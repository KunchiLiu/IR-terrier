	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the incidence of EA in pediatric patients undergoing minor ENT surgery under Sevoflurane and compare opioid-only based intra-operative analgesia to multi-modal analgesia consisting of opioid and IV acetaminophen or PO acetaminophen regimen using a validated and standardized EA measurement tool, the Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium (PAED) scale. [Appendix 1]. The post operative pain scores will be measured in all patients by post-op recovery staff using FLACC Score/Wong-Baker FACES (patients 24 months up to 7 years of age) or Numeric Pain Score for patients 7 years of age. The pre-operative, surgery, anesthesia and post-operative staff will be all blinded.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Emergence Agitation in Pediatric Patients Following Sevoflurane Anesthesia With and Without IV Acetaminophen for Analgesia for Minor Ear-nose-throat (ENT) Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypothesis: Using the Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium (PAED) scale, the incidence of Emergence Agitation associated with the use of intra-operative multi-modal analgesia is lower than opioid-only based intra-operative analgesia in children undergoing minor ENT surgery. The findings of this study assessing common neurobehavioral and neurocognitive disturbances after anesthesia and surgery can serve as an investigative platform for future studies involving other types of surgery, and adult patients and be examined when compared to other multimodal analgesic regimens. This novel approach using recently-approved non-opioid analgesics can serve an as example in how future multi-modal therapies can be instituted. Place of Study: Nemours Children's Hospital, Orlando, Florida (Primary Site) Study Design: 1. Prospective Randomized Study 2. Study Period: April 2017 - August 2017 3. Study Population: 30 pediatric patients in each group between 12 months and 7 years of age undergoing minor ENT procedures (tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy, tonsillectomy, adenoidectomy) 4. Total Number of Patients: 90 Methods and Materials: With IRB Committee approval and written consent from all parents or guardians and assent in children age 7, 90 patients between the ages of 24 months - 7 years, scheduled for tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy, will be randomly divided into three groups of 25 patients. Each group will receive sevoflurane induction and maintenance of anesthesia. Sevoflurane, currently the most commonly used agent for inhalational induction, will be used for induction of anesthesia, as it is less irritating to the tracheobronchial tree than other volatile anesthetic agents and is considered the standard for pediatric induction anesthesia. Children with severe sleep apnea defined as Apnea-Hypoxia Index greater than 10, developmental delay or psychological disorders, will be excluded. Also, patients and/or families that show inability to understand research consent due to English proficiency will be excluded. None of the patients will receive premedication for sedation. Any patient that requires premedication will be excluded from this study. In the pre-operative area, all patients will receive a de-identified PO syrup. The syrup will be prepared by the pharmacy and will contain acetaminophen (15 mg/kg) for the PO acetaminophen group and placebo flavored syrup for the other two groups. This approach will maintain blindness of the peri-operative staff, and patients/parents. Patients unable to take PO (acetaminophen or placebo) will be excluded from the study. Induction of anesthesia will be accomplished via inhalation of sevoflurane (8 vol%) in nitrous oxide (70%) and oxygen (30%) at a fresh gas flow of 10 Lpm. An IV will be established and propofol 2mg/Kg will be administered to facilitate endotracheal intubation. After intubation, all children will receive fentanyl 2 mcg/Kg IV. Intra-op anesthesia team will be blinded to the use of non-opioid IV analgesia and will administer a pharmacy prepared de-identified infusion following intubation that will consist of saline placebo for control groups and IV acetaminophen (15 mg/kg) for the IV acetaminophen group. For maintenance of anesthesia, children will receive sevoflurane (maximum of 2.0±0.2 MAC, age adjusted) with a constant fresh gas flow of 2 L/min (maximum FIO2 of 40% air mixed with oxygen), using a semi-closed circle breathing system. Ventilation will be controlled to maintain normocapnia (ET-CO2 32-38 mmHg). Additional doses of fentanyl can be administered, per anesthesiologist's discretion, in all groups by increments of 0.5 mcg/Kg IV per dose for hemodynamic response to surgical stimulation greater than 20% above baseline. Removal of the mouth gag for tonsillectomy/tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy/adenoidectomy will be defined as the end of surgery. At this point, inhalation anesthetic will be discontinued. Fresh gas flow will be increased to 8 Lpm, 100% oxygen. Tracheal extubation will be performed when normal ventilation is achieved and cough or gag reflex is regained. Children with a history of severe sleep apnea as described, developmental delay or psychological disorders will be excluded. All patients will not receive any premedication for sedation. Any patients that require premedication will be excluded from this study. Intraoperative/Post-Operative Standardization: The surgical technique will be standardized and a limited group of surgeons limited to two surgeon per clinical site will be recruited for the study. No peri-tonsilar local anesthetic injection will be used. The number of anesthesia providers involved in the study will also be limited to minimize variability and to execute a standardized intra-operative management. The post-operative pain management approach will be restricted to fentanyl (0.5 mcg/Kg IV/dose titrated to effect) for moderate to severe pain. Ibuprofen (10mg/Kg) PO will be ordered for mild to moderate post-op pain. Post-op recovery staff will be limited to a maximum of three trained recovery room nurses per study site and will use FLACC/Wong-Baker FACES (patients 24 months up to 7 years of age) or Numeric Pain Score for patients 7 years of age. to assess level of pain Episodes of clinical emergence delirium will receive rescue treatment. This treatment will consist of 0.5 - 1.0 mcg/Kg IV dexmedetomidine. Measurements: Age, gender, height, weight, procedure, duration of surgery, agents used, duration of anesthetic exposure and time from discontinuation of anesthetic to extubation will be documented for each patient. A blinded PACU nurse will record degree of agitation using the PAED scale on admission to the PACU every 15 minutes for approximately 1 hour after admission, or until discharge from the PACU, whichever comes first. Modified Aldrete scores (respiration, O2 saturation, consciousness, circulation, activity) and adverse events (nausea, vomiting, shivering, breath-holding, excessive secretions, laryngospasm, excessive bleeding) will also be recorded. Children will be considered discharge ready with an Aldrete score ≥9, and this will also be recorded. Statistical Analysis: All statistical analysis will be performed in SPSS v23 (IBM Corp.). Data will be assessed for normal distribution via Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. For continuous variables, normally distributed data will be analyzed using t-test and ANOVA. Non-normal distributions will analyzed with non-parametric methods (Mann-Whitney U). For discrete/categorical variables, Chi-squared and gamma testing will be performed as appropriate. Time-dependent data will be analyzed via ANOVA with repeated measures or Wilcoxon-Ranked Sum testing as appropriate based normal distribution testing. All testing will be performed with α=0.05 to determine statistical significance. APPENDIX 1: Pediatric Anesthesia Delirium (PAED) Scale SCORE CRITERIA: 1.
