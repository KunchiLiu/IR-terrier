	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study to determine the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab or placebo given with best supportive care (BSC) in Asian participants with previously systemically treated advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The primary hypothesis of this study is that overall survival is prolonged in participants who receive pembrolizumab compared to those who receive placebo.</brief_summary>
