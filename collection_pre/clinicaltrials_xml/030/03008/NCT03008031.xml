	<brief_summary>The optimal dose of iodine based contrast agents used in contrast-enhanced spectral mammography (CESM) is unknown. If CESM, performed with lower dose of iodine based contrast agent, visualizes a tumor comparable to CESM with regular dose of contrast agent, patients can receive less contrast agent for CESM in future and thereby risking less side effects of the contrast agent. In order to study whether CESM remains unchanged at smaller amounts of contrast administration, a second CESM exam will be performed within one week of the first with a an alternative amount of contrast, it being either 80%, 60% or 40% of the original contrast dose. The settings of the CESM unit will remain unchanged.</brief_summary>
