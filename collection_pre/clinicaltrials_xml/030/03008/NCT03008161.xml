	<brief_title>Multiple Dose Safety Study of NPT088 in Patients With Mild to Moderate Probable Alzheimer's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a multicenter Phase 1, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple-dose, dose-escalation safety and tolerability study of NPT088 or placebo in patients with Probable AD with a MMSE score of 18-27. Enrolled patients will receive an intravenous infusion of NPT088 or placebo once a month for six months during this study. Four dose cohorts are planned with the first two cohorts enrolling 9 patients each (6 NPT088: 3 placebo) and the final two cohorts enrolling 24 patients each (16 NPT088: 8 placebo) for a total of 66 patients (44 NPT088: 22 placebo).</detailed_description>
