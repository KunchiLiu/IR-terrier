We will assess their medical knowledge, and the amount of anesthesia delivered to patients after the curriculum is implemented. 3. The investigators will analyze any changes in clinical practice of residents in the care of elderly patients. Enrollment will be voluntary for all residents. Also, the investigators will not interfere with clinical management of any patients by residents which are done under direct supervision of faculty.</brief_summary>
