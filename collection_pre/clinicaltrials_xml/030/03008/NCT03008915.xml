	<brief_title>Targeting Pulmonary Perfusion in Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Emphysema is a common type of lung disease in patients with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD). Emphysema refers to destruction of the fine network of air spaces and blood vessels in the lung, and results in what looks like "holes" in the lung. Emphysema is associated with an increased risk of death but currently no medications, except for replacement of alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT), have been shown to treat emphysema. The study plans to enroll subjects with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency-associated lung disease (PiZZ phenotype) on augmentation therapy to perform a cross-over randomized controlled trial (RCT) of aspirin compared to placebo and perform a withdrawal study of augmentation therapy, to test the hypotheses that aspirin is effective in improving blood flow in the lungs and reducing damage to the endothelial cells. The study has 2 phases: a randomized cross-over phase and a withdrawal phase. Subjects will be randomized to receive aspirin or placebo for 2 weeks. There will be a 2-week washout period, then the participant will be crossed over to receive the other treatment (those who received aspirin first will receive the placebo and those who received the placebo first will receive aspirin). Then for the withdrawal of AAT augmentation therapy, subjects will be asked to stop AAT augmentation therapy for 5 weeks. This will allow AAT levels to drop briefly to those seen in the absence of AAT augmentation.</detailed_description>
