	<brief_summary>This study is a prospective,multi-center, open-label, randomized controlled clinical trial,aims to assess the clinical noninferiority of 3 months (short-term) vs 12 months (long-term) of Dual Anti-Platelet Therapy (DAPT) in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention implanted sirolimus target- eluting stent with abluminal grooves containing a biodegradable polymer (Firehawk™ stent). All participants met the inclusion criteria begin taking aspirin and open-label thienopyridine therapy before index procedure, and will be 1:1 randomized to 3 months or 12 month of DAPT at index procedure.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study will recruit 2,446 subjects with stable coronary artery disease in no more than 40 research centers in China. All participants met the inclusion criteria will be 1:1 randomized to 3 months or 12 month of DAPT after implanting Firehawk™ coronary stent.Clinical follow-up will be carried out at 30 days, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, 2 years and 3 years after index procedure.The primary study endpoint is Net Adverse Clinical and Cerebral Events (NACCE), a composite of all-cause death, myocardial infarction (MI), cerebral vascular accident (CVA) and major bleeding (academic research consortium [ARC] definition and GUSTO definition) at 18 months. Subjects that complete of 18 months follow-up will be regarded as having completed the primary endpoint. The secondary study endpoints contain ARC defined stent thrombosis (ST) at all study time-points; NACCE at 30 days,6,12,24 and 36 months of follow-up;major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE),major adverse cardiovascular and cerebral events (MACCE),target lesion revascularization (TLR),target lesion failure(TLF),ST at 30 days,6,12 ,18,24 and 36 months of follow-up; major bleeding at 1, 3, 6, 12 ,18,24 and 36 months of follow up; as well as cost-effective at 18 months of follow-up.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>General Age ≥ 18 years; Subjects (or legal guardians) understand the testing requirements and procedures, and provide written informed consent; Subjects could undergo percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI); Subjects have symptomatic coronary artery disease or have confirmed asymptomatic ischemia; Subjects are eligible candidates for coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG); Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) within 60 days ≥ 30%; Subjects were willing to accept the trial plan calls for all subsequent evaluations. Angiographic Target lesions must be new and have a visually estimated reference diameter ≥2.25 mm and ≤4.0 mm in autologous coronary artery; No limitations in target lesion length and number; The first target lesion must be able to successfully expand and implant Firehawk™ stent. Clinical Subjects recently suffer from MI (within 1 week), and ECG changes/clinical symptoms consistent with AMI or accompanied with increased cardiac biomarkers (CKMB, CK, TNT or TNI) are excluded: Subjects had an organ transplant or are waiting for an organ transplant; Subjects are receiving chemotherapy or will receive a chemotherapy within 30 days after PCI; Subjects are undergoing chronic (over 72 hours) anticoagulant therapy (such as heparin and coumarin) other than acute coronary syndrome; Subjects with abnormal counts of platelet and white blood cell (WBC): platelet counts less than 100×10E9/L or greater than 700×10E9/L, white blood cells less than 3×10E9/L; Subjects have confirmed or suspected liver disease, including hepatitis lab results; Subjects with elevated serum creatinine level &gt;3.0mg/dL or undergoing dialysis therapy; Subjects with active peptic ulcer, active gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding or other bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy, or refused a blood transfusion; Subjects with cerebral vascular accident (CVA) or transient ischemic attack (TIA) in the past 6 months, or with permanent nerve defects; Subjects had any PCI (such as balloon angioplasty, stent, cutting balloon, atherectomy) treatment in target vessels (including collateral) within 12 months prior to baseline; Subjects plan to undergo PCI or CABG within 18 months after the baseline PCI; Subjects have any coronary endovascular brachytherapy treatment previously; Subjects associated with drugs allergy (such as sirolimus, or structurerelated compounds fluorinated polymers, thiophenepyridine or aspirin); Subjects are suffering from other serious illness (such as cancer, congestive heart failure), which may cause drop in life expectancy to less than 18 months; Subjects are currently abusing drugs (such as alcohol, cocaine, heroin, etc); Subject plan to undergo any operations that may lead to confuse with the programme; Subjects were participating in another study of drug or medical device which did not meet its primary endpoint; Subjects plan to pregnant within 18 months after baseline; Subjects are pregnant or breastfeeding women. Angiographic Target lesions with the following criteria: left main, saphenous vein grafts or arterial grafts, via saphenous vein grafts or arterial graft, and instent sestenosis; Subjects with unprotected left main coronary artery disease (diameter stenosis &gt;50%); Subjects have a protected left main coronary artery disease (diameter stenosis&gt; 50% and left coronary artery bypass surgery), as well as target lesions located in the LAD and LCX; Subjects with other lesions of clinical significance, may be need intervention within 18 months after baseline.</criteria>
