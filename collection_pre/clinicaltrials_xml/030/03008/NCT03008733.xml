	<brief_summary>The use of nerve ultrasound for the diagnosis and monitoring of neuromuscular diseases is a promising growing field (1).

	<detailed_description>The use of nerve ultrasound for the diagnosis and monitoring of neuromuscular diseases is a promising growing field (1).

The main objective of this pilot study is to provide a descriptive analysis of the morphology of the nerves with an ultra high frequency ultrasound in subgroups of CIDP patients, anti-MAG antibodies and neuropathy NMMBC and controls. The thickness of the epineurium, the hallmarks of fascicular organization, Doppler vascularity, the nerve-sectional area, the specification of the section surface, nerve hypertrophy, the thickness of the perineurium and ultrastructural characterization of the different fascicular organization typologies will be well analyzed in order to better understand the specific sonographic characteristics of each disease compared with controls, no data exist at present in the literature with such image resolution. Secondary objectives: 1. Compare the morphological characteristics obtained by ultra high frequency ultrasound between different subjects subgroups according to the morphological data collected and sonographic scores: evaluation of nerve hypertrophy (intra- and inter-ratio nerve nerve) (4 ) and intra-fascicular nerve and nerve cross-ratio. 2. To study the correlation between sonographic and clinical scores scores in different subjects subgroups using functional assessment scales: MRC score, R-ODS score, INCAT, ONLS, ataxia Score and a torque rating of grip strength. 3. To study the correlation between sonographic scores and electrophysiological scores by making a électroneurogramme (ENG) in the different subjects of subgroups: the amplitude and distal motor latency for distal motor conduction, the motor conduction velocities, the presence of time dispersion or of a conduction block to the stepped motor conduction, the latency of the waveform F to the proximal motor conduction and the amplitude of the sensory potential for sensory conduction.</detailed_description>
