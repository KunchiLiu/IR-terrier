	<brief_summary>Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, abbreviated as NASH, is a chronic liver disease that may progress to cirrhosis. The disease is mostly associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus, or insulin resistance and is very common. However, Treatment of NASH is a significant unmet clinical need. IVA337 is a next generation pan-PPAR (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors) agonist addressing the pathophysiology of NASH : metabolic, inflammatory and fibrotic. The purpose of this research is to evaluate the efficacy and the safety of two doses of IVA337 (800mg, 1200 mg) per day for 24 weeks versus placebo in adult NASH patients with liver steatosis and moderate to severe necroinflammation without cirrhosis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 2b Study in NASH to Assess IVA337</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Randomized (stratified on diabetes), placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-assignment, dose-range multicenter study There are 3 parallel treatment groups: placebo, IVA337 800mg once a day (Quaque Die, QD) and IVA337 1200mg QD (identical capsules of 400mg IVA337 or placebo). Both, patient and investigator are blinded. For each patient, the study duration will be an overall of 6 to 8 months (with a 10-day to 4-week selection period, a 24-week treatment period and a 4-week follow-up period).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Adult subjects, age ≥18 years. NASH histological diagnosis according to the currently accepted definition of both EASL and AASLD, requiring the combined presence of steatosis (any degree ≥ 5%) + lobular inflammation of any degree + liver cell ballooning of any amount, on a liver biopsy performed ≤ 6 months before screening in the study and confirmed by central reading during the screening period and SAF Activity score of 3 or 4 (&gt;2) SAF Steatosis score ≥ 1 SAF Fibrosis score &lt; 4 Subject agrees to have a liver biopsy performed after 24 weeks of treatment. Compensated liver disease No other causes of chronic liver disease (autoimmune, primary biliary cholangitis, Hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), Wilson's, α1antitrypsin deficiency, hemochromatosis, etc…). If applicable, have a stable type 2 diabetes, defined as HbA1c &lt; 8.5% and fasting glycemia &lt;10 mmol/L, no changes in medication in the previous 6 months, and no new symptoms associated with decompensated diabetes in the previous 3 months. Have a stable weight since the liver biopsy was performed defined by no more than a 5 % loss of initial body weight. Negative pregnancy test or postmenopausal. Women with childbearing potential (i.e. fertile, following menarche and until becoming postmenopausal unless permanently sterile) must be using a highly effective method of contraception (i.e. combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal/ progestogenonly hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation, intrauterine device, intrauterine hormonereleasing system, bilateral tubal occlusion, vasectomised partner, sexual abstinence) Subjects must be willing to give written informed consent. Evidence of another form of liver disease. History of sustained excess alcohol ingestion: daily alcohol consumption &gt; 30 g/day (3 drinks per day) for males and &gt; 20 g/day (2 drinks per day) for females. Unstable metabolic condition: Weight change &gt; 5kg in the last three months, diabetes with poor glycemic control (HbA1c &gt; 8.5%), introduction of an antidiabetic or of an antiobesity drug/malabsorptive or restrictive bariatric (weight loss) surgery in the past 6 months prior to screening. History of gastrointestinal malabsorptive bariatric surgery within less than 5 years or ingestion of drugs known to produce hepatic steatosis including corticosteroids, highdose estrogens, methotrexate, tetracycline or amiodarone in the previous 6 months. Significant systemic or major illnesses other than liver disease, including congestive heart failure (class C and D of the American Heart Association , AHA), unstable coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, pulmonary disease, renal failure, organ transplantation, serious psychiatric disease, malignancy that, in the opinion of the investigator, would preclude treatment with IVA337 and/or adequate follow up. HB antigen &gt;0, HCV Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests &gt;0 (patients with a history of HCV infection can be included if HCV PCR is negative since more than 3 years), HIV infection. Pregnancy/lactation or inability to adhere to adequate contraception in women of childbearing potential. Active malignancy except cutaneous basocellular carcinoma. Any other condition which, in the opinion of the investigator would impede competence or compliance or possibly hinder completion of the study. Body mass index (BMI) &gt;45 kg/m2. Type 1 diabetes. Diabetic ketoacidosis Fasting Triglycerides &gt; 300 mg/dL. Hemostasis disorders or current treatment with anticoagulants. Contraindication to liver biopsy. History of, or, current cardiac dysrhythmias and/or a history of cardiovascular disease event, including myocardial infarction, except patients with only well controlled hypertension. Participation in any other clinical study within the previous 3 months. Have a known hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients or excipients of the Investigational medicinal product (IMP) Be possibly dependent on the Investigator or the sponsor (e.g., including, but not limited to, affiliated employee).</criteria>
