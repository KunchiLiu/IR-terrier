	<brief_summary>This long-term goal of this project was to advance best practices in occupational therapy in conjunction with yoga. To address the long-term goal, this research team developed a pilot yoga intervention. The intervention was designed to focus on balance, balance confidence, body responsiveness, pain, physical ability and quality of life. Assessments were then chosen to address these areas pre and post yoga intervention. A manual and protocol were developed for the intervention and then the intervention was implemented with a group of individuals with chronic traumatic brain injury.</brief_summary>
