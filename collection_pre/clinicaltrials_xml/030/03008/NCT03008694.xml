	<brief_summary>This study evaluates the effect of FDG-PET/CT for Simulation and Radiation Treatment Planning in oral Cancer patients. Progress-free survival (PFS) will be compared with historical control as defined in the protocol</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of FDG-PET/CT for Simulation and Radiation Treatment Planning in Oral Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Radiotherapy improves local control and overall survival for oral cavity cancer patients after surgery. However, limited locoregional control remains a key issue in the management of oral cavity carcinomas. Appropriate target selection is a key issue in the radiotherapy of oral cavity cancer. The purpose of this study is to determine the locoregional control in PET/CT based radiotherapy treatment planning in the treatment of oral cancer</detailed_description>
