	<brief_title>Phase II Ribociclib, Everolimus and Letrozole in Endometrial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration: Each study cycle is 28 days. You will take everolimus, letrozole and ribociclib by mouth and should be swallowed whole without opening, chewing, or crushing 1 time every day at the same time. You will take the dose in the morning with a full cup of water (about 8 ounces). You should fast (not eat or drink anything except water) for up to 2 hours before and after each dose of study drugs. When you come to clinic for a visit, you should wait to take your drugs until the study team tells you to take them. Length of Treatment: You may continue taking the study drugs for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best interest. You will no longer be able to take the study drugs if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions. Your participation on the study will be over after follow-up. Study Visits: On Day 1 of Each Cycle: - You will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 2 tablespoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests. - If the doctor thinks it is needed, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn to check for hepatitis. If you have had the hepatitis screening test during screening, it will not be repeated. - On Day 1 of Cycles 2 and beyond, you will have an EKG. - On Day 1 of Cycle 3 and every 3 cycles after that (Cycles 6, 9, 12, and so on), part of the routine blood draw will be used to check the level of fat in your blood. On Day 15 of Cycle 1: - You will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 3 ½ tablespoons) will be drawn for routine and pharmacodynamic PD testing. - You will have three EKGs 5 minutes apart before the dose and then 2-4 hours after. On Day 15 of Cycle 2, you will have an EKG before and then 2-4 hours after the dose. At the end of Cycles 2, 4, 6 and every 3 cycles after that (Cycles 9, 12, 15, and so on) (+/- 7 days): - You will have an MRI and/or CT scan. If you have signs of disease in the chest chest disease, you will have a CT scan of the chest. - If the disease could be felt in the pelvis at the beginning of the study, you will have a pelvic exam. End-of-Treatment Visit: Within 4 weeks after the last dose of study drugs: - You will have a physical exam. Blood (about 2 tablespoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests. - You will have an MRI and/or CT scan. If you have signs of disease in the chest, you will have a CT scan of the chest. Follow-Up: At 30 days after your last dose of study drugs and then every 3 months (+/- 1 month) after that, a member of the study staff will contact you by phone or at a regularly scheduled clinic visit to ask how you are doing and about any side effects you may have had. These calls or visits should last about 5-10 minutes each time. This is an investigational study. Everolimus is FDA approved and commercially available to treat kidney, breast, and pancreatic cancers. Letrozole is FDA approved and commercially available to treat breast cancer and ovarian cancer. Ribociclib is not FDA approved or commercially available. It is currently being used for research purposes only. The combination of everolimus, letrozole, and ribociclib to treat endometrial cancer is investigational. Up to 76 patients will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Patient has signed the Informed Consent (ICF) prior to any screening procedures being performed and is able to comply with protocol requirements. 2. Patients must have histologicallyconfirmed endometrial carcinoma (endometrioid and mixed endometrioid tumors, any grade). 3. Patients must have advanced or recurrent disease that is refractory to curative treatment based on imaging or clinical exam. 4. Patient must consent to allow for a baseline tumor biopsy. Tumor material from biopsies done before the screening period are acceptable if the biopsy was performed within 3 months prior to the planned treatment start and no other systemic cancer therapy was administered in the interim. If a biopsy is performed and the specimen is considered nondiagnostic or dose not have enough tissue, this does not prevent the patient from proceeding with the treatment. 5. Patients must have had no more than two prior chemotherapeutic regimens for recurrent endometrial carcinoma. Chemotherapy administered in conjunction with primary radiation as a radiosensitizer is not counted as a prior treatment for recurrent or advanced disease. 6. Prior radiation therapy of any kind is allowed. 7. Prior treatment with letrozole is allowed. 8. All patients must have measurable disease per RECIST version 1.1 defined as at least one "target lesion" that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (&gt;/= 10 mm longest dimension to be recorded; Lymph nodes must be &gt;/= 15 mm per short axis). Each lesion must be &gt; 20 mm when measured by palpation or conventional imaging techniques (CT or MRI based on primary physician preference) or &gt;10 mm with spiral CT scan. Measurable lesions must be at least 2 times the slice thickness in millimeters. Tumors within a previously irradiated field will be designated as "nontarget" lesions unless progression is documented. Ascites and pleural effusions are not considered measurable disease. If the measurable disease is confined to a solitary lesion, its neoplastic nature should be confirmed by cytology/histology. 9. Patients must not be pregnant, breastfeeding or of childbearing potential. Patients are considered not of childbearing potential if they are surgically sterile (they have undergone a total hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral oophorectomy) or they are postmenopausal for greater than 12 months (If patient is uncertain of amenorrhea for 12 months, a pregnancy test will be done to confirm pregnancy status). Patients in whom ovaries are present and were not previously menopausal at the time of hysterectomy, should have a serum estradiol &lt;10 pm/mL to confirm ovarian senescence 10. Patients must be off all other antitumor therapies (including immunologic or hormonal agents) for at least four weeks prior to study registration. 11. Age &gt;/= 18 years 12.

Fasting serum cholesterol &lt;/=240 mg/dL OR&lt;/=7.75 mmol/L AND fasting triglycerides &lt;/= 2.5 x ULN.
