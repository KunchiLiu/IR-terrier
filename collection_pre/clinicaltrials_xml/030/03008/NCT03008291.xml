	<brief_summary>Participants in this study will either have heart failure (HF) and are scheduled to undergo cardiac resynchronization therapy pacemaker (CRT-P) or cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator (CRT-D) implantation, or have atrioventricular (AV) block and are scheduled to undergo dual chamber pacemaker implantation. In this study additional heart rhythm measurements will be collected during the implant procedure to better understand how His bundle and/or parahisian pacing (HISP) effects electrical conduction in the hearts of patients with HF or AV block. The hypothesis is that His bundle or parahisian pacing (HISP) may normalize atrioventricular (AV) conduction with a narrow combination of the Q wave, R wave and S wave (QRS complex) in functional bundle branch block or conduction delay in patients with heart failure (HF).</brief_summary>
