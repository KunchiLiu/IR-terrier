	<brief_summary>We hypothesize that supplementation with L-carnitine that is available both as an FDA-approved therapy for primary carnitine deficiency, as well as widely available as an over-the-counter ergogenic aid will improve wellbeing and function measured by questionnaires in patient with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). We further hypothesize based on our review of literature that addition of health coaching (HC) to L-carnitine will yield greater gains.</brief_summary>
