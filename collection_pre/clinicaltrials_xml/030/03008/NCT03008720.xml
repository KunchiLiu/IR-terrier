	<brief_summary>Introduction: It is suggested that increased cortical activity, induced by cerebral stimulation associated or not with other rehabilitation techniques, may potentiate the motor and functional therapeutic effects in individuals with neurological deficits. Objectives: To evaluate the electrical activity of the anterior tibial muscle (TA) and postural control of individuals with hemiparesis due to stroke following treatment with transcranial direct current (tDCS) stimulation and functional electrical stimulation (FES), associated or isolated). (EMG) and postural control by the Balance Evaluation Systems Test (BESTest). Both of which were collected at four different time points: pre-treatment, immediately after 10 treatment sessions, and 30 days follow-up after the interventions. Patients will be randomized into 4 experimental groups: tDCS anodic active + active FES+ active contraction TA, tDCS sham + active FES+ active contraction TA, tDCS anodic active+ placebo FES+ active contraction TA, tDCS sham+ FES sham+ active contraction TA. tDCS (2mA) will be applied over the motor (Cz) and cathodic vertex over the supraorbital region of the normal hemisphere and FES over hemiparetic TA by a researcher who will not be the one who will evaluate the anesthesia patient. The treatment will last 10 sessions, twice a week, with a time of 20 minutes.</brief_summary>
