	<brief_summary>The Study for Employment Retention of Veterans (SERVe) is a randomized controlled trial, available exclusively to Oregon employers of veterans. It is designed to develop and scientifically evaluate Veteran-supportive supervisor training (VSST) that may enhance retention of veterans, with the goal of improving workplace culture and general well-being to our service members. The intervention, applied to workplace supervisors, will be measured by experience of veterans, assessing workplace experiences, health, well-being, as well as employees' spouse/partners' family experiences, health and well-being, and workplace outcomes.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The overall goal of the Study for Employment Retention of Veterans (SERVe) study is to improve health and well-being of current and former service members employed in participating Oregon organizations. The SERVe Study seeks to do this by training supervisors to support veteran employees by focusing on a reduction in work-life stress while increasing supportive supervisor behavior. The SERVe Study proposes that supervisor supportiveness can influence workplace experience, health, and well-being of service members, as well as of their families. The investigators of the SERVe Study expect positive results for study participants, including reduced stress and increased social support, reduction in negative workplace experiences, and improvement in family well-being outcomes. Longer term, these effects are expected to create a more supportive work environment, which has positive effects on safety, health, well-being, family, and organizational outcomes. Veteran participants are measured at baseline, three months, and nine months. Veteran spouses are invited to participate as well. Married and cohabitating veterans and their partners are invited to participate in the Daily Family Study (DFS), a 32-day daily diary survey after baseline and at six months.</detailed_description>
