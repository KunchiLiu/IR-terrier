	<brief_title>Intravitreal Aflibercept Injection for Radiation Retinopathy Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 30 eyes will be randomized (1:1 ratio) into either Group 1 or Group 2. Slit lamp exam and Indirect ophthalmoscopy will be performed at every study visit, where retinopathy level will be assessed, See Appendix II for grading scale. SD-OCT will be performed at each visit. Fluorescein angiogram will be performed at screen, week 26 and week 52. All other imaging studies will be standard of care at the discretion of the investigator. This trial will compare the results of 2 groups, with different treatment intervals, to assess the safety of intravitreal Aflibercept injections (IAI) for the treatment of radiation retinopathy. Patients in each group will be followed for a total of 52 weeks. Group 1: 15 Patients will receive a loading dose of 3 IAI. They will receive 2 mg IAI at screening/baseline, week 4, week 8, and week 12. A follow-up visit will occur at week 12. If the extension criteria are met, the patient will be extended by 2 weeks. The patient will continue to be followed per the treat and extend protocol described below. Group 2: Patients will not receive a loading dose. They will receive 2 mg IAI at screening/baseline followed by a visit at week 4. At week 4, if the extension criteria are met, the patient will be extended by 2 weeks. The patient will continue to be followed per the treat and extend protocol described below. Treat &amp; Extend Protocol Patients can be extended as long as they meet the following criteria - - Absence of retinal fluid (resolution of intraretinal and subretinal fluid on SD-OCT; Small intraretinal cysts that do not distort foveal contour on SD-OCT are acceptable and can be considered "dry".) AND - Less than 5 ETDRS letter loss from previous visit due to new or persistent retinal edema. IAI will be rendered at every visit (treatment at the week 26 mandatory visit will be administered based on the treat and extend status), no earlier than 4 days before the target date and no later than 4 days after the target date. Each extension will be 2 weeks in duration beyond the initial 4-week interval. If the extension criteria are not met on a follow-up visit, the treatment interval will be reduced by 2 weeks. Follow up interval will continue to be reduced by 2 weeks until the extension criteria are met or a 4-week interval is reached. All patients will have a mandatory study visit at Week 52 (final study visit). No study treatment will be administered after week 50 or at a study termination visit. If a patient receives treatment after week 48, they will return 4 weeks after the last clinic visit for the final study visit (instead of at week 52).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Age &gt; 18 years of age 2. Clinically identifiable radiation retinopathy with evidence of fluid on SDOCT causing vision loss in the study eye 3. Undergone either ocular or orbital radiation for any primary ocular or orbital cancer within clinical evidence of having radiation retinopathy 4. Willing and able to comply with clinic visits and studyrelated procedures 5. Provide signed informed consent A patient who meets any of the following criteria will be excluded from the study: 1. Metastatic cancer or any active primary cancer, at time of enrollment 2. Prior treatment with anti VEGF in the study within 60 days of screen in the study eye 3. Prior intravitreal or subconjunctival treatment with cortical steroids within 90 days of screen in the study eye 4. Macular ischemia (defined as greater than 5 disc areas), as assessed by the investigator 5. Media opacity obscuring a view of the fundus or any other reason for vision loss other than radiation retinopathy. 6. Evidence of infectious ocular infection, in the study eye, at time of screening 7. Pregnant or breastfeeding women 8. Sexually active men* or women of childbearing potential** who are unwilling to practice adequate contraception start of the first treatment, during the study, and for at least 3 months after the last dose. Adequate contraceptive measures include stable use of oral contraceptives or other prescription pharmaceutical contraceptives for 2 or more menstrual cycles prior to screening; intrauterine device; bilateral tubal ligation; vasectomy; condom plus contraceptive sponge, foam, or jelly, or diaphragm plus contraceptive sponge, foam, or jelly. Contraception is not required for men with documented vasectomy. **Postmenopausal women must be amenorrheic for at least 12 months in order not to be considered of childbearing potential. Pregnancy testing and contraception are not required for women with documented hysterectomy or tubal ligation.</criteria>
