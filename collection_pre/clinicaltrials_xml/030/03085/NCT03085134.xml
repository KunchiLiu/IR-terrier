	<brief_summary>The primary objective of the study is to show that infants with cow milk protein allergy (CMPA) fed with a new FSMP infant formula with reduced level of protein &amp; with 2 Human Milk Oligosaccharides (HMOs) (test formula) have a growth in line with infants fed with a comparable FSMP formula but without HMOs (control formula). The secondary objectives are to assess whether consumption of Test formula by CMPA infants (i) reduces medication use and risk for infections in particular lower respiratory tract infections/morbidity, (ii) is well tolerated and allows for age appropriate growth and (iii) reduces health care costs.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Safety &amp; Efficacy of a New Infant Formula With Specific Medical Purpose Containing Human Milk Oligosaccharides</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Infants with physician diagnosed CMPA, aged between birth and 6 months of age will take either the control or new test infant formula for 4 months and if judged suitable by physician, up to maximum of 12 months of age. Growth, adverse events, medication use and tolerance to formula will be assessed. As part of exploratory objectives, the study will also explore possible mode of action of the Test formula in CMPA infants, by assessing whether consumption of Test formula by CMPA infants affects stool microbiota and metabolic signatures as well as urine metabolic signatures and whether such changes can be associated to the intestinal inflammatory/health status, and the clinical measures.</detailed_description>
