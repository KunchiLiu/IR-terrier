	<brief_summary>The purpose of this phase I study is to test the safety of different dose levels of specially prepared cells collected from the patient called "modified T cells". The investigators want to find a safe dose of modified T cells for patients with this type of cancer that has progressed after standard therapy. The investigators also want to find out what effects these modified T cells have on the patient and the cancer.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients must have CD19+ CLL either with relapsed or refractory disease, defined as: Refractory to or relapsed after at least 2 prior chemo or chemoimmunotherapy (e.g. FCR, BR) requiring further treatment Refactory to or relapsed after at least 1 prior biologic agent (e.g. Ibrutinib, idelaslisib, venetoclax, except a single agent antiCD20 monoclonal antibody) requiring further treatment Age ≥ 18 years of age Creatinine ≤2.0 mg/100 ml, direct bilirubin ≤2.0 mg/100 ml, AST and ALT ≤3.0x upper limit of normal (ULN) Adequate pulmonary function as assessed by ≥92% oxygen saturation on room air by pulse oximetry Karnofsky performance status &lt;70 Pregnant or lactating women. Women and men of childbearing age should use effective contraception while on this study and continue for 1 year after all treatment is finished Impaired cardiac function (LVEF &lt;40%) as assessed by ECHO or MUGA scan Patients with active known autoimmune disease are ineligible Patients with following cardiac conditions will be excluded: New York Heart Association (NYHA) stage III or IV congestive heart failure Patients with uncontrolled systemic fungal, bacterial, viral or other infection are ineligible Patients with any concurrent active malignancies as defined by malignancies requiring any therapy other than expectant observation or hormonal therapy, with the exception of squamous and basal cell carcinoma of skin Patients with history or presence of clinically significant neurological disorders such as epilepsy, generalized seizure disorder, severe brain injuries are ineligible Any other issue which, in the opinion of the treating physician, would make the patient ineligible for the study</criteria>
