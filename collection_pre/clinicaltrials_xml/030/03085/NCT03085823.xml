	<criteria>age at least 18 patients with symptomatic coronary artery disease (including chronic stable angina, silent ischemia, acute coronary syndromes) with clinical indication to percutaneous coronary intervention. patients with one or more of the following criteria: known (and untreatable) hypersensitivity or contraindication to Aspirin, Heparin, Clopidogrel, Prasugrel, Ticagrelor, Sirolimus, or a sensitivity to contrast media which cannot be adequately premedicated. patients enrolled in another trial. Target lesion/vessel with any of the following characteristics: successful predilatation not performed in the target lesion, or not efficacious (residual stenosis &gt;50%); severe calcification of the target vessel, also proximal to the lesion; highly tortuous lesions which can impair access of device to treatment site. visible thrombus at lesion which is not treatable with aspiration.</criteria>
