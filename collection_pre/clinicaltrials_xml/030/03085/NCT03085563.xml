	<brief_summary>The objective of this project is to compare the sedative effects of intranasal midazolam versus inhaled nitrous oxide (N2O) for minor procedures in the pediatric emergency department. The primary outcome will be length of stay (LOS) in the emergency department (ED) stay for minor procedures. Secondarily the investigators will compare patient/family and provider satisfaction while using either intranasal midazolam or N2O for minimal sedation. The investigators hypothesize that the total length of stay for children undergoing minor procedures in the ED will be lower for N2O, as compared to intranasal midazolam. The investigators also hypothesize that patient/family and provider satisfaction will be higher with N2O and adverse effects will not differ between N2O and intranasal midazolam. Patients will receive either intranasal midazolam or N2O for minor procedures. Following the enrollment period, data will be analyzed and the two will be compared. Total length of stay, patient/family and provider satisfaction will be studied.</brief_summary>
