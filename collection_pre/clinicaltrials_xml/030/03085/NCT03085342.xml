	<brief_summary>As cirrhosis progresses, alteration of hemodynamics develops and decreased portal flow is often observed. Since direct measurement of portal pressure (HVPG) is invasive, non-invasive methods have drawn a lot of attention. MRI is one of the non-invasive methods and it is able to provide multiparametric data in one examination. Herein, we evaluate hepatic fibrosis with different stage using multiparametric MRI with emphasis on portal flow measurement.</brief_summary>
