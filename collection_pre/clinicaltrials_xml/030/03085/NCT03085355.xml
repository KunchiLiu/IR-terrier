	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to determine whether osteopathic manipulative treatment associated exercises and pain neurocience education improves pain and function in individuals with chronic non-specific neck pain Design: a randomized single blind controlled pragmatic trial will be conducted trial. Patients (n=40) with non-specific neck pain will be randomized to receive 1) osteopathic manipulative treatment and exercise and and pain neurocience education (n=20) or 2) exercise alone and pain neurocience education (n=20). Participants will receive 8 treatments during 4 weeks. Clinical outcomes will be obtained at 1 week, four weeks and 24 weeks after end of treatment. Methods: The primary outcome will be pain measured by 11-point numerical pain rating scale. The secondary outcome will be disability measured by the Neck Disability Index, range of motion measured by Cervical Range of Motion device, Pressure pain threshold measured by electronic algometer, global perceived effect, Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire and pain catastrophizing scale</detailed_description>
