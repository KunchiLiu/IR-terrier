	<brief_title>The STRIVE Study: Breast Cancer Screening Cohort</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Detection of early stage cancer may be possible through analysis of circulating cell-free nucleic acids (cfNAs) shed into the blood by tumors. GRAIL is using high-intensity sequencing (based on broad genomic coverage and deep sequencing) of cfNAs, combined with machine learning, to develop blood tests to detect cancer early. The purpose of this prospective, multi-center, observational cohort study is to train and validate an assay for the early detection of breast cancer. The study will collect blood samples from participants within 28 days of their screening mammogram. For participants who receive a cancer diagnosis during the study, tissue samples will be collected.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Patient has an appointment for screening mammography, as referred or recommended by a health care provider. 2. Screening mammogram is received at same facility within 28 days of blood draw (i.e. blood may be drawn up to 28 days before or 28 days after the screening mammogram). 3. Provides informed consent in English or Spanish. Understands the protocol and its requirements, risks, and discomforts. 4. Provides consent to participate in longterm followup, such as contact via study portal, mail, or phone, for further selfreported information regarding cancer diagnoses, change to health plan or residential status, or request for additional blood draws and linkage to state state cancer registries and administrative databases. 1. Inability on the part of the patient to understand the informed consent or be compliant with the protocol. 2. Breast biopsy to evaluate abnormal breast imaging results has occurred prior to a planned research blood draw.</criteria>
