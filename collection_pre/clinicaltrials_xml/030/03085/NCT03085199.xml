	<brief_summary>Until now, no prospective clinical trial for duodenal stump leakage after laparoscopic or open gastrectomy for gastric cancer patients has been conducted. We already introduced a technique of laparoscopic reinforcement suture (LARS) on staple-line of duodenal stump using barbed suture for prevention of duodenal stump leakage. Therefore, a prospective phase II study was designed for safety of this technique.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Laparoscopic Reinforcement Suture (LARS) of Duodenal Stump A Prospective Single Arm Phase II Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>As the results of recent prospective randomized controlled clinical trials, laparoscopic gastrectomy has been accepted by one of standard treatments for early gastric cancer in Korea, Japan and China. However, duodenal stump leakage remains one of the fetal complications after gastrectomy until now. The incidence of duodenal stump leakage is reportedly between 1.6% to 5% in Billroth II or Roux en Y reconstruction after gastrectomy for gastric cancer. According to a recent multicenter study, the laparoscopic approach increased the risk of duodenal stump leakage development comparing to open approach. Until now, no prospective clinical trial for duodenal stump leakage after laparoscopic or open gastrectomy for gastric cancer patients has been conducted. I already introduced a technique of laparoscopic reinforcement suture (LARS) on staple-line of duodenal stump using barbed suture for prevention of duodenal stump leakage. Therefore, a prospective phase II study was designed for safety of this technique.</detailed_description>
