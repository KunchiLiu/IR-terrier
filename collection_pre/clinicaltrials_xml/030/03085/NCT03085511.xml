	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if, in presence of a reduced calorie diet, a breakfast containing high quality protein source (eggs) would be more effective in reducing hunger and increasing feeling of fullness compared to a breakfast containing a lower quality of protein, but equal energy density. A previous pilot study with the same endpoints yielded borderline significant results; this study has been powered based on that pilot to interrogate our hypotheses.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This will be a crossover study with 2 experiments. Subjects will follow a reduced energy weight loss diet of 1,200-1,500 kcal adjusted to each individual's body weight for totally 2 weeks in each experiment. They will come to the clinic from day 1 to day 5 and consume egg breakfast (EB) under our supervision. Then on weekends they will continue this breakfast at home based on our advice. The next week they will have cereal breakfast (CB) and the process is similar to that in the first week. The 1st experiment will test the satiety from egg breakfast (EB) and following energy intake in both lunch and dinner, compared with CB (cereal breakfast). Lunch and dinner will be offered on 2 test days during each week. Anthropometric and body composition measurements, blood pressure, blood draw, satiety questionnaire, as well as energy intake will also be collected in the 2 test days and compared between 2 breakfast groups. The 2nd one is to test whether EB will help in resisting the intake of foods considered tempting, but detrimental to weight loss efforts, compared with CB. The process is similar to experiment 1 except no blood draw, no dinner offered. Instead, a tempting food after lunch will be offered.</detailed_description>
