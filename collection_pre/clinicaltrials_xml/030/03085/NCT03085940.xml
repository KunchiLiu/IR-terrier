	<brief_summary>Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) increase cardiovascular risk and endothelial dysfunction. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is expected to improve endothelial dysfunction through some metabolic effects. The investigators intend to find the role of HCQ to improve endothelial dysfunction in RA patients. This study will also evaluate correlation HOMA-IR (homeostasis model assessment-estimated insulin resistance), FFA (free fatty acid) and ox-LDL (oxidized-LDL) level change, with endothelial dysfunction improvement.</brief_summary>
