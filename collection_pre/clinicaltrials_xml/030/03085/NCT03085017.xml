	<brief_title>Effectiveness of BoneSeal® on Bone Hemostats in Patients Undergoing Cardiothoracic Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A prospective randomized open-label study that will evaluate the effectiveness of the pliable and absorbable bone hemostats (BoneSeal®) composed of synthetic materials and hydroxyapatite on the reduction of bleeding from the sternal bone marrow in patients undergoing Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting, with or without valve replacement or repair. This product will be compared to the similar, currently used product, Ostene®. Bleeding will be evaluated qualitatively by the surgeon as well as quantitatively by comparing pre- and post-operative hemoglobin levels, intra-operative and post-operative blood product usage, and post-operative chest tube output. A 30 day follow-up will be conducted to evaluate the patient's tolerance of the product, possible complications, or infection. Additionally, surgeons will be asked to comment on the ease of use of the product.</detailed_description>
