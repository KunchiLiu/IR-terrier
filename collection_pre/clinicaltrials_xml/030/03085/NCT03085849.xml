	<brief_summary>Primary Objectives Dose escalation phase: • To estimate the maximum tolerated dose of SGI-110 when given prior to durvalumab and tremelimumab, as determined by the rate of DLT Dose expansion phase: • To estimate the rate of treatment related adverse events for combination therapy with SGI-110 (at the MTD), durvalumab, and tremelimumab in order to guide phase 2 trial design Secondary Objectives Both phases: - To measure changes in expression levels of predicted neoantigens before and after epigenetic therapy with SGI-110 by performing WES and RT-PCR on tumor biopsies - To estimate overall response rate (ORR), median duration of response (mDOR), median progression-free survival (mPFS), and median overall survival (mOS) with this treatment</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>SGI-110 Plus Durvalumab/Tremelimumab in SCLC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>SCLC accounts for approximately 15% of new cases of lung cancer, and an estimated 33,000 cases are expected to be diagnosed in the United States in 2016.1 Compared to NSCLC, SCLC typically has a more rapid doubling time, a higher growth fraction, and earlier development of distant metastases. Patients with limited stage (LS) disease are treated with curative intent using definitive, concurrent chemotherapy and thoracic radiotherapy. For patients with extensive stage (ES) disease, systemic chemotherapy can prolong survival in most cases, however long-term survival is rare 2,3. Despite the activity of several agents in SCLC, an etoposide plus platinum (i.e. cisplatin) doublet regimen remains the standard of care in the first-line setting because of its higher activity compared to other chemotherapy regimens, as well as the ease of combining it with radiation. Initial response rates may be as high as 70-90% in LS-SCLC and 50-70% in ES-SCLC.4 However, the disease typically recurs rapidly which is reflected by median survival rates of 9 to 11 months for ES-SCLC and a 2-year survival rate of less than 5%. This study has a 3 + 3 design that will be used to assess the safety of SGI-110 given prior to flat doses of durvalumab (1500 mg) and tremelimumab (75 mg). The starting dose of SGI-110 will be 30 mg/m2 (dose level 0) and the target dose that is predicted to be safe and most effective will be 45 mg/m2 (dose level 1). These doses have been chosen based on safety and efficacy data from phase 1 clinical trials in other solid tumors, as described above. Patients enrolled in any given dose level will be evaluated for safety (adverse events monitoring) and efficacy. There will be mandatory pre- and on-treatment tumor biopsies performed in alternating fashion on cycle 1 day 8 +/- 2 days or cycle 2 day 8 +/- 2 days. The DLT observation period will last for 4 weeks (28 days) and ends on C2D1. Delayed serious immune-mediated adverse events will also be monitored but will not be considered dose limiting toxicities.</detailed_description>

Females of childbearing potential who are sexually active with a nonsterilized male partner must use a highly effective method of contraception from the time of screening, and must agree to continue using such precautions for 180 days after the final dose of investigational product. Cessation of contraception after this point should be discussed with a responsible physician. Periodic abstinence, the rhythm method, and the withdrawal method are not acceptable methods of contraception. Female subjects must also refrain from egg cell donation for 180 days after the final dose of investigational product. A) Females of childbearing potential are defined as those who are not surgically sterile (i.e. bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, or complete hysterectomy) or those who are not postmenopausal (defined as 12 months with no menses with postmenopausal gonadotropin levels [luteinizing hormone and folliclestimulating hormone], or estradiol levels within the postmenopausal range according to local guidelines without an alternative medical cause). B) A highly effective method of contraception is defined as one that results in a low failure rate (i.e. less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly. 7. Subject is willing and able to comply with the protocol for the duration of the study including undergoing treatment and scheduled visits and examinations including follow up. 8. Subjects must have a histologically confirmed diagnosis of small cell lung carcinoma. A fresh, pretreatment tumor biopsy will be required to evaluate tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, PDL1 IHC staining, methylation status, etc. as outlined in the study timeline. All subjects are also required to have a C1D8 (or C2D8) biopsy. 9. Subjects must have extensivestage disease (by NCCN criteria) that is progressive or relapsed after platinumbased chemotherapy. 10.
