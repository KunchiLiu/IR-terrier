	<brief_summary>This study includes patients affected by advanced and resectable rectal adenocarcinoma. It provides an induction chemotherapy with FOLFOXIRI regimen plus Bevacizumab followed by Chemoradiotherapy plus Bevacizumab. Surgery with total mesorectal incision must be performed within 7-9 weeks after this last treatment. The protocol will be evaluate the disease free survival at two years. Translational analyses will be performed to show the presence of VEGF polymorphism, CD133 surface markers on colorectal CSCs.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Histologically proven diagnosis of rectal adenocarcinoma. Diagnosis obtained by a biopsy technique which leaves the major portion of the tumor intact. Locally advanced, resectable disease defined by the presence of at least one of the following features: tumour extending to within 1 mm of or beyond the mesorectal fascia (ie, circumferential radial margin threatened or involved); lower third (≤ 6 cm from the anal verge) cT3 tumours; tumour extending 5 mm or more into perirectal fat; T4 tumour (ie, invading surrounding structures or peritoneum); clinical stage III disease (T14, N12), with the definition of a clinically positive lymph node being any node ≥ 1.0 cm; Distal border of the tumor must be located &lt; 12 cm from the anal verge. No evidence of metastatic disease by CT scan of the chest and abdomen and total body PETCT scan. Tumor must be amenable to curative resection (curative resection can include pelvic exenteration). No history of invasive rectal malignancy, regardless of diseasefree interval. No other rectal cancers (i.e., sarcoma, lymphoma, carcinoid, squamous cell carcinoma, or cloacogenic carcinoma) or synchronous colon cancer. No clear indication of involvement of the pelvic side walls by imaging. Age between 18 and 75 years. ECOG Performance status &lt; 2 if age &lt; 70 years and = 0 if age 7175 years. Life expectancy of at least 5 years (excluding diagnosis of cancer). Hematopoietic: absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,000/mm3; platelet count ≥ 100,000/mm3; haemoglobin level ≥ 10 g/dL. Hepatic: total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN); alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2 times ULN; AST ≤ 2 times ULN. [Note: *If AST&gt;ULN, serologic testing for Hepatitis B and C must be negative]. Renal: creatinine clearance &gt; 50 mL/min; no renal disease that would preclude study treatment or followup. Written informed consent to experimental treatment and pharmacogenomic analyses. Previous treatment with oxaliplatin, irinotecan or bevacizumab. Previous 5fluorouracil or capecitabine treatment is allowed. Previous pelvic radiation therapy. Hepatic disease that would preclude study treatment or followup; uncontrolled coagulopathy; history of viral hepatitis or other chronic liver disease. Cardiovascular disease that would preclude study treatment or followup; New York Heart Association class III or IV heart disease; active ischemic heart disease; myocardial infarction within the past 6 months; symptomatic arrhythmia; uncontrolled hypertension. Lack of upper gastrointestinal tract integrity or malabsorption syndrome; active inflammatory bowel disease (i.e., patients requiring current medical interventions or who are symptomatic). Pregnant or lactating women. Fertile patients must use effective contraception (i.e doublebarrier contraceptive measures, oral contraception or avoidance of intercourse during the study and for 30 days after surgery). Patients with prior malignancies (with the exception of rectal cancer), including invasive colon cancer, are eligible provided they have been diseasefree for ≥ 5 years and are deemed by their physician to be at low risk for recurrence. Other malignancy within the past 5 years with the exception of effectively treated squamous cell or basal cell skin cancer, melanoma in situ, carcinoma in situ of the cervix, or carcinoma in situ of the colon or rectum. Known hypersensitivity to fluorouracil, oxaliplatin or irinotecan or to Chinese hamster ovary cell proteins. Clinically significant peripheral neuropathy (i.e., neurosensory or neuromotor toxicity ≥ grade 2). Psychiatric or addictive disorders, or other conditions that, in the opinion of the investigator, would preclude study participation</criteria>
