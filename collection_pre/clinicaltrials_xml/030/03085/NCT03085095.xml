	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Relugolix in Men With Advanced Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is an international phase 3 randomized, open-label, parallel group efficacy and safety study to evaluate oral daily relugolix 120 mg in patients with androgen-sensitive advanced prostate cancer who require at least 1 year (48 weeks) of continuous androgen deprivation therapy. Relugolix 120 mg orally once daily or leuprolide acetate depot suspension, 22.5 mg (or 11.25 mg in some Asian countries), every 3-months (3-M) by subcutaneous or intramuscular injection will be administered to patients with prostate cancer who require androgen deprivation therapy. Approximately 1125 patients will be enrolled in this study. The study includes a Screening Period, a Treatment Period of 48 weeks, and a Follow-up Period. Additionally, unscheduled follow-up visit(s) may be arranged for patients with study-related safety concerns as needed. Eligible patients include those with evidence of biochemical relapse (rising PSA) following local primary intervention with curative intent, newly diagnosed metastatic disease (excluding metastases to the brain), and/or advanced localized disease. Following successful completion of the Screening period study participants will be randomized 2:1 to oral relugolix 120 mg once daily or leuprolide acetate 22.5 mg (or 11.25 mg in some Asian countries) 3-M depot subcutaneous or intramuscular injection and will attend visits monthly (ie, every 4 weeks) where serum testosterone and PSA will be assessed. Safety will be assessed throughout the study by monitoring adverse events, vital signs, physical examinations, clinical laboratory tests, and 12-lead electrocardiograms.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Has histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the prostate; 2. Is a candidate for, in the opinion of the investigator, at least 1 year of continuous androgen deprivation therapy for the management of androgensensitive advanced prostate cancer with one of the following clinical disease state presentations: 1. Evidence of biochemical (PSA) or clinical relapse following local primary intervention with curative intent, such as surgery, radiation therapy, cryotherapy, or highfrequency ultrasound and not a candidate for salvage treatment by surgery (radiotherapy, cryotherapy, or high frequency ultrasound are allowed after 2 months of androgen deprivation therapy); or 2. Newly diagnosed androgensensitive metastatic disease; or 3. Advanced localized disease not suitable for local primary surgical intervention with curative intent (radiotherapy, cryotherapy, or high frequency ultrasound are allowed after 2 months of androgen deprivation therapy); 3. Has a serum testosterone at the Screening visit of ≥ 150 ng/dL (5.2 nmol/L); 4. Has a serum PSA concentration at the Screening visit of &gt; 2.0 ng/mL (2.0 μg/L), or, when applicable, post radical prostatectomy of &gt; 0.2 ng/mL (0.2 μg/L) or post radiotherapy, cryotherapy, or high frequency ultrasound &gt; 2.0 ng/mL (2.0 μg/L) above the post interventional nadir; 5. Has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1 at initial screening and at baseline. 1. In the investigator's opinion, is likely to require chemotherapy or surgical therapy for symptomatic disease management within 2 months of initiating androgen deprivation therapy; 2. Previously received GnRH analog or other form of androgen deprivation therapy (estrogen or antiandrogen) for &gt; 12 months total duration. If androgen deprivation therapy was received for ≤ 12 months total duration, then that therapy must have been completed at least 12 months prior to baseline; 3. Previous treatment for prostate cancer with a taxanebased regimen; 4. Metastases to brain per prior clinical evaluation; 5. Features of the patient's medical condition that make life expectancy due to other medical conditions of less than 5 years; 6. Scheduled for major surgery after baseline; 7. History of surgical castration.</criteria>
