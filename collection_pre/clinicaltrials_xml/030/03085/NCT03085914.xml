	<brief_summary>This is an open-label, nonrandomized, Phase 1/2 study in subjects with advanced or metastatic solid tumors. Phase 1 is a dose-escalation assessment to evaluate the safety and tolerability of epacadostat when given in combination with a PD-1 inhibitor and chemotherapy. Once the recommended doses have been determined, subjects with advanced or metastatic CRC, PDAC, NSCLC (squamous or nonsquamous), or any advanced or metastatic solid tumor who progressed on previous therapy with a PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor will be enrolled in Phase 2.</brief_summary>
