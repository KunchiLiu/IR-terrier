	<brief_summary>Closure of the left atrial appendage in patients with atrial fibrillation and risk for stroke is a increasing technology leading to exclusion of the left atrial appendage volume from the blood circulation and therefore protects from cardioembolic strokes- It is unclear if the volume reduction of the left atrium leads to a change in exercise capacity or Quality of life.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Impact of Left Atrial Appendage Closure on Physical Capacity.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The monocentric trial deals with the endocrinological changes as a result of closure of the left atrial appendage with a internal closure device. Specially, the changes in atrial natriuretic peptide, brain natriuretic peptide and their impact on exercise capacity is on focus of the trial. The trial is planned as a all comers trial.</detailed_description>
