	<brief_summary>The goal of this clinical research study is to compare 2 different types of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Researchers will compare diffusion-weighted imaging (a method to show how water moves in a certain area) with standard-of-care imaging to learn which method is better to check the status of prostate cancer.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>If participant agrees, participant will have a whole body MRI along with participant's standard-of-care MRI of the pelvis. Adding the whole-body MRI imaging to participant's pelvic MRI will add about 20-30 minutes to the current standard-of-care MRI procedure. The total amount of time for the MRIs will be 60-70 minutes. Participant will also have participant's standard-of-care bone scan and a computed tomography (CT) scan of participant's abdomen and pelvis. Researchers will compare the results of these procedures to participant's whole-body MRI. Length of Study Participation: All of the scans described above will be scheduled and completed within 90 days of signing this consent or before beginning any treatment. They will be repeated at 6 months. If participant cannot complete the scans within 90 days or before beginning treatment, participant will not be able to continue to take part in the study. Participant's active study participation will be over when the bone scan, CT scan, and whole body MRI scans are complete at initial visit and follow up visit after 6 months. This is an investigational study. The whole-body MRI scan in this study is performed using an FDA-approved and commercially available method. Having whole- body MRI with participant's standard-of-care MRI of the pelvis at the same time is investigational. Up to 86 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>
