	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is the evaluation of system accuracy based on EN ISO 15197:2015 (ISO 15197:2013), clause 6.3 in which accuracy requirements and applicable test procedures for blood glucose monitoring systems intended for self-monitoring of blood glucose by patients are stipulated. ISO 15197:20132 was harmonized with the regulations of the European Union as EN ISO 15197:2015. This harmonization had no impact on the requirements and procedu¬res in ISO 15197:2013; changes were made to the foreword and an informative annex. In this study, system accuracy evaluation will be performed for OneTouch® Verio Flex (LifeScan Europe) on behalf of LifeScan Scotland Limited (customer) with three different reagent system lots.</brief_summary>
