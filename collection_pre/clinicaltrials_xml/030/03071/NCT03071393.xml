	<brief_summary>This study will examine if acute intermittent hypoxia (brief episodes of breathing lower oxygen), which has been shown to enhance plasticity and motor output, can enhance functional outcomes and muscle activation in individuals with spinal cord injury. Our aim is to assess breathing, sitting, standing and walking functional ability before and after acute intermittent hypoxia, compared to a sham treatment. This information may be useful in advancing rehabilitation for people with spinal cord injuries.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intermittent Hypoxia to Enhance Motor Function After Spinal Cord Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recent evidence has shown that acute intermittent hypoxia can strengthen motor pathways after spinal cord injury, and enhance walking outcomes after walking rehabilitation compared to walking rehabilitation alone. A single session of acute intermittent hypoxia has also been shown to temporarily enhance breathing and limb strength in people with spinal cord injury. Further evidence supports the hypothesis that acute intermittent hypoxia acts on all motor pathways, and thus can enhance the strength of most muscles in the body. Spinal cord injury affects the trunk muscles that control respiration and posture. Decreased respiratory muscle function can lead to diseases of the respiratory system, which are the primary cause of death and significant cause of re-hospitalization after spinal cord injury. Deficits in postural muscle function affect one's ability to balance, safely maintain a seated position, or ambulate after spinal cord injury, severely impacting daily activities such as self-care and feeding skills. This study will test the hypothesis that a single session of acute intermittent hypoxia will increase strength and activation of the trunk muscles that control respiration and posture, leading to improved scores on functional assessments in individuals with chronic spinal cord injury. Our long term goal is to better understand the therapeutic potential of acute intermittent hypoxia combined with physical rehabilitation for individuals with chronic spinal cord injury.</detailed_description>
