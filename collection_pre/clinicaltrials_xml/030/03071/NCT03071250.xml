	<brief_summary>The care for patients receiving total hip and knee arthroplasty at UAMS has followed a structured care pathway since July 2015. This system of perioperative care has focused on preoperative assessment of medical co-morbidities and risks to postoperative functional recovery, anesthetic care focused on PONV prevention and optimizing immediate postoperative functional ability, and aggressive postoperative physical therapy. This is an observational study to look at the outcomes of this program at UAMS. Areas of focus will be hospital length of stay, postoperative narcotic consumption, VAS scores, incidence of PONV, and 30-day readmission rates, and health literacy rates.</brief_summary>
