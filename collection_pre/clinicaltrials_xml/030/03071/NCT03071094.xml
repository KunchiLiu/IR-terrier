	<criteria>Histological/cytological diagnosis of primary HCC, excluding cholangiocarcinoma, hepatocholangiocarcinoma, fibrolamellar carcinoma and hepatoblastoma Advanced stage HCC per EASLEORTC (European Association for the Study of the LiverEuropean Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer) guidelines, i.e. patients who are not candidates for curative interventions and not candidates for locoregional modalities Patients naïve to systemic therapy for HCC Tumor status (as determined by radiology evaluation): At least one measurable viable tumor in the liver, ≥1 cm longest diameter (LD), using a dynamic imaging technique (arterial phase of triphasic computerized tomography [CT] scan, or dynamic contrastenhanced magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]), and injectable under imagingguidance (CT or ultrasound) At least one tumor that has not received prior localregional treatment, or that has exhibited definitive growth of viable tumor since prior localregional treatment of HCC undertaken at least 4 weeks prior to enrolment or 3 months prior to enrolment for radioembolization ChildPugh Class A. Note: paracentesis, albumin infusion or diuretic treatment cannot be used to downgrade ChildPugh score (e.g., to improve from severe to moderate/mild or from moderate to mild ascites) Performance status 0 or 1 on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) scale Adequate hematological, hepatic, and renal function Additional inclusion criteria exist Histological diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma, hepatocholangiocarcinoma, fibrolamellar carcinoma and hepatoblastoma Symptomatic cardiovascular disease, including but not limited to significant coronary artery disease (e.g., requiring angioplasty or stenting) or congestive heart failure within the preceding 12 months Current or past history of cardiovascular disease (e.g., past history of myocardial infarction, ischemic cardiomyopathy) unless cardiology consultation and clearance has been obtained for study participation History of moderate or severe ascites, bleeding esophageal varices, hepatic encephalopathy or pleural effusions related to liver insufficiency within 6 months of screening; patients with adequately treated esophageal varices are allowed Active, known or suspected significant immunodeficiency due to underlying illness including HIV/AIDS, autoimmune diseases, and/or immunesuppressive medication including highdose corticosteroids History of severe eczema and/or ongoing severe inflammatory skin condition (as determined by the Investigator) requiring medical treatment Any known allergy or reaction to any component of nivolumab formulation or its excipients Additional exclusion criteria exist</criteria>
