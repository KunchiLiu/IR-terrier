	<brief_title>A Comparative Study of Subjects Past Their Final Follow-ON Visit</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A comparative study to follow subjects who received stem cell therapies three, five, seven, and nine years after their follow-on visit. Subjects will be selected from a pool of previous Interdisciplinary Stem Cell Institute trial participants. Subjects will be followed during the study depending on the initial visit for this trial. The time point at which they are followed will depend on the subject's injection date in the previous trial. Depending on the subjects first treatment date (Day of injection) in the previous Interdisciplinary Stem Cell Institute (ISCI) cardiovascular clinical trial, subjects may be eligible for one to four study visits in this trial. Those who do not have a three, five or seven-year visit may receive informed consent at the year nine visit. Thus, subjects can be enrolled and consented at any visit if the previous eligible visit was missed.</detailed_description>
