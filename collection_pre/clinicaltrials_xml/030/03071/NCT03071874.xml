	<brief_title>Phase II Study Of Vistusertib (AZD2014) For Recurrent Grade II-III Meningiomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works in treating a specific disease. "Investigational" means that the intervention is being studied. The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved AZD2014 as a treatment for any disease. The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if the study drug AZD2014 can shrink or slow the growth of meningioma. Based on laboratory research, the cellular pathways which are blocked by AZD2014 are important for the growth and survival of meningiomas. Further, treatment of meningioma cells in the laboratory has resulted in decreased survival of tumor cells. As such, the purpose of this research is to see whether treating recurrent grade 2-3 meningioma with AZD2014 will result in tumor size stabilization or shrinkage. The safety of AZD2014 will also be studied. The physical state, the symptoms, changes in the size of the tumor, and laboratory findings obtained while on-study will help the research team decide if AZD2014 is safe and effective in participants with this condition. AZD2014 is being studied in patients with various cancers as a single agent (a drug that is used alone to treat the cancer) or in combination with a number of well known anticancer therapies. Previous studies have also allowed investigators to determine the best dose and frequency of AZD2014 to achieve anti-tumor effects while reducing the likelihood of side effects.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants must have histologically confirmed intracranial meningioma, grade IIIII,that has recurred or progressed at previous treatment. Participants must be willing and able to undergo regular MRI scans of the brain. Participants must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension as ≥10 mm with MRI, performed within 30 days prior to study registration. Patients must have received prior surgical resection and radiation therapy for the progressive meningioma. Patients must have received less than three prior chemotherapy regimens for progressive meningioma. Patients must have available an archival paraffin tumor block sufficient to generate at least 20 unstained slides; or, if a paraffin tumor block is unavailable, at least 20 unstained slides. Age ≥ 18 years at the time of study enrollment. ECOG performance status ≤2 (Karnofsky ≥60%, see Appendix A) with no deterioration over the previous 2 weeks.

For this reason and because mTOR kinase inhibiting agents are known to be teratogenic, female patients must be willing to use 2 forms of highly effective contraception (per institution standards) from the time of screening until four weeks after discontinuing study, must not be breast feeding, and must have a negative pregnancy test prior to start of dosing if of child bearing potential or must have evidence of nonchildbearing potential by fulfilling one of the following criteria at screening: (1) postmenopausal women, defined as either women aged more than 50 years and amenorrheic for at least 12 months following cessation of all exogenous hormonal treatments, or (2) women under 50 years old who have been amenorrheic for at least 12 months following the cessation of exogenous hormonal treatments, and have serum folliclestimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) levels in the postmenopausal range for the institution. Alternatively, women must have documentation of irreversible surgical sterilization by hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy or bilateral salpingectomy but not tubal ligation. Male patients should either be surgically sterile or willing to use an effective barrier method of contraception during the study and for 16 weeks following the last dose of study treatment if sexually active with a female of childbearing potential. If not done previously, storage of sperm prior to receiving AZD2014 will be advised to male patients with a desire to have children. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document prior to any study specific procedures, sampling, and analyses. Ability to swallow and retain oral medication. Participants with a clinical diagnosis of NF2 (either by NIH or Manchester criteria) or with a molecular diagnosis of NF2 Participants who received biopsy only or have received more than 2 prior courses of radiation for meningioma Participants who have had chemotherapy, radiotherapy, biological therapy, immunotherapy or other anticancer agents within 14 days (six weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study.

Pretreatment with other mTOR inhibitors may be allowed and should be discussed with the medical monitor. Current refractory nausea and vomiting, malabsorption syndrome, disease significantly affecting gastrointestinal function, resection of the stomach or small bowel, symptomatic inflammatory bowel disease or ulcerative colitis, or partial or complete bowel obstruction.

Screening for chronic conditions is not required. History of other malignancies, except: Malignancy treated with curative intent and with no known active disease present for ≥5 years before the first dose of study drug and felt to be at low risk for recurrence by treating physician, (2) adequately treated nonmelanoma skin cancer or lentigo maligna without evidence of disease, (3) adequately treated carcinoma in situ without evidence of disease, or (4) Gleason 6 prostate cancer under observation. Patients who have experienced any of the following procedures or conditions currently or in the preceding 12 months: coronary artery bypass graft angioplasty vascular stent myocardial infarction angina pectoris congestive heart failure New York Heart Association Grade ≥2 (ventricular arrhythmias requiring continuous therapy) supraventricular arrhythmias including atrial fibrillation, which are uncontrolled hemorrhagic or thrombotic stroke, including transient ischemic attacks or any other central nervous system bleeding History of drug abuse or alcohol abuse, as judged by the Investigator Abnormal echocardiogram (ECHO) or multigated acquisition scan (MUGA) at baseline (left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF] &lt;55%). Appropriate correction to be used if a MUGA is performed. Preexisting renal disease including glomerulonephritis, nephritic syndrome, Fanconi Syndrome or renal tubular acidosis. Mean resting corrected QT interval (QTc), calculated using Fridericia's formula, &gt; 470 msec obtained from 3 electrocardiograms (ECGs), family or personal history of long or short QT syndrome, Brugada syndrome or known history of QTc prolongation or Torsade de Pointes within 12 months of the patient entering in the study. Patients with uncontrolled Type II (HbA1c &gt;8% assessed locally) as judged by the investigator or abnormal fasting glucose value defined as &gt;126 mg/dL (&gt;7 mmol/L). Concomitant medications known to prolong QT interval, or with factors that increase the risk of QTc prolongation or risk of arrhythmic events (such as heart failure, hypokalemia, congenital long QT syndrome, family history of long QT syndrome or unexplained sudden death under 40 yearsofage). See appendix B for a list of medications. Vaccinated with live, attenuated vaccines within four weeks of the first dose of study drug. Judgment by the Investigator that the patient is unsuitable to participate in the study and the patient is unlikely to comply with study procedures, restrictions and requirements. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because AZD2014 is an mTORC1/2 inhibiting agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with AZD2014, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with AZD2014. HIVpositive participants on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with AZD2014. In addition, these participants are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrowsuppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in participants receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated. Involvement in the planning and/or conduct of the study (applies to both AstraZeneca, CRO staff, and/or staff at the CPU).</criteria>
