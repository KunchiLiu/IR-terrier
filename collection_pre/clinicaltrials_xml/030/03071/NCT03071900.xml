	<brief_summary>Detection rate and isolation yield of CTC is low in squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck (SCCHN) with in vitro approaches rely on limited sample volumes. In this study, we applied a new method, the CellCollector, which could capture CTC in vivo from peripheral blood.</brief_summary>
