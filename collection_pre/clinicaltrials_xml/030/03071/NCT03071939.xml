	<brief_summary>Schizophrenia is a disease of young adults that affects 1% of the general population. According to numerous studies, it has been estimated that between 50% and 80% of patients with schizophrenia do not consider to have a mental disorder and are therefore not aware of their disorders. A poor degree of insight is associated with poor compliance, a higher number of re-hospitalizations, altered social and relational functioning, and a higher number of suicides and violent behaviors. This is why insight, which is an essential dimension of psychopathology, must be evaluated, as it depends to a large extent on the therapeutic alliance, adherence to treatment, likelihood of relapse and prognosis.</brief_summary>
