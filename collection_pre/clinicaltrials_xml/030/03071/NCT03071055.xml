	<brief_title>Efficacy of Biweekly Ranibizumab (0.5 mg) for Exudative Macular Degeneration Retinal Edema Refractory to Anti-VEGF</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a 24 week, open-label, non-randomized, phase II study evaluating intravitreal ranibizumab dosed every 14 days in subjects with exudative macular degeneration who have persistent intraretinal or subretinal fluid despite chronic monthly anti-VEGF therapy (&gt;6 months). Subjects must have had a minimum of 5 intravitreal anti-VEGF injections administered every 4-6 weeks in the 6 months preceding enrollment. Consented, enrolled subjects will receive multiple open-label intravitreal injections of 0.5 mg ranibizumab administered every 14 days (Â± 3 days). Subjects who have resolution of fluid will convert to monthly ranibizumab for the remainder of the study. If fluid recurs, subjects will return to biweekly treatment. Patients will be assigned to receive treatment with either ranibizumab vial or PFSs so that approximately 10 patients will be treated with each delivery method option, and syringe preparation time (SPT) will be measured by an assistant who will be observing the procedure and timing with an automated stopwatch.</detailed_description>
