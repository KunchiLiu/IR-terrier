	<brief_summary>The primary objective of the study is to determine whether pemafibrate administered twice daily will delay the time to first occurrence of any component of the clinical composite endpoint of: - nonfatal Myocardial Infarction (MI) - nonfatal ischemic stroke - hospitalization for unstable angina requiring unplanned coronary revascularization; or - Cardio Vascular (CV) death.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Fasting TG ≥ 200 mg/dL (2.26 mmol/L) and &lt; 500 mg/dL (5.65 mmol/L) at Visit 1 (Screening/Enrollment Visit) or Visit 1.1 (Retest) 2. HDLC ≤ 40 mg/dL (1.03 mmol/L) at Visit 1 (Screening/Enrollment Visit) or Visit 1.1 (Retest) 3. Type 2 diabetes of longer than 12 weeks duration documented in medical records, for example: local laboratory evidence through medical record review of elevated HbA1c (≥ 6.5% [48 mmol/mol]), elevated plasma glucose (fasting ≥ 126 mg/dL [7.0 mmol/L], 2hour ≥ 200 mg/dL [11.1 mmol/L] during oral glucose tolerance testing, or random value ≥ 200 mg/dL with classic symptoms, or currently taking medication for treatment of diabetes; AND either 1. Age ≥ 50 years if male or ≥ 55 years if female (primary prevention cohort); OR 2. Age ≥ 18 years and established systemic atherosclerosis (secondary prevention cohort), defined as any 1 of the following: i. Prior MI or ischemic (nonhemorrhagic) stroke ii. Coronary angiographic lesion of ≥ 60% stenosis in a major epicardial vessel or ≥ 50% left main stenosis iii. Asymptomatic carotid disease with ≥ 70% carotid artery stenosis iv. Symptomatic carotid disease with ≥ 50% carotid artery stenosis v. Symptomatic lower extremity PAD (ie, intermittent claudication, rest pain, lower extremity ischemic ulceration, or major amputation with either anklebrachial index ≤ 0.9 or other diagnostic testing [eg, toebrachial index, angiogram, or other imaging study]) vi. Prior arterial revascularization procedure (including coronary, carotid, or peripheral angioplasty/stenting, bypass, or atherectomy/endarterectomy) 1. Current or planned use of fibrates or agents with PPARα agonist activity (eg, saroglitazar) within 6 weeks (42 days) of Visit 1 (Screening/Enrollment Visit). Note: PPARγ agonists (eg, glizatones such as pioglitazone and rosiglitazone) are allowed 2. Known sensitivity to PPARα agonists or tablet excipients 3. Initiation of, or change in, current TGlowering therapy within 12 weeks of Visit 1 (if applicable). Note: TGlowering therapy is defined as niacin &gt; 100 mg/day or dietary supplements or prescription omega3 fatty acids &gt; 1 g/day 4. Type 1 diabetes mellitus</criteria>
