	<brief_summary>Approximately 50% of people living with HIV (and as many as 80% over the age of 50) have difficulties with cognitive functions such as memory and thinking that can have a profound negative impact on activities of daily living and quality of life. Problems with memory and thinking are also associated with forgetting to take anti-retroviral drugs and experiencing challenges to balance, walking and mental health (anxiety and depression). There is increasing evidence that, in the general population, exercise has positive effects on cognition, physical functioning and mental health. Despite the recognition of multiple therapeutic benefits of exercise, little attention has been paid to its possible effects on cognition in people living with HIV. The purpose of the proposed pilot study is to compare the effects of a 12-week, randomly assigned, community-based yoga-mindfulness intervention on cognition, balance, walking, mental health and quality of life in 30 people &gt;45 years of age living with HIV in the Halifax area. Yoga is of particular interest because it encompasses not only the physical but also spiritual, emotional, and mental dimensions of life. As such, it has tremendous potential to help stave off some of the devastating consequences of HIV infection.</brief_summary>
