	<brief_summary>Multiple studies have shown clinical simulation benefits over classical learning method. Research on simulation of airway management has focused on endotracheal intubation training, while research on ventilation via facemask is scant. The investigators compared both learning methods regarding the acquirement of basic skills for airway management by medical students. Students in the clinical simulation group received a 3-hour training on airway management on the first day of their 28-day anesthesia rotation, while classical learning did not. On the last day of rotation, participants were evaluated based on a validated instrument of scores. Primary outcome was airway management scores. Secondary outcomes were rate of success of intubation and incidence of complications.</brief_summary>
