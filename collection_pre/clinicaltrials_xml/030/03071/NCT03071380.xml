	<brief_summary>An open label randomized, single dose, two-way crossover bioequivalence study to determine the bioequivalence of Rivaroxaban from Repatoxaban 10 mg Tablets (Horus for Pharmaceutical Industries, Egypt) and Xarelto® 10 mg Tablets (Janssen Pharm., Licensed from: Bayer Healthcare, Germany)</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bioequivalence Study of Rivaroxaban From Repatoxaban 10 mg Tablets (Horus for Pharmaceutical Industries, Egypt) and Xarelto® 10 mg Tablets (Janssen Pharm., Licensed From: Bayer Healthcare, Germany)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Pharmacokinetic Parameters: Cmax, AUC0→t and AUC0→∞ Secondary Pharmacokinetic Parameters: Ke, tmax and t1/2e. ANOVA using 5% significance level for transformed (with the 90% confidence intervals) and untransformed data of Cmax, AUC0→t and AUC0→∞ and for untransformed data of Ke, tmax and t1/2e. The confidence intervals of logarithmically transformed Test/Reference ratios for Cmax, AUC0→t and AUC0→∞ to be within 80.00-125.00%. A comprehensive final report will be issued upon the completion of the study.</detailed_description>
