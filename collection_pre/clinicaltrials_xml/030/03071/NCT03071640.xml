	<brief_summary>This study is a first part of a larger project aiming at improving the following outcomes in older cancer patients receiving external beam radiation therapy (EBRT): quality of life, functioning and need for professional help (dependency). To achieve this, the investigators will develop and test a geriatric assessment (GA) with management (GAM) intervention targeting patients at risk of negative outcomes as defined. The problems and needs that older patients experience before, during and after EBRT are poorly described. Furthermore, although GA is the recommended approach to assess older cancer patients' vulnerability, very few studies have investigated its benefit and feasibility in a radiotherapy setting and there is no universal recipe for how an efficient GAM intervention should be applied in this setting. Before defining and testing an intervention, the investigators will therefore conduct an observational study addressing older patients &gt;= 65 years referred for either palliative or curative EBRT. The main objectives are to identify patients at risk for negative outcomes, and to test the feasibility of GA in the community service and at a radiotherapy department.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Improving Quality of Life and Function for Older Cancer Patients Receiving Radiotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>GA includes a systematic assessment of area where older people often have problems, i.e. assessment of comorbidity, medication, functional status and physical functioning, cognitive function, nutritional status, and depression. In this observational study, the assessment will be performed using well-established instruments and tests before start and after completion of radiotherapy. The patient will be followed-up by repeated assessments at week 2, 8 and 16 post treatment. Quality of life (QoL) questionnaires will be filled in by self-report at the same points in time. Follow-up data will also include information on the patients' use of health services (home-, nursing home and hospital care). Additionally available diagnostic CT scans will also be used for analyses of nutritional status and body composition. Eligible patients will be included at the Radiotherapy Unit, Innlandet Hospital Trust after having given written informed consent. A project nurse (cancer nurse) will perform the assessments at the Radiotherapy Unit, whereas follow-up assessments will be performed by community cancer nurses. All municipalities in the hospital catchment area are invited to participate in the study. The study will be conducted in co-operation with several national and international partners, including partners from the local municipalities</detailed_description>
