	<brief_title>The Origin of Infrapyloric Artery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Infrapyloric artery(IPA) is of great importance for gastric cancer patients. In early gastric cancer patients, the pylorus-preserving gastrectomy requires the preserving of IPA. In advanced gastric cancer patients, the subgroup of No. 6 lymph node might be associated with IPA. In JGCA gastric cancer classification guidelines, the No. 6 lymph nodes is defined as lympn nodes along the first branch and proximal part of the right gastroepiploic artery(RGEA) down to the confluence of the right gastroepiploic vein and the anterior superior pancreatoduodenal vein. However,if IPA origins from the gastroduodenal artery(GDA) or anterior superior pancreatoduodenal artery(ASPDA), the lymph nodes along the IPA can not be grouped into the No. 6 lymph nodes. Thus, a new definition of No. 6 lymph nodes is needed on the basis of the origin of IPA. Previous studies about IPA origin are few and the origin of IPA varies greatly among different studies.</detailed_description>
