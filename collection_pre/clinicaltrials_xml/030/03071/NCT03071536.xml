	<brief_summary>Furosemide is an old drug that has been used frequently in the postoperative period of kidney transplantation, aiming to achieve adequate urine output. There is no previous study that directly evaluate the urine response to standardized dose of furosemide in the postoperative period. The objective is to measure the urine output after standardized dose of furosemide is delivered, as a biomarker to predict the graft function in perioperative period.</brief_summary>
