	<brief_title>Comparing the Therapeutic Efficacy and Safety of DA-9701 With Domperidone in Patients With Parkinson's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To prevent nausea and vomiting induced by anti-parkinsonian drugs, prokinetic drugs are frequently prescribed in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Additionally, there has been some evidence that prokinetics might improve PD symptom fluctuations. From this background, the investigators will evaluate the therapeutic efficacy and safety of DA-9701 in PD patients. In this study, 40 patients will be enrolled and randomly allocated 1:1 to receive either domperidone or DA-9701. The gastric function of each study participant will be evaluated using the MRI technique before and after 4 weeks of the treatment. The study participants will also be subjected to complete the gastrointestinal symptom diary before and during the treatment period. In addition, plasma levodopa concentrations will be determined 30 minutes after dose administration before and after treatment.</detailed_description>
