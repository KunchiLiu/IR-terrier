	<brief_summary>Participant is being asked to take part in this study because they have glioblastoma or anaplastic astrocytoma (AA) that has relapsed (come back) after treatment and the study doctor thinks that it is in their best interest to receive chemotherapy for the disease. Additionally, the study doctor thinks it may be in participant's best interest to also have a surgical procedure called laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT). LITT is a minimally invasive (using small incisions) surgery method that uses lasers to destroy tumor cells. For the procedure, the study doctor uses the NeuroBlate system to perform LITT in combination with MRIs and software models to focus the lasers on affected brain cells. The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if the NeuroBlate system in combination with lomustine can help to control glioblastoma or anaplastic astrocytoma (AA) that has returned after treatment. The safety of the combination will also be studied.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Laser Interstitial Thermal Therapy (LITT) in Recurrent Glioblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drug/Procedure Administration: If participant is found to be eligible to take part in this study, they will be scheduled to have the LITT procedure. An MRI will be performed the day before the procedure to produce images of participant's brain to direct the study doctor to the areas that should be treated. The LITT procedure will then be performed the next day. Participant will sign a separate consent form for the LITT procedure that explains this procedure and its risks in more detail. Participant will then receive standard of care hospitalization after surgery. Participant will have an MRI within 48 hours after the procedure to check the status of the disease. Participant will have 14 - 35 days for recovery from the LITT procedure. Participant will not take lomustine during this period. After the recovery period, participant will take lomustine by mouth on Day 1 of every 42-day cycle. Participant should take lomustine by mouth on an empty stomach before bed (2 hours after or 1 hour before food). Length of Treatment: Participant will take lomustine for up to 6 cycles. Participant will no longer be able to take the study drug if the disease gets worse, if they have intolerable side effects, or if they are unable to follow study directions. Participation in the study will be over after follow-up. Study Visits: On the day of the LITT procedure: - Participant will have a physical exam, including a neurological exam. - Participant will have MRI scans to help the surgeon perform LITT. - Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for biomarker testing. Biomarkers are found in the blood and tissue and may be related to participant's reaction to the study drugs. - Tumor tissue will be collected to confirm the diagnosis and for biomarker testing during the LITT procedure. Within 2 days after the LITT procedure, participant will have an MRI. About 14 days after the LITT procedure: - Participant will have a physical exam, including a neurological exam. - Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests. If participant can become pregnant, this will also include a pregnancy test. - Participant will complete the questionnaire about your quality of life. - Participant will have an MRI. When participant begins receiving lomustine, they will have study visits in 42-day cycles. On Day 1 of each cycle: - Participant will have a physical exam, including a neurological exam. - Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine test. If participant can become pregnant, this will also include a pregnancy test. - Participant will complete the questionnaire about their quality of life. - You will have an MRI. On Days 15 and 29 of each cycle, blood ( about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests. At any time during the study, extra tests may be performed if the doctor thinks they are needed. The study doctor will tell participant more about any extra tests. End-of-Study Visit: About 6 weeks after stopping the study drug: - Participant will have a physical and neurological exam. - Participant will complete the questionnaire about their quality of life. - Participant will have an MRI scan. Follow-Up: Every 3 months after participant's last dose of the study drug, the study staff will call and ask how they are feeling. This call should take about 5-10 minutes. If participant stops the study drug for any reason other than the disease getting worse, they will visit the clinic every 3 months unless the disease gets worse. At these visits: - Participant will have a physical exam, including a neurological exam. - Participant will complete the questionnaire about their quality of life. - Participant will have an MRI. This is an investigational study. The NeuroBlate system is FDA approved and commercially available for different types of brain surgery. Lomustine is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of brain tumors. LITT using the NeuroBlate System in combination with lomustine for the treatment of glioblastoma is investigational. The study doctor can describe how the study drug and procedure are designed to work. Up to 37 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Patients must have histologicallyproven, recurrent supratentorial grade IV glioblastoma (or grade III IDHwildtype anaplastic astrocytoma), for which a complete surgical resection is unsafe due to location, shape, or size of the tumor. Diagnosis of recurrence will be established by biopsy and frozen section immediately prior to initiating LITT procedure. If findings on frozen section are not consistent with recurrence (glioblastoma or recurrent IDHwildtype anaplastic astrocytoma), decision to proceed with LITT procedure will be at the discretion of the neurosurgeon (only patients with histologicallyproven recurrent tumor will be evaluable for efficacy). 2. All patients must sign an informed consent indicating that they are aware of the investigational nature of this study. Patients must have signed an authorization for the release of their protected health information. Patients must be registered prior to treatment on study. 3. Patients must be &gt;/= 18 years old. 4. Patients must have a Karnofsky Performance Score (KPS) &gt;60. 5. Patients must have received standard of care therapy with chemoradiation with temozolomide followed by adjuvant chemotherapy with temozolomide. Patients may have received one additional chemotherapy regimen (other than lomustine) in addition to adjuvant temozolomide prior to study entry (patients at either first or second recurrence are eligible). 6. In the context of this clinical trial, a lesion suitable for LITT is single, enhancing, supratentorial, at least 2 cm from inner table of skull over the hemispheric convexity, and &gt;1 cm, but &lt; 4 cm in crosssectional dimension, including thalamic tumor (&lt;/= 3 cm). 7.
