	<brief_summary>Postoperative pain is an ideal model for study on acute pain changing into chronic pain. The functional imaging of magnetic resonance can reflect the extent and character of pain exactly and the structural imaging of it can be a sign of the change. By analyzing fMRI results of participants with acute pain and following them up for three months, the investigators expect to find objective indicators for acute pain changing into chronic pain and give preventive analgesia for people with high risk of chronic pain.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The day before surgery, evaluate and choose patients according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. Use the same anaesthesia and management and record information needed by the case report format. Patients are examined by fMRI on their brains during the first week after surgery. Follow up the patients after surgery for three months to find out whether they have chronic pain. The NRS, DN4, ID pain and QLQ-C30 are used for each patient.</detailed_description>
