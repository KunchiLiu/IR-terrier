	<brief_summary>This is a Phase II, open-label, single-arm, multicenter study of intravesical BCG plus ALT-803 in patients with BCG unresponsive high grade non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). All patients treated in the study will receive via a urinary catheter in the bladder, BCG plus ALT-803 weekly for 6 consecutive weeks (induction). Patients without disease progression at Months 3, 6, 9 and 12 are eligible for continued BCG+ALT-803 treatment (maintenance). The study duration is 24 months.</brief_summary>
