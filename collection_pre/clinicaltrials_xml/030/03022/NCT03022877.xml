	<brief_summary>In the proposed project the investigators want to assess whether the approach of the post-conditioning by Levosimendan in patients with acute STEMI is safe and reproducible, can be used with a positive influence on the outcomes with respect to myocardial damage, cardiac left ventricular remodeling, myocardial function, the occurrence of cardiac events and quality of life.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Acute and Chronic Protective Effects of Peri-interventional Administration of Levosimendan in ST Elevation Myocardial Infarctions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is a severe disease that triggers an adverse remodeling, and served in progressive heart failure with a case fatality rate of 50% in 5 years. The opening of the occluded vessel is the first and most important therapy, the reperfusion improved both the function as well as the long-term survival. At the same time, experimental and clinical studies show, however, that this reperfusion self-reinforced damage of the myocardium. An additional Intervention in this trigger phase could not only reduce the acute damage, but long-term protective effects. Both effects could be an approach for the Calcium-Sensitizer Levosimendan in the animal model. So far, no clear effect on the remodeling and survive was demonstrated after myocardial infarction in the clinic. This could be mainly due to the delayed application in relation to the reperfusion and on the selection of suitable methods for the presentation of the effects on myocardial structure and function. In the proposed project the investigators want to assess whether the approach of the post-conditioning by Levosimendan in patients with acute STEMI is safe and reproducible, can be used with a positive influence on the outcomes with respect to myocardial damage, cardiac left ventricular remodeling, myocardial function, the occurrence of cardiac events and quality of life.</detailed_description>
