	<brief_summary>The purpose of this pilot prospective randomized control trial is to compare the initiation of labor epidural analgesia by combined spinal epidural vs. epidural for the influence on risk for postpartum depression symptoms. Investigators will randomize women to the receipt of CSE or E during labor, after measuring baseline psychological, psychosocial, and psychophysical factors related to pain and depression. The immediate research goals are to understand whether the association between labor pain and PPD is modifiable through the use of tailored anesthetic techniques.</brief_summary>
