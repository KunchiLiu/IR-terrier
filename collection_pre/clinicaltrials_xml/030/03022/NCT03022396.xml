	<brief_title>T-cell And General Immune Response to Seasonal Influenza Vaccine (SLVP018) Year 2, 2010</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators plan to study the immune response to different influenza vaccines much more broadly and deeply across different age groups and with different vaccine modalities and to probe the influence of genetics on these responses using monozygotic and dizygotic twins. The investigators plan to compare various immunological responses, identify age-specific biomarkers or clusters of markers, quantify the frequency of influenza-specific T-cells pre- and post-vaccination, and determine the effective breadth of T-cell repertoire to an influenza vaccine within an individual as a function of age and to what degree this is genetically determined. Twin Groups A-E will receive a single administration of the 2010-2011 formulation of seasonal trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV). Group F, elderly participants, will be randomly assigned to receive a single dose of inactivated vaccine, either the usual dose or the high-dose TIV. Blood samples to conduct the assays described will be taken at pre-immunization, Days 7-10 and 28 post-immunization.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Otherwise healthy, ambulatory children or adults, ages 817 years (identical twin pairs), 1830 years (identical or fraternal twin pairs), 4059 years (identical or fraternal twin pairs) or 70100 years (identical twin pairs). 2. Willing to complete the informed consent process. 3. Availability for followup for the planned duration of the study at least 28 days after immunization. 4. Acceptable medical history and vital signs. 5. All female of childbearing potential, must use an acceptable method of contraception and not become pregnant for the duration of the study (approximately 1 month or to completion of Visit 3). (Acceptable contraception includes implants, injectables, combined oral contraceptives, effective intrauterine devices (IUDs), sexual abstinence, or a vasectomized partner). 1. Prior offstudy vaccination with trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) or live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) in Fall 2010 2. Allergy to egg or egg products, or to vaccine components, including thimerosal (if TIV multidose vials used) 3. Lifethreatening reactions to previous influenza vaccinations 4. Active systemic or serious concurrent illness, including febrile illness on the day of vaccination 5. History of immunodeficiency 6. Known or suspected impairment of immunologic function, including, but not limited to, clinically significant liver disease, diabetes mellitus treated with insulin, moderate to severe renal disease or any other chronic disorder which, in the opinion of the investigator, might jeopardize volunteer safety or compliance with the protocol. 7. Blood pressure &gt;150 systolic or &gt; 95 diastolic at Visit 1 8. Hospitalization in the past year for congestive heart failure or emphysema. 9. Chronic Hepatitis B or C 10. Recent or current use of immunosuppressive medication, including glucocorticoids (corticosteroid nasal sprays and inhaled steroids are permissible). Use of oral steroids (&lt;20mg prednisoneequivalent/day) may be acceptable after review by the investigator. 11. Malignancy, other than squamous cell or basal cell skin cancer (includes solid tumors such as breast cancer or prostate cancer with recurrence in the past year, and any hematologic cancer such as leukemia). 12. Autoimmune disease (including rheumatoid arthritis treated with immunosuppressive medication such as Plaquenil, methotrexate, prednisone, Enbrel) which, in the opinion of the investigator, might jeopardize volunteer safety or compliance with the protocol. 13. History of blood dyscrasias, renal disease, or hemoglobinopathies requiring regular medical follow up or hospitalization during the preceding year 14. Use of any anticoagulation medication such as Coumadin or Lovenox, or antiplatelet agents such as aspirin, Plavix, Aggrenox must be reviewed by investigator to determine if this would affect the volunteer's safety. 15. Receipt of blood or blood products within the past 6 months 16. Medical or psychiatric condition or occupational responsibilities that preclude subject compliance with the protocol 17. Inactivated vaccine 14 days prior to vaccination 18. Live, attenuated vaccine within 60 days of vaccination 19. History of GuillainBarre Syndrome 20. Pregnant or lactating woman 21. Use of investigational agents within 30 days prior to enrollment 22. Donation of the equivalent of a unit of blood within 6 weeks prior to enrollment 23. Any condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, might interfere with volunteer safety, study objectives or the ability of the participant to understand or comply with the study protocol.</criteria>
