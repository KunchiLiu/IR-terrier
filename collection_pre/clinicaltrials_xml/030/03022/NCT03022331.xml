	<brief_summary>The term 'aortitis' refers to inflammation of the aorta. Aortitis is known to occur in a variety of vasculitides and connective tissue diseases, such as giant cell arteritis (GCA), Takayasu arteritis (TAK), rheumatoid arthritis, and spondyloarthropathies, among others. This study will establish a longitudinal cohort for these diseases.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>VCRC Longitudinal Protocol for Aortitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will develop a longitudinal cohort of patients with different types of aortitis to systematically study the natural history, optimal treatments, and outcomes in this group of diseases. This will provide a resource for future studies and for identification of new biomarkers of aortitis for purposes of diagnosis, disease activity measurement, disease damage assessment, determination of disease states, and evaluation of treatment response.</detailed_description>
