	<criteria>For generalized pustular psoriasis Have a diagnosis of generalized pustular psoriasis for at least 60 days prior to informed consent based on the diagnostic criteria of the Japanese Dermatological Association (JDA). Subjects not fulfilling one of the diagnostic criteria i.e., "accompanying systemic symptoms including fever or malaise" at the time of screening can be entered. Subjects with an erythema area with pustules accounting for ≥ 10% of the body surface area (BSA), and with a severity assessment criteria score (JDA total score) specified by the JDA of less than 14. Must be candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy for generalized pustular psoriasis, as assessed by the investigator. For erythrodermic psoriasis Have a diagnosis of erythrodermic psoriasis prior to informed consent. Subjects with an inflammatory erythema area accounting for ≥ 80% of the BSA at screening and at the time of the first administration of the study drug. Must be candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy for erythrodermic psoriasis, as assessed by the investigator. Previous exposure to risankizumab. Currently enrolled in another investigational study or less than 30 days (from screening) since completing another investigational study (participation in observational studies is permitted). For generalized pustular psoriasis Subjects with active ongoing inflammatory diseases other than generalized pustular psoriasis that might confound trial evaluations according to investigator's judgment. For erythrodermic psoriasis Subjects with active ongoing inflammatory diseases other than erythrodermic psoriasis that might confound trial evaluations according to investigator's judgment. Subject diagnosed with medicationinduced or medicationexacerbated EP.</criteria>
