	<brief_summary>Cochlear implants (CIs) are medical devices now widely used in persons with severe to profound hearing loss. After a six month to one-year period following implantation, adults typically reach optimal fitting parameters, which lead to a stabilized hearing performance with their CI. At this stage, they usually enter a routine clinical after-care program, which involves regular appointmentsattheir CI center. Such visits aim at identifying any complication, which can be medical (abnormal cutaneous healing evolution) and/or device related, as well as any declinein performance (possibly related to the former). In France, the HAS (French Health Authority) recommends CI users tobe seen around threetimes a year during the second and third years after implantation, and then annually. While the schedule of appointments remains dependent on centers' practices, there is some kind of consensus about the minimal content of a long-term follow-up session:medical consultation, CI external parts checking, free field aided tonal audiometry, fitting adjustments if necessary,speech understanding assessments. Our center (CRIC) is one of the biggest French CI implant centers approved by the HAS, providing after-care for no less than 750 CI users, most of whomhave entered their long-term follow-up period. For some, attending follow-up appointments may need several hours, require taking a half-day off work, and entail travel expenses. Some patients may also have associated disabilities making it difficultto reach the center.Moreover, although the cohort of patients has increased over the years, the number of trained professionals and the clinical care infrastructures have not evolved proportionally. As a consequence, there is a need to reduce the number of routine visits, to allow more scope for complex cases andto efficiently identify issues. Remote consultation seems to address all the points listed above. However, it appears that little has been doneto develop remote after-care for cochlear implant recipients. Published studies mainly focus on the fitting aspects. The development of telemedicine has become one of the key priorities of the French government over the past few years, and it is now feasible thanks to the development of high speed connections (ADSL, mobile internet, high definition transmissions). Promoting telemedicine has several goals, the main one being to extend health care services to underserved patients in remote locations; it also allows some medical units to be freed upand to reserve infrastructures and professionals for patients requesting critical care. Of course, telemedicine is also meant to save costs. The objectif of this protocole is to evaluate the feasibility of telemedicine applied to adult cochlear implant users' follow-up by comparing the data of the medical consultation and speech therapy assessment, carried out in the CRIC service and videoconferencing when the patient is home, using his computer equipment to communicate with the CRIC.</brief_summary>
