	<brief_summary>The EarEEG system is a novel non-invasive, unobstructed and discrete method for recording EEG in which the signal is recorded using dry-contact electrodes embedded on a customised ear piece. One intended medical indication of the EarEEG system is the detection of hypoglycaemia-induced changes in the EEG in patients with type 1 diabetes. Currently, no studies exist investigating the detection of hypoglycaemic episodes by use of ear electrodes. While a finger prick test accurately measures the blood glucose level, it does not provide continuous measurements, and hence it is unreliable as a hypoglycaemia alarm. Recent studies have indicated that the use of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) reduces the risk of severe hypoglycaemia. However, some find these devices troublesome to use and utilisation of CGM has remained limited to date. Observational data show that only a small percentage of patients with type 1 diabetes are using CGM on an ongoing basis. Thus, there is a medical need for a reliable hypoglycaemia detection device which is easy and convenient to use. This clinical study aims at investigating the feasibility of measuring hypoglycaemia induced changes in the EEG by use of the EarEEG system.</brief_summary>
