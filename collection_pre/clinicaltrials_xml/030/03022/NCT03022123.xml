	<brief_summary>270 untreated patients, age between 18 and 65 years , with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (B-DLCL) were treated with a pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PL-doxorubicin) modiÔ¨Åed CHOP-rituximab regimen. PL-doxorubicin 35-40 mg/m(2)and epirubicin 70mg/m(2) were given in combination with standard dosage of prednisone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, rituximab (according to CHOP-R regimen) every 21 days for six courses.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Study of Pegylated Liposomal Doxorubicin Contrast Epirubicin for the Treatment of Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PL-doxorubicin 35-40 mg/m(2) and epirubicin 70mg/m(2) were given on day 1 in combination with standard dosage of prednisone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide (according to CHOP regimen) every 21days for six courses. The choice to adopt the dosage of 30 mg/m2(instead of 50 mg/m2 of conventionaldoxorubicin) was based on pharmacokinetic data and on the results of previous studies in lymphoma.Rituximab 375 mg/m2 was given on day 0 in subsequent courses of therapy. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor was given in the presence of grade 4 neutropenia or febrile neutropenia until hematological recovery. Treatment was stopped if lymphoma progressed, the patient refused further participation,or if there was any other intercurrent clinical condition or adverse event.</detailed_description>
