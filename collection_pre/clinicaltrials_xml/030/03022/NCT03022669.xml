	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether text messages/messaging (TM) or a mobile application (app), compared with an educational website-control provided to all Veterans, can improve adherence to antiplatelet therapy among patients following acute coronary syndrome or percutaneous coronary intervention (ACS/PCI).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Adherence to antiplatelet medications is critical to prevent life threatening complications (i.e., stent thrombosis); yet rates of non-adherence range from 21-57% by 12 months. Mobile technology through TM or mobile apps is a practical and inexpensive strategy to promote behavior change and enhance medication adherence. The three specific aims of this proposal are to: 1) determine preferences for content and frequency of TM to promote medication adherence through focus groups; 2) determine the most patient-centered app to promote adherence through a content analysis of all commercially available apps for medication adherence and focus groups centered on usability; and 3) compare adherence to antiplatelet medications in 225 Veterans post ACS/PCI through a randomized controlled trial. Participants will be randomized to either TM, mobile app, or website-control group. The focus groups will be stratified by low/high mobile phone use and sex.</detailed_description>
