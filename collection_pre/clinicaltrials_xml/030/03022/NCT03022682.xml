	<brief_summary>Obesity affects over one third of US adults (&gt;72 million, with BMI ≥30 kg/m2), and the proportion of US adults with BMI ≥40 kg/m2 has doubled in the last 20 years. Obesity is associated with increased mortality through its linkage to comorbidities including diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, osteoarthritis, sleep apnea and psychosocial disturbances. Given its prevalence, impact on morbidity and mortality, and economic cost, limiting the spread of obesity and its consequences is one of the most important problems of our time.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Inflammation, Diabetes, Ethnicity and Obesity Cohort</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Inflammation, Diabetes, Ethnicity and Obesity (IDEO) cohort is recruiting 145 lean and obese individuals from three ethnicities, covering a spectrum of obesity and T2DM risk. Specifically, the cohort will include: 1) 45 obese subjects, including individuals each from three ethnic groups; Caucasian, Hispanic/Latino, and Chinese; 2) 45 subjects who are slated to undergo any type of bariatric surgery for obesity (20 individuals each from the three ethnic groups above); and 3) 55 lean controls, including individuals from each ethnicity.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects defined (lean and obese) from three defined ethnic groups; Caucasian, Hispanic/Latino, and Chinese. Subjects will be between the ages of 2565 years. These cutoffs are designed to allow inclusion of postmenopausal women, and younger/more active patients who are increasingly undergoing bariatric surgery. BMI criteria for both surgical and nonsurgical obese patients and lean "controls" are as follows: Obese patients: BMI &gt; 30 with standard comorbidities. For Chinese individual BMI cutoff for obesity is &gt;27. Lean controls: BMI &lt; 30 but BMI &gt;18.5 Patients with either diabetes type 2 or the metabolic syndrome will be included in the cohort. Subjects with chronic kidney disease (&gt; stage 3), chronic infections, autoimmune diseases. Subjects with symptomatic heart failure or CAD, cirrhosis or liver failure. Tobacco abuse Subjects on glucocorticoids, immunosuppressants [ tacrolimus, cellcept] and PPARgamma agonist will be excluded from the study.</criteria>
