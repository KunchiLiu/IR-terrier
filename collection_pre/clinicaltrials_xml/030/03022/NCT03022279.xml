	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to compare transversus abdominis plane (TAP) blocks to local wound infiltration (LWI) in terms of postoperative pain control in pediatric patients undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Our hypothesis is that TAP blocks will be superior to LWI for postoperative pain control resulting in decreased use of opioid / narcotic pain medication and decreased pain scored in the immediate 24-hour postoperative period. The rationale is that determining the effect of analgesia in this pediatric population is important to optimize clinical care.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In this study, patients ages 8 through 17 years scheduled for elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy will be invited to participate. Those having da Vinci cholecystectomy procedures will also be eligible. The da Vinci System is a minimally invasive option utilizing robotic technology. Once randomized, the patient will undergo either ultrasound guided bilateral TAP blocks or LWI at the beginning of the surgical procedure. Prospective data regarding pain scores, use of opioid medication, and nausea and vomiting episodes will be collected for both groups. Due to the nature of the study, it will not be possible to blind the investigators to the randomly selected method of injecting local anesthesia; however the personnel involved in the post-anesthetic and post-operative assessment will be blinded to the intervention, as well as the subjects themselves.</detailed_description>
