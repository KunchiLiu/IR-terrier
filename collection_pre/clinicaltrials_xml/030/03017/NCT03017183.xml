	<brief_summary>Study participants will be selected from clinical routine patients with endobronchial infiltration of a central lung cancer and indication for bronchoscopic sampling. Consented patients will undergo bronchoscopy for tumor sampling applying two routine sampling methods during one single procedure (EBUS-TBNA and conventional forceps sampling). The sequence of both sampling methods will be randomized in advance. The resulting tissue samples will be analyzed by a pathologist using multiplex PCR and FISH. The corresponding analysis results will be compared between sampling methods. Assignment of a subject to a particular therapeutic strategy is not influenced by this protocol. Medicinal products will be used according to current practice and marketing authorisation.</brief_summary>
