	<brief_summary>The mechanism responsible for improvement following manual physical therapy techniques is unknown. Previous studies have indicated both biomechanical and neurophysiologic effects which may be responsible for clinical changes observed. Yet, other studies report clinical changes following sham interventions. Through a mixed-methods design, this study aims to gain more understanding of the social and contextual factors that may be related to the improvement often observed following manual therapy techniques.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A convenience sample will be utilized to obtain subjects. Subjects will be given a brief questionnaire to identify possible contraindications for manual therapy treatment techniques and exclude individuals if necessary. Subjects will be randomized into one of eight groups (three variables, each with two conditions including: therapist gender match/mismatch, lab coat worn/not worn, detailed explanation/colloquial conversation about the technique) and participate in neurodynamic testing for the upper quarter via the Upper Limb Provocation Test. Subjects who are determined to be positive for one or more extremities will receive a sham thoracic spine manipulation technique. After application of the technique, previously positive limbs will be retested. Individuals who respond favorably to the sham technique upon reassessment will participate in an exit interview with open-ended questions in attempt to gain more insight into the factors which may have influenced their neurodynamic mobility improvement.</detailed_description>
