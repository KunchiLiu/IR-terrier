	<brief_title>High Flow Nasal Cannula as a Treatment for Obstructive Sleep Apnea</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A single center, prospective study. The study would include 30 patients diagnosed within the past 2 years with moderate to severe OSA (AHI&gt;=15) at the Rabin Medical Center (RMC) sleep lab, and who are intolerant to CPAP treatment. Following signing an informed consent form, these patients would undergo polysomnography (PSG) while treated with HFNC. The HFNC PSG outcome measures will be compared to the baseline PSG done within the past 2 years and to an additional PSG while connected to a CPAP device.</detailed_description>
