	<brief_summary>The investigators hypothesize that there is no relationship between in vivo kinematic abnormalities and patient-rated outcomes for scapholunate interosseous ligament injuries (SLIL) The secondary null hypotheses are that: There are no kinematic differences between subjects with unilateral, symptomatic, full thickness scapholunate ligament tears in comparison to the contralateral wrist without scapholunate ligament injury. The investigators aim to answer to the below questions: - What are baseline validated outcomes for subjects with SLIL injury? - What are baseline physical measures (range of motion, Jamar Dynamometry)?</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>In Vivo Kinematics of Scapolunate Interosseous Ligament Injuries</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In vivo kinematics of the normal wrist has been studied previously, but few studies have characterized the wrist with a SLIL injury. There are few studies evaluating validated patient-rated outcomes for patients with SLIL injury. The goal of this study would be to evaluate to what degree kinematic abnormalities affect patient-rated outcomes.</detailed_description>
