	<brief_title>Yield Rate for Procurement the Histologic Core With Endoscopic Ultrasound-guided Fine Needle Biopsy With 20-gauge Ultrasound Biopsy Needles for Solid Pancreatic Masses: Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is the fourth cause of death in the Western world. Surgery remains the only treatment offering an advantage in terms of overall survival (5-year survival range, 15-25%), but unfortunately only 10-20% of patients present resectable disease at the time of diagnosis. Regarding the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer, proper tool with high diagnostic yield is very important. The investigators investigated the technical feasibility and diagnostic yield of recent-developed new 20-gauge Procore needle for EUS-guided fine needle biopsy in pancreatic solid lesions. The investigators applied the 20-gauge procore needle for EUS-guided fine needle biopsy in the diagnosis of pancreatic solid mass. A total of 30 patients will be enrolled for the present pilot study.</detailed_description>
