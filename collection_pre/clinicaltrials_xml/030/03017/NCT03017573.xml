	<brief_summary>SCANDARE is a prospective biobanking study on tumor (+/- nodes), plasma and blood samples at different time points in ovarian, triple negative breast and head and neck cancer patients. This study will allowed to identify new molecular and/or immunological biomarkers associated with clinical and biological features of the tumors. All patients will receive standard treatment according to the stage of the diseases and usual procédures.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients will have blood and +/- tumor samples at the following times : 1. if eligible for surgery : - at surgery (blood + tumor and nodes) - after surgery (blood) - before cycle 1 of adjuvant chemotherapy (blood + tumor biopsie and nodes if possible) - before cycle 2 of adjuvant chemotherapy (blood) - at progression (blood + tumor biopsie and nodes if possible) 2. if eligible for neoadjuvant chemotherapy : - before neoadjuvant therapy (blood + tumor biopsie and nodes) - during neoadjuvant therapy (post cycle 1) (blood) - at the time of surgery (blood + tumor and nodes) - before cycle 1 of adjuvant chemotherapy (blood + tumor biopsie and nodes) - before cycle 2 of adjuvant chemotherapy (blood) - at progression (blood + tumor biopsie and nodes)</detailed_description>
