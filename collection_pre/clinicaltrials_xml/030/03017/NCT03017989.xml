	<brief_summary>Endometriosis is a common disease for which the current gold standard for diagnosis is a diagnostic laparoscopy with histologic confirmation. However, during the diagnostic laparoscopy endometriotic lesions are hard to identify due to the many appearances of endometriosis. Our hypothesis is that the use of intra-operative near infrared fluorescence imaging will provide real time image enhancement for the detection of endometriotic lesions by using the different vasculature in the endometriotic lesions. This hypothesis will be tested in a prospective study with 15 patients scheduled for an elective diagnostic laparoscopy for suspected endometriosis.</brief_summary>
