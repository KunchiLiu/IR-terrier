	<brief_title>Evaluation of the Effect of Dried Cranberry Powder in Women With Dry OAB</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a 6 month, randomized, prospective, single-center trial that will be conducted in an outpatient setting at a tertiary care facility. This will be a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled parallel study of dried cranberry for OAB symptoms in women. Eligible subjects will be female outpatients aged ≥18 years who have been diagnosed with OAB. All patients will be provided written informed consent before entering the study. The study protocol and all amendments will be approved by the appropriate Institutional Review Board. Patients will be recruited for the study from the office of Dr. Bilal Chughtai, from within Weill Cornell Medical College, including referral by WCMC-affiliated primary care and other physicians not involved with the study, as well as recruited from advertisement (Craigslist, newspapers, posters, etc.). Recruitment will also take place within New York Presbyterian Hospital. Subjects will have a complete history and physical examination in the office; the participants will complete the validated questionnaires and informed consent, as well as urinalysis. Eligible participants will be enrolled in the study and randomized to receive either a dried cranberry or placebo. The primary endpoint is the mean change in number of voids per day as measured using a three-day voiding diaries from baseline to end-of-treatment. Patients will complete voiding diaries for 3 consecutive days prior to each clinic visit. Secondary endpoints will include a comparison of the patient's baseline OAB symptom bother and quality of life, and sexual function as measured by 4 validated questionnaires: the OABQ-SF, PPBC, SQOL-F, and PFDI-20. The subjects will be given a device to measure their urinary volume throughout the study. The study duration will be 6 months. Follow-up visits will be conducted at 12 and 24 weeks. Adverse reactions and complications will be obtained and recorded by Clavien-Dindo Grading System. The investigator seeks to determine if dried cranberry powder changes the microbiome of women with Overactive Bladder symptoms versus placebo. At visit two (baseline) and visit four (end of study visit) stool and urine samples will be collected from up to 40 study participants out of the 76 participants enrolled in the study. The stool and urine samples will be collected and the microbiome of each specimen will be analyzed by Genomics Core or Epigenomics Core at Weill Cornell Medical College. Participants in the study will provide urine samples. The urine sample will be collected in sterile containers. Participants in the study will provide one urine sample during visit 2 (Baseline visit) and another sample during visit 4 (end of study). These samples will be subsequently analyzed for the presence/ absence of microbiota. This includes DNA extraction, library preparation, shotgun next-generation sequencing, and follow-up metagenomics and microbiome analysis using bioinformatics alignment tools, in order to identify microbial species and strains. Participants in the study will provide one stool sample during visit 2 of the study and another during visit 4 of the study. Stool samples will be self-collected using a clean catching receptacle (e.g. plastic inverted hat) and plastic scoop to transfer feces into 6 sterile tubes.</detailed_description>
