	<criteria>Participants must have at least one parent who meets the criteria for diagnosis of Bipolar I disorder (BDI) or Bipolar II disorder (BDII), as confirmed by the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) administered to the parent. MINI will be administered to parent if the history of BD is endorsed by Family Index of Risk for Mood (FIRM) or other medical information (psychiatrist, medical records). The MINI can be administered to the parent remotely through the telephone or video call if an inperson interview is not feasible due to logistical reasons. A diagnosis Bipolar Disorder Not Otherwise Specified in the parent would not qualify for eligibility Participants must be either drugnaive, or on stable treatment for at least 4 weeks. Participants (and/or their parents as applicable) must sign an Informed Consent Form (ICF) allowing data collection and source data verification in accordance with local requirements and/or sponsor policy.
