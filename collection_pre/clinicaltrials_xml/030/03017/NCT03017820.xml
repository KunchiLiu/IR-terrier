	<brief_summary>This phase I trial studies the best dose and side effects of recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus carrying the human NIS and IFN beta genes (VSV-hIFNbeta-sodium iodide symporter [NIS]) in treating patients with multiple myeloma, acute myeloid leukemia, or T-cell lymphoma that has come back or does not respond to treatment. A virus, called VSV-hIFNbeta-NIS, which has been changed in a certain way, may be able to kill cancer cells without damaging normal cells.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>VSV-hIFNbeta-NIS in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma, Acute Myeloid Leukemia, or T-cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of VSV-hIFNbeta-NIS in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma, acute myeloid leukemia, or T-cell lymphoma. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the safety profile of VSV-hIFNbeta-NIS. II. To estimate clinical response rate in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma, acute myeloid leukemia, or T-cell lymphoma overall and by disease type. III. To estimate progression-free and overall survival in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma, acute myeloid leukemia, or T-cell lymphoma overall and by disease type. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the time course of viral gene expression and virus elimination, and the biodistribution of virally infected cells at various times points after infection with VSV-hIFNbeta-NIS using planar and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)/computed tomography (CT) imaging. II. To assess virus replication, viremia, viral shedding in urine and respiratory secretions, and virus persistence after systemic administration of VSV-hIFNbeta-NIS. III. To characterize the pharmacodynamics (PD) of VSV-IFNbeta-NIS by way of measuring serum interferon-beta and also vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-real time (RT)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of VSV-IFNbeta-NIS. IV. Assess CD8+ T cell (both general and VSV-IFNbeta-NIS specific) and natural killer (NK) cell responses. V. Gene expression analysis pre- and post-virotherapy. VI. Assess presence of VSV in tumor and normal tissues subsequent to administration of intravenous (IV) VSV-IFNbeta-NIS. OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients receive VSV-IFNbeta-NIS intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1, and then undergo SPECT/CT 3-5 days later. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 28 days, and then every 3 months for up to 1 year.</detailed_description>
