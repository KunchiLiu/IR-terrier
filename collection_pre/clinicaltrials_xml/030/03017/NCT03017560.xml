	<brief_summary>The primary purpose of this study is to test the effects of a targeted, computerized cognitive training program on verbal memory in older women who have undergone chemotherapy treatment for early-stage breast cancer. As measured by neuropsychological assessment, this treatment will result in improved verbal memory. Secondarily, processing speed and naming abilities are expected to improve. Enhanced self-perception of cognitive ability is also expected.</brief_summary>
