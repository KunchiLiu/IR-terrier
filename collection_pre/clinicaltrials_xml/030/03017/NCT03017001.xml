	<brief_summary>Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (w-3-PUFA) may have a potential role in enhance the postoperative balance of host immunity and reduce the incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF). CHO drinks 2h before the induction of the anesthesia may reduce the necessity of vasoactive drugs preoperatively. the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of these two nutrients in patients undergoing CABG with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) on morbidity at ICU, mainly POFA. This is a double-blind controlled randomized trial.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Preoperative Carbohydrate Load and Intraoperative w3-PUFA in CAGB Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The authors include all patients of both sexes with medical diagnose of chronic coronary heart disease and eligible to elective CABG with age ranging from 18 to 80 years. All patients have signed the written informed consent form. We exclude those who have insulin-dependent diabetic, hepatic or renal disorders, thrombocytopenia, important dyslipidemia (triglycerides 3-fold higher than normal standard), gastro-esophageal reflux, acute coronary syndromes, allergy to fish oil, and severe malnutrition. We also exclude patients underwent off-pump CABG, combined heart procedures, reoperations, and those who received blood transfusion in the last 3 months. Patients were randomized using a random number software available at www.graphpad.com . They were allocated for four groups: group CHO (patients received a 8h fast for solids and 2h fast with 200mL of a drink containing water plus 12.5% maltodextrin (25g) and no infusion of intraoperative w-3-PUFA); Control group (preoperative fast for solids for 8h but allowed to drink 200 mL of water until 2h before anesthesia; and no infusion of intraoperative w-3-PUFA); group CHO+w3 (patients received a 8h fast for solids and 2h fast with 200mL of a drink containing water plus 12.5% maltodextrin (25g), and an intravenous intraoperative dose of w-3-PUFA (0.2 mcg/kg) during 4h ); and group w3 (preoperative fast for solids but allowed to drink 200 mL of water until 2h before anesthesia, and an intravenous intraoperative dose of w-3-PUFA (0.2 mcg/kg) during 4h). Only a dietitian of the hospital knew the randomization chart and informed the ward nurse to give the patient one of the two preoperative drinks before sent him to the surgical theater. . She also informed the anesthesiologist which patient would receive the intraoperative w-3-PUFA. The surgeon and his assistant team did not know which group belong each patient. A team of cardiologists and intensivists who also were blind to the study design and randomization collected all data. Endpoints The primary endpoints were the incidence of POAF and the need of inotropic vasoactive drug (dobutamine and/or noradrenalin) for weaning from CPB (intraoperative period) and at ICU (postoperative period). As secondary endpoints the investigators looked at perioperative morbidity, hospital mortality and length of both ICU stay and total postoperative stay.</detailed_description>
