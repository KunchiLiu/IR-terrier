	<brief_summary>The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog (AKT)-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway is one of the most frequently aberrantly regulated pathways in human tumors. TAS-117 is a highly potent and selective oral allosteric AKT inhibitor. It has high affinity for AKT1, 2, and 3 and shows potent anti-proliferative activity against multiple tumor cell lines in vivo. Therefore, we propose to conduct a phase II trial of TAS-117, potent and selective AKT inhibitor, in patients with advanced solid tumor with PI3K/AKT genetic aberrancy by NGS focusing panel in part of K-BASKET trial.</brief_summary>
