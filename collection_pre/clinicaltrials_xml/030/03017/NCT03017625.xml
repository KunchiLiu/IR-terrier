	<brief_summary>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is known for development of severe cardiovascular co-morbidities. Systemic inflammation during acute exacerbations of COPD (AE-COPD) is thought to play a role in development of cardiovascular disease. Platelets contribute to acute cardiovascular events and atherosclerosis. When platelets are activated, they form complexes with monocytes. These platelet-monocyte complexes (PMCs) are an early process in atherothrombosis and promote inflammation. In COPD, platelet function in AE-COPD is scarcely studied. This study aims to address this gap by investigating platelet function and coagulation in patients with AE-COPD and after convalescence.</brief_summary>
