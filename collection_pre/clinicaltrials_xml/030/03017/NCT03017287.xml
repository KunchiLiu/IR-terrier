	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy of the GlucoMe APP in Patients With Uncontrolled Diabetes Treated With MDI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>GlucoMe is an interactive system, which provides glucose management tools to both the patient and health care team (HCT). The system includes a decision support system to be used by the HCT aiming to aid clinical decision making with mathematical models. The system does not intend to replace clinical judgement and all recommendations are to be approved by the HCT. Forty (40) diabetic patients on multiple daily insulin injection (MDI) with abnormal HbA1c and identified as potential end users of the device will be recruited to the study and screened according to the study inclusion and exclusion criteria. Patient's daily blood glucose will be measured and the GlucoMe App will give its recommendations for change in insulin dose, as well as recommendations for pre and post-meal carbohydrate and exercise. Patient's daily blood glucose levels will be followed by the HCT biweekly for 12 weeks and patients will be instructed to change their insulin doses according to the decision of the treating physician. At the end of the study, the HCT's recommendations for treatment adjustment will be compared to those of the system for both safety and efficacy. Study subjects and the HCT will be asked to complete a questionnaire regarding the GlucoMe system usability.</detailed_description>
