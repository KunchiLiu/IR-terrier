	<brief_title>Mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) Screening in a High-Risk Population With Previous Surgical Repair or Presence of Inguinal and/or Umbilical Hernia Combined With Pediatric ENT Surgery or Bronchoscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) are a group of inherited lysosomal storage disorders. In individuals with MPS disorders, have deficiency or malfunction of specific lysosomal enzymes leads to an abnormal accumulation of certain complex carbohydrates (mucopolysaccharides or glycosaminoglycans) in the arteries, skeleton, eyes, joints, ears, skin, and/or teeth. These accumulations may also be found in the respiratory system, liver, spleen, central nervous system, blood, and bone marrow. This accumulation eventually causes progressive damage to cells, tissues, and various organ systems of the body. Due to such an extreme variability in clinical presentation as well as wide range of disease spectrum, but insufficient MPS disease awareness in Taiwan, these resulted in a delay diagnosis or even miss diagnosis with other clinical symptom thus patient often received inappropriate treatment. In order to address the current issue of delay diagnosis among MPS patient, it is critical to develop a MPS screening algorithm for high risk patients in Taiwan.</detailed_description>
