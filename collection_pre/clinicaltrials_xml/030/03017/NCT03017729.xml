	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the longitudinal attainment of subject centred and functional related goals (cumulated Goal Attainment Scale Total (GAS T) score) after abobotulinumtoxinA injection (including following repeated injection cycles where they occur) alongside spasticity management used in real life settings over a period of 18 months (and a maximum of six injection cycles).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Female or male subjects aged 2 to 17 years inclusive Decision to prescribe abobotulinumtoxinA, to be made prior to and independently from the decision to enrol in the study Primary diagnosis of paediatric lower limb (PLL) spasticity and either: Previously untreated with BoNT (na誰ve to BoNT), or previously treated with a BoNT (i.e. non na誰ve to BoNT), and for those who were previously treated with BoNTA, they should have responded to BoNTA treatment according to the investigator's criteria For non na誰ve BoNT subjects, a minimum interval of 12 weeks since the last BoNT injection and in the presence of spasticity Known resistance to any BoNT or experienced serious safety issues with previous use of BoNT Concomitant treatment with other BoNT Known hypersensitivity to abobotulinumtoxinA or related compounds, or any component in the study drug formulation Subjects with any clinical (or subclinical) evidence of marked defective neuromuscular transmission (e.g. Lambert Eaton syndrome or myasthenia gravis) or persistent clinically significant neuromuscular disorders</criteria>
