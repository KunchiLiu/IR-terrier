	<brief_title>Study of TAK-228 (MLN0128) in Combination With Metformin in Patients With Advanced Cancers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Groups: If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a dose level of TAK-228 and metformin based on when you join this study. Up to 6 dose levels of TAK-228 and metformin will be tested. Up to 6 participants will be enrolled at each dose level. The first group of participants will receive the lowest dose level. Each new group will receive higher doses than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen. This will continue until the highest tolerable dose of the combination of TAK-228 and metformin is found. This is called dose escalation. After the highest tolerable doses are found, up to an additional 14 participants will be enrolled to receive the metformin and TAK-228 at the highest tolerable doses. This is called dose expansion. Study Drug Administration: Cycle 1 is 42 days and Cycles 2 and beyond are 28 days. You will take TAK-228 and metformin by mouth every day at about the same time each day with a full cup of water (about 8 ounces) on an empty stomach. You should not eat or drink anything for 2 hours before and 1 hour after your TAK-228 dose. You should take it at home except on the days when you have a study visit. Depending on your dose, you may take metformin 1-3 times every day. Your study doctor will tell you how often you should take this drug. During Cycle 1, you will take metformin only for the first 2 weeks. You will not take both TAK-228 and metformin until Day 15 of Cycle 1. This is called a titration period. Length of Study Participation: You may continue taking the study drugs for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best interest. You will no longer be able to take the study drug if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions. Your participation on the study will be over when you have completed the follow-up visit. Study Visits: At every study visit, you will be asked about your health, any other drugs you are taking, and if you have had any side effects. You must fast for at least 8 hours before each visit. On Day 1 of Cycle 1: - You will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 3 teaspoons) and urine will be drawn for routine tests. Part of this blood sample will be used to check your glucose levels. - You will have an EKG before taking metformin. - If you can become pregnant, urine will be collected for a pregnancy test. If the test is positive, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn to confirm you are pregnant. On Day 8, 22, 29, and 36 of Cycle 1: - You will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 2-3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests. On Day 15 of Cycle 1: - You will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to test for diabetes. - Urine will be collected for routine tests. - You will have an EKG before taking TAK-228. On Day 1 of Cycle 2: - You will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 3 teaspoons) and urine will be drawn for routine tests. - You will have an EKG. On Day 15 of Cycle 2: - You will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 3 teaspoons) and urine will be drawn for routine tests. On Day 1 of Cycles 3 and Beyond: - You will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 3 teaspoons) and urine will be drawn for routine tests. Part of this blood sample will be used to test for diabetes every 3 cycles. - You will have an EKG every other cycle. About every 8 weeks starting at Day 28 of Cycle 2, you will have an x-ray, CT, MRI, and/or PET scan. If the study doctor thinks it is needed, they will be performed more often. If the study doctor thinks it is needed, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn to measure tumor markers. At-Home Glucose Monitoring: You will be asked to monitor your glucose levels at home. The study staff will give you a glucose monitor (called a glucometer) and teach you how and when to use it. You will bring the glucometer with you to each study visit so the study staff can collect the results of the testing. End-of-Study Visit: Within 30 days after your last dose of study drugs: - You will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests, to check your glucose levels, and to test for diabetes. - Urine will be collected for routine tests. - You will have an EKG. - You will have an x-ray, CT, MRI, and/or PET scan. - You will continue to monitor your glucose levels. - If the study doctor thinks it is needed, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn to measure tumor markers. If you have side effects at the end-of-study visit and the doctor thinks it is needed, you will continue to come into the clinic to have the above tests/procedures repeated until the side effects go away. This is an investigational study. TAK-228 is not FDA approved or commercially available. TAK-228 is currently being used for research purposes only. Metformin is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of diabetes mellitus. The combination of these drugs to treat advanced cancer is considered investigational. The study doctor can explain how the study drugs are designed to work. Up to 50 participants will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>
