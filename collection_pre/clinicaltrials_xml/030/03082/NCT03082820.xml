	<brief_summary>The study examines pain-related evoked potentials (PREP) in patients with peripheral nerve injuries. Since previous studies found altered latencies and amplitudes of PREP in generalized polyneuropathies, e. g. HIV-polyneuropathy and fibromyalgia, this study investigates if these alterations are detectable in unilateral peripheral nerve injuries as well.</brief_summary>
