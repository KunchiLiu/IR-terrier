	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is describe the safety and single-dose pharmacokinetics of rectally-administered IQP (ImQuest Pharmaceuticals)-0528 (DuoGel) in plasma, rectal tissue biopsies, vaginal tissue biopsies, rectal fluid and cervicovaginal fluid as well as to assess the luminal distribution of IQP-0528 in the rectum. Sixteen healthy volunteers will receive a single rectal dose of DuoGel, followed by blood, tissue and fluid sampling over the following 72 hours.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>ImQuest (IQP) DuoGel Phase 1 Pharmacokinetic Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a phase 1 open label study of the safety, PK, and PD of single-dose 10 mL IQP-0528 through rectal administration. Pharmacokinetics (PK) will be assessed in multiple compartments: plasma, rectal tissue, vaginal tissue, rectal fluid and cervicovaginal fluid. The luminal distribution of DuoGel in the rectum will be evaluated with Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography/ X-ray Computed Tomography (SPECT/CT). Pharmacodynamics (PD) will be assessed in an ex vivo HIV explant challenge of rectal and vaginal tissue biopsies. After completing the screening evaluation (Visit 1) and establishing participant eligibility, 16 eligible participants will be enrolled: 8 men and 8 women. A subsequent baseline visit (Visit 2) safety assessment and tissue ex vivo HIV explant challenge will be performed as baseline for comparison with later post-drug evaluation. Participants will receive a single 10 mL rectal dose of 99mTechnetium (99mTc) -radiolabelled DuoGel (Visit 3), followed by safety assessments and PK and PD sampling over three days (Visits 3, 4, and 5). Finally, a follow-up safety phone call is performed a week after all PK sampling and biopsies are collected.</detailed_description>

Participants who are currently receiving or have been on oral PrEP or PEP in the past month 9. Any other clinical condition or prior therapy that, in the opinion of the investigator, would make the patient unsuitable for the study or unable to comply with the study requirements. 10. Significant colorectal symptom(s) as determined by medical history or by participant selfreport 11. Active rectal infection, requiring treatment per current Centers for Disease Control (CDC) guidelines or symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI).

Significant vaginal symptoms, genital lesions, erythema, edema or any other abnormal physical finding that, in the opinion of the investigator or designee, would contraindicate study participation. 18.

Infections requiring treatment include Chlamydia (CT), gonorrhea (GC), syphilis, active HSV lesions, chancroid, bacterial vaginosis, vaginal candidiasis, trichomonas, genital sores or ulcers, and, if clinically indicated, genital warts. 19. History of significant vaginal bleeding 20. Undiagnosed irregular uterine bleeding 21. Postmenopausal defined as 12 months of amenorrhea 22. Per participant report, abnormalities of the female genital tract, which, in the judgment of the investigator, might increase the risk of the study to the research participant. 23.
