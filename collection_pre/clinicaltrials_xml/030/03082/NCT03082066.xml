	<brief_summary>Retrospective observational study: Soft tissue and bone diameters are assessed in MRI and CT scans of patients. Data is compared with recommendations of intraosseus needle producers to assess whether the information provided by the producers can be optimised. Study sites are head of humerus bone, distal femur, proximal and distal tibia in accordance with recommended intraosseus access sites. Primary and secondary outcome parameters will be assessed at one time only, i.e. when the patient has received MRI or CT scan for the diagnostic work up of their primary disease. Data collection for a given patient in this study can be completed within one session, e.g. 5-10 minutes. No additional investigation is required for this retrospective study.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Soft Tissue and Bone Diameter in Children and Adults for Intraosseus Access</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Retrospective observational single centre study: Soft tissue and bone diameters are assessed in MRI and CT scans of patients. Data is compared with recommendations of intraosseus needle producers to assess whether the information provided by the producers can be optimised. Study sites are head of humerus bone, distal femur, proximal and distal tibia in accordance with recommended intraosseus access sites. Data is gathered from patients who undergo either MRI or CT scanning for any disease and where bone at the IO puncture site is accessible for measurements required for this study. Primary and secondary outcome parameters will be assessed at one time only, i.e. when the patient has received MRI or CT scan for the diagnostic work up of their primary disease. Data collection for a given patient in this study can be completed within one session, e.g. 5-10 minutes. No additional investigation is required for this</detailed_description>
