	<brief_summary>It has been proved that concurrent radiotherapy (RT) and intrathecal methotrexate (MTX) for leptomeningeal metastases (LM) from solid tumors with adverse prognostic factors showed great effectiveness and safety. Cytarabine(Ara-C) is another agent which is commonly used for intrathecal chemotherapy. The purpose of the study is to observe the effectiveness and safety of concurrent RT and intrathecal chemotherapy for LM from solid tumors. In addition, the effectiveness of these two types of agents (MTX and Ara-C) in the concurrent chemo-radiotherapy will be compared in this study. This is a randomized controlled, parallel group, and phase II clinical trial. The object of this study is newly diagnosis patients with leptomeningeal metastases from solid tumors, who will accept the treatment of involved-field RT combined with concurrent intrathecal-MTX or intrathecal-Ara-C, respectively. Major endpoint is clinical response rate. Secondary endpoints are time to progression,severe adverse events and overall survival.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Concurrent Involved-field Radiotherapy and Intrathecal Chemotherapy for Leptomeningeal Metastases From Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The patients were randomly divided into two groups, who will accept the treatment of involved-field RT combined with concurrent intrathecal-MTX or intrathecal-Ara-C, respectively. Concomitant regimen consisted of intrathecal chemotherapy (via lumbar puncture, MTX 15 mg, plus dexamethasone 5 mg, or Ara-C 50mg, plus dexamethasone 5 mg, once per week, 4 weeks in total) and RT. RT consisted of fractionated, conformal radiation given at a daily dose of 2 Gy. The planning volume consisted of sites of symptomatic disease, bulky disease observed on MRI, including the whole brain and basis cranii received 40 Gy in 20 fractions and/or segment of spinal canal received 40-50 Gy. In the investigator's previous study, criteria of evaluation for clinical response that has been established was based on improvement of neurologic symptoms/signs and changes of karnofsky performance status(KPS). The criteria were proved as effective method for the evaluation of prognosis. The method was used to assess the clinical response in this study.</detailed_description>
