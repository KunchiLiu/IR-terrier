	<brief_summary>Shock is a common condition in critical care unit (ICU). It is extremely important that the patient accepts early goal-directed therapy (EGDT) treatment in the early stage of shock. However, several studies failed to demonstrate that the well used variables such as CVP and others could direct to a better treatment. In recent years, critical care ultrasound (CCUS) has been respected as a reliable noninvasive tool and widely used in ICU practice. With CCUS the investigators can accurately acquired the detailed information of the characteristic of the hemodynamics and lung pathology (the systole and diastole function, volume status, valve insufficiency, lung, edema, consolidation, and pleural effusion, etc.). To the investigators knowledge, there is no study investigating the epidemic of such ultrasonic variables and its value to predict to outcome. The aim of this study is to investigate the epidemic and the prognostic value of CCUS Based Characteristic of Hemodynamic and Lung pathology in Early Stage of Shock in patients admitted in ICU.</brief_summary>
