	<brief_summary>This study is designed to investigate if aerobic exercise during and after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (NACRT) can improve outcomes for rectal cancer patients. Rectal cancer patients will be randomly assigned to aerobic exercise or usual care. Patients in the aerobic exercise group will be asked to complete 3 supervised high-intensity aerobic interval training (HIT) session/week during NACRT and â‰¥ 150 minutes/week of unsupervised aerobic exercise after NACRT. Primary hypothesis: aerobic exercise during and after NACRT, compare to usual care, will result in significantly better cardiorespiratory fitness.</brief_summary>
