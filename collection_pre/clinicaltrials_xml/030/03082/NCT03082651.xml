	<brief_summary>The proposed study will investigate the effect of alternating footwear model and workout-type on the occurrence of running-related pain. To achieve this goal participants will be randomly assigned into one of four different groups who will perform: 1) the same workout throughout a week in the same running shoe model, 2) alternating workout-types throughout the week in the same shoe model, 3) the same workout throughout a week in alternating shoe models, and 4) alternating workouts in alternating shoes. Participants will be characterized based on body alignment, strength, injury and training history. Pain and injury status will be monitored.</brief_summary>
