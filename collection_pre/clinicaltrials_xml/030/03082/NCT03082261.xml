	<brief_title>Multi-center Prospective Study Determining the Sustainability of Pain Relief and Psychosocial and Functional Responses When Utilizing a Multiple Waveform Enabled Neurostimulator</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To evaluate sustainable pain control utilizing the Prodigy or Proclaim Elite family of neurostimulators using a tonic or BurstDR waveform. Subjects will be enrolled prior to their device trial evaluation period. Once the subject has their permanent system implant, they will return to the clinic for follow up visits at 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months post permanent implant.</detailed_description>
