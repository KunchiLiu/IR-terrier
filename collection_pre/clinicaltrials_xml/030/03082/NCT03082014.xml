	<brief_summary>Multicentre, multinational, prospective randomised, open-label, 3 sequence crossover phase III b clinical trial with blinded endpoint assessment (PROBE-design) - in 75 patients with sporadic small vessel diseases (SVDs) and - in 30 patients with cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL)</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Amlodipine and Other Blood Pressure Lowering Agents on Microvascular Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>TREAT-SVDs will be carried out as a multicentre open label trial at five trial sites across 3 European countries: Germany, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. Patients meeting eligibility criteria will be randomly allocated to one of three sequences of antihypertensive treatment which are given as open-label oral medications in standard dose in the following order Arm A: Amlodipine &gt; Losartan &gt; Atenolol Arm B: Atenolol &gt; Amlodipine &gt; Losartan Arm C: Losartan &gt; Atenolol &gt; Amlodipine. The study starts with a two week run-in phase. During these first two weeks, patients are not allowed to take antihypertensive drugs except for the rescue medication. After the run-in period,every patient will take subsequently three different antihypertensive drugs (each drug from a separate drug class) according to the randomly assigned arm. Each study drug will be administered for four weeks. Patients will be monitored telemetrically with a dedicated BP device during the whole trial period of 14 weeks.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients may be enrolled in the trial if all of the following criteria have been met: Symptomatic SVD defined as History of clinical lacunar stroke in the last 5 years with a corresponding recent small subcortical infarct visible on MRI scan or CT scan* compatible with the clinical syndrome. *On MRI, recent infarct is defined as a diffusionweighted imaging (DWI) lesion on the acute MRI scan. On CT, recent infarct is defined as a novel infarct on CT within 3 weeks after the event that was not visible on the admission CT. or cognitive impairment defined as visiting a memory clinic with cognitive complaints, and a clinical dementia rating (CDR) score of ≥ 0.5, and capacity to consent, and with confluent deep white matter hyperintensities (WMH) on MRI (defined on the Fazekas scale as deep WMH score ≥ 2) or a diagnosis of CADASIL established by molecular genetic testing of the NOTCH3 gene (presence of an archetypical, cysteineaffecting mutation) or the presence of granular osmiophilic material in ultrastructural, electron microscopy analysis of skin biopsy Indication for antihypertensive treatment (as defined by meeting one of the following): Hypertension defined as SBP ≥ 140 mmHg or diastolic BP (DBP) ≥ 90 mmHg without antihypertensive treatment or use of an antihypertensive drug for previously diagnosed hypertension Prior history of stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA) Age 18 years or older Written informed consent Patients will be excluded from the trial for any of the following reasons: Inclusion criteria are not met Unwillingness or inability to give written consent Pregnant or breastfeeding women, women of childbearing age not taking contraception. Acceptable contraception in women of childbearing age is a "highly effective" contraceptive measure as defined by the Clinical Trials Facilitation Group and includes combined (oestrogen and progesterone containing) or progesteroneonly contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation, or intrauterine device, or bilateral tubal occlusion. Contraindications to MRI (pacemaker, aneurysm clip, cochlear implant etc.) Other major neurological or psychiatric conditions affecting the brain and interfering with the trial design (e.g. multiple sclerosis) In case of clinical lacunar stroke syndrome other causes of stroke such as ≥ 50% luminal stenosis (NASCET) in large arteries supplying the area of ischaemia majorrisk cardioembolic source of embolism (permanent or paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, sustained atrial flutter, intracardiac thrombus, prosthetic cardiac valve, atrial myxoma or other cardiac tumours, mitral stenosis, recent (&lt; 4 weeks) myocardial infarction, left ventricular ejection fraction less than 30%, valvular vegetations, or infective endocarditis) other specific causes of stroke identified (e.g. arteritis, dissection, migraine/vasospasm, drug misuse) Other stroke risk factor requiring immediate intervention that would preclude involvement in the trial Renal impairment (eGFR &lt; 35ml/min) Life expectancy &lt; 2 years Use of &gt; 2 antihypertensive drugs for an appropriate BP control Contraindications to the applied antihypertensive drugs as known Severe aortic stenosis Bilateral renal artery stenosis Severe arterial circulatory disorders Atrioventricular block II° or III° or sick sinus syndrome Heart failure (NYHA III or IV) Bradycardia, resting heart rate &lt; 50/min Bronchospastic diseases such as severe bronchial asthma Severe hepatic dysfunction such as liver cirrhosis Use of monoamine oxidase (MAO)Ablockers Use of simvastatin &gt; 20mg/d Metabolic acidosis Disturbed electrolyte homeostasis such as hypercalcaemia, hypokalaemia, and hyponatraemia Symptomatic hyperuricaemia (gout)</criteria>
