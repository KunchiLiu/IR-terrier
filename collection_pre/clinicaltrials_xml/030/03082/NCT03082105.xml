	<brief_summary>Sufficient oxygenation is critical for completely buried avalanche victims to avoid life-threatening consequences during hypoxic exposure. Snow contains a remarkable capacity to maintain air availability; it was suspected that the snow physical properties affect the development of hypoxia and hypercapnia. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of different snow physical properties on the development of hypoxia and hypercapnia in subjects breathing into an artificial air pocket in snow. Twelve male healthy subjects breathed through an airtight face-mask and 40cm tube into an artificial air pocket of 4L. Every subject performed three tests on different days with varying snow characteristics. Symptoms, gas and cardiovascular parameters were monitored up to 30min. Tests were interrupted at SpO2 &lt;75% (primary endpoint); or due to subjective symptoms like dyspnea, dizziness, and headache (i.e. related to hypercapnia). Snow density was assessed via standard methods and micro-computed tomography (CT) analysis, and permeability and penetration with the snow micro-penetrometer (SMP).</brief_summary>
