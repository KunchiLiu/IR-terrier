	<brief_summary>The aim of this trial is to find the maximum tolerable dose of radiation that can be delivered combined with chemotherapy (DDP &amp; Paclitaxel) in patients with inoperable or medically unresectable esophageal cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiation Dose Escalation in Esophageal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The RTOG 8501 has established concurrent radiochemotherapy as the standard of care for cancer of the esophagus.However, locoregional remain problematic, with 25% of patients having persistence and 20% relapse of locoregional disease following the combined modality approach. New regimen is urgently needed for improving localregional control and survival.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Histologically confirmed primary squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus 2. Age 1 875. 3. Patients must be deemed unresectable disease or patient is not deemed operable due to medical reasons. 4. Patients with distant metastasis and life expectancy &gt;/= 3 months are eligible. 5. Zubrod performance status 0 to 2 6. No prior radiation to the thorax that would overlap with the current treatment field. 7. Patients with nodal involvement are eligible 8. Adequate bone marrow, renal and hepatic functions as assessed by the following: Hemoglobin &gt;/= 10.0 g/dl, Platelet count &gt;/= 1 00,000/mm^3,absolute granulocyte count (AGC) ≥2 × 10^9 cells/L,bilirubin and Aspartate transaminase ≤1.5 ×upper limit of normal (ULN), Creatinine &lt;/=1 .5 times ULN. 9. A signed informed consent must be obtained prior to therapy. 1 0. Induction chemotherapy is allowed. 1. The presence of a fistula. 2. Prior radiotherapy that would overlap the radiation fields. 3. gastroesophageal junction cancer. 4. Uncontrolled concurrent illness including, but not limited to: Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease(COPD) exacerbation or other respiratory illness, serious uncontrolled infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure (CHF),unstable angina pectoris, uncontrolled hypertension,or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with the study requirements. 5. Known hypersensitivity to paclitaxel. 6. Any other condition or circumstance that would, in the opinion of the Investigator, make the patient unsuitable for participation in the study. 7. Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome. 8. Conditions precluding medical followup and protocol compliance</criteria>
