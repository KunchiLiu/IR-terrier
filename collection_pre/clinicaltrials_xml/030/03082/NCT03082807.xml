The present study aimed to determine the effects of negative-calorie diet supplemented with exercise, on weight loss and lipid profile, and to compare its efficiency with low-calorie diet with exercise among elderly adult men with abnormal weight gain. Materials and Methods: Participants included sedentary men (age 45-75 years) with overweight or obesity (n=37). They were randomly divided into 2 groups including negative calorie diet with exercise, and low-calorie diet with exercise. Of all 37 participants, 30 persons completed the treatment. The weight assessment parameters including change in weight and body composition, blood sample tests were performed pre- and three month post-intervention.</detailed_description>
