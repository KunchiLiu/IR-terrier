	<detailed_description>AZD2014 50mg BD continuous schedule of a 28 day cycle AZD2014 will be administered with orange juice in STG/TG patients. AZD2014 can be taken with or without food. The first dose of the day should be taken at approximately the same time each morning.The second dose of the day should be taken approximately 12 hours after the morning dose.</detailed_description>

Relapse within 6 months of completion of adjuvant/neoadjuvant chemotherapy containing doublet 5fluoropyrimidine and platinumbased regimen could be considered as 1st line therapy. Acceptable prior chemotherapy regimens for this protocol are chemotherapy regimens that include Immune Target agent therapy. (such as a pembrolizumab, ramucirumab etc) 4. Previous adjuvant/neoadjuvant chemotherapy is allowed, if completed more than 6 months prior to starting the 1st line therapy. 5.

More than one prior chemotherapy regimen (except for adjuvant/neoadjuvant chemotherapy with more than 6 month wash out period) for the treatment of gastric cancer in the advanced setting. 2. Any previous treatment with PIK3CA, AKT or mTOR inhibitor or agents with mixed PI3K / mTOR activity. 3. Patients with second primary cancer, except: adequately treated nonmelanoma skin cancer, curatively treated insitu cancer of the cervix, or other solid tumours curatively treated with no evidence of disease for ≤5 years. 4. Patients unable to swallow orally administered medication. 5. Previous major surgery within 4 weeks prior to enrollment. 6. For AZD2014: Exposure to potent or moderate inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4/5 if taken within the stated washout periods before the first dose of study treatment 8. With the exception of alopecia, any ongoing toxicities (&gt;CTCAE grade 1) caused by previous cancer therapy. 9. Intestinal obstruction or CTCAE grade 3 or grade 4 upper GI bleeding within 4 weeks before the enrollment. 10. Resting ECG with measurable QTcB &gt; 450 msec on 2 or more time points within a 24 hour period or family history of long QT syndrome. 11.
