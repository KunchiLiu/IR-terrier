	<brief_summary>Pulmonary rehabilitation is recognized as a core component of the management of individuals with chronic obstructive respiratory disease, which has become first-line treatment besides drug therapy. However, in the current clinical evaluation system of pulmonary rehabilitation, there is still a lack of simple, objective index,which can be monitored at any time.Neural respiratory drive , as an important physiological index, is closely related to the symptoms and the severity of the disease. It may be a sensitive indicator to evaluate the effectiveness of pulmonary rehabilitation. Surface EMGdi can accurately evaluate neural respiratory drive , its detection is non-invasive, simple and safety . In recent years, with the development of signal detection and analysis technology, EMG recording is more stable, but as the related research samples were low, surface diaphragm EMG has not yet the establishment of standardization. Therefore, based on the previous work, the project was carried out in a multicenter randomized controlled study,in which the stable stage of COPD patients were included in different ways of pulmonary rehabilitation training, a comprehensive clinical assessment will be conducted before and after training. Compared with the traditional evaluation methods and standard esophageal diaphragmatic electromyography, surface EMGdi detect the changes of neural respiratory drive in patients with COPD,that can help to explore the application value of surface EMGdi in the assessment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with pulmonary rehabilitation, to provide a basis for the promotion of the diaphragm and the optimization of pulmonary rehabilitation program.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Surface EMGdi Evaluate the Efficacy of Pulmonary Rehabilitation in Patients With COPD: a Multi Center Prospective Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The patients with COPD will participate in a rehabilitation program for 52 weeks. Participants in the proposed study will be randomly programmed into one of four intervention groups: 1. Neither cycle training nor inspiratory muscle training. 2. Cycle training program alone (performing on calibrated stationary cycle ergometer). 3. Inspiratory muscle training alone (performing on threshold loading device). 4. Combined cycle training and inspiratory muscle training(performing on calibrated stationary cycle ergometer and threshold loading device).</detailed_description>
