	<brief_summary>This PAR (participatory action research) study to improve antibiotic prescribing quality in a GPC (general practitioner cooperative) during OOH-care (out-of-hours-care) uses a mixed methods approach using qualitative as well as quantitative techniques. In a first exploratory phase we will work on partnership development and mapping the existing issues. In a second phase the focus will be on facilitating change and implementing interventions through PDSA (plan do study act) cycles. In a third phase outcomes on prescribing quality during and outside office hours will be evaluated. Equally important is the process evaluation and theory building on improving antibiotic prescribing through PAR.</brief_summary>
