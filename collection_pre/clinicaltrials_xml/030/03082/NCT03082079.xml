	<brief_summary>Data are currently insufficient to guide the management of very small gastrointestinal stromal tumors（GISTs）（&lt; 2 cm) discovered incidentally on endoscopy,this study is designed to collect the medical records of patients in different treatment group with long-term follow-up data,and attempts to evaluate the usefulness of regular endoscopic ultrasound（EUS）surveillance and the necessity,safety and feasibility of endoscopic submucosal dissection（ESD）for small GISTs,thus provide evidence for the revision of the guideline.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Long Outcome of Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection for Small Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors (&lt;2cm)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTION:to evaluate the usefulness of regular endoscopic ultrasound（EUS） surveillance and the necessity,safety and feasibility of endoscopic submucosal dissection（ESD） for small GISTs(&lt;2cm),thus providing evidences for the revision of the guideline. OUTLINE:This is a randomized controlled trial. Eligible patients are divided into 2 group with 45 in each.The experimental group undergo ESD for GISTs,while the investigators do no treatment to the control group.Then,the 2 groups will be follow up for 5 years.All data are analysed with the Statistical Product and Service Solutions（SPSS）statistical software.</detailed_description>
