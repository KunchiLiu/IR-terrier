	<brief_summary>This is a non interventional prospective study. Centers will enroll adult participants with partial onset seizures with or without secondary generalisation for whom the clinician has decided to initiate ESL as an adjunctive therapy prior to the decision to take part in this study. Participants to be enrolled into the study will receive eslicarbazepine acetate (ESL) either as an adjunctive therapy to one baseline antiepileptic drug (AED) or to at least two baseline AEDs. Participants will be seen at baseline and at a follow-up visit after approximately 6 months to assess retention, efficacy, tolerability, quality of life (optional), and cognitive performances (optional).</brief_summary>
