This study will also describe the epidemiological features for the disease for the enrolled patients.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Subjects willing to sign the informed consent form (ICF) 2. Female subjects 18 years of age or older 3. Have histologically confirmed diagnosis of Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) ovarian epithelial, primary peritoneal cancer made by one or more of the following: 1. Standard staging laparotomy including bilateral salpingooophorectomy,omentectomy, and lymph node sampling and debulking and/or 2. Surgical resection and radiographic evidence consistent with ovarian cancer 3. Paracentesis or biopsy with radiographic evidence consistent with ovarian cancer(normal appearing pancreas, liver, and gastrointestinal tract). 4. Have availability of paraffinembedded archived tumor tissue block (preferred) or, if a block is not possible, a minimum of twenty 10um sections. Patients who meet any of the following criteria are ineligible to participate in the study and hence will not be consented: 1. The diagnosis is not of a primary ovarian cancer; thus, patients will be excluded if a previous cancer has metastasized to the ovary, or if there is a secondary malignancy that is associated with the ovarian cancer. 2. Is not able or willing to provide written informed consent. 3. Have a diagnosis of other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric conditions that may increase the risk associated with study participation or may interfere with the interpretation of the study. 4. Be a patient who, in the judgment of the Investigator, would be inappropriate for enrollment in this study. A rationale will be documented for all patients who are screened and ultimately excluded from the study as a result of meeting any of the aforementioned exclusion criteria</criteria>
