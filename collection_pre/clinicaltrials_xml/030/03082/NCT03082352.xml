	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to compare the bioavailability of a generic product of metoprolol with that of a reference product when administered to healthy volunteers under fasting conditions. The test product is BF-Metoprolol Tablets 100mg manufactured by Bright Future Pharmaceuticals Factory O/B Bright Future Pharmaceutical Laboratories Limited and the reference product is Betaloc Tablet 100mg. The plasma kinetic data of metoprolol obtained from two formulations will be used to access the interchangeability of the products.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Bioequivalence Study on Two Metoprolol Tablet 100mg Formulations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study design is a single-dose, two-treatment, two-period, two-sequence cross over with a washout period of one to two weeks. Subject will be randomly assigned to two groups corresponding to two dosing sequences. Each subject will undergo two study (treatment) sessions, during which a single oral dose of 100mg metoprolol from either test or reference formulations will be administered. The estimated duration of subject's participation will be about 29-36 days (i.e. 3 weeks for screening and medication restraint, 1 day each for study (treatment) sessions I and II, 1 - 2 weeks as washout period. Venous blood samples will be collected at pre-dose (0h), and up to 24h post dose. The plasma concentrations of metoprolol will be determined by a validated assay. The non-compartmental method will be used to analyze the plasma concentration-time data and calculate the main pharmacokinetic parameters such as Cmax, Tmax, AUC0-last, AUC0-inf, and T1/2. ANOVA will be calculated on logarithmically transformed Cmax, AUC0-last and AUC0-inf. The two one sided tests will be used to calculate the 90% confidence intervals for the mean difference in AUC0-last, AUC0-inf and Cmax and to assess the bioequivalence of the two products</detailed_description>
