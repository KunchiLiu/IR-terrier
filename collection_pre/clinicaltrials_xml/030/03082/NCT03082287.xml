	<brief_summary>The ALPCO Calprotectin ELISA is an in vitro diagnostic test intended to quantitatively measure concentrations of fecal calprotectin in human stool samples. Calprotectin is a protein biomarker of mucosal inflammation. Measurement of calprotectin can aid in the diagnosis of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD), specifically Crohn's Disease (CD) and Ulcerative Colitis (UC), as well as aid in the differentiation of IBD from Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) when used in conjunction with other diagnostic testing and the total clinical picture. This study will estimate the predictive values of a negative (NPV) and positive (PPV) test by utilizing the assay outcomes of the ALPCO Calprotectin ELISA.</brief_summary>

Exclusion Criteria (IBD or IBS Subjects): patient under the age of 18 Patient taking NSAIDs Patients not presenting with signs or symptoms of IBS or IBD with the exception of 100 normal patients to be included in the study. Fifty (50) presenting for routine colonoscopy and 50 patients presenting with no disease symptoms and not scheduled for a colonoscopy. Patients not scheduled to have an colonoscopy unless enrolled in the study as normal population Exclusion Criteria (normal subjects): Unable or unwilling to provide a stool specimen. Have taken protein pump inhibitors (PPIs) or H2receptor antagonists for control of upper GI disease within the previous 2 weeks.
