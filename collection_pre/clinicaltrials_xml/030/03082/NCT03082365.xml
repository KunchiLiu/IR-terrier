	<brief_title>Oral Findings in Chronic Kidney Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will be held in the Nephrology units at the Kasr Al-Ainy Cairo university hospital. The data collected through the questionnaire will be obtained through an interview between the investigator and the patient. Clinical examination will be performed for both oral (soft tissue) and dental (hard) tissue. For patients undergoing dialysis, examination will be performed before dialysis therapy Selection bias: will be minimized by enrolling the participants in the study in a consecutive order of the entering the clinic. Non-respondent bias: will be minimized by explaining to the participants the aim of the study and their importance and role in the study. Incomplete records: will be excluded from statistical analysis with reporting the cause of not completing the record. Using a precision of 5, a design effect set at 1 with 90% CI (confidence interval), a total sample size of 250 pre-dialysis patients and 200 end stage renal disease patients will be sufficient. The sample size was calculated by Epi info software.The sample will be divided between two researchers; each researcher will have 50% of the whole sample to collect</detailed_description>
