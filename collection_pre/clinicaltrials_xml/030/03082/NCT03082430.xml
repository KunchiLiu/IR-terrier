	<brief_summary>This monocentric protocol is designed to evaluate the efficacy of therapeutic management of symptomatic knee osteoarthritis (resistant to medical first-line treatment) by intra-articular injection of autologous PRP prepared in the same procedure and using a dedicated CE marked medical device and a validated and reproducible method of preparation</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>GO PRP: Assessing the Efficacy of Intra Articular Injection of Platelets Rich Plasma for Gonarthrosis Treatment in Routine Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The main objective is to get a 50% proportion of responders defined by answers "absent" or "light" in the KOOS questionnaire on questions about pain and difficulty walking on flat ground. Secondary objectives include the safety validation of the use of PRP (prepared standardized manner by means of a given medical device) as second-line standard of care for osteoarthritis by the introduction of a systematic monitoring; and the feasibility of the health care system dedicated to the treatment of knee osteoarthritis by autologous PRP. Furthermore, the secondary objectives are to monitor and follow the evolution of pain (VAS) and the knee function (KOOS score) at 1 month, 3 months, 6 months. Evaluation of MRI will be performed within 15 days prior (inclusion visit) injection and 6 months to assess the cartilage thickness and visualize a regenerative effect.</detailed_description>
