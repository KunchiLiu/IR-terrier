	<brief_summary>The aim of our prospective multicenter study was to investigate the prognostic value of the acute and long-term changes of liver stiffness in patients receiving a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Role of SWE-change After TIPS in the Prediction of Prognosis After TIPS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We included 83 patients receiving TIPS for prevention of rebleeding, therapy-refractory ascites or both. Hemodynamic parameters were assessed before TIPS and after TIPS insertion. 16 patients from Freiburg underwent TE immediately before and after TIPS. In 67 patients from Bonn, SWE of liver and spleen, as well as clinical and biochemical parameters were assessed before TIPS, seven days and six weeks after TIPS.</detailed_description>
