	<brief_summary>The overarching goal of this research is to create a tool that could reduce suicide rates, increase delivery of efficacious suicide interventions, and decrease overall costs associated with suicidal behaviors. With this in mind, investigators intend to: (1) develop and scientifically validate a relational agent for suicidal patients that delivers Collaborative Assessment and Management of Suicidality (CAMS), an efficacious and cost-effective intervention developed by David Jobes, PhD; and (2) to create an integrated software system (CAMS Relational Agent System; CAMS-RAS) that assists medical personnel by synthesizing the CAMS intervention findings into an easy-to-interpret report, providing empirically-derived clinical decision support; (3) enhances the patient's coping capability by including psychoeducational skills training modules for use during and after hospitalization; and (4) automates the delivery of caring contacts, an efficacious and brief suicide prevention intervention provided after discharge. The focus of participant recruitment will be Emergency Departments (EDs), often the initial point of contact and where personnel must make the decision whether to hospitalize or discharge the suicidal patient. Investigators will also conduct testing in other medical and outpatient mental health settings to ensure public health impact and commercial success. Phase I project aims include: (1) creating an advisory board to guide the development of CAMS-RAS; (2) iteratively design and develop relational agent ("Dr. Dave") modeled after the gestures, expressions, and mannerisms of CAMS treatment developer, David Jobes, PhD; and (3) conduct feasibility tests to determine whether CAMS-RAS is acceptable, easy to use, and liked by target end-users: acutely suicidal patients admitted to hospital EDs, psychiatric inpatient units, and medical floors for treatment of injuries sustained during a suicide attempt; hospital medical personnel, administrators, and other stakeholders including peer advocates; and outpatient suicidal patients, clinicians and administrators.</brief_summary>
