	<brief_title>An Intervention for Primary Caregivers to Improve Outcomes in Children With Severe Malnutrition</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Mortality rates remain high in hospitalized children with severe malnutrition and long-term impairments in child development exist in children that do survive. Hospitalized children with severe malnutrition will be allocated to an intervention or standard of care group in each one-week cycle. The intervention package consists of a counseling and support program that includes three modules: 1) psychosocial stimulation; 2) nutrition and feeding; and 3) water, sanitation and hygiene. Assessments will be done at baseline (t=0) and follow-up (t=6 months). The primary outcome is child development, which will be assessed using the Malawi Developmental Assessment Tool, a validated tool for gross and fine motor, language, and social development.</detailed_description>
