	<brief_summary>The investigators aimed at investigating the effects of thyroidectomy on tracheal anatomy and airflow in patients with benign nodular goiter, employing a prospective observational study. Magnetic resonance images of the neck and respiratory flow-volume curves were performed prior to and six months following surgery. Tracheal and thyroid volumes, smallest cross-sectional area of the trachea (SCAT), tracheal narrowing, tracheal deviation and tracheal encirclement by the thyroid were evaluated. Through flow-volume curves respiratory function, including both in- and expiration, was evaluated.</brief_summary>
