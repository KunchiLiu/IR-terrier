	<brief_summary>Malignant gliomas have a very poor prognosis with median survival measured in months rather than years. It is a disease in great need of novel therapeutic approaches. Based on the encouraging results of our preclinical studies which demonstrate improved efficacy without added toxicity, the paradigm of delivering a novel oncolytic adenovirus via a neural stem cell line in combination with radiation and chemotherapy is well-suited for evaluation in newly diganosed malignant gliomas. The standard-of-care allows application of virotherapy as neoadjuvant therapy and assessment of the cooperative effects with radiation/chemotherapy without altering the standard treatment.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients must have presumed malignant glioma based on clinical and radiologic evaluation (pathologic confirmation of malignant glioma must be made at the time of stereotactic biopsy or resection prior to NSCCRAdSpk7 injection; if this is not possible, the injection will not be performed and the subject will no longer be eligible for the study). Tumor must be accessible for injection and must not be located in the brainstem, or contained within the ventricular system. Planning to undergo standard radiation/chemotherapy 18 years of age or older. Performance status must be KPS â‰¥ 70 SGOT (AST) &lt; 3x upper limit of normal Serum creatinine &lt; 2mg/dl Platelets &gt; 100,000/mm3 and WBC &gt; 3000/mm3 Prior or ongoing liver disease including known cirrhosis, hepatitis B or C infection but not to exclude patients with a distant history of resolved hepatitis A infection. Immunosuppressive drugs (with exception of corticosteroid). Known HIV+ patients. Acute infections (viral, bacterial or fungal infections requiring therapy). Pregnant or breastfeeding patients. Evidence of metastatic disease or other malignancy (except squamous or basal cell skin cancers). Prior radiation therapy to the brain or prior treatment for brain tumor Other serious comorbid illness or compromised organ function.</criteria>
