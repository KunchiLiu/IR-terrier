	<brief_title>International Multicenter Study of the Immunogenicity of Medicinal Product GamEvac-Combi</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This clinical trial is designed as a double blind randomized placebo-controlled study to evaluate immunogenicity of medicinal product GamEvac-Combi - Combined Vector-Based Vaccine against Ebola Virus Disease, 0.5 ml+0.5 ml/dose. The study includes three periods: screening, administration of the investigated product and follow-up. Vaccine will be administered to groups of volunteers (each group will include not more than 40 volunteers at a time; a new group of volunteers cannot be hospitalized before the earlier vaccinated volunteers are discharged from the hospital. In total, 8 visits will be held, including a screening visit; two of the visits will take place during the inpatient stage and six - during the outpatient observation. Study design in the both facilities will be the same for all volunteers, except that the biomaterial collected for immunogenicity evaluation from volunteers included in the study in the Russian Federation will be delivered directly to the testing laboratory; biomaterial from volunteers included in the study in the Republic of Guinea will undergo primary specimen processing, be frozen and stored under the assigned temperature conditions in the research center and, as biomaterial is accumulated, it will be transported in a fridge to the study site. In addition, laboratory tests for such concomitant infectious diseases, as yellow fever, Denge fever, Ebola and Marburg virus diseases will be carried out for epidemiological indications (i.e. in the endemic regions if disease cases are reported).</detailed_description>
