	<brief_title>Corticosteroid Injection in Carpal Tunnel Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, single-blinded randomized controlled study to determine the efficacy of low dose corticosteroid in patient with CTS. Patient with CTS were randomly assigned to group receiving ultrasound guided steroid injection with different dosage of triamcinolone acetonide (Shincort) mixed, 1ml 10mg (10mg/ml) or 1ml 40mg (40mg/ml) with 1 ml of 2% lidocaine hydrochloride. The follow up at 6 and 12 weeks includes Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire, nerve conductive study and VAS pain score.</detailed_description>
