	<brief_summary>DHANI-2 is an extension to DHANI (NCT01580345) which proposes to extend maternal supplementation (DHA or Placebo) from &lt;20 weeks of gestational age through 6 months postpartum and infant follow-up through 12 months. Leveraging the RCT design, DHANI-2 aims to assess the role of maternal DHA supplementation on infant neurodevelopment and body growth. It also intends to enhance the mechanistic understanding by the addition of repeated biochemical measures from mother-child dyads.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Maternal DHA Supplementation and Offspring Neurodevelopment in India (DHANI-2)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A double-blinded, randomized, placebo controlled trial would be conducted among pregnant women in India to test the effectiveness of supplementing pregnant Indian women with 400 mg/d algal DHA compared to placebo from mid-pregnancy through delivery. Eligible participants would be randomized to receive either 400 mg of DHA or a placebo baseline measures would be taken before the enrollment of the participant in the study. The mother-child dyads would be followed through infant age 1 year and anthropometric measurements and biochemical investigations would be used to assess the effect of maternal DHA supplementation on infant neurodevelopment at ages 6- and 12-months using validated the Development Assessment Scale for Indian Infants (DASII).</detailed_description>
	<criteria>18 to 35 year old pregnant women (singleton) at &lt;=20 weeks of gestation (calculated from the LMP by study physician). Willing to participate in the study and perform all measurements for self, husband and the offspring including anthropometry, dietary assessment, questionnaires and biological samples (blood and breast milk). Willing to provide signed and dated informed consent. Women allergic (if aware) to any of the test products. Women at high risk for hemorrhagic bleeding, clotting (if aware). Women with highrisk pregnancies (history and prevalence of pregnancy complications, including abruptio placentae, preeclampsia, pregnancyinduced hypertension, any serious bleeding episode in the current pregnancy, and/ or physician referral); and/or diagnosed chronic degenerative disease(s) such as diagnosed heart disease, cancer, stroke or diabetes (as omega3 could raise blood sugar and lower insulin production). Women consuming omega3 supplements or having used these in 3 months preceding the intervention period. Reported participation in another biomedical trial 3 months before the start of the study or during the study (not to get the results of the present study contaminated).</criteria>
