	<brief_summary>The Beijing Hospital Atherosclerosis Study (BHAS) is a prospective, single-center, observational cohort study performed at the Beijing Hospital in Beijing, China. Subjects enrolled in this study will be the consecutive patients undergoing coronary angiography in the hospital. Blood samples are taken immediately before the angiographic procedure. Clinical and angiographic characteristics are recorded. All patients will have routine follow-up at 6 months and 1 year postprocedure, then yearly thereafter. Follow-up includes mortality, myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, rehospitalization, coronary revascularization procedures, life styles, and medication use. The primary end point for the study will be the major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), defined as death from any cause, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke and revascularization. This study has been reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee of Beijing Hospital. All enrolled individuals will be received written notice of the intended use of their blood samples and provided written consent. The major objectives of the BHAS Study are to (1) establish a prospective cohort and a biological sample bank in ethnic Chinese with coronary angiography, (2) identify baseline new biosignature profiles such as novel biomarkers via metabolomics approach associated with the subsequent clinical events, (3) assess the use of molecular profiles from multiple platforms (eg, genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics) integrated with readily available clinical information for improved risk classification for cardiovascular events, and (4) provide clearer understanding of underlying disease processes.</brief_summary>
