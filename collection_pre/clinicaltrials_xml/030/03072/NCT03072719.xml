	<criteria>Inclusion Demonstrates understanding of the study and willingness to participate Aged at least 18 to 65 years Understands and is willing, able and likely to comply with all study procedures and restrictions Good general health with (in the opinion of the investigator) no clinically significant and relevant abnormalities of medical history or oral examination. Selfreported history of dentinal hypersensitivity lasting more than 6 months but not more than 10 years Minimum of 20 natural teeth at screening, a minimum of two accessible teeth (incisors, canines, premolars) At baseline, participant has two nonadjacent sensitive teeth from those meeting the EAR, GI and mobility criteria at screening, with sensitivity measured by tactile stimulus (Yeaple ≤ 20g) and evaporative (air) assessment (Schiff Sensitivity Score ≥ 2) at baseline Exclusion Pregnant or breastfeeding women Known or suspected intolerance or hypersensitivity to the study materials (or closely related compounds) or any of their stated ingredients. Participation in another clinical study or receipt of an investigational drug within 30 days of the screening visit Recent history (within the last year) of alcohol or other substance abuse An employee of the sponsor or the study site or members of their immediate family Presence of chronic debilitating disease which, in the opinion of the investigator, could affect study outcomes. Any condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, causes xerostomia Dental prophylaxis within 4 weeks of screening Tongue or lip piercing or presence of dental implants Professional desensitising treatment within 12 weeks of screening Gross periodontal disease, treatment of periodontal disease (including surgery) within 12 months of screening, scaling or root planning within 3 months of screening. Teeth bleaching within 12 weeks of screening Tooth with evidence of current or recent caries, or reported treatment of decay in 12 months of screening Tooth with exposed dentine but with deep, defective or facial restorations, teeth used as abutments for fixed or removable partial dentures, teeth with full crowns or veneers, orthodontic bands or cracked enamel. Sensitive teeth with contributing aetiologies other than erosion, abrasion or recession of exposed dentine Sensitive tooth not expected to respond to treatment with an overthe counter dentifrice in the opinion of the investigator. Use of a desensitising dentifrice within six weeks of screening (participant will be required to bring their current dentifrice to the site in order to verify the lack of known antisensitivity ingredients) Daily doses of a medication which, in the opinion of the investigator, could interfere with the perception of pain Currently taking antibiotics or have taken antibiotics within 2 weeks of baseline. Daily doses of a medication which, in the opinion of the investigator, causes xerostomia Individuals who require antibiotic prophylaxis for dental procedures Any participant who, in the judgment of the investigator, should not participate in the study.</criteria>
