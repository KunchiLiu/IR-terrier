Cytologic or fineneedle aspiration samples are not acceptable. Tumor tissue from bone metastases that is subject to decalcification is not acceptable. A valid PTEN IHC result (per central testing) (e.g., participants with an "invalid" or "failed" PTEN IHC result are not permitted to enroll) Metastatic disease documented prior to randomization by bone lesions on bone scan or soft tissue disease by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) Asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic form of prostate cancer Progressive disease before initiating study treatment Ongoing androgen deprivation with gonadotropinreleasing hormone (GnRH) analog or bilateral orchiectomy, with serum testosterone &lt; 50 ng/dL (&lt; 2.0 nmol/L) within 28 days before randomization Inability or unwillingness to swallow whole pills History of malabsorption syndrome or other condition that would interfere with enteral absorption Clinically significant history of liver disease consistent with ChildPugh Class B or C, including cirrhosis, current alcohol abuse, or current known active infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) Need for current chronic corticosteroid therapy (&gt; 10 mg/day of prednisone or an equivalent dose of other antiinflammatory corticosteroids) Active infection requiring intravenous (IV) antibiotics within 14 days before Day 1, Cycle 1 Immunocompromised status because of current known active infection with HIV or because of the use of immunosuppressive therapies for other conditions Major surgical procedure or significant traumatic injury within 28 days prior to Day 1, Cycle 1, or anticipation of the need for major surgery during study treatment History of ventricular dysrhythmias or risk factors for ventricular dysrhythmias, such as structural heart disease (e.g., severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction, left ventricular hypertrophy), coronary heart disease (symptomatic or with ischemia demonstrated by diagnostic testing), myocardial infarction or atrial thrombotic events within the past 6 months, severe unstable angina, New York Heart Association Class III and IV heart disease or depressed left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF; &lt; 50%), clinically significant electrolyte abnormalities (e.g., hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia), or family history of sudden unexplained death or long QT syndrome Current treatment with medications that are well known to prolong the QT interval History of other malignancy within the previous 5 years, except for appropriately treated nonmelanoma skin carcinoma, or participants who have undergone potentially curative therapy with no evidence of disease and are deemed by the treating physician to be at low risk for recurrence Any other diseases, cardiovascular, pulmonary, or metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding, or clinical laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition that contraindicates the use of an investigational drug or that may affect the interpretation of the results or renders the participants at high risk from treatment complications.
