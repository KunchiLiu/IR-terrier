	<brief_summary>N-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids(N-3 PUFAs) is important in balancing the immune function and physical health by reducing membrane arachidonic acid (AA) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) synthesis, which might be linked to the somatic manifestations physical morbidity, such as Cardiovascular disease in depression. n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids appears to be a promising treatment that is safe, beneficial to patients with Cardiovascular disease and depression. In this proposal, investigators aim the test the hypothesis that n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids will be more effective than placebo in treating Cardiovascular disease patients with major depression after 12 weeks of intervention.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Omega-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids on Major Depressive Disorder in Patients With Cardiovascular Diseases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a 3-year study and a randomized, double-blind, and placebo controlled Clinical the study. investigators plan to enroll 60 subjects from cardiovascular department of China Medical University Hospital.Participants will be randomized into omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids or placebo group.The intervention period is 12 weeks. Evaluation of the depressive symptoms ( using Hamilton Depression Scale, HAM-D, and Beck Depression Inventory, BDI ) of the subjects who are enrolled into the study will take place at â€”1st, 0, 2nd, 4th, 8th, 12th week. The plasma level of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, chemokines/cytokines, and Electrocardiogram will also be measured at the beginning and at the end of the study.</detailed_description>
