	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate teriparatide (TP) as a chondroregenerative therapy for human knee osteoarthritis (OA). The central hypothesis to be tested is that TP supports structural modification of the joint and improves biomarker, functional and patient-reported measures of knee OA.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Teriparatide as a Chondroregenerative Therapy in OA</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, randomized, placebo controlled, double blinded, crossover study. The investigators will identify, recruit and enroll 80 subjects with symptomatic, unilateral medial compartment knee OA. Enrolled subjects will be randomized into equal TP (in the FDA approved form, Forteo) or placebo arms of 40 subjects each (includes allowance for a 25% dropout rate with no replacements). All subjects will be treated for 24 weeks, then followed for an additional 24 weeks to assess the durability of any observed effects. The trial incorporates a crossover design, based on interim analysis of the 24 week outcome data after every subject has completed the 24 week treatment period. If positive effects on structural and/or biomarker measures are apparent from the interim analysis, placebo treated subjects will be offered TP (in the FDA approved form, Forteo) and followed for an additional 24 weeks. If the placebo subjects who choose to participate in the crossover treatment have not yet completed the 48 week visit, it will not occur. These subjects will begin the crossover portion 24 week treatment and monitoring period when they receive the TP pens (in the FDA approved form, Forteo).</detailed_description>
