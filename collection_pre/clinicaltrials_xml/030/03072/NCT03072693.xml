	<brief_summary>Background: Despite the advances in pharmacological management of heart failure (HF), the associated mortality and re-hospitalization for HF remain poor. This is at least partly due to suboptimal early discharge care, delayed detection of HF complications, and underutilization and under-dosing of evidence-based HF medications. Mobile technology has revolutionized inter-personal communication allowing instantaneous, multi-directional, and massive data transfer. Nonetheless the potential of these enhanced communications have not been fully explored in the management of patients with HF. Objective: To explore the potential of state-of-the-art mobile technology for home-based remote HF management in order to reduce HF mortality and HF re-hospitalization. Study Design: This will be a multicenter, randomized controlled clinical trial in patients with HF and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) who are discharged from hospital following an episode of acutely decompensated HF. The clinical effectiveness of a physician-directed patient self-management strategy based on remotely collected physiological data obtained from home-based and wearable devices will be compared with two control groups who will receive the home-based remote HF management system without activation or routine therapy. In the interventional arm, there will be three modes of home-based HF management: (1) Early discharge mode to optimize volume status; (2) Drug escalation mode to ensure the utilization of evidence-based medications at the maximum tolerated dose; and (3) Maintenance mode to ensure medication compliance and early detection of complications such as acutely decompensated HF and atrial fibrillation. The trial will enroll up to 876 patients with LVEF &lt;40% who are discharged from hospital after an episode of acutely decompensated HF. Randomization to the intervention group or control groups will be in a 1:1:1 ratio with follow-up for 1 year. The primary outcome will be a composite of cardiovascular death and HF hospitalization within 1 year. Summary: DAVID-HF will provide essential information about the role of home-based, remote heart failure monitoring that will incorporate instantaneous physician-directed patient-self management in the long-term management of HF patients.</brief_summary>
