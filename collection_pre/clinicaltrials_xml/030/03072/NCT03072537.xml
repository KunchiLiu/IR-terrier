	<brief_summary>CrescNet is a network of Primary care physicians and pediatricians (n=221) and endocrinological treatment centers (n=31), established in Leipzig in 1998, whose aim is to improve the early detection of growth disorders. Secondary to this clinical aim, epidemiological analyses on secular trends of growth data of children are performed.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CrescNet - Wachstumsnetzwerk [Growth Monitoring Network]</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pediatricians participating in CrescNet provide pseudonymized data on patients' height, weight, and head circumferences to the CrescNet database. Following automatized filter algorithms and subsequent evaluation by a pediatric endocrinologist, the primary care physician will be informed about abnormal growth pattern. CrescNet does not have direct access to patients or personal patient data. Each participating pediatrician receives a quarterly screening report with recommendations for the work-up of children with abnormal growth or abnormal development of weight or body mass index. The entire data set can be used for scientific purposes.The collection of data from healthy children allows the generation of evidence based statements about prevalence rates of growth disorders and also about the rates in disorders of weight development. For this, data are provided completely anomynized without allowing conclusions on personal patient data.</detailed_description>
