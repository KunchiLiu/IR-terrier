	<brief_summary>Approximately 80 male and female patients with documented solid tumor malignancies of epithelial origin that are locally advanced or metastatic, and either refractory to standard therapy or for whom no standard therapy is available, will be entered into this Phase 1a/2a, multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation, cohort study of AVID100, an anti-human EGFR monoclonal antibody (mAb) linked to the maytansinoid DM1. The initial Phase 1a Dose-Escalation portion of the trial (approximately 30 patients) is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability, as well as identify the DLT(s), MTD, and RP2D of sequential escalating doses of AVID100 (study drug), when administered to patients with tumors reasonably likely to express EGFR; secondary objectives include characterization of the PK profile of total antibody (AVID100 plus MAB100), AVID100, and DM1, as well as preliminary assessment of the antineoplastic activity of AVID100. Once the MTD and/or RP2D is identified, 3 expansion cohorts of patients (approximately 50 patients total) with measureable disease and confirmed EGFR-positive tumors (tumor types to be determined) will be accrued during the subsequent Phase 2a Dose-Expansion portion of the trial where the goal will be to further evaluate the safety, tolerability, and antineoplastic activity of AVID100 when administered at the RP2D; a secondary objective is to further characterize the PK profile of total antibody, AVID100, and DM1 (PK evaluation will be less extensive in Phase 2a when compared to Phase 1a). An exploratory objective in both the Phase 1a and Phase 2a portions of the trial will be evaluation of the utility of potential biomarkers and response predictors of AVID100 activity in FFPE tumor tissue (optional in Phase 1a patients, required in Phase 2a patients). Patients will be treated and followed on an outpatient basis throughout the trial, unless hospitalization is required for other reasons, or to assure patient safety.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>AVID100 in Advanced Epithelial Carcinomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>On Day 1 of study, patients will receive study drug administered by 1-hour IV infusion in a fixed 100 mL volume. AVID100 will be administered once every 3 weeks (Q3W) with administration on Day 1 of the first week, followed by a 3-week recovery period. This 3 week (21 day) period will be considered Cycle 1. In Phase 1a, determinations regarding cohort escalation, DLTs, and MTD will be based on the toxicities observed during this initial cycle. Patients must receive their full planned dose of AVID100, plus complete the designated follow-up period, in order to be considered evaluable for tolerability, unless dose reduction, interruption, or discontinuation was the result of a DLT. In all patients entered, a minimum of at least Cycle 1 of study will be completed, if tolerated, after which, in the absence of documented disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, a patient may continue to receive additional cycles of study drug Q3W (+ 2 days), at the same dose and infusion duration established for the patient during Cycle 1, and on the same schedule. These additional 3 week cycles may continue, if tolerated and in the absence of documented disease progression, at the Investigator's discretion, provided specified retreatment criteria have been met. Evidence of progressive disease at any point in the study will necessitate withdrawal of the patient from further participation so that alternative management of their malignancy may be considered.</detailed_description>
