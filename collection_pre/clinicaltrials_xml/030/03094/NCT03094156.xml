	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study was to To investigate whether the administration of BIA 6-512 (25 mg, 50 mg, 75 mg and 100 mg) at steady-state affects the pharmacokinetics of levodopa when administered in combination with a single-dose of immediate release levodopa/benserazide 200/50 mg or with a single-dose of immediate release levodopa/benserazide 200/50 mg plus a single-dose of entacapone 200 mg.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of BIA 6-512 at Steady-state on the Levodopa Pharmacokinetics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Single centre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, rising multiple-dose study in four sequential groups of healthy male and female subjects. Eligible subjects were admitted to the Human Pharmacology Unit (UFHBIAL - Portela &amp; Cª, SA) on the day prior to receiving the first study medication. Starting in the morning of Day 1 (first dose), subjects received BIA 6-512/Placebo thrice-daily until the morning of Day 5 (last dose). Concomitantly with the morning dose of BIA 6-512/Placebo, on Day 4 a levodopa/benserazide 200/50 mg (Madopar® 250) single-dose was administered. On Day 5, a Madopar® 250 single-dose and a entacapone 200 mg (Comtan®) single-dose were administered concomitantly with the morning dose of BIA 6-512/Placebo. In the morning of Day 4 and Day 5, products were administered in fasting of at least 8 hours and subjects remained fasted until 2 h post-dose. Subjects were resident in the UFH from admission (Day 0) until at least 24 h post last dose (Day 6); then, they were discharged and returned for the follow-up visit.</detailed_description>
