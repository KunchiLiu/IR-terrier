	<brief_summary>The proposal is a phase II clinical study designed to assess the feasibility of durvalumab (MEDI4736) in HIV-1-infected individuals with solid tumors. Additionally, to obtain data that lets understand the possible benefit of this treatment in cancer patients and HIV infection, exploring if activity of durvalumab (MEDI4736) could be higher in cancer that has been produced at least in part due to the chronic immunosupression. Simultaneously, it will allow us to investigate the effect of disrupting this immunoregulatory pathway might have in reversing cancer pathways and HIV-specific T-cell function during persistent chronic HIV infection in humans.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Durvalumab in Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PD-1/ PD-L1 coinhibitory pathway plays a significant role in the regulation of the immune response in both chronic infectious diseases and cancer. Preclinical and animal data support the safety and promising activity of anti-PD-1 antibody in HIV-1 infection. Demonstrated anticancer activity and safety profile of durvalumab (MEDI4736) in cancer clinical trials. Unlikely drug interactions of durvalumab (MEDI4736) and antiretroviral treatments. The proposal is a phase II clinical study designed to assess the feasibility of durvalumab (MEDI4736) in HIV-1-infected individuals with solid tumors. Additionally, to obtain data that lets understand the possible benefit of this treatment in cancer patients and HIV infection, exploring if activity of durvalumab (MEDI4736) could be higher in cancer that has been produced at least in part due to the chronic immunosupression. Simultaneously, it will allow us to investigate the effect of disrupting this immunoregulatory pathway might have in reversing cancer pathways and HIV-specific T-cell function during persistent chronic HIV infection in humans. In this regard, our hypothesis is: HIV patients with cancer have a similar outcome in terms of tolerability when treated with durvalumab (MEDI4736) monotherapy at the recommended dose than non HIV infected patients.</detailed_description>
