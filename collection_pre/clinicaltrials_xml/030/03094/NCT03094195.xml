Patients must have documented past and/or ongoing inadequate treatment response (having insufficient pain relief with treatment or inability to tolerate) to at least 2 different prescribed therapies commonly used to treat and considered effective by the Investigator for the treatment of PHN.

Patients who have a known diagnosis of diabetes and are stable on medication with a hemoglobin A1c &gt; 8%. Those who do not have a known diagnosis of diabetes with a hemoglobin A1c &gt; 7%. Have previously received herpes zoster vaccine Patient is unwilling or unable to complete daily eDiary Other protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
