	<brief_title>Does Dexamethasone Administration Improve Recovery In Patients Undergoing Minimally Invasive Sacrocolpopexy?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There has been a public outcry regarding the continuing rise of health care expenditures. In 1997, the estimated costs of surgery for pelvic organ prolapse (POP) were $ 100.1 million. It is important to identify interventions that would improve the QoR in this patient population and to speed-up postoperative recovery. As most of these surgeries are performed in an outpatient manner as a 23 hour observation, improved recovery may also speed discharge and free-up valuable hospital resources. Patients will receive either Dexamethasone or placebo ( normal saline) at the time of induction of general anesthesia. QoR questionnaires, Pain scale and postoperative nausea and vomiting scale (PONV).</detailed_description>
