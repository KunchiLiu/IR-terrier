	<brief_summary>Comorbid depression and multiple medical conditions in older adults are a serious public health problem. As an important facilitator of health-related activities, families are already involved in various aspects of self-management of chronic disease in older adults. Despite the benefits they provide, informal caregiving activities currently are organized outside the medical system, which potentially creates redundant or misaligned efforts.The purpose of the mentored research is to examine the feasibility and acceptability of the FACE-PC, a theory-driven, multi- component, technology-assisted interdisciplinary team-based care model that systematically involves family in chronic disease management. It aims to optimize the patient and family's collective ability to self-manage chronic disease.</brief_summary>
