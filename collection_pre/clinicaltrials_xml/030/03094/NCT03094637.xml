	<brief_title>Azacitidine and Pembrolizumab for Patients With Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration: Each study cycle is 4 weeks (28 days). - Participant will receive azacitidine either by vein over about 10-40 minutes or as an injection under the skin on Days 1-7 of each cycle. - Participant will receive pembrolizumab by vein over about 30 minutes on Day 1 of Cycle 1, and then every 3 weeks after that. Length of Study: Participant will receive the study drugs for as long as the doctor thinks is in participant's best interest. Participant will no longer be able to take the study drugs if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if participant is unable to follow study directions. Participation on the study will be over after the long-term follow-up period. Study Visits: On Day 1 of Cycle 1, or within 72 hours of the first dose of study drugs, if participant is able to become pregnant, blood (about 1 teaspoon) or urine will be collected for a pregnancy test. On Day 1 of Cycle 1 and then every 3 weeks after that, blood (about 2-3 teaspoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests before the dose of pembrolizumab. On Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of Cycle 1 and Day 1 of every cycle after that: - Participant will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 2-3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests. Between Days 22-28 of Cycles 1 and 3 and then 1 time every 3 cycles after that, participant will have a bone marrow biopsy and aspirate to check the status of the disease and for cytogenetic testing. If participant's doctor thinks it is needed, at any point in the study, participant may have additional bone marrow biopsies and aspirations. End-of-Treatment Visit: Within 30 days of the last dose of the study drugs: - Participant will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 2-3 teaspoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests. Follow-Up: About 30 days after participant's last dose of study drugs, blood (about 2-3 teaspoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests. If participant stops taking the study drugs for any reason other than if the disease gets worse, every 12 weeks: - Participant will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 2-3 teaspoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests. - Participant will have a bone marrow biopsy and aspirate to check the status of the disease. If the disease gets worse and participant stops receiving the study drugs and begin receiving other treatment, participant will be called every 12 weeks until participant leaves the study, or until the end of the study, whichever occurs first. This is an investigational study. Pembrolizumab is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer. Azacitidine is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of MDS. The use of the study drugs in combination is investigational. The study doctor can explain how the study drugs are designed to work. Up to 40 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson Cancer Center.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Voluntary signed informed consent before performance of any study related procedure not part of normal medical care indicating that the patient is aware of the investigation and nature of this study in keeping with Institutional policies and with the understanding that the consent may be withdrawn with the subject at any time without prejudice to future medical care. 2. Intermediate 1 (INT1) or higher risk MDS defined by International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) criteria. 3. More or equal than 18 years of age at the time of signing consent. 4. Patients can or cannot have receive prior therapy with hypomethylating agent but will be allocated to specific patient cohorts based on their prior exposure. Patients that had received prior hypomethylating agent therapy should have at least received 6 cycles of therapy and not achieved any response or had progressed after any given number of cycles. 5. ECOG performance of 0 to 2. 6. Male patients, even if surgically sterilized, should agree to practice effective barrier contraception for the entire study treatment period and through 120 days after the last dose of the study treatment or agree to completely abstain from heterosexually intercourse. Female patients who are postmenopausal for at least one year before the screening visit or are surgical sterile or if they are of child bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within 72 hours of treatment of the start date and agree to practice two effective methods of contraception forms at the same time from the time of signing the informed consent through 120 days of the last dose of the study treatment or agree to completely abstain from heterosexual intercourse. 7. Willingness and ability to comply with scheduled visits treatment plans, laboratory tests and other study procedures. 8. Demonstrate adequate organ function as follows, all screening labs should be performed within 10 days of treatment initiation. Serum creatinine or measured or calculated creatinine clearance (GFR can also be used in place of creatinine or CrcL) &lt;/= 2.0 x upper limit of normal (ULN) or &gt;/= 60 mL/min for subject with creatinine levels &gt; 1.5 x institutional ULN. Creatinine clearance should be calculated per institutional standard. Serum total bilirubin &lt;/= 2.0 x ULN or direct bilirubin &lt;/= ULN for subjects with total bilirubin levels &gt; 1.5 ULN. AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) &lt;/= 2.5 x ULN or &lt;/= 5 x ULN for subjects with liver metastases. 9. Female subject of childbearing potential should have a negative urine or serum pregnancy within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study medication. If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required. 10. Female subjects of childbearing potential should be willing to use 2 methods of birth control or be surgically sterile, or abstain from heterosexual activity for the course of the study through 120 days after the last dose of study medication. Subjects of childbearing potential are those who have not been surgically sterilized or have not been free from menses for &gt; 1 year. 11. Male subjects should agree to use an adequate method of contraception starting with the first dose of study therapy through 120 days after the last dose of study therapy. 12.
