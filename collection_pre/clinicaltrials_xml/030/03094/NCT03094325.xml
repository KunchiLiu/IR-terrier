	<brief_summary>There is no current way to monitor the depth of surgical septal myectomy during the on-pump period in the OR. This is because the heart is empty of blood and TEE and epicardial imaging is impossible. A probe device used during in neurosurgery may make the surgical procedure more accurate and decrease complications of "too little myectomy" or "too much myectomy". It may decrease the need for reoperation which is currently a risk of myectomy 1-2%.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This pilot study uses an ultrasound probe that is currently clinically used to assess pituitary anatomy, the Hitachi-Aloka high resolution pituitary transducer to measure left ventricular (LV) septal thickness during cardiopulmonary bypass in the performance of surgical septal myectomy. Septal thickness will be assessed and can be visualized during the procedure and if it is likely to improve the efficacy and safety of the procedure. The probe has FDA clearance for a variety of intra-operative surgical procedures but will be off-label for this cardiac surgical protocol.</detailed_description>
