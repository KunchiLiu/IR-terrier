	<brief_summary>An appropriate balance of omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids is important for support of neurocognitive development in healthy infants and toddlers. In young children recovering from severe acute malnutrition (SAM), excess omega-6 intake depletes omega-3 fatty acid status. This research will evaluate how novel ready-to-use therapeutic foods (RUTF) with balanced fatty acids improve the metabolic and neurocognitive effects in young children in Malawi recovering from SAM, yielding new knowledge that also has implications for development of well-nourished children.</brief_summary>
