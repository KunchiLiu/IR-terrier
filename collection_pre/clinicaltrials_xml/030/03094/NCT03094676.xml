	<brief_summary>Performing physical exercise alters the body's homeostasis, and recuperative techniques seek to anticipate and potentiate the body's recovery. One of the ways to demonstrate a recovery of the organism is the resumption of autonomic cardiac modulation analyzed through heart rate variability (HRV), a method of global assessment of the behavior of the autonomic nervous system. Among the recovery techniques, massage is the most widely used technique in sports. Therefore, the objective of the study will be to measure the effects of massage as a recuperative technique on autonomic cardiac modulation at different moments of application. It will be a randomized clinical trial where there will be five stages of evaluation. In the first stage, the behavior of the baseline HRV will be evaluated, in the second stage the behavior of the HRV in front of the massage, in the third stage the behavior of the HRV in front of the stress protocol, in the fourth stage the HRV behavior after the stress protocol and immediately after Execution of the massage and finally in the 5th stage where the HRV behavior will be evaluated after the stress protocol and the massage application will be performed at the moment of HRV recovery. The stress protocol will be composed of squats followed by jumps and wingate test, and massage by slides in the anterior thighs and posterior trunk. The HRC indexes in the time domain, frequency domain and Poincar√© plot, as well as cardiorespiratory parameters and a questionnaire on individual touch perception will be analyzed. The descriptive statistical method will be used and comparisons of cardiorespiratory parameters and HRV indices will be performed using the analysis of variance technique for repeated measures model in the two factor scheme. The level of significance will be p &lt;0.05 for all tests.</brief_summary>
