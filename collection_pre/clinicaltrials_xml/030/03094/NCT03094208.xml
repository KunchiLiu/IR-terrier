	<brief_summary>The people with transfemoral amputation who use mechanical prosthesis will be include to this study. All participants will be assessed and then they will be randomly assigned to two groups. both groups will receive traditional balance trainnig. Study group will also receive dual task balance training. Training will take 4 weeks, 3 days a week. After the training program, both groups will be assessed again and the results will compare.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effects of Dual Task Balance Training In Individuals With Above Knee Amputation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The people who have transfemoral amputation may have poor balance and gait. Many people with lower limb loss report the need to concentration on gait. People with lower limb loss may need to use cognitive resources to monitor and control movements of the prosthetic limb. The need to concentrate on walking may be greater for those with transfemoral amputation. For examine the use of cognitive resources, dual task paradigm may use. Dual task rehabilitative training used in many patients like stroke, Multipl sclerosis osteoporosis. But there is no study about dual task training on amputation. The purpose of this randomized controlled study is to investigate the effects of dual-task balance training on balance and gait of patients with transfemoral amputation as compared with single-task balance training. We hypothesized that dual-task balance training would improve the balance and gait, it would be more effective than single-task balance training.</detailed_description>
