	<brief_summary>The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if inotuzumab ozogamycin can help to control the disease in patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). The safety of this treatment will also be studied.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Low Dose Inotuzumab Ozogamicin in Patients With Relapsed and Refractory CD22 Positive Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration: There are 28 (+/- 7) days in each cycle. If participant is found to be eligible to take part in this study, they will receive the study drug by vein over about 1 hour on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each cycle. If participant's doctor thinks it is needed, they may also receive drugs through a spinal tap (intrathecally) to help lower the risk of the disease coming back in the fluid surrounding their brain. Participant may be given other drugs to help decrease the risk of side effects. Participant's doctor will tell them about these drugs, how they will be given, and the possible risks. Length of Treatment: Participant may receive up to 6 cycles of treatment. Participant will no longer be able to take the study drugs if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if they are unable to follow study directions. If the disease gets worse after responding for at least 3 months, participant may be able to be retreated for up to 6 additional cycles. Participant will continue to have study visits as described above. The study doctor will discuss this option with participant. Participant is still at risk for side effects due to the study drug. This could also delay starting other treatments. The disease may also get worse to the point that participant is no longer able to receive other treatments. Study Visits: Before each treatment cycle, participant will have a physical exam. One (1) time weekly during Cycles 1-6, blood (about 2-3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests. On Days 14 and 21 of Cycle 1, then every 2-3 cycles, participant will have a bone marrow biopsy and/or aspiration. This is an investigational study. Inotuzumab ozogamycin is not FDA approved or commercially available. It is currently being used for research purposes only. Up to 48 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Patients at least 12 years of age. 2. Patients with a diagnosis of CD22positive ALL (ie, &gt;/=10% blasts CD22positive) based on local immunophenotyping and histopathology) who have: a.Refractory disease, defined as disease progression or no response while receiving their most recent prior anticancer therapy., b.Relapsed disease, defined as response to their most recent prior anticancer therapy with subsequent relapse. 3. Performance status of 0 to 3. 4. Adequate renal function including serum creatinine &lt;/= 2 x upper limit of normal (ULN) or estimated creatinine clearance &gt;/= 15 mL/min as calculated using the method standard for the institution. 5. Adequate liver function, including total serum bilirubin &lt;/= 1.5 x ULN unless the patient has documented Gilbert syndrome, and aspartate and alanine aminotransferase (AST or ALT) &lt;/= 2.5 x ULN. If organ function abnormalities are considered due to tumor, total serum bilirubin must be &lt;/= 2 x ULN 6. No active or coexisting malignancy requiring chemotherapy or radiation within 6 months. 1. Pregnant or nursing women 2. Known to be HIV+ 3. Ph+ ALL 4. Active and uncontrolled disease/infection as judged by the treating physician 5. Unable or unwilling to sign the consent form 6. Prior allogeneic stem cell transplantation (ASCT) or other antiCD22 immunotherapy within &lt;/= 4 months before first dose of study treatment. 7. Active CNS or extramedullary disease unless approved by the PI. 8. Monoclonal antibodies therapy within 2 weeks before study entry 9. Radiotherapy and cancer chemotherapy (except for intrathecal chemotherapy, hydroxyurea, and cytarabine. Cytarabine and hydroxyurea are allowed to be used emergently in case of leukocytosis) or any investigational drug within 2 weeks before study entry. 10. Evidence or history of venoocclusive disease (VOD) or sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS)</criteria>
