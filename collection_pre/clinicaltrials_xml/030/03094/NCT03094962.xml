	<brief_summary>The proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint is the second joint in the finger from the finger tip. The outcome following replacement surgery of this joint is considered unsatisfactory. In order to improve these outcomes, it would be helpful to understand the geometry of the joint, how it moves and the forces that are involved. This can be achieved using computer models that model the bones and the soft tissues - musculoskeletal models. In order to make these models as representative as possible, they should be generated using anatomical data. Data will initially be extracted from patients' existing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) scans. This will enable the computer model to begin being constructed. In parallel to the model initialisation, anatomical and motion data of the PIP joint of healthy volunteers will be collected. The necessary data will be collected using CT and MRI scans, as well as optical motion tracking methods. These data will then be used to populate the musculoskeletal model. Once the model is constructed, it will be used to simulate the motion of the joint and look at the effect of a simulated PIP joint replacement. This information should then provide insight as to how PIP joint replacements might be improved in future.</brief_summary>
