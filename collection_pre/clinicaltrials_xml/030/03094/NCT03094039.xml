	<brief_summary>This study aims to measure the cardio-respiratory physiological consequences of initiating resuscitation during placental transfusion (PT) with an intact umbilical cord in infants with congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH). PT, mainly via delayed cord clamping, has been shown to offer a higher circulating blood volume, less need for blood transfusion, less need for inotropes in infants. Currently infants with CDH receive immediate cord clamping (ICC) to facilitate immediate resuscitation including immediate intubation and mechanical ventilation. With the development of a resuscitation platform (iNSPiRE), resuscitative care can now be commenced from birth in infants with CDH to benefit from PT.</brief_summary>
