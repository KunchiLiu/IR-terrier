	<brief_summary>The present study aims at investigating (i) the feasibility in chronic stroke of using a dedicated virtual reality (VR) based system that embeds real-time 3D motion capture and embodied visual feedback to deliver functional exercises designed for training of impaired upper limb motor skills, (ii) whether chronic stroke survivors improve in functional outcomes in the upper limb when exposed to intensive VR-based therapy, and (iii) safety and tolerance to such a technology. The investigators hypothesize that intensive VR-based rehabilitation may lead to high rehabilitation doses and functional improvement in chronic stroke.</brief_summary>
