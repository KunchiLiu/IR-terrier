	<brief_summary>The project studies auditory deficits in congenital amusia at the behavioral and neurophysiological levels. The auditory processes investigated are pitch discrimination, short-term memory, sound-induced emotions. To characterize auditory deficits in the amusic population, neuropsychological assessments are combined with neurophysiological markers (Electro-encephalography: EEG, Magneto-encephalography: MEG, Magnetic Resonance Imaging: MRI).</brief_summary>
