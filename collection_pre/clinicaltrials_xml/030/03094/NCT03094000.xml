	<brief_summary>Bulimia Nervosa (BN), Binge Eating Disorder (BED) and Night Eating Syndrome (NES) are Binge Eating Disorders (BE-Dis) in which binge eating episodes are a main symptom. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is the leading evidence-based treatment for patients suffering from these disorders. CBT-E is an "enhanced" trans-diagnostic version of the treatment which appears to be more effective in a variety of Eating Disorders (EDs). The main goals of this treatment are reducing dietary restrictions and EDs symptoms as well as food intake regulation. Self-monitoring (SM) is an important and central tool in this type of treatment considered crucial for its success. Therefore, during treatment, patients are required to monitor their eating, the circumstances, and their thoughts and feelings proximate to the time of eating. Nevertheless, despite the importance of this tool, research has shown that there are many difficulties challenging the clients' adherence to SM, which might reduce this treatment's effectiveness and outcome. Additionally, in recent years there has been cumulative data supporting the use of mindfulness in the treatment of EDs. Mindfulness, as a western psychological approach, is defined as the "unique non-judgmental focus of one's attention at the present moment". Although SM requires the ability to observe, describe and identify occurrences, no studies have yet examined the direct effect of mindfulness skills on SM adherence, and therefore the improvement of treatment outcomes. The main objective of the present study is to examine the effect of a mindfulness based intervention on SM adherence during a CBT intervention for BE-Dis, and on the treatment outcomes as seen in the ED psychopathology and compliance to the nutritional instructions and food intake composition. Other aims include examining the differences between the experimental group and the control group, regarding their level of mindfulness and SM adherence. In addition, mediating and moderating processes between mindfulness and SM adherence will be examined.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Women between the ages of 1860 who meet the criteria for BN, BED or NES according to the DSMV. The participants will be recruited via convenience sampling among patients applying for treatment in the ED unit in "Hanotrim" outpatient clinic ("Shalvata" mental health center) and through internet advertising. Participation in the research program will be allowed only after evaluation and a diagnostic procedure to examine if the criteria for CBT are met in terms of diagnosis and motivational status. This procedure will be conducted through psychological and nutritional intake. Exclusion Criteria (contraindications to starting CBTE immediately): Current suicidal ideation Current substance/alcohol dependence or abuse Current psychosis Pregnancy (which began prior inclusion) Inability to attend treatment on a regular basis</criteria>
