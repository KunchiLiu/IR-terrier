	<brief_title>Efficacy of Pea Hull Fiber - Phase 2</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An 8-week randomized, cross-over study will be carried out to assess the efficacy of pea hull fiber. Participants will complete a 2-week baseline period during which appetite, stool frequency, and stool consistency (transit time) will be collected by paper questionnaire, and participants will collect a single stool. Dietary data (Automated Self-Administered 24-Hour) will be obtained bi-weekly at study appointment during the baseline period. Participants will be randomized on or about day 15 and consume snacks without pea hull fiber for a 2-week control period, and snacks with added pea hull fiber for a 2-week treatment period separated by a 2-week washout period. In both intervention periods, participants will complete daily questionnaires to assess stool frequency and consistency (transit time) and appetite twice per week. The GSRS will be competed at each study visit. The ASA24-Kids will be collected during the study visits at the end of the intervention periods. During washout periods, the same data will be collected as was done during the baseline and intervention periods. Participants will be asked to collect one stool during baseline and weeks 4,6, and 8 for a total of 4 stools. Stool samples will be analyzed for changes in the microbiota.</detailed_description>
