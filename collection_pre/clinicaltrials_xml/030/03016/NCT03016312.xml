	<brief_summary>This Phase III, multicenter, randomized, open-label study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of atezolizumab in combination with enzalutamide compared with enzalutamide alone in participants with mCRPC after failure of an androgen synthesis inhibitor (e.g., abiraterone) and failure of, ineligibility for, or refusal of a taxane regimen. Participants will receive treatment until investigator-assessed confirmed radiographic disease progression per Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 (PCWG3) criteria or unacceptable toxicity.</brief_summary>
