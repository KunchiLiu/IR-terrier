	<brief_summary>Ulcerative colitis is a common digestive system disease, the incidence is increasing in recent years.It is reported that the occurrence and development of ulcerative colitis is closely related to imbalance of intestinal flora .Moreover,intestinal mucosal immunity may be related to intestinal flora. Fecal microbiota transplantation as a new technology to rebuild intestinal flora has been used for several diseaseï¼Œbut the efficacy of ulcerative colitis by fecal microbiota transplantation needs to be further explored.</brief_summary>
