	<brief_summary>During cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass , pulmonary dysfunction remains to be a problem complicating the postoperative course of the patients.Remote ischemic preconditioning(RIPC) with transient upper limb ischemia/reperfusion is a novel, simple, cost-free,non-pharmacological and non-invasive strategy.Recent several trials suggested that RIPC could provide pulmonary protection by reducing serum biomarkers,however,whether the RIPC can improve the clinical outcomes in patients undergoing on-pump cardiac surgery,is still uncertain. The study hypothesis is: remote ischemic preconditioning will provide lung-protective effect and improve clinical outcomes in patients undergoing cardic surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Remote Ischemic Preconditioning on Pulmonary Injury in Cardic Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) protocol will be induced during anesthesia by 3 cycles of 5-min upper limb ischemia and 5-min reperfusion using a blood pressure cuff inflated to a pressure 200mmHg</detailed_description>
