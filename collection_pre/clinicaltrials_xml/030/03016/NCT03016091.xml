	<brief_title>A Trial of Pembrolizumab for Refractory Atypical and Anaplastic Meningioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multicenter, prospective, single arm, open label, interventional study. The goal of this study, is to evaluate feasibility and efficacy of pembrolizumab for the treatment of recurrent or progressive meningioma (WHO grades II-III) or hemangiopericytoma (HPC). All patients will receive IV pembrolizumab, at a dose of 200mg, every 3 weeks. Patients will be treated until disease progression or intolerable toxicity. Treatment can be stopped after one year of treatment in case of stable disease or completer response, with re-initiation of treatment upon progression. Expression of PD1 and PD-L1 will be tested, on tumor cells, using IHC staining on biopsy material obtained from previous surgeries. All patients will have a baseline neurologic and clinical exam, MRI scan, a brain dedicated CT-PET scan, a baseline cognitive exam and QOL assessment with a dedicated questionnaire. Patients will have a clinical and neurological exam every treatment cycle. MRI scan will be repeated after 2 months from the beginning of the trial drug administration and then every 2-3 months. There are no designated and specific criteria for response assessment in the treatment of meningioma. Therefore, response evaluation will be made using the RECIST 1.1 criteria, as used for solid tumors. The trial will allow the continuation of pembrolizumab in case of stable or improved clinical response, when pseudo-progression is suspected in the MRI. In addition, response assessment will also be made according to the RANO criteria, as used for high grade glioma. This will be compared to the RECIST evaluation, but will not be used for treatment decision making.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Be willing and able to provide written informed consent/assent for the trial. 2. Be 18 years of age on day of signing informed consent. 3. Have measurable disease based on RECIST 1.1. 4. Histologically, previously proven, grade II or III meningioma, HPC or classic radiographic features of a recurrent surgically inaccessible atypical or anaplastic meningioma. 5. All patients would have to have recurrence despite radiotherapy, unless radiotherapy is contraindicated. 6. No limit on the number of prior surgeries, radiation or radiosurgery treatments. 7. No limit on prior systemic therapies chemotherapy or biological agents. 8. Patients who received stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) are eligible without histologic documentation of recurrence if at least 6 months have passed from previous SRS treatment, and preferably, but not necessarily a 2ﬂuoro2deoxyDglucose PET imaging demonstrated hypermetabolism. 9. KPS≥50% 10. At least 4 weeks since any prior therapy. 11. Life expectancy of at least 4 months. 12. Dexamethasone use will be allowed up to a dose of 2mg per day. Steroids dose should be reduced or stopped 7 days prior to treatment with study drug. 13. Demonstrate adequate organ function as defined in Table 1, all screening labs should be performed within 10 days of treatment initiation. Table 1 Adequate Organ Function Laboratory Values Hematological Absolute neutrophil count (ANC)≥1,500 /mcL Platelets≥100,000 / mcL Hemoglobin≥9 g/dL or ≥5.6 mmol/L without transfusion or EPO dependency (within 7 days of assessment) Renal Serum creatinine OR Measured or calculated creatinine clearance (GFR can also be used in place of creatinine or CrCl)≤1.5 X upper limit of normal (ULN) OR ≥60 mL/min for subject with creatinine levels &gt; 1.5 X institutional ULN Hepatic Serum total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 X ULN OR Direct bilirubin ≤ ULN for subjects with total bilirubin levels &gt; 1.5 ULN AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) ≤ 2.5 X ULN OR ≤ 5 X ULN for subjects with liver metastases Albumin &gt;2.5 mg/dL Coagulation International Normalized Ratio (INR) or Prothrombin Time (PT) Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT)≤1.5 X ULN unless subject is receiving anticoagulant therapy as long as PT or PTT is within therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulants ≤1.5 X ULN unless subject is receiving anticoagulant therapy as long as PT or PTT is within therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulants a Creatinine clearance should be calculated per institutional standard. 14. Female subject of childbearing potential should have a negative urine or serum pregnancy within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study medication. If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required. 15. Female subjects of childbearing potential (Section 5.7.2) must be willing to use an adequate method of contraception as outlined in Section 5.7.2 Contraception, for the course of the study through 120 days after the last dose of study medication. Note: Abstinence is acceptable if this is the usual lifestyle and preferred contraception for the subject. 16. Male subjects of childbearing potential (Section 5.7.1) must agree to use an adequate method of contraception as outlined in Section 5.7.1 Contraception, starting with the first dose of study therapy through 120 days after the last dose of study therapy. Note: Abstinence is acceptable if this is the usual lifestyle and preferred contraception for the subject. 1. Is currently participating and receiving study therapy or has participated in a study of an investigational agent and received study therapy or used an investigational device within 4 weeks of the first dose of treatment. 2. Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of trial treatment. 3. Patients who are steroid dependent and cannot reduce the dexamethasone dose to a maximal dose of 2mg per day. 4. Has a known history of active TB (Bacillus Tuberculosis) 5. Hypersensitivity to pembrolizumab or any of its excipients. 6. Has had a prior anticancer monoclonal antibody (mAb) within 4 weeks prior to study Day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier. 7.

Note: If subject received major surgery, they must have recovered adequately from the toxicity and/or complications from the intervention prior to starting therapy. 8.
