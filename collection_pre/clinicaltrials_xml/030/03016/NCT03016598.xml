	<brief_title>Stimulant Oxytocin Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>High rates of substance use disorders (SUDs) in Veterans compared to the general population are heavily influenced by psychosocial factors - such as difficulty reintegrating into civilian life due to avoidance of vital support systems - leading to disproportionately elevated unmet addiction treatment needs. Administering oxytocin, a mammalian neuropeptide, intranasally to healthy controls facilitates the stress-buffering properties of social support. Oxytocin may also have an independent role in mitigating the symptoms of SUDs. For example, in animal models of addiction, oxytocin administration directly reduces tolerance, withdrawal effects, self-administration, and stress-induced reinstatement of drug seeking for a range of addictive substances. Moreover, oxytocin plays a role in modulating the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, which is involved in stress-induced SUD relapse. While results of early translational work in oxytocin and SUDs in humans, including my own pilot work, have been promising, findings have varied based on social context. A more integrated understanding of oxytocin's distinct effects on the behavior and psychology of 1) addiction, 2) sociality, and 3) stress reactivity could be the key to defining oxytocin's role in SUD treatment. This is particularly relevant to Veterans with SUDs, who are at a disadvantage due to increased rates of comorbid avoidant attachment - a measurable personality variant defined by avoidance of social intimacy and overvalued independence - and posttraumatic stress symptoms preventing retention in existing SUD treatment paradigms and heightening vulnerability to stress-induced substance use. This study will uniquely combine psychopharmacological and evidence-based psychosocial interventions targeted at improving sociality, treatment engagement, and stress responsivity to enhance overall recovery among Veterans with SUDs.</detailed_description>
