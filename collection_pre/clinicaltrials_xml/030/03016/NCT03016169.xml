	<brief_title>Trifecta™ GT Post Market Clinical Follow-up</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study is a prospective multi-center evaluation of approximately 350 subjects implanted with a St. Jude Medical (SJM) Trifecta™ GT valve. It will be conducted in approximately 35 sites worldwide. Subjects will be followed for 5 years. The total duration of the study is expected to be 6 years, assuming all subjects are enrolled within 1 year of study initiation. To ensure enrollment balance across sites, no individual site can enroll more than 10% of the sample size (n=35 subjects) without prior approval from the sponsor.</detailed_description>
