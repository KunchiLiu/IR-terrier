	<brief_title>Magnetic Seizure Therapy vs. Electroconvulsive Therapy for Bipolar Mania</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Magnetic seizure therapy (MST) is likely to be an alternative options to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). Widespread stimulation of cortical and subcortical regions is inevitable for ECT since the substantial impedance of the scalp and skull shuts most of the electrical stimulus away from the brain. Nevertheless, magnetic pulses are capable to focus the stimulus to a specific area of the brain because they can pass the scalp and skull without resistance. In Addition, electric current will penetrate into deeper structures, while magnetic stimulus are only capable to reach a depth of a few centimeters. As a consequence, MST are able to generate focus stimuli on superficial regions of the cortex while ECT can't, which may give MST the capability to produce comparable therapeutic benefits with the absence of apparent cognitive side effects.</detailed_description>
