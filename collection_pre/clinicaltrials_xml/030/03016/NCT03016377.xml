	<brief_summary>This research study combines two different ways of fighting disease: antibodies and T cells. Both antibodies and T cells have been used to treat patients with cancers. They both have shown promise, but neither alone has been sufficient to cure most patients. This study is designed to combine both T cells and antibodies in order to create a more effective treatment. The treatment that is being researched is called autologous T lymphocyte chimeric antigen receptor cells targeted against the CD19 antigen (ATLCAR.CD19) administration. In previous studies, it has been shown that a new gene can be put into T cells that will increase their ability to recognize and kill cancer cells. The new gene that is put in the T cells in this study makes a piece of an antibody called anti-CD19. This antibody sticks to leukemia cells because they have a substance on the outside of the cells called CD19. For this study, the anti-CD19 antibody has been changed so that instead of floating free in the blood part of it is now joined to the T cells. When an antibody is joined to a T cell in this way it is called a chimeric receptor. These CD19 chimeric (combination) receptor-activated T cells seem to kill some of the tumor, but they do not last very long in the body and so their chances of fighting the cancer are unknown. Preliminary results have shown that many subjects receiving this treatment have experienced unwanted side effects including cytokine release syndrome. In this study, to help reduce cytokine release syndrome symptoms, the ATLCAR.CD19 cells have a safety switch that when active, can cause the cells to become dormant. These modified ATLCAR.CD19 cells with the safety switch are referred to as iC9-CAR19 cells. If the subject experiences moderate to severe cytokine release syndrome as a result of being given iC9-CAR19 cells, then the subject may take part in a sub-study where you will be given a second study drug, AP1903. AP1903 activates the iC9-CAR19 safety switch, reducing the number of the iC9-CAR19 cells in the blood. The goal of the sub-study is to determine what dose of AP1903 can be given that reduces the severity of the cytokine release syndrome to mild, but still allows the remaining iC9-CAR19 cells to effectively fight the leukemia. The primary purpose of this study is to determine whether receiving iC9-CAR19 cells is safe and tolerable and to determine an optimal dose of AP1903 to be given to subjects to alleviate severe cytokine release syndrome.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Administration of Autologous CAR-T CD19 Antigen With Inducible Safety Switch in Patients With Relapsed/Refractory Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>STUDY OBJECTIVES Primary Objective - To determine the safety and tolerability of autologous iC9-CAR19 T cells administered to adult and pediatric subjects with relapsed or refractory CD19+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia. All subjects will receive a dose of 1X10^6 cells/kg of iC9-CAR19 T cells Secondary Objectives - To measure the survival of iC9-CAR19 T cells in vivo. - To determine the anti-leukemia overall response rate (ORR) mediated by autologous iC9-CAR19 T cells administered to adult and pediatric subjects with relapsed or refractory CD19+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia. - To determine overall survival (OS) in adult and pediatric subjects with relapsed or refractory CD19+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia following infusion of IC9-CAR19 T cells. - To determine event-free survival (EFS) in adult and pediatric subjects with relapsed or refractory CD19+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia following infusion of IC9-CAR19 T cells. - To determine relapse-free survival (RFS) in adult and pediatric subjects with relapsed or refractory CD19+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia following infusion of IC9-CAR19 T cells Sub-Study Objectives Adult subjects who develop Grade 2* CRS or adult and pediatric subjects who develop Grade 3 CRS as a consequence of iC9-CAR19 therapy will enter a sub-study designed to evaluate the safety and the optimal dose of AP1903 that can be administered to adult and pediatric subjects with CD19+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia that provides adequate CRS symptom relief will be determined separately in adult and pediatric subjects. Five potential doses of AP1903 (range 0.025 mg/kg to 0.4 mg/kg) will be evaluated in the sub-study. All subjects who develop Grade 4 CRS will be treated per standard of care guidelines. - The optimal dose will be estimated based on isotonic estimates of CRS control, anti-leukemia response and dose limiting toxicity (DLT) rates. The estimated optimal dose is the lowest dose that maximizes the probability of anti-leukemia response and CRS control among doses with dose limiting toxicity rate not exceeding 0.25. Primary Objective of Sub-Study To evaluate the safety of AP1903 and determine the optimal dose or doses that can be administered to adult and pediatric subjects with relapsed or refractory CD19+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia that can alleviate Grade 2*/3 CRS symptoms to ≤ Grade 1 without compromising the anti-leukemia response mediated by autologous iC9-CAR19 T cell therapy. Secondary Objectives of Sub-Study - To determine the anti-leukemia ORR to iC9-CAR19 T cell infusion therapy in adult, and pediatric subjects with relapsed/refractory CD19+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia who received doses of AP1903 to treat Grade 2*/3 signs/symptoms of cytokine release syndrome. - To determine serum cytokine levels after iC9-CAR19 T cell infusion in adult and pediatric subjects with relapsed/refractory CD19+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia who received doses of AP1903 to treat signs/symptoms of Grade 2*/3 cytokine release syndrome. - To measure iC9-CAR19 T cells in the peripheral blood of adult and pediatric subjects with relapsed/refractory CD19+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia following escalating doses of AP1903 to treat signs/symptoms of Grade 2*/3 cytokine release syndrome. - To measure iC9-CAR19 T cells in the peripheral blood of adult and pediatric subjects with relapsed/refractory CD19+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia following escalating doses of AP1903 to treat signs/symptoms of Grade 2*/3 cytokine release syndrome. To determine EFS in adult and pediatric subjects with relapsed or refractory CD19+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia following the administration of escalating doses of AP1903 to treat signs/symptoms of Grade 2*/3 cytokine release syndrome. - To determine relapse-free survival rate in adult and pediatric subjects with relapsed or refractory CD19+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia following the administration of escalating doses of AP1903 to treat signs/symptoms of Grade 2*/3 cytokine release syndrome. ENDPOINTS Primary Endpoint Toxicity will be classified and graded according to the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, version 4.0). (Note: The safety evaluation period will encompass toxicities related to the cell therapy that are experienced starting on the day of iC9-CAR19 T cell infusion up through 6 weeks post infusion. The iC9-CAR19 T-cells will be considered safe if the proportion of subjects with Grade 3-5 non-infectious, non-hematologic and non-cytokine release syndrome-related toxicities associated with the cell infusion are lower than 0.25 (exceptions include alopecia and electrolyte abnormalities, diarrhea, or nausea and vomiting adverse events that can be managed with supportive care that do not persist as Grade 3-4 toxicities for &gt; 1 week). Secondary Endpoints - Persistence of iC9-CAR19 T cells in vivo will be determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and flow cytometry in samples of peripheral blood. - ORR (CR/CRi) to iC9-CAR19 T cell therapy will be determined using National Comprehensive Cancer Network Response Criteria (NCCN) for acute lymphoblastic leukemia provided in Section 7.8.1. Assessment of minimal residual disease will be included as criterion of response (ie, the percentage of subjects who achieve CRm [defined as minimal residual disease negative complete response] by either flow cytometry or PCR analysis will be determined). - Overall survival will be measured from the date of administration of iC9-CAR19 T cells to the date of death. - EFS applies to all subjects and will be measured from the date of administration of iC9-CAR19 T cells to the date of signs and symptoms of treatment failure or relapse from complete remission or CRi, or death from any cause; subjects not known to have any of these events are censored on the date they were last examined. - Relapse free survival will apply only to subjects achieving CR or CRi and measured from the date of achievement of a remission until the date of relapse or death from any cause; subjects not known to have relapsed or died at last follow-up are censored on the date they were last examined. OUTLINE Cell Procurement Peripheral blood, up to 300 mL total (in up to 3 collections)will be obtained from subjects for cell procurement. In subjects with low (CD3 count as assayed by flow cytometry less than 200/μl) T-cell count in the peripheral blood, a leukopheresis may be performed to isolate sufficient T cells. The parameters for pheresis will be 2 blood volumes. iC9-CAR19 Cells Administration Post lymphodepletion, subjects who meet eligibility criteria for cellular therapy will receive iC9-CAR19 T cells within 2-4 days after completing the pre-conditioning chemotherapy regimen. We will administer iC9-CAR19 post lymphodepletion at a dose of 1×106 iC9-CAR19+ T cells/kg. Subjects may receive re-infusion of IC9-CAR19 T cells (without lymphodepleting chemotherapy) if the following criteria are met: - The subject has completed the 6 week evaluation period post initial infusion AND: - The subject does not have progressive leukemia AND: - The subject has sufficient stored cells for re-infusion (1x10^6/kg) AND - Either has been treated with AP1903 or corticosteroids for CRS, OR has evidence of loss of iC9-CAR19-cell persistence or function. Duration of Therapy Therapy in LCCC1541-ATL involves 1-3 infusions of iC9-CAR19 cells (see section 5.3.3). Treatment with at least one infusion will be administered unless: - Subject decides to withdraw from study treatment, OR - General or specific changes in the subject's condition render the subject unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator. Cytokine Release Syndrome Sub-Study Therapy Subjects who are eligible for the sub-study, designed to determine the safety and optimal dose(s) of AP1903 that can be administered to adult or pediatric subjects with CD19+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia that reduces CRS symptoms to ≤ Grade 1 in all subjects treated at that dose level while simultaneously preserving the anti-leukemia response rate mediated by autologous iC9-CAR19 T cell therapy, may receive up to two doses of AP1903 over a 48-hr period administered 24 hrs apart. The planned dose levels of AP1903 that will be tested are 0.025mg/kg, 0.05 mg/kg, 0.1 mg/kg, 0.2 mg/kg and 0.4 mg/kg. If CRS symptoms have not improved to ≤ Grade 1 within 24 hrs of receiving a 1st or 2nd dose of AP1903 or become worse (e.g., progress to Grade 4) during the sub-study, then these subjects will be classified as non-responders and treated for CRS according to standard of care guidelines. Duration of Follow-up Subjects will be followed for up to 15 years for replication-competent retrovirus evaluation or until death, whichever occurs first. Subjects removed from study for unacceptable adverse events will be followed until resolution or stabilization of the adverse event.</detailed_description>
