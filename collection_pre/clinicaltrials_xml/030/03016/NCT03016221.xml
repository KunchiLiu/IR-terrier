	<brief_summary>The use of topical over-the-counter (OTC) products with a warming or cooling effect is widespread in the fields of sport, physiotherapy and in private households. Advertisements for such products promise pain relief when suffering from musculoskeletal disorders such as muscle tension, rheumatism or acute injuries, e.g. sprains. In literature, there are only little information about the efficacy and the physiological mechanisms of topical warming or cooling products. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate the local skin characteristics during and after an application of a topical product with a warming or cooling effect.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Local Changes of Skin Characteristics After an Application of a Topical Product With a Warming or Cooling Effect</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The use of topical products for local pain relief in chronic or acute musculoskeletal disorders is widely used. Despite the widespread use of these products, there is missing information on the physiological mechanisms and efficacy of topical warming and cooling ointments. Most of the existing literature is about the efficacy of topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-products on chronic pain in osteoarthritis. Furthermore, one study tested the cooling effect of gels with different menthol concentrations. They found that, regardless of the concentration, the skin temperature was reduced up to one hour post application in the area of application. The aim of our study is to evaluate the change of skin characteristics after a single application of a warming or cooling topical product on healthy subjects. Outcome parameters include skin perfusion, temperature, skin redness and subjective thermal sensation. We only selected products in form of alcohol based ointments, menthol or wintergreen oil. Sprays and patches were excluded. The application area is the unilateral lumbar back region, whereas the contralateral side serves as control area. After an acclimatization period, baseline measurements are performed, followed by standardized application of the topical product. The local skin responses are measured in 10 mins time increments up to one hour.</detailed_description>
