	<brief_summary>Cardiovascular Implantable Electronic device (CIED) is a evolution therapy and number of patients with it are growing rapidly. Electromagnetic interference causing device malfunction is not uncommon, Radiofrequency Identification system is among its plausible source. Patients with CIEDs are at risk of exposure to this novel product in their daily living especially automobile keyless access system. Only informal studies have been conducted and not be published. Formal and systemic evaluation and tests are crucial.</brief_summary>
