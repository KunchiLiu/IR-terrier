	<brief_summary>Dolutegravir (DTG) is a potent inhibitor of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) integrase that has been developed for the treatment of HIV. This is a phase 3b (PH3b), non-randomized, open-label, multi-center, treatment rollover study. The primary objective of this pediatric interventional study is to provide continued access to DTG for eligible participants who previously participated in the international maternal pediatric adolescent acquired immunodeficiency syndrome [AIDS] clinical trials (IMPAACT) P1093 study (parent study) and who cannot locally access DTG in the public sector. The P1093 study was designed to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety, tolerability and antiviral activity of DTG in HIV-1 experienced adolescents and children as well as treatment-naive infants and toddlers. Participants who have no evidence of virological failure (VF) and who have tolerated DTG in the parent study without any significant toxicity leading to the permanent discontinuation of this drug and withdrawal from the parent study will be considered for this open-label continued access study. Participants will be receiving their age/weight appropriate dose of DTG as defined in the parent study. The objective of this study will be supported through evaluation of serious adverse events. The duration of participant accrual into the study will extend until DTG receives local (by country) regulatory approval . Therefore, participants enrolled into this study will be those who will benefit from treatment and will continue to receive DTG until local (by country) regulatory approval and commercial or other availability occurs from another source (e.g. government programs, aid programs, assistance programs, etc.). Participants will be enrolled after all screening procedures have been completed. In most cases, the Screening visit will overlap with the participant's penultimate visit on the parent study (at Week 180 of P1093). Participants who meet all entry criteria may enroll and will be seen in the clinic every 12 weeks for a safety evaluation and to receive DTG. It is estimated that no more than 120 participants will be enrolled in this study.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Between &gt;=4 weeks and &lt;18 years of age inclusive, at the Day 1 visit for the P1093 study. Subjects must have previously participated in the P1093 study (parent study) through at least Week 180 with no evidence of VF. Subjects must have virological control defined as HIV1 ribonucleic acid (RNA) &lt;400 copies per milliliter (c/mL) during the parent study at their penultimate P1093 visit (on or after the Week 180 visit). If the penultimate P1093 visit on or after the Week 180 visit indicates the possibility of VF, a retest can be used to confirm eligibility. Adherence issues should be addressed and viral suppression must be confirmed prior to Day 1. Demonstrated ability or willingness to swallow assigned dolutegravir (DTG) tablets (for subjects requiring tablets). DTG 10, 25, and 50 milligram (mg) tablets may not be crushed or dissolved. The 5 mg dispersible tablets may not be cut and must be used in five milligram intervals. Female subjects who are of child bearing potential and male subjects engaging in sexual activity should be counseled on safer sexual practices including the use and benefit/risk of effective barrier methods (e.g. male condom) and on the risk of HIV transmission to an uninfected partner. Male subjects engaging in sexual activity that could lead to HIV1 transmission must use a condom. Female subjects who are of child bearing potential and who are engaging in sexual activity that could lead to pregnancy, must use 2 adequate birth control methods while on study and for 2 weeks after stopping study drug. Condoms are recommended in addition, because their appropriate use is the only contraception method effective for preventing HIV1 transmission. Parent, legal guardian or subject &gt;=18 years of age is able and willing to provide signed informed consent which includes compliance with the requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form and in this protocol. Presence of any active AIDS defining opportunistic infection. Known &gt;=grade 3 laboratory toxicities prior to study entry (e.g. neutrophil count, hemoglobin, platelets, aspartate aminotransferase [AST], aspartate aminotransferase [ALT], lipase, serum creatinine and total bilirubin). Repeat testing will be allowed for eligibility determination. &gt;=grade 3 total bilirubin is allowable, if the subject is on atazanavir (ATV). Subjects with laboratory abnormalities considered unrelated to DTG may be allowed to enter the study. Thus, if the laboratory abnormality persists upon repeat testing, the subject may be considered for study entry after consultation and approval of the study team. Subjects who were permanently discontinued from DTG in the parent study due to intolerance or pregnancy must not be included in this current program. The following liver toxicities within 30 days prior to study entry: ALT &gt;3 times upper limit of normal (ULN) and direct bilirubin is &gt;2 times ULN. Women who are pregnant or plan to become pregnant or breastfeed during the study. Subject is currently participating in or has participated in a study with a compound or device that is not commercially available within 30 days of signing informed consent, unless permission from the sponsor's medical monitor is granted. Presence of any history of allergy/sensitivity to any of the study drugs. Use of any disallowed medications at time of screening. Subject is unlikely to adhere to the study procedures, keep appointments, or is planning to relocate during the study. Clinical or symptomatic evidence of pancreatitis, as determined by the clinician. Any condition (including but not limited to alcohol and drug use) that would, in the opinion of the site investigator, place the subject at an unacceptable risk of injury or render the subject unable to meet the requirements of the protocol.</criteria>
