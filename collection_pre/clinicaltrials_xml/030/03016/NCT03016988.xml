	<brief_summary>Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is a type of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and shows poor survival. This study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Bortezomib combined with Fludarabine and Cytarabine treatment in the naive and relapsed MCL who are not eligible for high dose therapy and transplantation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Efficacy and Safety of Bortezomib Combined With Fludarabine and Cytarabine Treatment for Mantle Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The eligibility criteria were pathologically confirmed, previously untreated MCL or relapsed MCL as defined by the World Health Organization classification; age≥18 years; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-2; adequate haematologic function (haemoglobin &gt; 9.0 g/l, absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1500/ml, platelets &gt; 75,000/l), hepatic function (total serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 times the upper limit of normal, alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase ≤ 2.5 times the upper limit of normal), renal function (serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 mg/dl, creatinine clearance ≥ 50 ml/min); normal coagulation function and electrocardiogram results. Stage was defined according to the Ann Arbor system. The Fujian Medical University Union Hospital approved this study before subjects were enrolled. Treatment dosages were as follows: days 1,4,8,and 11 subcutaneous infusion of 1.3mg/m2 Bortezomib. Days 1-3 intravenous infusion 25mg/m2 Fludarabine. Days 1-3 intravenous infusion of 500mg/m2 Cytarabine. The regimen was repeated every 28 days for a maximum of six cycles.</detailed_description>
