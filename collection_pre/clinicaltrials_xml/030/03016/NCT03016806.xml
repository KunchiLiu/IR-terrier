	<detailed_description>This study is a single-center treatment protocol with four possible preparative regimens, designed to validate the process of umbilical cord blood stem cell transplantation at our institution. Enrolled patients will receive chemotherapy +/-total body radiation as a pre-transplant conditioning regimen. Patients will then receive cord blood stem cells followed by GvHD prophylaxis that will include Tacrolimus and Mycophenolate Mofetil, or Cyclosporin A and Methylprednisolone. Multiple data points will be collected prior to, during, and g and following transplantation to ensure safety of the process and to evaluate the stated objectives.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Appropriate diagnosis: Patients must have a disease or syndrome amenable to therapy with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Diagnoses include, but are not limited to: Congenital and Other Nonmalignant Disorders: Immunodeficiency disorders (e.g. Severe Combined Immunodeficiency, WiskottAldrich Syndrome) Congenital hematopoietic stem cell defects (e.g. ChediakHigashi Syndrome, Congenital Osteopetrosis, Osteogenesis Imperfecta) Metabolic disorders (e.g. Hurler's Syndrome) Severe aplastic anemia HighRisk Leukemia: Acute Myelogenous Leukemia Refractory to standard induction therapy (more than 1 cycle required to achieve remission) Recurrent (in CR ≥ 2) Treatmentrelated AML or MDS Evolved from myelodysplastic syndrome Presence of FLT3 abnormalities FAB M6 or M7 Adverse cytogenetics Myelodysplastic Syndrome Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia including T lymphoblastic leukemia: Refractory to standard induction therapy (time to CR &gt;4 weeks) Recurrent (in CR ≥ 2) WBC count &gt;30,000/mcL at diagnosis Age &gt;30 at diagnosis Adverse cytogenetics, such as t(9:22), t(1:19), t(4:11), and other MLL rearrangements. Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia in accelerated phase or blast crisis Biphenotypic or undifferentiated leukemia Burkitt's leukemia or lymphoma Lymphoma: Large cell, Mantle cell, Hodgkin lymphoma refractory or recurrent, chemosensitive, and ineligible for an autologous stem cell transplant or previously treated with autologous SCT Marginal zone or follicular lymphoma that is progressive after at least two prior therapies Multiple Myeloma, recurrent following highdose therapy and autologous SCT or ineligible for an autologous HSCT Solid tumors, with efficacy of allogeneic HSCT demonstrated for the specific disease and disease status Adequate organ function: Cardiac LVEF &gt;45%, or shortening fraction &gt;25%, Absence of congestive heart failure or conduction disturbances with high risk for sudden death Pulmonary DLCO (corrected for hemoglobin), FEV1 and FVC ≥ 50% predicted; Renal serum Cr &lt; 1.5 times the upper limit of normal for age or GFR ≥ 50 ml/min/1.73m2 Hepatic total bilirubin level &lt; 2 times the upper limit of normal (except for patients with Gilbert's syndrome or hemolysis); if the primary disease process is causal, this criterion will be reconsidered. ALT, AST, and Alkaline phosphatase ≤ 5 times upper limit of normal. Performance Status Karnofsky or Lansky score ≥ 70%. Informed Consent must be obtained prior to initiating conditioning therapy. Receipt of viable cord blood product(s), single or dual, must be confirmed with the stem cell processing laboratory prior to initiating conditioning therapy. Availability of 10/10 or 9/10 HLAmatched related or unrelated donor within a reasonable timeframe dictated by the clinical urgency of the transplant Autologous HSCT &lt; 6 months prior to proposed UCB transplant Pregnant or breast feeding Current uncontrolled infection Evidence of HIV infection or positive HIV serology</criteria>
