	<brief_summary>This study is a retrospective chart review of patients treated with onabotulinumtoxinA (BOTOX速) for idiopathic overactive bladder (OAB) and will determine voiding efficiency (VE) cutoff ratios that predict post-procedure urinary retention requiring catheterization.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patient with documented idiopathic OAB diagnosis Patient was treated with 100200U of BOTOX速 for OAB Urodynamics assessment within prior to first BOTOX速 injection. Patient had received botulinum toxin formulations other than BOTOX速 in the bladder Patient had symptoms of OAB associated with a neurological condition (eg, spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis, cerebrovascular accident, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, etc).</criteria>
