	<brief_summary>This prospective, observational pilot study is designed to assess feasibility, refine the target population, and quickly test qualitative and quantitative changes in the microbiome after short-term travel to South or Southeast Asia, regions where rates of travelers' diarrhea and intestinal colonization with antimicrobial resistant bacteria are highest. To measure the diversity change of the intestinal microbiota, participants will complete a questionnaire and provide a stool specimen at three different time points: prior to traveling, two weeks after returning from traveling, and 14 weeks after returning from traveling.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Assessing Intestinal Microbiota Diversification and Changes After Travel to South(East) Asia From the US</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Travelers' diarrhea is the most common illness experienced by those going overseas. Estimates vary, but incidence has been reported to range between 30-60%, depending on travel destination and season. Multiple organisms have been implicated as causes of travelers' diarrhea, but bacteria account for 80-90% of cases. There is mounting evidence that the integrity of the intestinal microbiome may be a strong modulator of diarrheal disease, and that intestinal infections and other factors, including stress, antibiotic exposure, and diet may disrupt the diversity and overall composition of the microbiome. Dysbiosis, a state of altered microbiota diversity, may be less resistant to the acquisition of intestinal pathogens and colonization of multiple drug resistant organisms. Furthermore, disruptions in the microbiome that may result from an episode of travelers' diarrhea may have a role in the development of chronic diarrhea and post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome. This prospective, observational pilot study is intended to obtain preliminary data to support the rationale for a subsequent larger cohort study. This study is designed to assess feasibility, refine the target population, and quickly test qualitative and quantitative changes in the microbiome after short-term travel (seven to 21 days) to South or Southeast Asia, regions where rates of travelers' diarrhea and intestinal colonization with antimicrobial resistant bacteria are highest. The target population will include 10 Emory University students and/or Emory University Hospital TravelWell Clinic (TWC) patients who have international travel plans. Consented, willing, and eligible participants will complete an initial eligibility screening, followed by pre-travel, short-term post-travel, and long-term post-travel study visits. To determine specific factors associated with diversity change of the intestinal microbiota and changes in the presence of genes that code for antibiotic resistance, questionnaires designed to collect data on demographics, medical history, diet, food intake, recent (within 12 weeks of pre-travel assessment, during travel, or post-travel) illness history, medication use, travel itinerary, travel activities, and relevant food and water risk behaviors will be completed at each study visit. A stool sample will also be provided at each time point. The primary protocol objective is to pilot a study investigating the association between travel and changes in the intestinal microbiome (including both bacterial and fungal components) and the bacterial and fungal resistome. The secondary protocol objective is to assess microbiota profile changes and reversion to or toward the pre-travel state by comparing pre-travel stool specimen sequencing results to short-term post-travel and long-term post-travel stool specimen sequencing results.</detailed_description>
