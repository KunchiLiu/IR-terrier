	<brief_title>Serum TRAP-5b Levels in Patients With Generalized Chronic Periodontitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>30 Chronic periodontitis subjects were divided into two groups- group A underwent scaling and root planing and group B underwent scaling and root planing with systemic administration of amoxicillin of 500 mg and metronidazole of 400 mg thrice daily for 7 days. Periodontal parameters probing pocket depth and clinical attachment level were measured at baseline and at 3rd month. Serum TRAP-5b levels were also measured at baseline, 1 month and at 3rd month.</detailed_description>
