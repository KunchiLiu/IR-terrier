	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to confirm the optimal dose and potential toxicity of oncolytic poliovirus (PV) immunotherapy with PVSRIPO for pediatric patients with recurrent WHO grade III or IV malignant glioma, but evidence for efficacy will also be sought. The primary objective is to confirm the safety of the optimal dose of PVSRIPO when delivered intracerebrally by convection-enhanced delivery (CED) in children with recurrent WHO Grade III malignant glioma (anaplastic astrocytoma, anaplastic oligoastrocytoma, anaplastic oligodendroglioma, anaplastic pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma) or WHO Grade IV malignant glioma (glioblastoma, gliosarcoma). A secondary objective is to estimate overall survival (OS) in this population.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 1b Study PVSRIPO for Recurrent Malignant Glioma in Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PVSRIPO will be delivered intratumorally by CED using an intracerebral catheter placed within the enhancing portion of the tumor. The population group are patients with recurrent WHO grade III or IV malignant glioma who are between the ages of 12 and 17. After a single dose of PVSRIPO, subjects will return for periodic visits to monitor tumor status, adverse events, and changes in blood immune profiles. A maximum of 12 pediatric patients will be treated with PVSRIPO, and then carefully monitored for safety for at least a year after treatment.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must have a recurrent supratentorial WHO Grade III malignant glioma (anaplastic astrocytoma, anaplastic oligoastrocytoma, anaplastic oligodendroglioma, anaplastic pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma) or WHO Grade IV malignant glioma (glioblastoma, gliosarcoma) based on imaging studies with measurable disease (≥ 1 cm and ≤ 5.5 cm of contrastenhancing tumor). The prior histopathology must be consistent with a World Health Organization (WHO) Grade III or IV malignant glioma confirmed by the study pathologist, Roger McLendon, or his designee. There is no standard of care treatment for children with Grade III/IV gliomas. Patients must have completed firstline treatments including surgical procedure and a minimum of 54 Gray of radiation prior to participating in this trial. Due to the potential implications of the treatment on the developing CNS, all patients must be ≥ 12 years of age and &lt; 18 years of age at the time of entry into the study. The patient must have a Lansky or Karnofsky Performance Score (KPS) of ≥ 70% at the time of entry. Laboratory Studies: Platelet count ≥ 125,000 per microliter prior to biopsy (unsupported). Platelets ≥ 100,000 per microliter prior to infusion (unsupported); Prothrombin and Partial Thromboplastin Times ≤ 1.2 x upper limit of normal (ULN) prior to biopsy; Positive serum antipoliovirus titer ≥ 1:8 prior to biopsy; Creatinine ≤ 1.2 x ULN prior to biopsy; Total bilirubin, SGOT, SGPT, alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2.5 x ULN prior to biopsy; Neutrophil count ≥ 1000 per microliter prior to biopsy (unsupported); Hemoglobin ≥ 9 gm/dl prior to biopsy (can be transfused). The patient must have received a boost immunization with trivalent inactivated IPOL™ (SanofiPasteur) ≥ 1 week prior to administration of the study agent. At the time of biopsy, prior to administration of virus, the presence of recurrent tumor must be confirmed by histopathological analysis. A signed informed consent form approved by the Duke University Institutional Review Board (IRB) will be required for patient enrollment into the study. Parents must be able to read and understand the informed consent document and must sign the informed consent indicating that they are aware of the investigational nature of this study. All children will have to provide assent to the study. Able to undergo brain MRI with and without contrast without requiring general anesthesia. Pregnant or breastfeeding. Patients with an impending, lifethreatening cerebral herniation syndrome, based on the assessment of the study neurosurgeon. Patients with an active infection requiring treatment or having an unexplained febrile illness (Tmax &gt; 99.5°F). Patients with known immunosuppressive disease or known human immunodeficiency virus infection. Patients with unstable or severe intercurrent medical conditions such as severe heart (New York Heart Association Class 3 or 4) or lung (FEV1 &lt; 50%) disease, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus. Patients with albumin allergy. Gadolinium allergy. A history of neurological complications due to past PV infection would imply previous virus replication in the CNS. Based on animal studies, previous exposure to poliovirus administered intracerebrally can reduce subsequent virus replication in the CNS. Patients who have not recovered from the toxic effects of prior chemo and/or radiation therapy. Guidelines for this recovery period are dependent upon the specific therapeutic agent being used: Patients who are less than 12 weeks from radiation therapy, unless progressive disease outside of the radiation field or 2 consecutive scans with disease progression or histopathologic confirmation of recurrent tumor. Patients who have received chemotherapy or bevacizumab ≤ 4 weeks [except for nitrosourea (6 weeks) or metronomic dosed chemotherapy such as daily etoposide or cyclophosphamide (1 week)] prior to starting the study drug unless patients have recovered from side effects of such therapy. Patients who have received immunotherapy ≤ 4 weeks prior to starting the study drug unless patients have recovered from side effects of such therapy. Patients with neoplastic lesions in the brainstem, cerebellum, or spinal cord, tumors extending into or crossing the corpus callosum, intraventricular tumors, pineal tumors, pituitary tumors, radiological evidence of active (growing) multifocal disease, leptomeningeal disease, or other locations at the discretion of the treating neurosurgeon. Patients with a diagnosis of agammaglobulinemia, that is: Undetectable antitetanus toxoid IgG Known history of agammaglobulinemia Patients who are on dexamethasone receiving &gt; 4 mg/day in the two weeks prior to admission for intracerebral delivery of PVSRIPO. Patients with worsening steroid myopathy (history of gradual progression of bilateral proximal muscle weakness, and atrophy of proximal muscle groups). Patients with prior, unrelated malignancy requiring current active treatment with the exception of cervical carcinoma in situ and adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.</criteria>
