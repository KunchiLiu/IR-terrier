	<brief_summary>This is a multicenter controlled intervention study that aims to assess the efficacy of a telephone follow-up program for the prevention of suicidal behavior in adults discharged from general hospitals after a suicide attempt. The hypothesis is that the implementation of this program is associated with reduced rates of suicide reattempts in these patients and also with delayed reattempts in them.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prevention of Suicidal Behaviour With Telemedicine Techniques</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Justification: Suicide is a global public health concern and is the leading cause of avoidable death in the Basque Country (Spain). The use of telemedicine techniques applied to high risk patients has shown to be useful in the prevention of suicide and suicidal behavior. Objectives: To assess the efficacy of a telephone follow-up program for the prevention of suicidal behavior in patients who recently attempted suicide. Design: This is a multicenter, prospective intervention study, non-randomized and with control group. Method: A sample of adults discharged from 2 general hospitals after a suicide attempt are enrolled in a telephone follow-up program which is added to their usual treatment (TAU). The program consists of 5 short calls made by nurses during 6 months. The calls are intended to: 1) Assess the risk of suicide in that moment, 2) Improve patient's adherence to treatments, and 3) Provide general psychoeducation guidelines. The control group is composed of patients discharged from a third general hospital after a suicide attempt. These receive TAU but are not enrolled in the telephone follow-up. Evaluation: All patients are followed during 12 months. Main outcome measures include the percentage of patients that make a second attempt and the average time to reattempt. Patients sign and informed consent.</detailed_description>
