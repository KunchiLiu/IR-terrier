	<brief_summary>This study evaluates the use of intermittent epidural boluses compared to continuous infusion in maintaining epidural pain relief in labor. The medicine solution used contains, in addition to bupivacain and fentanyl, adrenalin in both groups.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Programmed Intermittent Epidural Bolus Adrenaline Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Labor is often painful for the woman going through it, and thus many women choose to have pain relief by an epidural catheter. This is done by placing a thin plastic catheter in the epidural space in the lower back of the patient, and injecting a medicine solution usually consisting of local anesthesia and opioids. To ensure an effective pain relief through the labor process, additional medicine solution is injected through the catheter. Traditionally, this is done by a continuous infusion, often with the addition of patient controlled boluses. In this study the investigators investigate if maintaining the pain relief through programmed hourly intermittent boluses is more effective than continuous infusion. This is done in other studies with promising results, but the difference in this study is the addition of adrenaline to the medicine solution in order to make it more effective.</detailed_description>
