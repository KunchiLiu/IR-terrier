	<brief_summary>This is an open-label study to evaluate the safety of continued therapy with oral treprostinil in subjects who have completed Study TDE-HF-301. This study will provide long-term, open-label data regarding the effect of continued long-term oral treprostinil therapy for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension (PH) associated with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Subject visits will occur at Baseline, Weeks 6, 12, 18, 24, and every 12 weeks thereafter until either oral treprostinil becomes commercially available to treat PH associated with HFpEF or the study is discontinued by the Sponsor.</brief_summary>
