	<brief_title>A Pooled Analysis of the Data From Two Studies of Ammonium Succinate for Menopausal Symptoms</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Both studies were conducted previously and were randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled. They followed very similar protocols, were of nearly identical design, had common inclusion and exclusion criteria. Both studies achieved statistical significance for ammonium succinate-based dietary supplement on most of pre-specified endpoints of Greene Climacteric Scale symptoms severity reduction at week 12. Nevertheless, some minor variation in the patient population, both within the studies (e.g., between different centres, as well as seasonal variability) and between the studies can be expected. Naturally occuring estrogen deficiency over the course of the menopausal transition and postmenopause causes hot flushes and other psychosomatic and vasomotor symptoms. Menopausal hormone therapy is a method of choice, however in many cases it is contraindicated or unacceptable for other reasons. Many alternatives exist, generally acting via estrogen receptors (ER). The dietary supplement tested in the aforementioned studies contains ammonium succinate, which does not bind to ER, instead acting by supporting the Krebs cycle. It does not have phytoestrogenic ingredients.</detailed_description>
