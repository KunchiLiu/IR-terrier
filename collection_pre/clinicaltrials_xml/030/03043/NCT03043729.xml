	<brief_title>mFOLFOX6 vs. mFOLFOX6 + Aflibercept as Neoadjuvant Treatment in MRI-defined T3-rectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with locally advanced rectal cancer are generally recommended to receive preoperative radiotherapy or radiochemotherapy. The advantage of combined-modality therapy in rectal cancer is that it has reduced local pelvic recurrence - a dreaded and morbid event - to rates of about 10%. There is good quality evidence that preoperative radiotherapy reduces local recurrence but there is little if any impact on overall survival. One strategy to reduce the distant recurrence rate, and thereby increase the cure rate, would be to introduce systemic treatment earlier to prevent dissemination of micrometastases. The present trial is designed to compare two neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimens in patients with non-metastatic T3 CRM-negative rectal cancers using quality-controlled MRI of the pelvis as a main inclusion criterion. This strategy is believed to reduce acute and long-term toxicity caused by preoperative radiotherapy and to administer effective systemic chemotherapy early in the course of disease as neoadjuvant chemotherapy.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Age ≥ 18 years on day of signing informed consent 2. Signed and dated informed consent, and willing and able to comply with protocol requirements 3. WHO/ECOG Performance Status (PS) 01 4. Diagnosis of rectal adenocarcinoma 5. Candidate for sphinctersparing surgical resection prior to neoadjuvant therapy according to the primary surgeon, i.e. no patient will be included for whom surgeon indicates need for abdominoperineal resection (APR) at baseline. 6. Clinical staging is based on the combination of the following assessments: Physical examination by the primary surgeon CT scan of the chest/abdomen Pelvic MRI Rigid rectoscopy / endoscopic ultrasound (ERUS). Both examinations (i.e. MRI and ERUS) are mandatory. 7. The tumor has to fulfill the following criteria: No symptomatic bowel obstruction Locally advanced rectal and rectosigmoid cancer, i.e. lower border of tumor &gt; 5 cm and &lt; 16 cm from anal verge as determined by rigid rectoscopy MRI criteria: 1. Lower border of tumor below a line defined by promontorium and symphysis, regardless of the criterion "&lt; 16 cm from anal verge as determined by rigid rectoscopy". 2. No evidence that tumor is adjacent to (defined as within 2 mm of) the mesorectal fascia on MRI (i.e. CRM &gt; 2 mm) 3. Only T3tumors are included, i.e infiltration into perirectal fat &lt; 10 mm provided CRM &gt; 2 mm 4. Note: MRI criteria are used for the definition of T3 tumor (i.e. exclusion of T2 and T4 situation). 8. Hematological status: Neutrophils (ANC) ≥ 2 x 10^9/L Platelets ≥ 100 x 10^9/L Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL (previous transfusion of packed blood cells allowed) 9. Adequate renal function: Serum creatinine level ≤ 1.5 x upper limit normal (ULN) or ≤ 1.5 mg/dl Creatinine clearance ≥ 30 ml/min 10. Adequate liver function: Serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit normal (ULN) Alkaline phosphatase &lt; 3 x ULN AST and ALT &lt; 3 x ULN 11. Proteinuria &lt; 2+ (dipstick urinalysis) or ≤ 1 g/24hour or ≤ 500mg/dl 12. Regular followup feasible 13. For female patients of childbearing potential, negative pregnancy test within 1 week (7 Days) prior of starting study treatment 14. Female patients of childbearing potential (i.e. did not undergo surgical sterilization hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral oophorectomy and is not postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months) must commit to using high effective and appropriate methods of contraception until at least 6 months after the end of study treatment such as combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation, progestogenonly hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation, intrauterine device (IUD), intrauterine hormonereleasing system (IUS), bilateral tubal occlusion, vasectomized partner, sexual abstinence. If an oral contraception is used, a barrier method of contraception (e.g. male condom, female condom, cervical cap, diaphragm, contraceptive sponge) has to be applied additionally 15. Fertile male patients with a partner of childbearing potential must commit to using high effective and appropriate methods of contraception (details see above) until at least 9 months after the end of study treatment. 1. Distant metastases (CT scans of thorax and abdomen are mandatory) 2. cT2 and cT4 tumors (defined by MRI criteria) 3. Exclusion of potentially compromised CRM as defined by MRI criteria (i.e. &gt; 2 mm distance from CRM) 4. Prior antineoplastic therapy for rectal cancer 5. History or evidence upon physical examination of CNS metastasis 6. Uncontrolled hypercalcemia 7. Preexisting permanent neuropathy (NCICTCAE grade ≥ 2) 8. Uncontrolled hypertension (defined as systolic blood pressure &gt; 150 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure &gt; 100 mmHg), or history of hypertensive crisis, or hypertensive encephalopathy 9. Concomitant protocol unplanned antitumor therapy (e.g. chemotherapy, molecular targeted therapy, immunotherapy, radiotherapy) 10. Treatment with any other investigational medicinal product within 28 days prior to study entry 11. Known dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) deficiency 12. Treatment with CYP3A4 inducers unless discontinued &gt; 7 Days prior to randomization 13.

Involvement in the planning and/or conduct of the study (applies to both Sanofi staff and/or staff of Sponsor and study site) 25. Patient who might be dependent on the sponsor, site or the investigator 26.
