	<brief_summary>Background: Non-specific neck pain (NS-NP) is characterized by pain in structures located in the region between the superior nuchal line and the spinal process of the first thoracic vertebra, without association with any specific systemic disease provided by multifactorial and/or little known causes. Objective: The objective of the present study will be to verify the clinical effects of MV through visceral nociceptive inhibition in NS-NP patients with functional dyspepsia. Methods: In this study sixty NS-NP patients with functional dyspepsia (age: 18 and 50 years) will be randomized in into two groups: visceral manipulation group (VMG) (n =30) and control group (CG) (n =30). The VMG will be treated with visceral manipulation to the stomach and liver wile CG received placebo treatment. The immediate effects and 7 days after treatment will be evaluated through pain, cervical range, and electromyographic activity of the upper trapezius.</brief_summary>
