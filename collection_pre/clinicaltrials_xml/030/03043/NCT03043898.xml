	<brief_summary>This study addresses the question, how does sound propagate from a source in the chest to the chest wall? Using sound recorded at the chest as a diagnostic technique has the advantage of being non-invasive and non-radioactive, but compared to other techniques it cannot currently differentiate well between different diseases. Our aim is to improve our ability to differentiate between different diseases using sound recorded at the chest by improving our fundamental understanding of mechanisms by which sound propagates through the chest. Examples of conditions that could be diagnosed using audible lung sounds are bronchomalacia, asthma, lung cancer, interstitial lung disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The methodology of the study will be to place a sound source at a known location in the chest and measure the acoustic response on the chest wall with a microphone array. The sound source will be created by playing sound down the working channel of a bronchoscope and located anatomically using direct imaging. By placing a sound source inside the chest we will be able to generate an acoustic map of the chest and test the relative importance of different propagation mechanisms. This will be an advance on previous work, which placed a sound source at the mouth. Subjects will be selected for the study by asking patients undergoing a bronchoscopy procedure whether they would be willing to take part in the experiment in addition to their standard procedure. Procedures will take place in the Bronchoscopy Unit at Addenbrooke's hospital in Cambridge. The Unit runs regional speciality clinics in severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, lung cancer, bronchomalacia and interstitial lung disease and has a nationally significant interventional bronchoscopy service. A subsidiary part of the study will collect sound recordings from healthy volunteers and patients with common respiratory diseases using the same microphone array. This is to create a database of lung sounds and quantify inter-subject variability. The study will last approximately 18 months.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study has two parts, A and B. Both parts are observational studies of the sounds heard at the chest as recorded by an acoustic array. In Part A, healthy volunteers and patients at Addenbrooke's hospital will have the sounds at their chest recorded using a microphone array. This will be done in a single session lasting approximately 15 minutes. 25 healthy volunteers and 25 patients will be included. In Part B, 50 patients undergoing a bronchoscopy at Addenbrooke's hospital will have their bronchoscopy extended by 5-10 minutes so that sounds can be played through a catheter in the working channel of the bronchoscope and recorded by a microphone array at the chest. Part B will investigate 25 patients with structurally 'normal' hearts (for example patients with Chronic Cough) (Part B(i)), and 25 patients with lung disease that has resulted in an 'abnormal' lung structure (Part B(ii)). The consultant bronchoscopist will assign the patient to the relevant group based on information from their medical history and their CT scan. For Part B of the study an existing CT scan is an inclusion criteria. CT scans will not be carried out specifically for this study.</detailed_description>
