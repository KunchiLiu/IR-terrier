	<brief_title>Rocuronium Effective Dose for Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rocuronium is one of the most used neuromuscular blockers to help intubation and to relax abdominal wall for laparoscopic surgery. Rocuronium intubation dose can be enough for intubation but not last enough for excellent laparoscopic conditions. There is little variation in time from anesthesia induction to the end of the laparoscopy for cholecystectomy and avoiding excess rocuronium dose can help providing excellent conditions and fast track extubation. Dixon's up-and-down method will guide this dose-finding study for the ED50.</detailed_description>
