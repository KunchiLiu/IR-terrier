	<brief_title>Activating Media for Salt Reduction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this study, reporters just like researchers were in charge of the low-sodium salt intervention. Reporters are responsible for recommended objects and measure their blood pressure personally. By observing personally the change of blood pressure pre and post low-sodium salt intervention, reporters will increase their confidence and come to the conclusion that the low salt diet is an economical way to reduce blood pressure. Those reporters would share their experiment with other people including their colleagues, Hopefully, those reporters that took part in the trial would consciously keep a sustained focus to this topic, thereby retaining a long-time education in mass media.There were two interventions. One is low-sodium salt intervention and the other is informational intervention. Low-sodium salt intervention was carried out on those family members recommended by reporters, and informational intervention. Low-sodium salt intervention was only on the reporters. The evaluation criteria of low-sodium salt intervention is the blood pressure value, and the evaluation criteria of informational intervention are the numbers of related articles in certain newspaper and the awareness of related knowledges in local population.</detailed_description>
