	<brief_summary>Good quality of postoperative analgesia would lead to attenuate or prevent the adverse effects on the common functions of the immune system. We compared the effect of epidural analgesia versus rectus sheath block on postoperative pain and proinflammatory cytokines following malignant urological surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Epidural Analgesia Vs Rectus Sheath Block: Postoperative Analgesia and Proinflammatory Cytokines</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study groups: 60 patients were included in the study divided into two groups of 30 patients each as follow. Epidural group: Lumbar epidural catheter (L3-4) was inserted in each patient before induction of general anesthesia. After induction of general anesthesia 5ml of plain bupivacaine 0.25% plus 5ml normal saline (10 ml bupivacaine 0.125%) was injected through the epidural catheter, then continuous epidural infusion of 25 ml plain bupivacaine 0.25% plus 25 ml normal saline (50 ml bupivacaine 0.125%) at a rate of 3-5 ml/hour for 24hours postoperative. Rectus sheath group: Each patient received bilateral single shot ultrasound guided rectus sheath block under complete aseptic condition in a dose of 30 ml of plain bupivacaine 0.25% in each side immediately after induction of general anesthesia. Anesthetic technique: Standard monitoring by pulse oximetry, ECG, and non-invasive arterial pressure was performed. General anaesthesia was induced with sleeping dose of propofol (2 to 4 mg/kg) IV; fentanyl 1 mcg/kg IV; atracurium 0.5 mg/kg. Subsequently, the trachea was intubated and general anesthesia was continued with atracurium 0.015 mg/kg/min IVI and isoflurane, initially at 1 MAC, and then titrated to clinical end points. The lungs were mechanically ventilated at tidal volumes less than 6 mL/kg, and at respiratory rates (12-14/minute to maintain end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2) concentration between 30-40 mmHg, with a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5mmHg and an inspired oxygen fraction (FIO2) of 0.6. At the beginning of the skin closure, anesthesia was discontinued and tracheal extubation performed once the patient was awake after reversal of neuromuscular blocking agent. Data collection: Evaluation of postoperative pain intensity by Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) pain score (0 = no pain, 10=the worst pain imaginable): NRS evaluation was evaluated during rest and during cough (by asking the patient to cough) at the following postoperative period, 1hour (T1), 2hour (T2), 4hour (T4), 6hour (T6), 12hour (T12), 18hour (T18) and 24hours (T24). All the patients, in both groups, will receive paracetamol 1000 mg/6hour IVI. When VAS &gt; 4 morphine 0.1 mg/kg will be given slowly IV as rescue analgesia with a maximum three doses in 24 hours with 8 hours interval. Measurement of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IL-6): Two samples (preoperative and 24hour postoperative) of 5 mL venous blood were drawn in plan tubes under sterile conditions from each patient. Serum was rapidly centrifugated and quickly frozen at −70°C and stored until processed. Serum TNF-α and IL-6 levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique using commercially available kit from (KOMA BIOTECH, KOREA) according to the manufacturer instructions.</detailed_description>
