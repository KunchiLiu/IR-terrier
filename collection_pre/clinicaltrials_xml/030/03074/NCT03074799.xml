	<brief_summary>To assess implementation of a nurse-led, symptom-based screening program in local, decentralized clinics for tuberculosis (TB) screening of child contacts less than 5 years old who were exposed to tuberculosis in the home. This will allow nurses in decentralized clinics to either start IPT for those asymptomatic patients and refer symptomatic patients for evaluation of TB disease and possible antituberculous therapy (ATT).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nurse-Led, Symptom-Based Screening of Household Child Contacts of Tuberculosis Index Cases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Retrospective review of routine program data for child contacts less than five years of adult TB index cases who are receiving TB care at local, decentralized clinics in the Matlosana district of Northwest Province will be assessed. 16 clinics will be stratified and randomized in 1:1 fashion to either TST-based screening, the current standard of care, or symptom-based screening, the newly recommended standard of care in South Africa. Those who are TST positive in the TST-based group and those who are symptomatic in the symptom-based group will be referred to Klerkdorp Hospital for further evaluation of tuberculosis. Nurses in the decentralized clinics will initiate those who are TST negative or asymptomatic on IPT. Their clinical course will be monitored throughout treatment and adherence to therapy measured. The investigators will compare clinic-level outcomes including percentage of patients initiated on, adherent to, and completing IPT.</detailed_description>
