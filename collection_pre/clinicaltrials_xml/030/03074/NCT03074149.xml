	<brief_summary>To gain further insight on the characteristics, management, disease progression and the outcomes of patients with IPF, as diagnosed and treated under real-world, clinical practice conditions in Greece. More specifically, this registry will be used to: Provide a comprehensive clinical picture of IPF, Track access to health care and cost of caring for IPF patients over time, Examine the implementation of treatment guidelines used on patients diagnosed with IPF, according to the existing diagnosis guidelines, Characterization of patients on different treatments. To provide information regarding survival and mortality causes, IPF exacerbations as well as IPF patient co-morbidities including myocardial infarction, CNS infarction, other arterial thromboembolic events, deep vein thrombosis, hemorrhage, gastrointestinal perforation and pulmonary hypertension. Data regarding IPF patient hospitalization will be collected and evaluated with regards to potential respiratory causes, and there will be documentation of treatment patterns and economic aspects.
