	<brief_summary>Post-operative bleeding in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) can result in hypovolemic shock and unnecessity for allogenic blood transfusions. Intravenous and topical tranexamic acid (TXA) have been well established in reducing blood loss postoperatively. However, there are lack of data on peri-articular TXA injection during TKA. Therefore, the investigators conducted a three-arm prospective, randomized, controlled trial to compare the effectiveness of bleeding reduction of peri-articular TXA injections, intraarticular TXA injections and control group.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Comparative Efficacy of Peri-articular and Intraarticular Tranexamic Acid in Total Knee Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients scheduled for unilateral primary TKA; 108 patients were randomly assigned to receive peri-articular TXA, intraarticular TXA and control group. 36 patients received either: (I) 15 mg/kg peri-articular TXA combined with multimodal local anesthetic infiltration (bupivacaine, morphine, ketorolac and epinephrine) into the anterior soft tissue, medial gutter area, lateral gutter area prior to capsular closure and tourniquet deflation (group 1). (II) 2 g of intraarticular TXA after complete capsular closure just before tourniquet deflation (group 2). (III) Don't receive any route of TXA in control group (group 3). Hemoglobin (Hb) concentrations were measured at 24 and 48 hour, and the number of blood transfusions and knee circumference measurements were recorded. Serum TXA was recorded at 2 and 24 hours after operation. The reviewers were blinded to treatment group.</detailed_description>
