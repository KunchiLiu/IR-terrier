	<brief_summary>Background:The aim of the study is to value the application of three-dimensional visualization and three-dimensional printing in the hepatobiliary and pancreatic surgery.Methodï¼šFrom January 2016 to December 2018,the clinical data of 200 patients with the hepatobiliary and pancreatic diseases will be collected.All the patients received abdominal CT scanning and 3D reconstruction. Then we used the 3D reconstruction model and the 3D printed model based on the 3D reconstruction model in the operation planning and the operation.The clinical data include operative time, intraoperative blood loss,and postoperative complications after surgery.</brief_summary>
