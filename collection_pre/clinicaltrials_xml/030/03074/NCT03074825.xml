	<brief_summary>Chiauranib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking Aurora kinase B（Aurora B）、VEGFR/PDGFR/c-Kit、CSF-1R targets. This clinical trial is studying the efficacy and safety of chiauranib works in treating patients with relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, in the meantime, exploring the latent biomarkers accompany with chiauranib, as well as the relevancy of which and clinical benefit.</brief_summary>
