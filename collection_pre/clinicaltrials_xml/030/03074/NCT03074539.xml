	<brief_summary>There is evidence for a high prevalence of Sleep Disorder Breathing (SDB) in patients with Chronic Thromboembolic Pulmonary Hypertension (CTEPH). Central Sleep Apnea, Cheyne-Stokes Breathing and Obstructive Sleep Apnea appear to occur in CTEPH. However, there is no information on the impact of CTEPH treatment modalities on concomitant SDB. Furthermore, the use of PAP therapy in CTEPH has not yet been investigated. CTEPH is a rare and serious disease and there may be a bidirectional association of SDB and CTEPH. This study plans to investigate the prevalence of SDB in CTEPH and compare it to datasets of large epidemiological studies on SDB. Furthermore, the impact of CTEPH treatment on SDB will be analyzed and CTEPH patients for possible PAP treatment will be defined.</brief_summary>
