	<brief_summary>Lung cancer is a malignant tumor that causes the highest morbidity and mortality, and the main pathological type is non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Most of them present with advanced stage at diagnosis. Radiotherapy is an important treatment strategy for advanced non-small cell lung cancer. However patients have different responses to radiotherapy due to individual differences, thus there is still lacking of sensitive markers to predict treatment response at present. Using bioinformatics to process the data and small sample clinical trial, our previous study found 5 plasma miRNAs were related to radiosensitivity. The design is controlled clinical trial. According to the size of lung lesions, the investigators divided the patients into hyperfractionated radiotherapy group（50Gy/11F/2W) with lesion ≤5cm in diameter and conventional fractionated radiotherapy group（60Gy/30F/6W）with lesion &gt;5cm in diameter.</brief_summary>

Age 18~75 years old; 6. The function of lung, liver, kidney, bone marrow was normal; 7. The patients had not received radiotherapy for previous primary tumor and metastases; 8. At least accept 2−4 cycles of chemotherapy,not disease progression after chemotherapy,start radiotherapy in two weeks after the last cycle of chemotherapy; 9. Wildtype EGFR; 10. Sensitive mutant EGFR, but refused to targeted therapy; 11. In line with the indications of radiotherapy and accept it; 12.
