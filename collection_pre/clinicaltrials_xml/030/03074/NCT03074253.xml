	<detailed_description>"Cardiovascular Imaging and Biomarker Analyses (CIBER)" is a single-center, prospective and observational study evaluating the expression of novel biomarkers in patients undergoing cardiacvascular imaging within clinical routine care. It is aimed to evaluate associations with biomarker expressions with ascertained cardiac imaging parameters. Furthermore the prognostic value of biomarkers and imaging parameters on mid-term and long-term prognosis will be evaluated. Novel biomarkers will comprise blood derived biomarkers including neurohormones, proteins, cytokines, microRNAs and metabolomics.</detailed_description>
