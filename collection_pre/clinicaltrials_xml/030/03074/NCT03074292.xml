	<criteria>Term and latepreterm neonates (â‰¥35weeks) according to the guidelines of the American Academy of Pediatrics (2004) which stated that gestational ages of newborns were determined according to the first day of the mother's last menstrual period (by the mother's statement) and were additionally confirmed by the Ballard scoring system (Ballard et al., 1991) and antenatal ultrasonographic estimation or obstetric records if present. Clinical significant indirect hyperbilirubinemia requiring phototherapy in the first week of life. Normal blood counts and peripheral blood smears Normal reticulocytic count. Breast fed newborn. Those in whom the total serum bilirubin (TSB) level rose by more than 5 mg/dl per day or was higher than 20 mg/dl within the first 24 hours after birth were excluded from the study. Infant of diabetic mothers. Maternal eclampsiapreeclampsia. Birth asphyxia Sepsis congenital anomalies. Direct Coombs`test positive Pathological causes of hyperbilirubinemia. Enclosed hemorrhage. Hemolytic type of hyperbilirubinemia due to blood group or Rh incompatibility.</criteria>
