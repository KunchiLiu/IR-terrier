	<brief_title>Atezolizumab and Bevacizumab in Rare Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration: Each cycle is 21 days. On Day 1 of each cycle, you will receive atezolizumab and bevacizumab by vein over about 60 minutes each. Length of Treatment: You may continue taking the study drugs for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best interest. You will no longer be able to take the study drugs if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions. Your participation on the study will be over after the follow-up visits. Study Visits: On Day 1 of every odd-numbered cycle (Cycles 1, 3, 5, and so on): °°You will have a physical exam. Blood (about 4 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to learn if you have certain genetic mutations (changes) that may affect your response to the study drugs. °Urine will be collected for routine tests. On Day 1 of every even-numbered cycle (Cycles 2, 4, 6, and so on): - You will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 4 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine testing. - During Cycle 2, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn before your dose of study drugs for biomarker testing. - During Cycle 2, you will have an image-guided core biopsy to check the status of the disease and for biomarker testing. On Day 8 of Cycles 1 and Cycle 2: - You will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine testing. Every 9-12 weeks, you will have an MRI or CT scan. At any time the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have an EKG and either an ECHO or MUGA scan. End-of-Treatment Visit: About 30 days after your last dose of study drugs: - You will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests. If the disease got worse, this sample will also be used for biomarker testing. - If the disease got worse, you will have an image-guided core biopsy to check the status of the disease. Follow-Up: About every 3 months after your end-of-treatment visit, you or your family/caregiver will be called by the study staff and asked how you are doing. This call should last about 15 minutes. The study staff may also access your medical records or publically available records to learn about your long-term health status. This is an investigational study. Atezolizumab is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of metastatic (has spread) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Bevacizumab is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer, metastatic non-squamous NSCLC, metastatic renal cell carcinoma, recurrent (has come back after treatment) glioblastoma, cervical cancer, and platinum-resistant (a type of chemotherapy) recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer. The combination of these drugs to treat the type of cancer you have is considered investigational. The study doctor can explain how the study drugs are designed to work. Up to 160 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>
