	<brief_title>DEB Versus 2nd Generation DES in Patients With In-Scaffold Restenosis of Bioresorbable Vascular Scaffold</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The bioresorbable vascular scaffold (BRS) has been emerged as new therapeutic option in percutaneous coronary intervention for coronary artery disease. Although 2nd generation drug-eluting stent (DES) has enhanced the efficacy and safety of DES, However, along with the widespread use of this newer generation DES in most clinical conditions, including high-risk patients with more complicated lesion profiles, ISR has continued to be a major concern, even in the era of newer generation DES. In this regards, the concept of BRS has introduced and has showed promising results. Nevertheless, previous reports showed that even BRS has not been free from restenosis, leading target lesion revascularization up to 7.4% during 3-year follow up. Currently, previous researches which comparedsafety and efficacy of treatment options for ISR lesion showed similar clinical outcomes following 2 representative options, namely, drug-eluting balloon or drug-eluting stent. In this regards, current European Society of Cardiology/European Association for Cardiothoracic Surgery (ESC/EACTS) guidelines recommend drug-eluting balloon (DEB) and 2nd generation DES as class IA recommendations for the treatment of BMS or DES-ISR. However, all the previous reports evaluated the ISR of metallic stents, and there has been no evidence for treatment option for BRS ISR. Therefore, the Smart Angioplasty Research Team: Safety and Efficacy of Drug-Eluting Balloon versus 2nd Generation Drug-Eluting Stent in Treatment of In-Bioresorbable Vascular Scaffold Restenosis (SMART-BRS-ISR) trial will randomly allocate patients with BRS ISR into DEB or 2nd generation DES and compare safety and efficacy of both treatment options.</detailed_description>
