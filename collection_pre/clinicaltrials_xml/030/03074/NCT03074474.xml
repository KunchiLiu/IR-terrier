	<brief_summary>The study is designed to demonstrate that the use of OviTex® 1S material for a ventral hernia repair leads to the same or a lower percentage of early post-operative complications and true hernia recurrences when compared to other types of available meshes. 100 subjects will be included from 5-7 participating investigator sites. Within 30 days prior to the hernia repair surgery, a baseline visit will be performed during which the patient's eligibility for the study will be evaluated. The surgical technique used for the repair will be determined by the investigator/surgeon. Additional study data will be collected during the hospital stay, 30 and 90 days post-operatively and 12 and 24 months post-operatively. At the follow up visits, the surgical site will be evaluated by the surgeon, both the surgeon and patient will be asked to rate their satisfaction with the repair and the subject will be asked to complete two Quality of Life questionnaires.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ventral Hernia Study Using OviTex Reinforced Bioscaffold</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study is intended to evaluate the post-operative complications and re-herniations following the use of OviTex® Permanent 1S reinforced bioscaffold in subjects with ventral hernias. The study is designed to mirror surgical standard of care for ventral hernia intervention, with the exception of asking for subjects to return for evaluation at longer time points post-surgery than is typical for standard care. A baseline visit will be performed for patients who are identified for and provide informed consent to participate in the study. During this visit, a review of medical history, a physical exam and assessment of the hernia site will be performed. The potential subject will also be asked to complete two quality of life surveys; one that is disease specific and one that is a standard method of health assessment. On the day of surgery, the ventral hernia will be repaired with the use of OviTex® 1S reinforced bioscaffold. Perioperative data will be collected and the surgeon will provide an assessment of the product's handling qualities. During the course of the hospital stay, the subject will be assessed for incidence of early post-operative surgical site wound events and complications, all necessary medical interventions and/or re-operations. On the day of discharge, surgical site occurrences or wound related events noted at the hernia repair site and the occurrence of other post-operative complications will be assessed. The Day 30 and Day 90 visits will have a visit window of +/- 2 weeks. At these visits, the incidence of late surgical site occurrences or wound related events noted at the hernia repair site will be assessed. If hernia recurrence is suspected, it will be confirmed via diagnostic imaging with a CT scan. The occurrence of other late post-operative complications will also be assessed. The subjects will be asked to complete the same disease specific questionnaire and the same health assessment questionnaire as was done at the Baseline visit, however the subject will also be asked to complete a pain assessment. Both the surgeon and the subject will provide an assessment of his/her satisfaction with the hernia repair. The activities at Months 12 and 24 mirror those of Days 30 and 90, however the visit window is extended to +/- 4 weeks.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subject suffers from an uncomplicated ventral hernia that requires surgical repair with the use of an implant to reinforce or replace weakened or missing tissue. The size of the implant needed for repair is expected to be 18 x 22 cm, 20 x 20 cm or less. Subject meets CDC/SSI Wound Classification Class I (Clean) or Class II (CleanContaminated) criteria Subject is willing and able to sign an informed consent for the study and has signed the IRB approved Informed Consent form for this study. Subject is able to complete Quality of Life (QoL) and pain Questionnaires. Subject is at least 18 years old (or considered an adult per state law). Subject is able to participate fully in, and for the full duration of, the study. Subject has a BMI of &gt;35 Subject meets CDC/SSI Wound Classification Class III (Contaminated) or Class IV (DirtyInfected) criteria. Subject is female and is pregnant. Subject has a life expectancy of &lt; 2 years making it unlikely that the subject will successfully achieve twoyear followup. Subject has recent history of drug or alcohol abuse (in last 3 years).
