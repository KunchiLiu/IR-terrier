	<brief_summary>This study evaluates the benefit to use 1) insecticidal paints, 2) larvicides, 3) Ivermectin for both human and domestic animals and 4) strengthened Information, Education and Communication (IEC) strategy to complement the universal coverage with LLINs through a cluster randomized trial.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Insecticide Resistance Management in Burkina Faso and CÃ´te d'Ivoire</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Insecticidal paint comprised of two organophosphates (OPs) and an Insect Growth Regulator (IGR). This tool targets adult mosquitoes that are resistant pyrethroids to reduce vector density. Larvicide is a new formulation of Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis that will be implemented in major permanent breeding sites with the objective to reduce vector density. Ivermectin will be injected to domestic animals in addition to the national campaign implemented in the study area which treats the whole population. Ivermectin reduces the survival of mosquito that blood feed on treated humans and animals. Information, Education and Communication strategy aims to increase the adherence of the population to control tools available. Strengthening the IEC aims to increase the good use of long lasting nets.</detailed_description>
