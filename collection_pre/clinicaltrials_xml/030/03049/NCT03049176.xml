	<brief_title>The Impact and Cost-effectiveness of Safer Conception Strategies for HIV-discordant Couples (SAFER)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The reproductive needs of HIV-discordant couples who desire pregnancy represent an urgent public health problem that has been neglected in HIV prevention research. In Zimbabwe , and across sub-Saharan Africa, the vast majority of HIV-infected individuals are adults of reproductive age. Pregnancy and the desire for children are common among HIV-infected individuals, and HIV-discordant couples face a difficult choice between attempting pregnancy and risking HIV transmission to their partners. Recent surveys have found that 30-50% of HIV-infected individuals in sub-Saharan Africa are involved in stable, HIV-discordant relationships, and HIV transmission within married, cohabitating HIV-discordant couples accounts for 44-60% of new HIV infections in some regions of sub-Saharan Africa. While knowledge of HIV discordance can lead to increased condom use, many discordant couples have unprotected intercourse often motivated by the desire to conceive. Currently, HIV discordant couples who attempt to conceive place themselves at considerable risk of transmission. This research study aims to help promote couples' rights to conceive while at the same time decreasing the risk of HIV transmission.</detailed_description>
