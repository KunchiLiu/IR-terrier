	<brief_summary>Central retinal artery occlusions (CRAO) are the equivalent of an ischemic stroke (IS) at the retinal level. They share the same risk factors and common pathology. Their incidence is lower (8.5 / 100,000) and the functional prognosis is unfavorable in 80% of cases with visual acuity (VA) &lt;1/10. The diagnosis of an CRAO is clinically based on the sudden occurrence of a decrease in deep visual acuity with fundamentally signs of reactive ischemia. There is no data on early retinal arterial recanalization after CRAO, nor on the relationship between early recanalization (spontaneous or post-thrombolysis) and visual prognosis.</brief_summary>
