	<brief_summary>The objective of this project is to prepare healthcare services to use the diagnosis of prolonged grief disorder (PGD). The project aims to determine the frequency of PDG in a population sample of bereaved spouses and their adult children. It will also identify early predictors of PGD and common trajectories of natural and prolonged grief. The mapping of grief trajectories may turn out to be a potential prognostic tool to identify individuals with high versus low risk of developing PGD. Given the project's large, population-based sample and prospective design, this research will inform bereavement research and expand our knowledge of PGD considerably both nationally and internationally.</brief_summary>
