	<brief_summary>Physical activity has demonstrated efficacy in cancer prevention and improves quality of life and outcome in cancer survivors. Patients undergoing chemotherapy, especially those with advanced disease, may have symptoms leading to inactivity. Adapted physical activity (APA) among those patients could improve their tolerance to the treatment, and thereby their quality of life. APA could be beneficial to patients with curable disease as well as patients undergoing palliative chemotherapy. Some studies suggest that fighting against loss of muscle mass could lead to a survival benefit. However, APA is not established in daily practice and has not yet been evaluated in a chemotherapy ambulatory care unit. Primary aim of the study is to assess feasibility of an APA program in a chemotherapy ambulatory care unit of digestive, lung, hematological and dermatological cancers Secondary aim is to measure the impact of an APA program on fatigue, anxiety, depression and handgrip strength in patients beginning chemotherapy or targeted therapy for a digestive, lung, hematological or dermatological cancer, of any stage.</brief_summary>
