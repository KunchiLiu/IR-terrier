	<brief_summary>Using bone ring grafts with simultaneous implant placement after three-dimensional augmentation of severely defective bone ridges using computer-guided surgical templates. The study compares accuracy effectiveness by mimics software</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Computer Guided Versus Conventional Augmentation Using Bone Ring</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To study the effectiveness of computer guided surgical stents in ridge augmentation with implant insertion compared with free hand augmentation -Population/Intervention/Comparator/Outcome (PICO)- Population (P): patients with massive bone resorption horizontally and vertically, severe bone loss around teeth, periodontal disease or traumatic extraction in partially edentulous maxillary anterior region requiring implant insertion. Intervention (I): simultaneous implant placement with ridge augmentation using computer guided surgical templates with PRF. Comparator (C): Free hand simultaneous implant placement with ridge augmentation. Outcome (O): Patient esthetic satisfaction - Augmentation and implant insertion accuracy</detailed_description>
	<mesh_term>Bone Resorption</mesh_term>
	<criteria>1. Patients with insufficient alveolar ridge or severe alveolar bone resorption horizontally and vertically in partially edentulous maxillary anterior region. 2. Medically free patients in order to be a confounding factor on the final results. 3. Highly motivated patients. 4. Good oral hygiene. 5. Patients physically able to tolerate surgical and restorative procedures. 1. Young patients (incomplete bone growth). 2. Patients with any systemic disease that could affect bone healing. 3. Patients allergic to local anaesthetic agent. 4. Pregnant or lactating females. 5. Presence of any pathosis in the area. 6. history of oral radiotherapy. 7. history of prolonged steroid use. 8. Psychological disorders.</criteria>
