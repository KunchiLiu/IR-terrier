	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to evaluate efficacy and safety of Peptide Receptor Radionuclide Therapy (PRRT) with 177Lu-Edotreotide compared to targeted molecular therapy with Everolimus in patients with inoperable, progressive, somatostatin receptor-positive (SSTR+), neuroendocrine tumours of gastroenteric or pancreatic origin (GEP-NET).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Histologically and clinically confirmed diagnosis of welldifferentiated neuroendocrine tumour of nonfunctional gastroenteric origin (GENET) or both functional or nonfunctional pancreatic origin (PNET) Measurable disease per RECIST 1.1 Somatostatin receptor positive (SSTR+) disease Radiological disease progression, defined as progressive disease per RECIST 1.1. criteria Known hypersensitivity to edotreotide or everolimus Known hypersensitivity to DOTA, lutetium177, or any excipient of edotreotide or everolimus Prior exposure to any peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) Prior therapy with mTor inhibitors Prior EFR (extended field radiation) to GEPNET lesions or radioembolisation therapy Therapy with an investigational compound and/or medical device within 30 days prior to randomisation Indication for surgical lesion removal with curative potential Planned alternative therapy (for the period of study participation) Serious nonmalignant disease Renal, hepatic, cardiovascular, or haematological organ dysfunction, potentially interfering with the safety of the study treatments Pregnant or breastfeeding.</criteria>
