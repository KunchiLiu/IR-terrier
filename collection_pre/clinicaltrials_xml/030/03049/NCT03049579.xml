	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of a probiotic supplementation on adult volunteers with having caught the common cold more than 4 times in the past year. This study is a single center, double-blind, randomized, controlled, parallel-designed, prospective trial. Subjects received a probiotic drink containing probiotics of Lactobacillus paracasei (108 colony forming units (CFU)/ml), Lactobacilluscasei431® (108CFU/ml) and Lactobacillus fermentiumPCC® (106CFU/ml) or an identical placebo without probiotics for a 12-week study period. The incidence of flue and cold during the study period were compared between study groups. Blood and fecal samples were collected at baseline and at the end of the intervention. Fecal samples were collected for the secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) analysis. Blood sample was drawn for interferon γ (IFN-γ), interleukin 4 (IL-4), interleukin 10 (IL-10), immunoglobulin A (IgA), immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) analysis.</brief_summary>
