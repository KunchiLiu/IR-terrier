	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial studies how well the Enhancing Connections program improves family adjustment in patients with incurable cancer. Participating in an educational program with a co-parent to learn about ways to talk to a child about cancer may help parents and co-parents support their child with the parent's cancer and may help families communicate and function better.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Enhancing Connections Program in Improving Family Adjustment in Patients With Incurable Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Test the feasibility of the study protocol in advanced cancer patients and co-parents (recruitment/retention, dosage and fidelity of the intervention; program acceptability of program; and logistics). II. Evaluate the short-term impact of the program on the diagnosed parents', co-parents' and children's adjustment and family functioning using a within group design (pre- and posttest design). III. Compare outcomes from the Enhancing Connections Palliative Program with similar outcomes obtained from the completed phase III trial (between group design) for the patients and children outcomes. IV. Evaluate the longer term impact of the program on the co-parents' and children's adjustment, including bereavement outcomes when appropriate, using a within and across group design (pre- and posttest design). OUTLINE: Patients and co-parents participate in the Enhancing Connections program consisting of 5 sessions over 1 hour each in the clinic or over the telephone. Session topics include managing cancer-related emotions when talking to children, developing deep listening skills, initiating difficult cancer-related conversations with children, interpreting a child's behavior, recognizing newly acquired gains from the program, and identifying available resources that can be used after program completion. After completion of the study, participants are followed-up at 6 months.</detailed_description>
