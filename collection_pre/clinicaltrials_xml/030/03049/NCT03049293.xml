	<brief_summary>To determine the impact of Midazolam levels in follicular fluid on morpho-kinetics and morpho-genetics. The reason to measure Midazolam levels in larger size follicles in this study is to maximize the chances to get a mature oocyte and therefore develop into a potential embryo to be analyzed.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The correlation of Midazolam levels in follicular fluid and euploid status of the embryos is worth exploring as no data exists that suggests any influence on the quality of the embryos from using this substance for IVF since its earliest days. Measuring time lapsed from injection to first oocyte retrieval as well as time lapsed in between first and last oocyte retrieved will grand insight into the rise of levels of Midazolam inside the follicular fluid, correlated with the chromosomal status and the morphokinetic development of the euploid embryos.</detailed_description>
