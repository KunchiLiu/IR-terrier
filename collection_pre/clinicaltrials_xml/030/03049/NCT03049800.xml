	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to perform longitudinal high-resolution 7T MRI in participants with first-episode psychosis (FEP) enrolled in our ongoing randomized controlled clinical trial (RCT) of cognitive training. The investigators seek to determine whether a 12-week course of intensive cognitive training of auditory processing in young FEP patients delivered remotely as a stand-alone treatment is neuroprotective against neural tissue loss in auditory cortex (superior temporal gyrus, STG), and possibly in other cortical regions. The investigators will also observe the effects of training on white matter integrity in the brain.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study will seek to enroll 60 participants. 40 participants will be considered First Episode Psychosis (FEP) patients, meaning that they have been diagnosed with a psychotic illness with their first psychotic episode occurring within the last two years at time of enrollment. These participants will be recruited from a separate study protocol conducted by Dr. Sophia Vinogradov which examines remote cognitive training in FEP subjects (application in progress). 20 of these participants will receive treatment as usual (TAU), while 20 will be assigned to Targeted Cognitive Training (TCT). Additionally, the investigators will enroll 20 healthy, age and gender matched controls (HC). All participants will undergo 2 MRI scans approximately one year apart. Each MRI scan should last about one hour. The outcome measurements of this study will be changes in functional, structural, and diffusion weight images over time within subjects and between groups.</detailed_description>
