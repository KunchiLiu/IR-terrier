	<detailed_description>Eighteen first year residents were asked to take part in a nine-minute scenario based on an ACLS bradycardia algorithm in which a high-fidelity mannequin required external pacing. The scenario was considered a success if the material was correctly set by the participant to obtain electrical and mechanical pacing in nine minutes. All participants were wearing Tobii Glasses® which is a mobile eye-tracking system that automatically aggregates gaze data. Infrared markers were placed in the simulation room to create Area of Interest (AOI), from which results were obtained. Three AOI were created: the vital signs monitor, the defibrillator/pacing unit and the head of the patient. Eye-tracking data were analyzed using the Tobii Studio® program.</detailed_description>
