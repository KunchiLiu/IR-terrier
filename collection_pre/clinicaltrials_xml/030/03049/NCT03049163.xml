	<brief_summary>Routine anesthesia methods for vitrectomy surgery include retrobulbar and peribulbar anesthesia. However, both methods have potential complications that can vary from minor to severe. Vitrectomy surgery for vitreous floaters is widely considered straighter forward than other vitreoretinal surgeries. Hence, the investigators compared the effect of topical anesthesia (with eye drops) and retrobulbar anesthesia for 27-gauge par plana vitrectomy for symptomatic vitreous floaters.</brief_summary>
