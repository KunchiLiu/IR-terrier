	<brief_summary>The decentralization study will describe children taking antiretroviral therapy (ART) at a larger health facility in the Eastern Cape province of South Africa, between the years of 2004-2013. The study will be conducted at Dora Nginza Hospital (DNH). The study will measure how many children stay in care and how many die, as well as their health status. The study will also compare whether children do better if they stay in care a large hospitals or if they get health care at smaller clinics. A second part of the study will find children in the community who have stopped coming for health care and find out what happened to them and what their health status is.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pediatric Decentralization of ART in South Africa</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators propose to conduct a two part study which will include a retrospective cohort study to examine care outcomes among pediatric patients 0-14 years of age initiated on antiretroviral therapy (ART) in 2004-2013 at a larger peri-urban health facility in the Eastern Cape province of South Africa. The study will be conducted at Dora Nginza Hospital (DNH). The outcomes measured in the study will include retention and mortality, as well as virologic suppression rates for children initiated on ART. In addition to reporting outcomes for all children with available data, the study will compare outcomes for children retained in care at DNH (where they initiated ART) to those children who were referred out after initiation for routine follow-up at community health clinics and primary care clinics ("down referred"). A second part of the study will trace pediatric patients in the community who have been lost to follow-up (LTF) to ascertain their outcomes after they left care at the health facility.</detailed_description>
