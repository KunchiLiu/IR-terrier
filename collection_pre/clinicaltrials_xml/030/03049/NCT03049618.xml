	<brief_summary>This phase IIa trial studies how well recombinant EphB4-HSA fusion protein and pembrolizumab work in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer that has spread to other places in the body or head and neck squamous cell cancer that has come back or spread to other places in the body. Recombinant EphB4-HSA fusion protein may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Giving recombinant EphB4-HSA fusion protein and pembrolizumab may work better in treating patients with non-small cell lung or head and neck squamous cell cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Recombinant EphB4-HSA Fusion Protein and Pembrolizumab, MK-3475</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the response rate of the combination of pembrolizumab and recombinant EphB4-HSA fusion protein (sEphB4-HSA) as combination therapy. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the biomarkers of response. II. Determine the unique toxicities of the combination of pembrolizumab and sEphB4-HSA. OUTLINE: Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1 and recombinant EphB4-HSA fusion protein IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat every 3 weeks for up to 24 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 12 weeks.</detailed_description>

1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) OR measured or calculated creatinine clearance (glomerular filtration rate [GFR] can also be used in place of creatinine or creatinine clearance [CrCl]) &gt;= 60 mL/min for subject with creatinine levels &gt; 1.5 x institutional ULN Serum total bilirubin =&lt; 1.5 x ULN OR direct bilirubin =&lt; ULN for subjects with total bilirubin levels &gt; 1.5 ULN Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (serum glutamicoxaloacetic transaminase [SGOT]) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase [SGPT]) =&lt; 2.5 x ULN OR =&lt; 5 x ULN for subjects with liver metastases Albumin &gt;= 2.5 mg/dL International normalized ratio (INR) or prothrombin time (PT) =&lt; 1.5 x ULN unless subject is receiving anticoagulant therapy as long as PT or partial thromboplastin time (PTT) is within therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulants Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) =&lt; 1.5 x ULN unless subject is receiving anticoagulant therapy as long as PT or PTT is within therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulants Female subject of childbearing potential should have a negative urine or serum pregnancy within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study medication; if the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required Female subjects of childbearing potential must be willing to use an adequate method of contraception for the course of the study through 120 days after the last dose of study medication Note: abstinence is acceptable if this is the usual lifestyle and preferred contraception for the subject Male subjects of childbearing potential must agree to use an adequate method of contraception, starting with the first dose of study therapy through 120 days after the last dose of study therapy Note: abstinence is acceptable if this is the usual lifestyle and preferred contraception for the subject Is currently participating and receiving study therapy or has participated in a study of an investigational agent and received study therapy or used an investigational device within 4 weeks of the first dose of treatment Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving systemic steroid therapy or any other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of trial treatment Has a known history of active TB (Bacillus tuberculosis) Hypersensitivity to pembrolizumab or any of its excipients Has had a prior anticancer monoclonal antibody (mAb) within 4 weeks prior to study day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e., =&lt; grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier Has had prior chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy, or radiation therapy within 2 weeks prior to study day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e., =&lt; grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events due to a previously administered agent Note: subjects with =&lt; grade 2 neuropathy are an exception to this criterion and may qualify for the study Note: if subject received major surgery, they must have recovered adequately from the toxicity and/or complications from the intervention prior to starting therapy Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment; exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin that has undergone potentially curative therapy or in situ cervical cancer Has known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis; subjects with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they are stable (without evidence of progression by imaging for at least four weeks prior to the first dose of trial treatment and any neurologic symptoms have returned to baseline), have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases, and are not using steroids for at least 7 days prior to trial treatment; this exception does not include carcinomatous meningitis which is excluded regardless of clinical stability; known brain metastases are considered active, if any of the following criteria is applicable: Brain imaging during screening demonstrates progression of existing metastases and/or appearance of new lesions compared to brain imaging performed at least 4 weeks earlier Neurological symptoms attributed to brain metastases have not returned to baseline Steroids were used for brain metastases within 28 days of randomization Has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs); replacement therapy (eg., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment Has known history of, or any evidence of active, noninfectious pneumonitis Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with cooperation with the requirements of the trial Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the projected duration of the trial, starting with the prescreening or screening visit through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment Has received prior therapy with an antiPD1, antiPDL1, antiPDL2, or anti cytotoxic Tlymphocyteassociated antigen4 (CTLA4) antibody including ipilimumab or any other antibody or drug specifically targeting Tcell costimulation or checkpoint pathways Has a known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (HIV 1/2 antibodies) Has known active hepatitis B (e.g., hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg] reactive) or hepatitis C (e.g., hepatitis C virus [HCV] ribonucleic acid [RNA] [qualitative] is detected) Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study therapy Note: seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and are allowed;
