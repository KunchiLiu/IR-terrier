	<brief_summary>This study are to: - Evaluate effect of magnetic therapy on peripheral neuropathy in diabetic patients. - Evaluate effect of laser therapy on peripheral neuropathy in diabetic patients. - Compare effects of magnetic therapy with that of laser therapy on peripheral neuropathy in diabetic patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Electromagnetic Therapy Versus Laser Therapy on Peripheral Diabetic Neuropathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sixty- five male and female diabetic patients with peripheral neuropathy will be selected to participate in this study. They will be equally divided into two groups Group-I: Twenty five patient with diabetic peripheral neuropathy will be exposed to low intensity pulsed magnetic therapy Group-II: Twenty five patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy will be exposed for 24 treatment sessions of laser therapy Group-III 15 patient received only medical treatment</detailed_description>
	<criteria>All diabetic patients with peripheral neuropathy will be selected to participate in this study. Their age ranges from 35 to 65 years old. All patients under medical control (optimal blood glucose). such as analgesic medications (e.g. opiates, antidepressants, anticonvulsants and diabetic drugs to control blood glucose). Patients have DPN due to other causes than diabetes Ulcers in either foot Lack of blood sugar control Other nervous system impairments Visual problems Unstable medical conditions Pregnancy Metallic implants Alcohol or drug abuse.</criteria>
