	<brief_summary>Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disorder of neuromuscular transmission, characterized by fluctuating muscle weakness and fatigability. In isolated ocular myasthenia, when only the extraocular muscles are involved, most common ancillary tests, such as acetylcholine receptor autoantibodies and repetitive nerve stimulation, are often negative. A simple, quick and non-invasive test for ocular myasthenia based on ocular vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (oVEMP) was recently developed. The main goal of the study is to validate repetitive oVEMP stimulation in a blinded diagnostic accuracy study in order to facilitate early and accurate diagnosis of ocular myasthenia.</brief_summary>
