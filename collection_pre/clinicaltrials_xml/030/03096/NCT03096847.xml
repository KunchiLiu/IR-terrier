Patient has a histologically and/or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of estrogenreceptor positive and/or progesterone receptor positive and HER2negative breast cancer by local laboratory. Local pathology is sufficient for assessment. Patient must have either: 1. Measurable disease, i.e., at least one measurable lesion as per RECIST 1.1 criteria ). 2.
