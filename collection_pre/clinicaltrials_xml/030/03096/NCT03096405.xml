	<brief_summary>Staphylococcus aureus represents one of the most met germs, with Escherichia coli, during bacteremia. We distinguish at aureus S. two profiles of resistance in beta-lactamines: S. aureus sensitive to the methicillin ( SASM) and the S. aureus resistant to the methicillin ( SARM). With the implementation of the MALDI-TOF, it is now possible to identify the origin responsible of the bacteremia the day of the positivity of the hemoculture ( J0) and to set up a treatment with adapted antibiotic, which, in the case of a sepsis to aureus S., is the vancomycine. Ye it was demonstrated, that the use of the vancomycine on the SASM increased the average duration of stay and a more important rate of relapse. The PCR SARM was organized in the GHPSJ in 2014. It allows from the day of the positivity of the hemoculture ( J0), to determine the phenotype of resistance of S. aureus.</brief_summary>
