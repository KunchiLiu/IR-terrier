	<brief_title>Titanium-Prepared Platelet Rich Fibrin in the Sinus Lifting Procedure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants randomly divided into 2 groups and the test group had a Schneiderian membrane elevation with using balloon lifting technique and after that sinus was filled with T-PRF produced from the patients' blood and 4 months waiting period has been entered. At the end of the 4th month, the bone samples were received from the implant slots and sent to histological evaluation. After 3 months, implant stability was measured and recorded. In the control group, the same procedures were followed and sinus was filled with only allograft. Waiting period was changed to 6 months for this group.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Participants having been diagnosed to display a residual crest height of less than 5mm in posterior maxilla and nonsmokers were included. Participants with blood platelet disorders, infectious and metabolic diseases, ongoing chemotherapy or radiotherapy, history of chronic sinusitis associated with maxillary sinuses, taking any antibiotics and/or antiinflammatory drugs were excluded.</criteria>
