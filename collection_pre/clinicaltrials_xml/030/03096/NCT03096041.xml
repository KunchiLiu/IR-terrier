	<brief_summary>Auriculotherapy is a complementary medicine, with few side effects, without contraindication, inexpensive and not very restrictive.Its efficacy has been found in several tests especially for the treatment of intraoperative pain. It remains more controversial in other indications. Evaluation of the value of auriculotherapy is often difficult because of the methodological limitations of the trials conducted. In the daily practice, the auriculotherapy is proposed to improve the articular pains of patients treated by AA. This Phase III study aims at validate this approach.</brief_summary>
