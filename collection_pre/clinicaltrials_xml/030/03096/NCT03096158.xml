	<brief_summary>Background: Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) due to coronary artery disease (CAD) is one of the main surgical procedures performed in the area of cardiology. Individuals undergoing CABG present sarcopenia, decreased muscle strength of the lower limbs, decreased respiratory muscle strength and dyspnea due to immobility in the bed and the inherent conditions of the disease itself. Cardiorespiratory rehabilitation techniques are rarely used with measurement in hospitals and can greatly favor an early and effective reestablishment to this population in several parameters. Objective: To evaluate the effect of functional electrical stimulation (FES), ventilatory muscle training (TREMVEN), early aerobic training (AERO) and isometric handgrip training (ISO) on the functional capacity, endothelial function and cardiac parameters of individuals undergoing CABG. Methods: In a randomized clinical trial, volunteers will be allocated into four groups: EEF, TREMVEN, AERO or ISO in the preoperative period of CABG. After 48 hours (postoperative midway) of the surgery, the protocol will begin until after hospital discharge. The endpoints evaluated will be: functional capacity, respiratory muscle strength, systolic and diastolic function, arterial endothelial function, inflammatory profile and plasma levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Scientific contributions: Phase 1 cardiorespiratory rehabilitation with alternative interventions may provide an increase in functional capacity, strengthening of respiratory muscles, improvement in cardiac and endothelial functions, as well as increased systemic VEGF levels (myocardial revascularization) and improvement of the inflammatory profile, effectively forwarding the individuals to the rehabilitation phase 2.</brief_summary>
