	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of physical therapy (PT) plus BFR training compared to PT alone (without BFR training) after ACL reconstruction in patients who require extended limited weight bearing through assessment of patient reported outcomes and functional testing. The hypothesis is that PT plus BFR training will mitigate the loss of quadriceps muscle cross-sectional area, strength, and function while also improving early clinical and functional results.</brief_summary>
