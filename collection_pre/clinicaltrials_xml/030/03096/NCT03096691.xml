	<brief_summary>Prematurity is the most important cause of obstetric morbidity and mortality. Health centers and obstetricians are trying to reduce the preterm birth rate by taking into account the permanent effects of premature birth on human life in the early and long term. The most effective solution of preterm delivery is to determine the patients entering the risk group and to prevent preterm labor by putting the correct diagnosis at the right time. Recently, there have been studies on the efficacy of pessary practice in preventing preterm birth, but with the positive results of these studies, there has been hope for early birth prevention as well as other treatments. The aim of this study is; To assess the effectiveness of pessary use in patients with high risk for preterm labor and prophylactic cervical length less than 25 mm below 25 weeks and with a history of cervical insufficiency.</brief_summary>
