	<brief_title>Non-cardiac Chest Pain: Effect of Cognitive Therapy Administered as Guided Self-help</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Most patients with chest pain referred to hospital do not have a cardiac illness. Non-cardiac chest pain (NCCP) is often followed by persistent distress and reduced quality of life, and societal costs are nearly equal to those of cardiac patients. Research suggests that face-to-face CBT is effective, but this has not been implemented as standard treatment. We plan to test an easily implementable web-based guided self-help intervention for NCCP patients. Patients will be recruited at the chest pain unit at SÃ¸rlandet Hospital, Kristiansand, and will be recruited after they have finished their cardiac examination. The intervention group will receive six web-based sessions, comprising information, exposure to physical activity, how worry can excess pain, physical reactions to pain and worry, consequences of avoidance, and specific panic treatment.</detailed_description>
