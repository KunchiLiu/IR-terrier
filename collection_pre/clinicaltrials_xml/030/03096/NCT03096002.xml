	<brief_title>Small Steps for Big Changes: A Lifestyle Program to Reduce the Risk of Developing Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study is a one-group repeated measures design and the primary outcome is exercise adherence at 12 months post the 3-week supervised exercise program. There is no randomization of individuals to conditions. Exercise adherence will be measured using self-report physical activity (using the Godin leisure time exercise questionnaire) and a subsample will also wear tri-axial accelerometers to measure total time spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity assessed over 7 days. Secondary outcomes include physical fitness, haemoglobin A1C, quality of life, self-regulatory efficacy, anthropometrics, diet and exercise-related cognitive errors. The 3-week lifestyle program includes six sessions with a lifestyle coach and exercise sessions performed at home. These sessions will focus on regular healthy lifestyle that includes walking (or exercise of any kind) at least three times per week and will highlight simple dietary strategies that are linked to reduced risk of T2D. The 3-week supervised exercise program includes brief exercise counseling sessions that teach participants self-regulatory skills to promote independence and long-term adherence to exercise and a healthy diet. At the conclusion of the three-week program, participants will be asked to continue exercising a minimum of three times per week for twelve months on their own.</detailed_description>
