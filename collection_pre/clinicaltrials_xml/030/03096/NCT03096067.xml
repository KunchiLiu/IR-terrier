	<brief_summary>The purpose of this project is to investigate if the magnitude of a loading based 12 weeks rehabilitation regime for patellar tendinopathy influence the clinical outcome, tendon structure and function. The investigators hypothesize that a greater magnitude (90% of 1RM) of loading will yield a more positive clinical outcome, tendon structure and function in patients with patellar tendinopathy compared to a lower magnitude of loading (55% of 1 RM) when total exercise volume is equal in both groups.</brief_summary>
