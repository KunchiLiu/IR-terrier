	<brief_summary>The purpose of the current study is to investigate in a prospective randomized cross-over trial, the impact of alcohol versus a placebo drink on smoking behavior and topography (duration and frequency of puffing), abuse liability, and toxicity. It is hypothesized that drinking alcohol before smoking will be associated with longer puffs and shorter duration between puffs and greater abuse liability and toxicity.</brief_summary>
