	<brief_summary>This study investigates cold-induced brown fat activation assessed using PET/MR scans. Subjects will participate in an acute cooling intervention day and a thermoneutral intervention day with PET/MR scans on both days. A secondary purpose is to make a validation of an infrared thermography camera by comparison of skin temperatures and SUV of the supraclavicular brown adipose tissue.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cold Induced Activation of Brown Adipose Tissue in Humans</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The field of human brown adipose tissue (BAT) research is focused on activation of BAT as a means of manipulating energy expenditure and potentially anti-obesity and anti-diabetic properties of the tissue. This is well established in rodent studies and explained as due to the specific brown fat uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1). Despite increasing evidence that indicates a metabolic regulatory role of BAT in humans, BAT activation/recruitment is not fully understood and even less is known about the endocrine capacities of human BAT. Cold induced brown fat activity will be assessed with PET/MR scans and validate an infra-red thermography camera, as well as perform a proteomic screening using blood samples under these two intervention days. 15 healthy lean male subjects will serve as their own control in a cross-over randomized control study, including a pre-examination day, a thermoneutral-day and a cooling test-day with cold exposure followed by a PET/MR scan to determine BAT activity. An extra cooling day is applied for the external validation of the infrared thermography camera. Blood samples and abdominal fat-biopsies will be taken at thermoneutral condition and under cold stimulation of brown fat.</detailed_description>
