To determine the feasibility of individuals with metastatic brain tumor(s) to engage in physical activity(PA) and cognitive rehabilitation (CR) as in an outpatient therapy setting.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Impact of Cognitive Rehab &amp; Physical Activity on Exec Functioning Following Radiation Therapy (RT) for Cerebral Mets</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rolling recruitment for the study. Participants will be randomized into one of three treatment arms. All treatment arms will undergo physical &amp; cognitive testing prior to whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT)/stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). Arm 3 will receive cognitive rehabilitation intervention sessions prior to, and concurrent with, WBRT/SRS. Approximately 14 days following WBRT/SRS: all arms will undergo physical and cognitive testing, and: Arm 1 will begin physical activity intervention. Arm 2 will begin physical activity intervention and cognitive intervention. Arm 3 will continue with cognitive intervention and begin physical activity intervention. All Arms will undergo physical and cognitive testing approximately 2.5 months post WBRT/SRS.</detailed_description>
