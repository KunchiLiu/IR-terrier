	<brief_summary>The objective of the study is to evaluate whether a less intensive intervention, Guided Self-Help Family Based Treatment (gshFBT), is non-inferior to the more intensive Family Based Treatment (FBT) for childhood obesity on child weight loss over 18-months. Cost-effectiveness of both treatments will also be compared.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The primary aim of this project is to determine whether gshFBT is non-inferior to FBT for childhood obesity on child weight loss. Four assessments will be conducted; baseline (month 0), month 6 (post-treatment), and at month 12 and month 18. Assessments will include the following for child and parent: anthropometry, physical activity, nutrition, and cost-effectiveness. Cost-effectiveness will be calculated from a societal perspective and a third party payor perspective. This program of research has the potential to advance the standard of practice for children who are overweight or obese by providing a less intensive but more cost-effective intervention.</detailed_description>
