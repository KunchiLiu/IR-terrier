	<brief_summary>The investigators sought to evaluate the morphological and functional changes, risk stratification and prognosis of patients of participants with compete left bundle branch block (CLBBB). The conduction of this study was largely due to the increased clinical requirement, which reflected the increased awareness among physicians of heart failure due to asynchronous cardiac function caused by CLBBB. The investigators also aim to figure out the time point or CMR parameters for cardiac resynchronization therapy in patients with CLBBB.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The effect of cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) for heart failure patients was heterogeneous. Candidate selection was important before intervention. The underlying mechanical dyssynchrony of left ventricular bundle branch block was insufficiently descripted. Earlier study of investigators found novel imaging methods such as cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging including T1 Mapping(1-3) and feature tracking(4-6) imaging can provide more detailed information about regional and global LV function in patients. While the role of new cardiac MR imaging techniques in predicting CRT responses, especially in LBBB patients, is still insufficient (7-10). Z Chen et al used T1 mapping technique to quantitatively assess the diffuse fibrosis burden of myocardial in heart failure patients. But they found focal fibrosis burden, not diffuse burden, is associated with a poor response to CRT(11). Other cardiac MR imaging parameters also showed potential predictors of CRT, such as 16 segment time-to-maximum radial wall thickness , scar locations and RV septal lead placement et al. (12-14).In this study cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (including T1 Mapping combined with feature tracking imaging ) will be applied to follow up LV function in LBBB patients (with or without intervention) in 10 years to find out prognostic predictors and time point or CMR parameters for cardiac resynchronization therapy in patients with CLBBB.
