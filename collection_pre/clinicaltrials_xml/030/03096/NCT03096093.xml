	<brief_summary>This study evaluates four different doses of ACIT-1 for safety and for the ability to raise effective anti-cancer immune responses in patients with pancreatic and other late stage cancers. Approximately half of the patients will have pancreatic cancer and the other half will have other late stage cancers.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Investigation of a Therapeutic Vaccine (ACIT-1) in Late Stage Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The immune system has an important role in helping prevent cancer by destroying early cancer cells. When cancer does develop antigen-specific immune (T) cells are still present in the blood but are either not responding or are not effective. Vaccines stimulate these T cells to respond and kill cancer cells. ACIT-1 is designed to stimulate tumour antigen-specific T cells to respond and kill cancer cells.</detailed_description>

Concurrent use of immunosuppressive drugs, in particular systemic steroid therapy, above a threshold of 10mg per day prednisolone equivalent Evidence of active infection e.g. Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, HIV or syphilis Chemotherapy, radiotherapy or biological therapy within 28 days of treatment with the exception of gemcitabine for pancreatic cancer patients Participation in another investigational medicinal product trial within 28 days of treatment Other vaccination within previous 4 weeks Antibody treatment within previous 3 months Major surgery within the 14 days preceding the screening visit Scheduled elective surgery or other procedures requiring general anaesthesia during the study Graft transplantation recipient Active systemic autoimmune and allergic disease Pregnant or lactating females Significant renal or hepatic impairment as defined by the following: Serum creatinine ≥ 1.5 x upper limit of normal and/or GFR ≤ 40 ml/min. Total bilirubin ≥ 1.5 x upper limit of normal; and AST/ALT ≥ 5 x upper limit of normal Life threatening illness unrelated to the patient's cancer Previous history of serious adverse allergic reaction to any medication Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements Any other significant disease or disorder which, in the opinion of the Investigator, may either put the participant at risk because of participation in the study, or may influence the result of the study, or the participant's ability to participate in the study.</criteria>
