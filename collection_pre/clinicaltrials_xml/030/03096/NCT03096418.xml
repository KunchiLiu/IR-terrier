	<brief_summary>The hypothesis of this study is that paclitaxel levels increase chromosomal instability (CIN) in tumors and this is lethal to tumors that have pre-existing CIN. Treatment will be administered on an outpatient basis. Paclitaxel will be initiated as standard infusions on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 1-day cycle. Participants will continue with paclitaxel for cycles 2-4 prior to surgery.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Women with pathologically demonstrated breast cancer Patients must be candidates for neoadjuvant paclitaxel chemotherapy by their treating oncologist Patients must not have metastatic disease on staging workup with chest imaging, CBC, and liver function studies. A formalinfixed paraffin embedded tumor block (preferred) or unstained slides must be available from a prior biopsy of the primary tumor. A minimum of 8 slides must be available. The primary tumor must be readily biopsied by surgery or radiology teams. The primary tumor must be measurable by an imaging modality prior to treatment. This imaging modality is to be repeated after completion of 4 cycles of paclitaxel and prior to surgery. Such imaging modalities may include ultrasound, CT, mammography, or MRI. MRI will be the preferred imaging modality if available because it has the highest accuracy and positive predictive value for predicting pathologic complete response.All imaging will be performed per standard of care at the discretion of the treating physicians. Subjects may not have had prior systemic chemotherapy or targeted therapy regimens administered for treatment of their current breast cancer. Patients must have adequate organ and marrow function as determined by the treating oncologist. Patient must be willing to undergo additional biopsy of breast tumor. Patient must have the ability and willingness to sign a written informed consent document. Women of childbearing potential must agree to use effective contraception as discussed with treating oncologist for the duration of the study. Patients who have had systemic chemotherapies, targeted therapies or radiotherapy for any cancer within 5 years prior to entering the study. History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to paclitaxel including to other drugs formulated in Cremophor(R) EL (polyoxyethylated castor oil). Patients with known HIV due to concern that chemotherapy may cause further immunosuppression and potential infectious complications. Patients on nonaspirin anticoagulation (Coumadin, heparins, or clopidogrel) or with documented bleeding disorders will be excluded due to risk of bleeding with biopsy. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active severe infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, other malignancies requiring therapy or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because paclitaxel is a pregnancy category D drug and may cause deleterious effects to the fetus. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with paclitaxel, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is enrolled in the trial.</criteria>
