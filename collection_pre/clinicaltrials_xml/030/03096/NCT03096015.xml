	<brief_summary>An intensive, interdisciplinary treatment program was administered during the summer as part of regular clinic services in the Aphasia Resource Center (ARC) at Sargent College. This program was run program as described for three years. Not more than six native English speakers with mild or moderate profiles of aphasia and multidisciplinary rehabilitation needs (OT,PT, SLP and nutrition) were recruited from the Boston community to participate in an intensive interdisciplinary treatment program for four weeks during the month of June 2013. The program consists of approximately six hours of interdisciplinary treatment each day, five days per week over a four-week interval. Treatment is individualized using current evidence-based treatment approaches, which are commonly accepted protocols in clinical practice and will be administered by clinical faculty and staff from Speech-Language and Hearing Sciences, Occupational Therapy (OT), Physical Therapy (PT), the Center for Neurorehabilitation and Nutrition. Segments of these types of treatments are available for a small fee as part of our service in the Aphasia Resource Center; however, this comprehensive, interdisciplinary program is not available of this research study. Approximately 30 hours of therapy per week are provided -- 6 hours per day over 5 days consisting of Speech-language Pathology, Physical Therapy, Occupational Therapy, and Nutrition Counseling.</brief_summary>
