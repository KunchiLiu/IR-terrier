	<brief_summary>AIM : To determine the efficacy of cold saline irrigation in reduction of post operative pain following root canal therapy. METHODOLOGY : Forty patients requiring root canal treatment on permanent single rooted teeth were included. The patients were assigned randomly into two groups of 20 patients each. The teeth in Group1 (n = 20) were irrigated using normal saline solution, whilst those in Group 2 (n = 20) were irrigated with cold saline solution stored at 4 degrees centigrade. A Heft Parker visual analog scale was used to measure pre-operative pain and post-obturation pain at 12, 24,48 and 72 hours after obturation. Chi square tests and Mann Whitney U tests were used for statistical analysis.</brief_summary>
