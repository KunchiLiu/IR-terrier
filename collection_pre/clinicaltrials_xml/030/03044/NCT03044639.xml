	<brief_summary>The randomized, double-blind, multi-centric study performed in four parallel groups to compare all lipid emulsions, which can be used as a part of PN. Patients with home parenteral nutrition due to stable intestinal failure, were randomly assigned to receive parenteral nutrition with one the following lipid emulsions: - Long-chained triglycerides (LCT group) - Medium/ long-chained triglycerides MCT/LCT (50:50, MCT/LCT group)) - Olive oil/ LCT (80:20, OO group)) - SMOFlipid (Omega-3/ olive oil/ MCT/ LCT, SMOF group)</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Intravenous lipid emulsion (IVLE) is the essential component of parenteral nutrition (PN), because it is a very efficient source of energy and essential fatty acids (FA).The prevalence of abnormal liver function tests during PN varies from 15 to 85%, according to most authors.[19-21] The severity of IFALD depends also on underlying disease, especially ongoing sepsis and pre-existing liver disease. A study comparing all lipid emulsions, which can be used as a part of PN, has never been done. The aim of the study was to compare the clinical value of the four most popular intravenous lipid emulsions in regards to the liver function in long term intestinal failure patients.Patients with home parenteral nutrition due to stable intestinal failure, were randomly assigned to receive parenteral nutrition with one the following lipid emulsions: - Long-chained triglycerides (LCT group) - Medium/ long-chained triglycerides MCT/LCT (50:50, MCT/LCT group)) - Olive oil/ LCT (80:20, OO group)) - SMOFlipid (Omega-3/ olive oil/ MCT/ LCT, SMOF group) Randomization was performed after assessment and check for in-/exclusion criteria if the patient has met all study eligibility requirements. The test emulsion became a part of regular PN admixture, which was used to feed patient at home. The study was performed for 12 months.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. chronic intestinal failure (CIF) receiving HPN including lipids 2. metabolic stability on HPN for more than three months (metabolic stability = the absence of pathological laboratory resulting in the change of PN regime for at least one month) 3. 1.0 g lipids/kg body weight per day as a part of PN 1. Existing liver failure: an elevation of SGOT, SGTP, total bilirubin, GGTP, alkaline phosphatase of more than 1.5 times x normal value 2. Patients in whom PN was interrupted for longer than 4 continuous weeks in the preceding 6 months 3. Patients with history of cancer and anticancer treatment within the last 5 years 4. Severe hyperlipidemia 5. Severe coagulopathy 6. Severe renal insufficiency 7. Acute thromboembolic events 8. Positive test for HIV, Hepatitis B or C (from medical history) 9.
