	<brief_summary>BACKGROUND Recent evidence has been published about the effectiveness for the secondary prevention of osteoporotic fractures (OF) of the hospital-based fracture liaison services. AIM To assess the effectiveness of a primary care based intervention in the secondary prevention of OF. METHODOLOGY Prospective study of random clusters, defined at the primary-care trust (PCT) level. Total study follow-up 3 years. Sample size 1800 patients. DESCRIPTION To launch a defined strategy for the identification of OF. To carry out a primary care based intervention about lifestyle, diet and drug prescription, if needed, with an intensive follow-up in the intervention PCT vs treatment as usual in the control branch. ANALYSIS As the outcome are the new OF, a survival analysis will be done. Risk factors will be analyzed through Cox proportional hazard regression model stratified by age groups. Outcomes : - new OF ratio in intervention vs control areas. - maintenance of the adherence to the pharmacological and non pharmacological interventions proposed - assessment of cost-effectivity of the intervention</brief_summary>
