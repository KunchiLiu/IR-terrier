	<detailed_description>Enteroendocrine K and L cells are pivotal in regulating appetite and glucose homeostasis, but knowledge of their distribution in man is sparse and it is unknown whether alterations occur in type 2 diabetes. Twelve patients with type 2 diabetes and 12 age and BMI-matched healthy individuals underwent upper and lower double-balloon enteroscopy with mucosal biopsy retrieval from every ~30 cm of the small intestine and specific locations in the large intestine. The investigators evaluated the distribution of enteroendocrine cells (using IHC staining for their specific hormonal products) and evaluated mRNA expression of the corresponding genes along the entire intestinal tract in patients with type 2 diabetes and in healthy individuals.</detailed_description>
