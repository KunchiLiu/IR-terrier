	<brief_summary>Congenital lung anomalies include different pathologies such as congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation, pulmonary sequestration, bronchial atresia, emphysema, bronchogenic cyst. They concern less than 1/10000 births and their physiopathological origin is still poorly understood. The main goal of this project is to pool the cases from different swiss centers on a prospective cohort study, first to increase knowledge of clinical and radiological evolution and their correlation with histological data, and second to analyse the pathological embryological mechanism underlying these malformations.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1. To register prospectively clinical, biological, radiological and histological datas in a multicentric database (secured internet link, via SecutrialÂ® software). for children with prenatal diagnosis of this kind of malformation. This study is conducted by a multidisciplinary team, involving obstetricians, neonatologists, pneumologists, pediatric surgeons, radiologists and anatomopathologists. 2. To create a tissue biobank Outcomes: 1. Contribute to the definition of a standardized procedure at the Swiss level for the treatment of patients suffering from these malformations, 2. Improve the assessment of lesion evolution related to CLA, and 3. Possibly validate some biomarkers, which could help to identify individuals at risk. On the long term, these results could also support the development of innovative therapies targeting the factors involved in lung development.</detailed_description>
