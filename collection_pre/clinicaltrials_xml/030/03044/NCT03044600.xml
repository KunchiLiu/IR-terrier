	<brief_summary>Objectives: 1. To better define the differences in molecular genetics of parathyroid tumors in patients with MEN1, single gland parathyroid disease in patients less than 50 years old and single gland disease in patients greater than 50 years old. 2. To better define the incidence of HRPT2 mutation in young patients with primary hyperparathyroidism and determine whether routine testing in these patients is indicated.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patient charts will be reviewed to collect demographic data, pre-operative and post-operative clinical and laboratory data, operative reports, and pathology reports. Archived formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks from surgical specimens of patients will be stained for parafibromin to evaluate for HRPT2 mutations.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. All patients previously enrolled in parathyroid tissue banking under protocol Lab080034. 2. For the subgroup designated for HRPT2 mutation testing: Patients with primary hyperparathyroidism who are younger than 50 years of age and have tested negative for MEN1, between January 1, 1980 and the present.</criteria>
