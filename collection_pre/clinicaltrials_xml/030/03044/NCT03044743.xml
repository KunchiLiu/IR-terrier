	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the safety of PD-1 knockout EBV-CTL cells in treating EBV (Epstein-Barr virus) positive advanced stage malignancies. Blood samples will also be collected for research purposes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PD-1 Knockout EBV-CTLs for Advanced Stage Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) Associated Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a study of CRISPR-Cas9 mediated PD-1 knockout-T cells from autologous origin. Patients are assigned to receive 4 circles of cell therapy. The safety and clinical response are evaluated. Biomarkers and immunological markers are also monitored.</detailed_description>
