	<brief_summary>The primary purpose of our study is to conduct a pilot, practice-based intervention focused on increasing adherence to the 6As for youth ages 11 through 17 years. The 6As are: (1) "Anticipate" (future use), (2) "Ask" (about tobacco use), (3) "Advise" (advise the patient to quit using tobacco), (4) "Assess" (the patient's readiness to quit using tobacco), (5) "Assist" (by setting a quit date, providing materials on quitting tobacco, providing tobacco cessation medications, and referring the patient for additional services and/or counseling) , and (6) "Arrange" (by re-contacting the patient after their quit date and arranging a follow-up visit).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Investigators will incorporate American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) best practice recommendations to screen and counsel parents. The specific aims of this study are to: (1) Develop and deploy an electronic short screening tool for tobacco and nicotine product use into pediatric primary care workflow in conjunction with clinician and office staff training on the 6As and parent screening through the use of trained Clinical Practice Facilitators, clinician-engaged adaptations of the intervention to fit their practice workflow, and support for Maintenance of Certification (MOC) to engage pediatricians in implementing the best practices; (2) Gather pilot data about the effectiveness of the intervention on clinician adherence to best practices and changes in practice capacity for change, adaptive reserve, and clinician self-efficacy; and (3) Examine the congruence between documentation of the intervention in the electronic health record (EHR) and youth report of the intervention.</detailed_description>
