	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to evaluate efficacy and safety of VTE prophylaxis by the combination of graduated compression stockings (GCS), standard doses of low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWH) and sequential compression device (SCD) in the mixed group of surgical patients at high and extremely high risk for venous thromboembolism.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intermittent Pneumatic Compression in Surgical Patients at Extremely-high Risk for Venous Thromboembolism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is the most common complication after major surgery, especially in high-risk patients. But the high-risk group is inhomogeneous. Some patients included in this group have an extremely high prevalence of postoperative venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, in whom the standard complex prophylaxis with elastic compression and standard anticoagulation is less effective. This is particularly so, in patients having a Caprini score of 11 and more, so that at the background of standard prophylaxis postoperative DVT is 10 times higher. This group of patients needs a more effective protocol for VTE prevention. Sequential compression devices (SCD) combined with graduated elastic compression stockings (GCS) or without them were found to be effective in the prevention of VTE in high-risk patients, especially after neurosurgical interventions, even without the administration of anticoagulants. However, their efficacy in patients at "extremely high risk", having 11+ Caprini scores has not been assessed yet. The aim of the current study is to evaluate efficacy and safety of VTE prophylaxis by the combination of graduated compression stockings (GCS), standard doses of low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWH) and sequential compression device (SCD) in the mixed group of surgical patients at high and extremely high risk for venous thromboembolism The expected outcome of the study is a reduction of asymptomatic postoperative venous thrombosis rate in the hospital and reduction in all VTE during 6 months after discharge.</detailed_description>
