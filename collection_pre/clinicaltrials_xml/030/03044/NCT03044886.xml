	<brief_title>Effects of Vitamin D on Moderate to Severe Periodontitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by periodontal tissues inflammation and alveolar bone loss. Vitamin D is involved in stimulating osteoblasts to enable normal bone growth and preservation, also the regulation of cellular proliferation, differentiation, innate immune response and anti-inflammatory effect.Previous studies have reported the association of vitamin D levels and gingivitis and periodontitis. This study was designed as a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effect of vitamin D supplementation on chronic periodontitis. The study was divided into two phases. Recruitment including baseline clinical measurements was obtained and standard periodontal treatments were performed in Phase One. The randomization and intervention of vitamin D were performed in Phase Two. The 323 subjects were randomly divided into 3 groups (n=105,110,108) to receive a supplement kit containing 90 capsules of 2000 IU vitamin D, 1000 IU vitamin D, or placebo capsule for 3 months. After intervention, all the subjects were followed up after 3 months and received standard periodontal examination, including attachment loss (AL), probing depth (PD), bleeding index (BI), and panoramic radiographs were taken to evaluate alveolar crest height (ACH).</detailed_description>
