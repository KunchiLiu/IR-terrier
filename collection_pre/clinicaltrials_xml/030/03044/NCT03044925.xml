	<brief_title>Remote Magnetic Navigation-guided Ablation Versus Cryoablation for Persistent Atrial Fibrillation (RECREATION Study)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1. Compare the efficacy of remote magnetic navigation-guided ablation and cryoablation for patients with persistent atrial fibrillation. 2. Compare the safety of remote magnetic navigation-guided ablation and cryoablation for patients with persistent atrial fibrillation. 3. Compare the procedural parameters of remote magnetic navigation-guided ablation and cryoablation for patients with persistent atrial fibrillation. 4. Compare the effects of amiodarone on recurrence after these two different ablation procedures.</detailed_description>
