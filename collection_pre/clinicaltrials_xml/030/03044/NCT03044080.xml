	<brief_summary>Clinical randomized clinical trial to assess the effectiveness on walking speed of repeated use of botulinum neurotoxin type A (BoNT/A)in the post-stroke spastic equinovarus foot in three successive infiltrations at 6-month intervals, checking if the sustainability of the effect is greater in incobotulinumtoxin A (Xeomin®) than in onabotulinumtoxinA (Botox®).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Botulinum Neurotoxin Type A (BoNT/A) Free of Complexing Proteins in the Spastic Equinovarus Foot</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Spasticity is present in 38% of patients at six months after stroke. Equinovarus foot, with or without claw toes and striatal foot, is especially common. There is a weak to moderate evidence in favor of the use of botulinum neurotoxin type A (BoNT/A) in the equinovarus foot, stiff-knee and in other patterns that may interfere with gait ability. Specifically, BoNT/A increases walking speed in stroke patients with spastic equinovarus foot. Repeated use of BoNT/A may lead to the appearance of neutralizing antibodies, so its effect may decrease over successive infiltrations. Among the differential characteristics of incobotulinumtoxinA (Xeomin®) there is a reduced inactivated botulinum neurotoxin content and the lack of complexing proteins, which would diminish antigenicity and not suppose a decrease of the effect before successive infiltrations. The objective of this project is to determine the effect on walking speed of repeated use of BoNT/A in post-stroke spinal equinovarus foot in three consecutive injections at 6-month intervals and to investigate whether the sustainability of the effect is greater in incobotulinumtoxinA (Xeomin®) than in onabotulinumtoxinA (Botox®). All patients will receive 200-300 units of BoNT/A (Xeomin ® or Botox ®) that will be distributed according to the individual clinical pattern of spastic equinovarus foot.</detailed_description>
