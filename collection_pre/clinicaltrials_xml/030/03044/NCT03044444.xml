	<brief_summary>In this study, the effect of citrus extract on exercise performance will be investigated. The study consists of three groups: one group will receive a high dose citrus extract, one group will receive a low dose citrus extract and the last group will receive a placebo. After four and eight weeks the effects on performance are measured through a Triple Wingate cycling test, handgrip strength, vertical jump and 1600m run trial. It is expected that exercise performance will increase in the citrus extract groups, compared to the placebo group.</brief_summary>
