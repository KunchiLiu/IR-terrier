	<brief_summary>Peripheral regional anesthesia induces a sympathectomy-like effect with neurovascular changes causing increased arterial blood flow and venodilatation . Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) can be applied to different kinds of tissue providing oxygen saturation by detecting the absorption and reflection of near-infrared light . The effect on peripheral tissue oxygenation in patients undergoing arteriovenous fistula revision has not yet been examined. We postulate an increase in tissue oxygenation by sympathicolysis caused by peripheral regional anesthesia that might be the reason for beneficial outcome. The aim of our study was to demonstrate the effect of a supraclavicular plexus block in this group of patients.</brief_summary>
