	<brief_summary>It's a multi-center, prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial of cryoballoon versus radiofrequency ablation for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of RF and crYoballoon ablatiOn Therapy of AF（CRYO-AF）</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The hypothesis of this study is that pulmonary vein isolation with cryoballoon ablation is not inferior to radiofrequency ablation with 3D mapping with respect to clinical safety and efficacy.</detailed_description>
