Have had an Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) or a computed tomography (CT) scan concurrent with or following the diagnosis of probable AD, to exclude prior stroke or structural brain disease Have a reliable caregiver/study informant who provides written informed consent to participate and who is in frequent contact with the patient (defined as spending at least 4 hours/day at least 4 days/week with the patient and who is knowledgeable about the patient's daytime and nighttime behaviors). The caregiver/study informant must be able to communicate with site personnel, and opinion of the investigator, must understand the written protocolspecified questionnaires. If a caregiver/study informant cannot continue, a replacement caregiver will be allowed if the above criterion is met Are receiving acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs) on stable doses ≥3 months prior to or during the study, or in the opinion of the investigator will be likely to remain on a stable treatment regimen for 6 months. Patients not being treated with AChEIs are also eligible for study enrollment Have venous access sufficient to allow for blood sampling per the protocol Have clinical laboratory test results within normal reference range for the population or investigative site Are capable of participating in all study assessments Are able and willing to provide consent (patients and caregivers/study informants) Have a history of significant psychotic disorders prior to or simultaneous with the probable diagnosis of AD (including, but not limited to, schizophrenia and bipolar affective disorder) Meet National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke/Association International pour la Recherche et l'Enseignement en Neurosciences criteria for vascular dementia Have an MRI or CT scan (on file since the onset of symptoms of AD) that is inconsistent with a probable diagnosis of AD Meet Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental DisordersFifth Edition (DSMV) criteria for delirium. Have renal impairment as defined by Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) &lt;45 milliliters per minute per 1.73 square meters (ml/min/1.73m2) Have psychosis from nonADassociated etiologies (for example, substance abuse or a diagnosis of psychosis prior to the development of AD) Have significant cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, renal, hematologic, or oncologic comorbidities that could impact patient safety and study participation over 10 weeks Have a history of seizures or other condition that would place the patient at increased risk of seizures. Are, in the investigator's judgment, at risk for suicide, or as indicated by the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (CSSRS) Have a Fridericia's corrected QT interval (QTcF) greater than (&gt;) 450 milliseconds (ms) for males or 470 ms for females Use any antipsychotics or any other drug intended to treat psychosis during the study. If the patient is taking the medication prior to study entry, there must be a washout period Are currently enrolled in any other clinical trial involving an investigational product or any other type of medical research judged not to be scientifically or medically compatible with this study Have participated, within the last 30 days, in a clinical trial involving an investigational product. If the previous investigational product has a long halflife, at least 3 months (or more) must have passed In the opinion of the investigator or sponsor, are unsuitable for inclusion in the study</criteria>
