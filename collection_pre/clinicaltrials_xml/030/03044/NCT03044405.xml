	<brief_summary>The aims of the study are: 1. To evaluate the feasibility of echocardiography monitoring in postoperative unit; 2. To assess diagnostic value of different focussed echocardiography parameters to define fluid responsiveness for non-cardiac hypotensive spontaneously breathing patients after major abdominal surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Focused Assessed Echocardiography to Predict Fluid Responsiveness</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>As there are different strategies of perioperative fluid management discussion which is the choice liberal or restrictive one occurs? Individualized infusion therapy should be the goal. The investigators hypothesize extended hemodynamic monitoring based on focused transthoracic echocardiography enable to differentiate the cause of hypotension more carefully and fluid overload will be avoided after major abdominal surgery. The goals of the study are: - To conduct one group of hypotensive patients after major abdominal surgery. To divide this group into responders and nonresponders after fluid challenge. - To evaluate the feasibility of echocardiography monitoring in postoperative unit (having in mind such restrains as supine position, postoperative pain, bandages etc.) - To compare the evaluation of fluid responsiveness by clinical signs and focused assessed echocardiography data. - To identify the best focused echocardiography parameters for prognosis of fluid responsiveness. - To determine if extended hemodynamic monitoring changes postoperative fluid management.</detailed_description>
