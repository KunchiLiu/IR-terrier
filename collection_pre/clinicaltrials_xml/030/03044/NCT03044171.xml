	<brief_title>Evaluation of the Effect of Fluoride and Laser Application on the Prevention of Sensitivity in Bleached Teeth</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective of this double blind, randomized and controlled clinical study, was to evaluate the efficacy of 1.1% sodium fluoride associated with LLLT (Low Level Laser Therapy) on teeth that were exposed to 35% hydrogen peroxide during 4 weeks of bleaching treatment. Methods: 25 volunteers were evaluated through the split-mouth model, where the hemiarcates were ranzomized and later allocated in one of the experimental groups: G-FLUOR+LASER - constitutes the group treated with LLLT + 1.1% sodium fluoride; and G-FLUOR - constitutes the group treated with placebo + 1.1% sodium fluoride .</detailed_description>
