	<brief_summary>The study is intended to evaluate whether monthly repeated courses of administration of GSK2315698 followed by GSK2398852 is associated with a reduction in cardiac amyloid load in patients with cardiac amyloidosis, monitored by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) and echocardiography (ECHO), and whether this is associated with an improvement in cardiac function. Cohort 1 is transthyretin cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM) , cohort 2 is patients with immunoglobulin light chain (AL) systemic amyloidosis at greater than 6 months post chemotherapy, cohort 3 newly diagnosed AL systemic amyloidosis undergoing chemotherapy. Primary objectives for the study are assessment of reduction in cardiac amyloid load after repeated administrations of Anti-SAP treatment as evaluated by CMR in all study groups and assessment of safety &amp; tolerability of repeated administration of Anti-SAP treatment, including compatibility with chemotherapy treatment in patients with AL systemic amyloidosis. This is an open label, non-randomised, three-group, monthly repeat Anti-SAP treatment study in systemic amyloidosis patients with cardiac dysfunction caused by cardiac amyloidosis. Subjects will receive up to 6 courses of Anti-SAP treatment. Maximum total duration for a subject in the study is approximately 18 months.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Between 18 and 80 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the informed consent. Male and female. Males: Male subjects with female partners of child bearing potential must comply with the following contraception requirements from the time of first dose of study medication for a cycle of spermatogenesis following five terminal halflives after the last dose of study medication. Vasectomy with documentation of azoospermia. Male condom plus partner use of one of the contraceptive options below: Contraceptive subdermal implant, Intrauterine device or intrauterine system, Combined Oral Contraceptive or Injectable progestogen, Contraceptive vaginal ring, Percutaneous contraceptive patches . This is an allinclusive list of those methods that meet the following GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) definition of highly effective: having a failure rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly and, when applicable, in accordance with the product label. For nonproduct methods (e.g., male sterility), the investigator determines what is consistent and correct use. The GSK definition is based on the definition provided by the International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH). The investigator is responsible for ensuring that subjects understand how to properly use these methods of contraception. Females A female subject is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant (as confirmed by a negative Urine human chorionic gonadotrophin [hCG] test), not lactating, and at least one of the following conditions applies: • Nonreproductive potential defined as: Premenopausal females with one of the following: Documented tubal ligation; Documented hysteroscopic tubal occlusion procedure with followup confirmation of bilateral tubal occlusion; Hysterectomy; Documented Bilateral Oophorectomy. Postmenopausal defined as: 60 years old; Twelve(12) months of spontaneous amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile, e.g. age appropriate, &gt; 45 years, in the absence of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) or medical suppression of the menstrual cycle (e.g. leuprolide treatment) in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and oestradiol levels consistent with menopause (refer to laboratory reference ranges for confirmatory levels). Females on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the highly effective contraception methods if they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status prior to study enrolment. • Reproductive potential and agrees to follow one of the options listed in the Modified List of Highly Effective Methods for Avoiding Pregnancy in Females of Reproductive Potential (FRP) (As mentioned in study protocol) from 30 days prior to the first dose of study medication and until 3 months after the last dose of study medication.
