	<brief_summary>The overall goal of this proposed study is to assess the reliability of plasticity measured by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) interleaved with intermittent theta-burst stimulation plasticity measures and to assess the influence of an acute bout of aerobic exercise on TMS plasticity measures.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Reliability and Timing of Exercise on TMS-based Plasticity Measures.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary aim of this study is to assess the reliability of TMS plasticity measures recorded one week apart, on healthy individuals. The secondary aim is assess TMS plasticity measures on healthy individuals after an acute bout of aerobic exercise. Participants will complete 3 visits. Visits 1 and 2 comprise TMS plasticity testing, and on visit 3, participants will complete a short bout of aerobic exercise before undergoing TMS plasticity testing.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Adult males and females aged 1870 years old. Primary language is English Exercise clearance Presence of cognitive, neurologic or orthopedic conditions that could affect performance of the testing and training procedures History of migraines History of fainting spells of unknown or undetermined etiology that might constitute seizures History of seizures, diagnosis of epilepsy, history of abnormal (epileptiform) EEG or family history of treatment resistance epilepsy Any current history of psychiatric illness Any unstable medical condition No medication is an absolute exclusion from TMS. Medications will be reviewed by the Principal Investigator and a decision about inclusion will be made based on the following: The subject's past medical history, drug does, history of recent medication changes or duration of treatment, and combination with other central nervous system active drugs. The published TMS guidelines review medications to considered with TMS (Rossi, Hallet, Rossini, PascualLeone, &amp; Safety of TMS Consensus Group, 2009) Any metal in the brain, skull or elsewhere unless approved by the responsible MD Any medical devices (i.e. Cardiac pacemaker, deep brain stimulator, medication infusion pump, cochlear implant, vagal nerve stimulator) Intracranial lesion Substance abuse or dependence within the past six months</criteria>
