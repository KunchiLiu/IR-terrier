	<brief_title>Short Term Weight Loss With Liraglutide and Metformin in Infertile Obese PCOS Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common cause of anovulatory infertility, in particular when PCOS is linked to obesity. Obese PCOS has poor IVF outcomes associated with impaired oocyte and embryo parameters and morphology. The purpose of this pilot prospective study was to investigate the effect of the antiobesity medical therapy (combination of metformin and liraglutide (COMBI)) on short time weight loss in the specific infertile obese PCOS population. Additionally, we analyzed eventual impact of the short term weight loss 5% or more before IVF on oocyte maturity and embryo quality in infertile obese PCOS population.</detailed_description>
