	<brief_title>An Evaluation of Healthy Marriage and Relationship Education Program: Elevate</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study is based on the theory that couples can learn skills through participating in the Elevate curriculum that will help them function better as a couple resulting in improved relationship quality/stability, improved co-parenting skills, improved financial management, and reduced financial stress. As a result of improved relationship skills and better management of stress, couples will then provide more supportive, safe, and stable family environments for children. Individuals who are eligible (biological parents of children 0-18 who were removed from their home and were recently re-unified) and agree to participate in the study are randomly assigned to a treatment group or a control group. Both groups receive a needs assessment and referral to appropriate agencies to address their needs. Treatment group participants will participate in the Elevate intervention (8 hours of classes over a 4-week period). Individuals in the control group do not participate in the intervention but are wait-listed and eligible to participate in Elevate after they complete the study (12 months). The impact study of Elevate will examine whether participation in the study improves couple functioning and parenting skills and decreases instances of child abuse/neglect. Members of both the treatment and control groups are surveyed three times. The surveys include items related to couple functioning behaviors, relationship quality/stability, parenting/co-parenting skills, and financial management and distress. At the end of 12 months, Georgia's Department of Family and Children Services (DFCS) will provide information on whether or not the families (in both the treatment and control groups) have had any substantiated reports of child abuse or neglect. The impact of Elevate will be measured by whether or not families have substantiated reports of child abuse/neglect and thereby re-enter the DFCS system.</detailed_description>
