	<brief_summary>Purpose: to study the effect of insect protein on performance and hypertrophy during 8 weeks of resistance training. Hypothesis: Insect protein supplementation enhances the effect of resistance training on muscle mass and muscle strength. Primary outcome: Muscle hypertrophy and muscle strength Design: Two groups of healthy young men (age: 18-30 years) with resistance training experience, but no structural resistance training performed for the last 12 months. Randomized controlled intervention study +/- insect protein (placebo group ingest isocaloric carbohydrate). Both groups perform 8 weeks of progressive resistance training (4/week) aiming to induce muscle hypertrophy.</brief_summary>
