	<brief_summary>As we age, a number of factors can reduce our cognitive (or thinking) abilities. This study will evaluate whether transcranial electrical stimulation (TES), which uses small amounts of electricity to modulate brain functioning, can improve cognitive abilities. Here, the effects of TES on working memory, learning, and memory, will be evaluated in a group of healthy older adults.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The primary objective is to investigate the cognitive effects of high definition anodal tDCS (HD-tDCS; anode at center electrode) at 3 mA (for 20 minutes) on learning, memory, and working memory. Participants will be randomized to active or sham stimulation and will complete a series of cognitive tests both during and after stimulation. Tolerability and blinding will also be evaluated using standard side effect questionnaires (Brunoni et al., 2011).</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1. Individuals with intact cognitive functioning. 2. Participants will be age 50 or older. 1. Individuals with a documented history of cognitive impairment. 2. A history of serious mental illness (e.g., bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, axis 2 disorders) 3. Sensory or motor impairments that limit the ability to take part in the study 4. A significant history or current use of alcohol or drug abuse/dependence 5. Those who are currently pregnant (if there is a question of pregnancy, pregnancy tests will be available for participants at no charge) 6. Participants with an Mini Mental State Examination score &lt;24 at screening.</criteria>
