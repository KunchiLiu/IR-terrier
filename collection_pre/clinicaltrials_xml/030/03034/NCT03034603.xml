	<brief_summary>This triple-blinded randomized placebo control trial aims to investigate the safety and efficacy of Nutri-PEITC jelly, a functional food, in head and neck cancer patients. The primary outcome measure includes adverse events and health-related quality of life. The secondary outcome includes tumor response and functional status.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Safety and Efficacy Test of Nutri-PEITC Jelly in Head and Neck Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Previously, Nutri-jelly, a novel edible nutritious gel for patients with chewing and swallowing difficulties, was shown to be effective in improving the quality of life of head and neck cancer patients. Recently, Nutri-PEITC jelly is recently developed by addition of Phenethyl Isothiocyanate (PEITC), a phytochemical compound with chemopreventive action in animal bearing oral cancer. It intends to be a functional food for cancer survivor. The dose of PEITC in Nutri-jelly was based on safe and effective dose determined in animal studies. Furthermore, Nutri-PEITC jelly was proven safe in healthy volunteers who daily consumes for a consecutive month with no serious adverse events. The purpose of this study is to determine safety and efficacy of Nutri-jelly with PEITC in head and neck cancer patients. independent variable: continuous Nutri -jelly with PEITC intake dependent variable (outcome): adverse effects, health-related quality of life score, tumor response and functional status</detailed_description>
