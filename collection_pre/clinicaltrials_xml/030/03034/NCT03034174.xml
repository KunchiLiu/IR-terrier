	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to describe the pharmacokinetics of tigecycline in critically ill patients receiving continuous venovenous haemodialysis (CVVHD) and to evaluate the frequency of pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic target attainment with high dosing strategy (200 mg loading dose and 100 mg/12h).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetics of High-dose Tigecycline in Critically Ill Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective observational study performed on critically ill patients. Inclusion criteria are: severe sepsis on admission requiring broad-spectrum antibiotics. Both medical and surgical patients will be included. Any type of infections will be included (pulmunary, abdominal, urinary tract, etc.) Antibiotcs regimen includes: tygecycline (200 mg every 12 hours intravenously), meropenem (2 grams every 8 hours intravenously). Blood sampels (3 mL) will be collected 2, 4, 8 and 12 hours after each dose of tigecycline for 3 consecuetive days. The standard arterial canula will be used to obtain samples. In each case CVVHD will be started and continued for at least 3 days' period. 30 minutes after a collection each sample will be centrifuged for 10 minutes at 3,000 rpms. Subsequenly, supernatant will be collected and frozen. Serum tygecycline concentration will be measured with high performance liquid chromatography. Each patient's hemodynamics parameters will be recorded with the use of tranpulmonary thermodilution technique (PICCO). Other therapies i.e.: ventilatory support, sedation, an antifungal agent will be given as requierd.</detailed_description>
