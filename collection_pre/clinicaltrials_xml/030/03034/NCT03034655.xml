	<brief_title>Reducing Rate of Falls in Older People by Means of Vestibular Rehabilitation (ReFOVeRe Study)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Accidental falls, particularly in the elderly, are one of the most important socio-healthcare problems of ageing western societies. Many factors condition and favour falls; one of them is old age, usually related to a decline in sensorial functions and worsening of balance Vestibular rehabilitation has been shown to be effective to improve balance and reduce the number of falls in older people. Previous studies have demonstrated that exercises in computerized dynamic posturography (CDP) are more effective than other vestibular rehabilitation strategies in this group of age. But CDP is very expensive and not widespread. It would be important to minimize cost of posturographic vestibular rehabilitation. This study compare vestibular rehabilitation with two different posturographic devices (CDP and mobile posturographic system with vibrotactile stimulation), in people over 65 years. Additionally, we try to assess whether the reduction in the number of vestibular rehabilitation sessions (five) leads to an improvement in balance and in reducing the number of falls similar to those obtained with ten sessions.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Persons with a high risk of falling shall meet at least two of the following requirements: Having fallen at least once in the last 12 months. Using more than 15 seconds or needing support in the TUG test. Obtaining a mean CDP SOT balance score of &lt; 68%. Having fallen at least once in the CDP SOT. A score in Mobile posturography gSBDT &gt; 60 %. Cognitive decline or reduce cultural level that prevents the patient from understanding the assessment, vestibular rehabilitation exercises and granting informed consent. Organic conditions that prevent standing on two feet, necessary for assessment of balance and performance of VR exercises. Balance disorders caused by conditions other than age (neurologic, vestibular,....). Current treatment with drugs that potentially disturb balance.</criteria>
