	<brief_title>Single Versus Multi-port Robotic Assisted Sacrocolpopexy for Repair of Vaginal Apex Prolapse</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One hundred female patients diagnosed with vaginal apex prolapse will be recruited to a prospective randomized controlled study intended to compare the efficacy of 2 methods of robotic assisted sacrocolpopexy: 1. Via single-port. 2. Via multi-port. The patients will be evaluated and randomized 2 weeks before the expected date of surgery during which eligibility will be examined. Patients` electronic files will be reviewed post operatively to acquire information regarding medical history, prolapse scores, surgical information, anesthesia information and surgical complications. Patients will have 3 week and 3 month post operative follow-up sessions to determine surgical success, late complications and patient satisfaction.</detailed_description>
