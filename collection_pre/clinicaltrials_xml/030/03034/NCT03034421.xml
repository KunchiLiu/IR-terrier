	<brief_summary>Endoscopic valve therapy is an effective therapy for patients with severe emphysema and low interlobar collateral ventilation. Although, valve therapy is a minimal-invasive treatment approach, it is associated with complications the most common of which is pneumothorax with a rate of 18-25%. Modifying post-operative medical care including bed rest for 48 hours after valve implantation may reduce the risk of post-interventional pneumothorax.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prevention of Pneumothorax Following Endoscopic Valve Therapy in Patients With Severe Emphysema</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patient enrolment and data acquisition is to be carried out on a prospective basis. It is planned to enrol a total of 130 patients with advanced emphysema and low collateral ventilation. Patients will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive modified medical care including a 48 bed rest or standard medical care following valve implantation. All patients will undergo treatment at one study centre in Heidelberg.</detailed_description>
