	<brief_summary>The morbidities associated with very low birth weight (VLBW) infants constitute a major health problem and a significant emotional and financial burden for families and our nation. The key to reducing this burden is early diagnosis. This research will be the first step towards intervention for cerebral growth and long-term neurodevelopmental morbidities of VLBW infants. The proposed research is to design and fabricate a new technological innovation in wearable soft-sensors, called flexi-mitts, for measuring force modulation and joint angles of the hand (wrist and fingers) of toddlers. Building upon the investigators' ongoing work, they plan to engineer stretchable electronics for safe, toddler-scaled flexi-mitts to measure planning and force modulation. Additionally, the investigators plan to have the parent/guardian wear the gloves so they can determine the relative contributions of the child and the adult to the child's learning. In the same way that the adult assists learning to walk, they may assist in learning during play. The force data may be analyzed in the same way as the child's data. The investigators' new flexi-mitt technology has the potential to provide a new diagnostic technology and the development of clinical assessment norms. With additional trials of the technology in large numbers of young children, it may be possible for clinicians and day care providers to eventually make measurements of planning and force modulation in play settings.</brief_summary>
