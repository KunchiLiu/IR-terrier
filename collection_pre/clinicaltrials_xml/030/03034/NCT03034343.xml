	<detailed_description>The aim of this study is to assess and compare a mindfulness low-intensity (4 weeks) psychological intervention for the treatment of depression in Primary Care between different groups: 1) a face-to-face mindfulness intervention in group format (10-12 people/group), 2) a control group which will received primary care TAU (usual medical treatment) and 3) the same mindfulness intervention applied by Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) (Internet-based program). All participants in the two psychological intervention groups will also receive usual medical treatment managed by their general practitioner. Each group will be composed of 40 participants with a total sample of 120. The principal hypothesis is that face to face intervention will be more effective than TAU. Secondary hypothesis, are: 1) The online computerized program will be more effective than TAU; 2) The differences between face-to-face and online format will be analyzed. Finally, a qualitative study will be conducted in order to analyze the feasibility, acceptance, barriers and causes of drop-outs and success, expectations, experiences and attitudes that could be obstacles or facilitators in the interventions, both in patients and in health professionals. This study will allow us to understand the experiences of depressed patients with these interventions and their differences.</detailed_description>
