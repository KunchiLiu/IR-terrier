	<brief_summary>This study aims to observe the safety and efficacy of the Xyntha Solofuse prefilled syringe in the setting of routine practice. The primary objective is to detect medically significant events (factor VIII inhibitor). The secondary objective is to observe the overall efficacy and safety of the Xyntha Solofuse prefilled syringe including serious adverse events. In this open-label, non-comparative, observational, non-interventional, retrospective and multi-center study, post-marketing surveillance data will be collected retrospectively for up to 6 months from the initial administration day of the Xyntha Solofuse prefilled syringe injected into patients who have been administered the Xyntha Solofuse prefilled syringe. As specified in the product approval issued by the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety, the study will be conducted for 4 years from the approval date. At least 600 study subjects will be enrolled in this study to meet the MFDS requirements. Although 600 is the assigned number of study subjects, the number of cases will be adjusted considering the actual number of enrolled subjects after the study start day.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>. Inclusion criteria To be eligible to enroll in this study, the study subjects will have to meet all the following inclusion criteria: 1. Hemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency) patients who have been administered according to the indication of the product 1) Control and prevention of bleeding episodes and for routine and surgical prophylaxis in patients with hemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency) 2) This drug does not contain von Willebrand factor and, therefore, is not indicated in von Willebrand's disease 2. Those who have been administered the Xyntha Solofuse prefilled syringe at least once Exclusion criteria Patients who satisfy the following criteria are not included in the study according to the local labeling: 1. Patients who have a history of hypersensitivity to the Xyntha Solofuse prefilled syringe or the ingredients of this drug. 2. Patients who have a history of hypersensitivity to hamster proteins. 3. Patients who have bleeding disorders other than hemophilia A. 4. Patients who have a history of FVIII inhibitors, or currently have or are suspected of having FVIII inhibitors. In case inhibitor titers quantified in Bethesda Units in the laboratory test results are within the normal laboratory range or at least 0.6 BU/mL. If laboratory tests cannot be performed, the investigator will determine whether or not inhibitors exist based on the clinical assessment results that show a decrease in efficacy of the replacement of FVIII (e.g. bleeding at least once, if the replacement of antibleeding agents is needed to be administered, and if frequency or dosage of replacement FVIII therapy needs to be increased). 5. Use of immunomodulatory therapy. (e.g. intravenous injection of immunoglobulin, use of regular systemic corticosteroids, cyclosporine, and mediators of antiTNFÎ±)</criteria>
