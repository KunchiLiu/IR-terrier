	<brief_summary>The goal of this study is to test the efficacy of a financial incentives-based telehealth intervention to reduce 30- and 90-day heart failure (HF) readmissions by tracking and increasing adherence to patient self-care - specifically by incentivizing adherence to prescribed cardiac medication regimen and daily self-weighing. Patients randomized to the treatment arm will be given a cellular-connected scale to use at home, as well as a mobile app on their smartphone that tracks their adherence to daily self-weighing through the scale and cardiac medications via patient photo submission. The health care team will intervene if a sudden increase in weight is detected (2 lbs/day or 5 lbs/week). Financial incentives of $150 are offered for full adherence over 90 days. Each day where the patient does not step on the scale and complete a medication check-in will result in a deduction of $2 per day from the incentive amount to be paid out. The control group will receive the usual discharge instructions as prescribed by their health care team.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mobile App With Patient Financial Incentives for Adherence to Heart Failure Medications &amp; Daily Self-Weighing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nonadherence to cardiovascular medications and daily weight monitoring are critical issues in readmissions to the hospital for heart failure. Only 60% of patients adhere to prescribed cardiovascular medications on at least 80% of days, and only 40% monitor their weight daily, despite owning scales. Nationally, nonadherence contributes to excessive HF readmission rates of 50% within 6 months, and 24% within 30 days of discharge. To raise awareness and accountability, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) began reporting these rates in 2009, and the Affordable Care Act and value-based contracts with payers have established financial penalties to spur provider-based solutions. Telehealth interventions are an ideal, low-cost, scalable method to reduce readmissions by remotely enhancing patient support. Telehealth interventions for HF that target medication compliance and self-weighing have demonstrated reductions in readmission rates by 80% or more, but these are not yet widely adopted in clinical practice due to a lack of randomized, controlled studies. We are thus proposing a randomized, controlled study of a proprietary telehealth platform at University Medical Center of Princeton at Plainsboro (UMCPP) to enable remote support for HF patients through a mobile app combined with financial incentives to motivate adherence to medication and self-weighing. Patients admitted to UMCPP with the primary admitting or discharge diagnosis of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (EF&lt;40%) (ICD-10 codes I50.2_) will be invited to participate in the study. Each patient in the intervention arm will be offered $150 in incentives along with the Wellth app loaded on to his or her smartphone. When users first log in to the app, which will occur with the guidance of a healthcare provider trained in its use, they will be shown a large dollar amount that they have earned by enrolling in the program - in this study $150 will be offered for 90 days of perfect adherence to medications and daily self-weighing using connected digital scales provided by Wellth. Instructions will also be given stating that missed weight and medication check-ins will result in a $2 deduction per day from the account to be paid out at each monthly pay period. If a 2 lb. or greater daily increase in weight, or a 5 lb. weekly increase in weight, is detected in any patient, a UMCPP physician or nurse will be alerted via automatic email and text. A physician or a nurse will then call the patient to assess the patient's symptoms (i.e. increasing shortness of breath or decreases in exertional tolerance, medication and dietary adherence). Once a weight gain alert has been triggered, the team will continue to receive additional data about the patient for the next 7 days to see if weight continues to increase which would trigger an additional phone call and patient physician notification. After a call is made to the patient, if, in the clinical judgment of the physician or nurse that there are increasing heart failure symptoms, the physician or nurse will suggest to the patient that they make an appointment and see their doctor within the next 48 hours. Benefits of this study to the intervention arm include better health, reduced risk of readmission, and concomitant reduction in healthcare burden, as well as a small but tangible financial gain. Benefits for society, assuming widely applicable success, include reduction in population-wide readmission rates due to greater health, and reduction in healthcare spending.</detailed_description>
