	<brief_summary>COPD is characterized by an airflow limitation, which is not fully reversible, usually progressive and accompanied by chronic cough, sputum production and dyspnea, which can be a major cause of disability and anxiety associated with the disease. In addition, COPD is associated with poor health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Pharmacologic therapy is used to improve lung function, reduce symptoms, reduce the frequency and severity of exacerbations, and also to improve health status and exercise tolerance. This is a multi-center, randomized, double blind, double dummy, 3-arm parallel group study to compare umeclidinium/vilanterol (62.5/25 microgram [mcg], once daily), umeclidinium (62.5 mcg, once daily), and salmeterol (50 mg, twice daily) in male and female subjects with COPD. The primary purpose of this study is to demonstrate improvements in lung function for subjects treated with UMEC/VI compared with UMEC for 24 weeks. Approximately 2424 subjects will be randomized across 3 parallel arms in 1:1:1 ratio. Subjects will be stratified based on long-acting bronchodilator usage during the run-in period (none, one or 2 long-acting bronchodilators per day). Subjects will receive either UMEC/VI inhalation powder (62.5/25 microgram [mcg] once daily) administered via the ELLIPTA® dry powder inhaler (DPI) and placebo twice daily via DISKUS® DPI; or UMEC (62.5 mcg once daily) administered via the ELLIPTA DPI and placebo twice daily via DISKUS DPI or salmeterol (50 mcg twice daily [BID]) administered via the DISKUS DPI and placebo once daily via ELLIPTA DPI. The duration of the study will be 29 to 31 weeks including a pre-screening period of 2 weeks, run-in period of 4 weeks, treatment period of 24 weeks and follow-up period of 1 week.

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria 40 years or older at date of signing informed consent at Screening Visit 1 Outpatient with a diagnosis of COPD Persistent airflow limitations as indicated by a pre and postalbuterol/salbutamol FEV1/FVC ratio of &lt;0.70 and a postalbuterol/salbutamol FEV1 of &gt;=30% to &lt;=80% predicted normal values at Screening Visit 1. A CAT score of &gt;=10 at Screening Visit 1 Current or former cigarette smokers with a history of cigarette smoking of &gt;=10 packyears (number of pack years = [number of cigarettes per day / 20] multiplied by number of years smoked [e.g., 20 cigarettes per day for 10 years, or 10 cigarettes per day for 20 years both equal 10 packyears]). Former smokers are defined as those who have stopped smoking for at least 6 months prior to Visit 1. Pipe and/or cigar use cannot be used to calculate packyear history. Male and female subjects are eligible to participate in the study. A female subject is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant (as confirmed by a negative urine human chorionic gonadotrophin test), not lactating, and at least one of the following conditions applies: nonreproductive potential defined as premenopausal females with documented tubal ligation or documented hysteroscopic tubal occlusion procedure with followup confirmation of bilateral tubal occlusion or hysterectomy or documented bilateral oophorectomy. Postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea. In questionable cases, a blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone and estradiol levels consistent with menopause must be tested. Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the highly effective contraception methods if they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status prior to study enrolment. A female subject with reproductive potential is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant and agrees to follow one of the highly effective methods for avoiding pregnancy in females of reproductive potential from 30 days prior to the first dose of study medication and until (at least five terminal halflives or until any continuing pharmacologic effect has ended, whichever is longer) after the last dose of study medication and completion of the followup visit. The investigator is responsible for ensuring that subjects understand how to properly use methods of contraception. Capable of giving signed informed consent prior to study participation. Exclusion criteria A current diagnosis of asthma (Subjects with a prior history of asthma are eligible if they have a current diagnosis of COPD, which is the primary cause of their respiratory symptoms). Subjects with known alphaantitrypsin deficiency as the underlying cause of COPD Subjects with active tuberculosis are excluded. Subjects with other respiratory disorders (e.g., clinically significant: bronchiectasis, sarcoidosis, lung fibrosis, pulmonary hypertension, interstitial lung diseases) are excluded if these conditions are the primary cause of their respiratory symptoms. Current active liver or biliary disease (with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones or otherwise stable chronic liver disease as per investigator assessment); stable chronic liver disease should generally be defined by the absence of ascites, encephalopathy, coagulopathy, hypoalbuminaemia, oesophageal or gastric varices, or persistent jaundice, or cirrhosis; chronic stable hepatitis B and C (e.g., presence of hepatitis B surface antigen or positive hepatitis C antibody test result or within 3 months prior to first dose of study treatment) are acceptable if subject otherwise meets entry criteria. Subjects with unstable or life threatening cardiac disease. The investigational product should be used with caution in subjects with severe cardiovascular disease. In the opinion of the investigator, use will only be considered if the benefit is likely to outweigh the risk in conditions such as myocardial infarction or unstable angina in the last 6 months, or unstable or life threatening cardiac arrhythmia requiring intervention in the last 3 months, or New York Heart Association Class IV heart failure. The investigator will determine the clinical significance of each abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG) finding in relation to the subject's medical history and exclude subjects who would be at undue risk by participating in the trial. Subjects with the following abnormalities are excluded from participation in the study: atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate &gt;120 beats per minute (bpm), sustained or nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, second degree heart block Mobitz type II or third degree heart block (unless pacemaker or defibrillator had been inserted). Subjects with medical conditions such as narrowangle glaucoma, urinary retention, prostatic hypertrophy, or bladder neck obstruction will be excluded unless, in the opinion of the study physician, the benefit outweighs the risk. Any subject who is considered unlikely to survive the duration of the study period or has any rapidly progressing disease or immediate lifethreatening illness (e.g., cancer). In addition, any subject who has any other condition (e.g., neurological condition) that is likely to affect respiratory function will not be included in the study. Hospitalization for COPD or pneumonia within 12 weeks prior to Visit 1.
