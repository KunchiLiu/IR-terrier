	<brief_title>Comparison Between Hypoglycemic Counter Regulatory Responses in Type 1 Diabetics vs Control Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Iatrogenic hypoglycemia is one of the main limiting factors for optimal glycemic management of diabetes. It causes recurrent morbidity in most people with type 1 diabetes and in many patients with type 2 diabetes and can be fatal. Episodes of hypoglycemia impair physiologically protective mechanism in subsequent episodes of hypoglycemia. This phenomenon is known as hypoglycemia-associated autonomic failure (HAAF), the clinical syndromes of defective glucose counter regulation and hypoglycemia unawareness.</detailed_description>
