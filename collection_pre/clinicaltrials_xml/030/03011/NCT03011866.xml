	<brief_summary>Multilevel decompression and bone graft fusion is a most effective measure for treating degenerative lumbar spinal diseases. Yet, the surgery is commonly associated with large amount of perioperative blood loss and high demand for homologous blood transfusion. Tranexamic acid (TXA) has been proved as efficient in reducing the gross blood loss in various kinds of surgeries. However, high quality evidence of its efficacy and safety is still lacking in lumbar spinal surgeries. Besides, systemic use of TXA carries the risks of thromboembolic complications such as deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, thus the optimal drug delivery route of TXA remains undetermined. The aim of this study is to test the non-inferiority of topical TXA application to its intravenous use in multilevel decompression and bone graft fusion surgeries. A prospective, randomized, double-blind, head-to-head comparison study design will be adopted.</brief_summary>
