	<brief_summary>The Investigators will examine if DC-STAMP can serve as an early marker of TNFi response in PsA. Identification of such a biomarker would permit rapid transition to a new agent, a major treatment advance. TNFi are the most effective therapies in PsA, however, methotrexate is frequently initiated early in the disease course based on its significantly lower cost. Unfortunately, the efficacy of MTX has not been supported in clinical trials and up to 40% of patients do not respond to TNFi therapy. Moreover, valid biomarkers to predict MTX or TNFi responses are currently unavailable. This study may also provide the first data on the comparative efficacy of MTX and TNFi using clinical, Power Doppler Ultrasound (PDUS) and biomarker outcomes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>DC-STAMP: Regulators of Osteoclastogenesis and Response Marker in PsA</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Psoriatic arthritis (PsA), an inflammatory joint disease associated with psoriasis (Ps), affects approximately 650,000 adults in the United States and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Bone damage develops in half these patients within the first two years of the disease, often leaving them with impaired function and diminished quality of life. The emergence of anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor therapies (TNFi) has dramatically improved clinical response and slowed bone and cartilage degradation in PsA patients, however, only 50-60% of patients respond to these agents. To improve these outcomes, the investigators must address two major gaps: a limited understanding of key events that underlie pathologic bone destruction and the absence of biomarkers to predict biologic response and identify early biologic responders to facilitate optimization of therapy. Bone damage is mediated by osteoclasts which arise from monocyte precursors in the blood. Osteoclast Precursors (OCPs) are dramatically increased in PsA, compared to controls, particularly in patients with bone damage on X-ray. The number of these circulating precursor cells dropped rapidly following treatment with TNFi. OCPs may serve as response biomarkers, but cost, time and high variability limit these assays. Osteoclast precursors express Dendritic Cell-Specific Transmembrane Protein (DC-STAMP), which is a seven-pass transmembrane protein required for fusion of monocytes to form osteoclasts and giant cells. Monocyte DC-STAMP levels dropped rapidly following treatment with TNFi. TNF receptor-associated factor 3 (TRAF3), an inhibitor of OC formation that correlates with extracellular TNF concentrations, is elevated in OCPs from PsA patients. These markers may predict TNFi treatment response. The goal of this study is to examine DC-STAMP in Psoriatic Arthritis patients prior to and after starting standard of care treatment with a biologic or non-biologic DMARD. The investigators will also examine PsA patients with low disease activity on TNFi and PsA patients with low disease activity on methotrexate and other oral DMARDs will serve as controls. Up to 66 Psoriatic Arthritis patients will be consented and studied with this protocol. Up to 80 PsA subjects may be consented to allow for screen failures and to replace longitudinal subjects who withdraw. Up to 20 PsA or healthy subjects may be enrolled for assay development, to test techniques and/or for ultra sound comparison. Unique individuals will count towards study numbers reported, i.e. individual subjects participating in more than one aspect of this study will only be counted once. 30 patients starting out on standard of care treatment with a biologic or non-biologic DMARD will take part in the longitudinal section of the study with two patients asked to have a blood draw at one additional visit before starting therapy for additional research assays. The investigators will also ask a total of 36 patients to participate in the cross-sectional part of the study. 18 patients on stable DMARDS and 18 patients on stable biologic therapies will be compared in the cross-sectional part. This population should be in Good Disease State such that their disease is controlled and treatment will not need to be changed. If longitudinal subjects fit the cross-sectional criteria and wish to participate, they will be re-consented for the cross-sectional part of the study. The investigators may ask subjects to come back for one additional blood draw for assay development approximately after a week.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Ability to provide written informed consent. Subjects can be of either gender but must be at least 18 years old. Subjects with PsA should fulfill CASPAR criteria. Longitudinal: Patients with active PsA who will be starting a biologic or nonbiologic DMARD treatment (Subjects starting nonbiologic DMARDS can have their blood drawn within the first few days of starting therapy). Additional Blood Draw: Positive DCSTAMP signal at baseline CrossSectional: Patients on stable DMARDS or biologics for more than 16 weeks. Healthy Subjects: Healthy controls should have no active systemic disorders or inflammatory conditions that would confound the results of the study. Unable to donate blood because of poor venous access or intolerance of phlebotomy.</criteria>
