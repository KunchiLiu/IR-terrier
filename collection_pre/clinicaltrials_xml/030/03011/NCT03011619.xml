	<brief_title>Brief CBT for the Treatment of Depression During Inpatient Hospitalization</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants assigned to the CBT condition will receive the usual standard of care during an inpatient psychiatric hospitalization. This includes but is not limited to medication management, group therapy, and individual therapy. If a patient is randomly assigned to the enhanced CBT group, manualized CBT, including a sequence of sessions that builds upon prior sessions and planned exercises, including worksheets and journal entries.The training M.D., who is a treating physician on HCC-10, will also intermittently and randomly observe the CBT sessions to ensure the manual properly is being followed. Although the control condition may contain elements of CBT as per the clinician completing the therapy, it is not manualized, does not include specific exercises to be completed between sessions, and is not a course that builds upon skills from the previous day, as in the CBT condition. Participants assigned to the control condition will receive the usual standard of care during an inpatient psychiatric hospitalization. This includes but is not limited to medication management, group therapy, and individual therapy.</detailed_description>
