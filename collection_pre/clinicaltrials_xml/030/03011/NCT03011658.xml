	<brief_summary>Oral lichen planus (OLP) is a T-cell mediated chronic immunological disease directed to a still unknown antigen. It is a mucocutaneous and a psychosomatic disorder, with unknown prevalence rate; however studies suggest an incidence of 0.02 to 0.22% among the Indian population. 75% of patients with cutaneous lichen planus also experience oral lesions and may be precipitated or exacerbated by psychosocial stressors. In conditions like pain, anxiety and stress, many metabolic and endocrine changes occur in the body, the most common effect of which is increased cortisol level in blood. This hormone is a 21-carbon corticosteroid secreted by adrenal cortex and regulates the metabolism of carbohydrates, fats, proteins and water. Also known as stress hormone, cortisol is a decisive index in stressful situations. This study is intended to correlate the serum cortisol levels with anxiety and depression in patients with symptomatic oral lichen planus. This study attempts to evaluate psychological anxiety and depression in oral lichen planus subjects using Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale ( HADS) and correlating with their serum cortisol levels. To understand and explore the etiopathogenesis for better management of oral lichen planus.</brief_summary>
