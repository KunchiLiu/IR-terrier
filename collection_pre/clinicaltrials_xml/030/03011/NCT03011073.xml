	<brief_summary>Paris Saint Joseph hospital has just acquired a new echocardiography EPIC . This new system has image processing and left ventricular function quantification software which are different from the precedent model Philips IE33.Left ventricular function quantification and myocardial distortion are the main medical examination influencing doctor's decisions. EPIC can evaluate and quantify the cardiac ejection fraction via new software. Myocardial distortion quantification software also has been modified with new cut off and different calculation method. The aim of this study is to compare the quality of images and the quantification of cardiac ejection fraction with these new software in order to choose the more reliable and reproducible for patient.</brief_summary>
