	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is: - to determine absolute bioavailability, input rates, distribution volume, renal and intestinal excretion of trospium in subjects with wild-type of SLC22A1 rs72552763 and rs12208357 and in subjects with homozygous variant alleles of SLC22A1 rs72552763 or rs12208357 - to determine absolute bioavailability, input rates, distribution volume and renal and intestinal excretion of trospium in subjects with wild-type alleles of SLC22A1 rs72552763 and rs12208357 after co-medication of 300 mg of the OCT1- inhibitor ranitidine - to determine absolute bioavailability, input rates, distribution volume and renal and intestinal excretion of trospium in subjects with wild-type alleles of SLC22A1 rs72552763 and rs12208357 after co-medication of 500 mg of the P-glycoprotein- inhibitor clarithromycin - to determine absolute bioavailability, input rates, distribution volume and renal and intestinal excretion of trospium in subjects with homozygous variant alleles of SLC22A1 rs72552763 or rs12208357 after co-medication of 500 mg of the P-glycoprotein- inhibitor clarithromycin.</brief_summary>
