	<criteria>Subjects diagnosed with atopic dermatitis as defined by the Hanifin and Rajka criteria. Subjects with a history of atopic dermatitis for at least 2 years. Subjects with an Investigator's Global Assessment score of 2 to 3 at screening and baseline. Subjects with body surface area of atopic dermatitis involvement, excluding the face and intertriginous areas, of 3% to 20% at screening and baseline. Subjects who agree to discontinue all agents used to treat atopic dermatitis from screening through the final followup visit. Subjects with evidence of active acute or chronic infections. Use of topical treatments for atopic dermatitis (other than bland emollients) within 2 weeks of baseline. Systemic immunosuppressive or immunomodulating drugs (eg, oral or injectable corticosteroids, methotrexate, cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine) within 4 weeks or 5 halflives of baseline (whichever is longer). Subjects with other dermatologic disease besides atopic dermatitis whose presence or treatments could complicate the assessment of disease (eg, psoriasis). Subjects with a history of other diseases besides dermatologic disorders (eg, other autoimmune diseases) taking treatments that could complicate assessments. Subjects with cytopenias at screening, defined as: Leukocytes &lt; 3.0 × 10^9/L. Neutrophils &lt; lower limit of normal. Hemoglobin &lt; 10 g/dL. Lymphocytes &lt; 0.8 × 10^9/L Platelets &lt; 100 × 10^9/L. Subjects with severely impaired liver function (ChildPugh Class C) or endstage renal disease on dialysis or at least 1 of the following: Serum creatinine &gt; 1.5 mg/dL. Alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase ≥ 1.5 × upper limit of normal. Subjects taking potent systemic cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors or fluconazole within 2 weeks or 5 halflives, whichever is longer, before the baseline visit (topical agents with limited systemic availability are permitted). Subjects who have previously received Janus kinase inhibitors, systemic or topical (eg, ruxolitinib, tofacitinib, baricitinib, filgotinib, lestaurtinib, pacritinib).</criteria>
