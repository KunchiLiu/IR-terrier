	<brief_summary>Some researches have found that gait posture velocity have influence on kinematic parameters. However, how the gait velocity and posture will influence kinematic parameters remain unclear. In addition to walking, running is one of the most daily activities of people. The purpose of this research is to find out the influence of gait velocity and running to kinematic parameters . To do this, it will provide a reference for future prospective studies or investigations and make us fully understand the impact of gait velocity and running to kinematic parameters of gait.</brief_summary>
