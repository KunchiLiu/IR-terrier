	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the diagnostic accuracy of a novel endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) biopsy needle to the current standard EUS needle. The investigators hypothesize that with the SharkcoreTM needle a diagnostic yield of 90% is possible for subepithelial lesions (SEL) within the Gastrointestinal (GI) tract versus 60% yield with the current needle.</brief_summary>
