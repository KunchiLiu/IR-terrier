	<criteria>Able to understand and willing to comply with all study requirements and procedures throughout the duration of the study and give written informed consent; Aged ≥18 years; Patients receiving statin therapy must meet one of the following criteria: Aged ≥21 years with clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) (history of acute coronary syndrome or myocardial infarction, stable or unstable angina, coronary revascularization, stroke, transient ischemic attack [TIA] presumed to be of atherosclerotic origin, or peripheral arterial disease or revascularization), on a highintensity statin (or moderateintensity statin if not a candidate for highintensity statin due to safety concerns); Aged ≥21 years with a history of LDLC ≥190 mg/dL, which is not due to secondary modifiable causes, on a highintensity statin (or moderateintensity statin if not a candidate for highintensity statin due to safety concerns); Aged 40 to 75 years, inclusive, without clinical ASCVD but with diabetes and a history of LDLC of 70 to 189 mg/dL, inclusive, on a moderate or highintensity statin; or Aged 40 to 75 years, inclusive, without clinical ASCVD or diabetes, with a history of LDLC of 70 to 189 mg/dL, inclusive, with estimated 10year risk for ASCVD of ≥7.5% by the Pooled Cohort Equation on a moderate or highintensity statin; Patients not currently on statins, must not meet the criteria for statin therapy listed above; Fasting TG levels ≥500 mg/dL (5.65 mmol/L) and &lt;2000 mg/dL (22.60 mmol/L) based on the mean of Visit 2 (Week 2) and Visit 3 (Week 1). Mild to moderate renal impairment eGFR &gt;= 30mL/min/1.73 and &lt; 90 mL/min/1.73 at Visit 1 Patients who will require lipidaltering treatments other than study drugs (K877 or fenofibrate), statins, ezetimibe, or PCSK9 inhibitors during the course of the study. These include bile acid sequestrants, nonstudy fibrates, niacin (&gt;100 mg/day), omega3 fatty acids (&gt;1000 mg/day), or any supplements used to alter lipid metabolism including, but not limited to, red rice yeast supplements, garlic supplements, soy isoflavone supplements, sterol/stanol products, or policosanols; Body mass index (BMI) &gt;45 kg/m2 at Visit 1 (Week 8 or Week 6); Patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus; Patients with newly diagnosed (within 3 months prior to Visit 2 [Week 2]) or poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), defined as hemoglobin A1c &gt;9.5% at Visit 1 (Week 8 or Week 6);</criteria>
