	<brief_summary>Valvular heart disease (VHD) is becoming more and more frequent with the aging, which has brought a heavy burden to the world. However, the prevalence and prognosis of valvular heart disease are not so clear, especially in the developing countries such as China etc. Because of the slow and progressive nature of VHD, symptoms might not be too severe to be diagnosed on time. Our retrospective survey (Int J Cardiol. 2016 Nov 25) indicated that severe valvular diseases are very common in China. Hence, we design a prospective, observational cohort study to provide contemporary information on the prevalence, characteristics, risk stratification，cost-effective ,treatments and prognosis of Chinese hospitalised adult patients with valvular heart disease.</brief_summary>
