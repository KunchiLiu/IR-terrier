	<brief_summary>The primary objective is to assess if discontinuation of anti- tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF) treatment in ulcerative colitis patients in sustained clinical remission, with the option to restart treatment in the case of relapse, is non-inferior to continued anti-TNF treatment. Secondary objectives are to assess the efficacy and safety of restarting anti-TNF treatment after a relapse</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Anti-tumor Necrosis Factor in Patients With Ulcerative Colitis in Clinical Remission: to Continue or Not?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The BIOSTOP study is a prospective, open randomized, multicenter, parallel-group study to compare clinical outcome of discontinuing (interventional group) compared to continuing (control group) biologic treatment with anti-TNF in ulcerative colitis patients in clinical remission. Adult male and female patients with an established diagnosis of ulcerative colitis treated for minimum one year with anti-TNF maintenance therapy and being in clinical remission during the last 3 months are potential study patients. Eligible patients who have given their informed written consent will be randomized 1:1 to either discontinue anti-TNF treatment or to continue anti-TNF treatment for another two years. Patients in the control group who are still in clinical and endoscopic remission after two years on continued anti-TNF treatment, will then be switched to discontinue anti-TNF treatment. End of study/follow-up is after 4 years. In order to identify the primary endpoint (occurrence of disease relapse), each study center will have a phone number for patients to call in case of symptoms suspect of increased disease activity. If a patient is experiencing a potential disease flare (6-point Mayo score &gt; 1) and/or 2 consecutive calprotectin tests are positive (&gt; 200 mg/kg), an unscheduled visit including recto sigmoidoscopy will be performed without delay to document disease status.</detailed_description>
