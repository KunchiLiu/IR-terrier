	<brief_summary>Thromboelastometry better assess coagulation than standard coagulation test in patients undergoing ortothopic liver transplantation. In a post-hoc analysis from a randomized study recently conducted by our group, presurgical values of MA10 Extem &lt; 35 mm are highly predictive of RBC administration , with no further improvement over MA10 Extem &gt;40 mm ; suggesting that MA10 Extem between 35-40 would be the optimal range to manage blood product administration. The aim of the study is to validate this result in a prospective cohort of patients submitted to ortothopic liver transplantation.</brief_summary>
