	<brief_summary>This study aims to evaluate whether NSAIDs (Non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs) administered during the postpartum period influence blood pressure in women with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. The study design is a prospective double blinded randomized control trial with participants randomized to receive postpartum analgesic regimens with and without NSAIDs.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hypertension In Postpartum Preeclampsia Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are effective agents for the management of pain in the postpartum period. The addition of NSAIDs to post-cesarean analgesic regimen has been shown to improve post-cesarean pain and reduce opioid requirements. However, concern has been raised over use of NSAIDs in hypertensive pregnant patients, as recent evidence suggests the potential for increased blood pressure in patients with chronic hypertensive disorders receiving these agents. Notably, these studies were conducted on patients with longstanding chronic hypertension, which included males and non-pregnant females, and it is therefore unclear whether this recommendation is appropriate for patients with transient hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. This protocol describes a randomized trial to evaluate whether NSAIDs influence blood pressure parameters in patients with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. Patients with severe hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (Severe HDP) will be studied separately from women with mild hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (Mild HDP).</detailed_description>
