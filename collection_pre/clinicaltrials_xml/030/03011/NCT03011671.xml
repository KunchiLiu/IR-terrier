	<brief_summary>We hypothesize that ACZ can be safely administered concomitantly with TMZ in patients with malignant glioma and that this regimen improves patient survival without increasing toxicity to an unacceptable level. Information gathered from this study will contribute towards the development of a future larger phase II study in these tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I Study of Safety and Tolerability of Acetazolamide With Temozolomide</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Malignant gliomas are a diverse group of tumors that encompass WHO grade III and WHO grade IV, glioblastoma (GBM), tumors. Alkylating chemotherapy is central to the management of these tumors and temozolomide (TMZ) is now the most commonly used anti-glioma chemotherapeutic [1]. Standard treatment for newly diagnosed malignant glioma involves concomitant TMZ and ionizing radiation (IR). Despite its routine use, many patients experience minimal benefit from the addition of TMZ [2]. Given that no new chemotherapeutics have been approved for GBM in over a decade, identification of strategies to enhance the efficacy of TMZ is important. In preliminary work, we identified the proto-oncogene, Bcl-3, as a biomarker in glioma that can predict response to TMZ. In examining the mechanism by which Bcl-3 promotes resistance to therapy, we identified carbonic anhydrase II (CAII) as a unique factor that is both Bcl-3-dependent and induced by TMZ. CAII is potently inhibited by the oral CA inhibitor, acetazolamide (ACZ, Diamox), an FDA-approved agent used for a variety of medical conditions seen in patients with glioma including epilepsy and raised intracranial pressure. Importantly, using patient-derived GBM cells and xenografts we find that ACZ sensitizes GBM to TMZ. Specifically, our pre-clinical studies show that daily ACZ given in combination with TMZ and extended for 21 days after TMZ initiation significantly prolongs survival of animals bearing GBM xenografts compared to TMZ alone. Primary Objective: To determine the safety, tolerability and adverse event profile of adding acetazolamide to temozolomide in patients with newly diagnosed malignant glioma. Secondary Objectives: 1. To describe objective response rate (ORR), progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). 2. To determine the feasibility of accrual, and adequacy of eligibility criteria, by defining the proportion of patients enrolled from the eligible cases of malignant glioma presented at the weekly multidisciplinary Neuro-oncology tumor board at the University of Chicago Medical Center. 3. To evaluate Bcl-3 expression level within each tumor and preliminarily examine the ability of Bcl-3 to predict response to TMZ and the efficacy of adding ACZ.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically proven, newly diagnosed WHO grade III or IV glioma. Patients are eligible if they had a prior low grade glioma and there is subsequent histological evidence of a diagnosis of grade III or IV tumor. Patients must be receiving TMZ as part of their treatment regimen. Patients must be ECOG performance status ≤1 or Karnofsky performance ≥60% (see appendix A). Normal organ activity, which includes adequate bone marrow function as defined by the following laboratory values: Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) ≥ 1.0 x 109/ L Platelets ≥ 80 x 109 / L Hemoglobin ≥ 8.0 g / dL Age ≥18 years. Because of the risk of adverse events in patients &lt;18 years of age, children are excluded from this study, but will be eligible for future pediatric trials. Renal function (creatinine level within normal institutional limit, or creatinine clearance ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for patients with creatinine level above institutional normal). Liver function (AST/ALT &lt;2.5 X institutional upper limit of normal, Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 times ULN, INR within 1.5 times ULN (or if receiving anticoagulant therapy an INR of ≤ 3.0 is allowed with concomitant increase in PT or an aPTT ≤ 2.5 × control). Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within 30 days of registration. Patients must have the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document. Prior invasive malignancy that is not lowgrade glioma (except nonmelanomatous skin cancer or carcinoma in situ of the cervix) unless the patient has been disease free and off therapy for that disease for a minimum of 3 years. Active systemic infection requiring treatment, including any HIV infection or toxoplasmosis. Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition, or laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or study drug administration. Systemic corticosteroid therapy, &gt;2 mg of dexamethasone daily (or equivalent) at study enrollment. Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition, or laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or study drug administration that may interfere with the interpretation of study results and in the judgment of the investigator would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study. Pregnant women are excluded from this study, where pregnancy is confirmed by a positive serum betahCG laboratory test. Breastfeeding should be discontinued.</criteria>
