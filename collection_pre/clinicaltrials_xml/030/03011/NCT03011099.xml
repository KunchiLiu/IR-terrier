	<criteria>Motor Incomplete spinal cord injury, as classified by American Spinal Injury Association guidelines, above the lumbar level (T12 and above). Able to independently stand for two minutes with or without an assistive device and with or without orthoses distal to the knee. Male or nonpregnant woman ≥ 18years of age At least 6 months after injury Height between 5'2" and 6'2" (150188 cm) Weight ≤ 220 pounds (100 kg) Ability to perform informed consent Presence of clinical signs of lower motor neuron injury History of severe neurologic injuries other than SCI (MS, CP, ALS, TBI, CVA, etc.) Severe comorbidities: active infections, heart, lung, or circulatory conditions, pressure ulcers. Documented severe osteoporosis affecting the hip and spine Severe spasticity in the lower extremities (Modified Ashworth ≥ 3) or uncontrolled clonus Unstable spine Unhealed limb or pelvic fractures Skin issues that would prevent wearing the device Range of motion restrictions that would prevent subject from achieving a normal, reciprocal gait pattern, or would restrict a subject from completing normal sit to stand or stand to sit transitions. Upper extremity strength deficits that limit ability to balance with a front rolling walker or crutches. Heterotopic ossification that resists functional range of motion in lower extremities Contractures (&gt;15 degrees at the hips or &gt;20 degrees at the knees) Psychiatric or cognitive comorbidities resulting in motor planning or impulsivity concerns Colostomy Have received any physical therapy intervention within 3 months prior to enrolment in the study NonEnglish speaking</criteria>
