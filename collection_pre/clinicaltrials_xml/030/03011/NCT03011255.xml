	<brief_summary>Immunotherapy is now considered to be one of promising approaches for treating cancer. Radiation therapy has been to be a cornerstone treatment for unresectable advanced esophageal cancer. Radiation-induced mutation genes were identified as new sources of tumor associated antigens using exon sequencing and peptide microarray technologies. Epitope peptides for these targets are able to induce peptide specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). In this clinical trial, investigators evaluate the efficacy and safety of peptide specific CTL therapy in combination with radiation therapy in treating patients with unresectable, advanced or recurrent esophageal cancer.</brief_summary>
