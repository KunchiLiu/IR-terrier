	<brief_summary>The program is to improve STEMI medical care quality in China. With the documents issued by National Health and Family Planning Commission of the People's Republic of China, the program was initialed in at least 200 primary PCI capable hospitals together with hundreds of adjacent non-primary PCI capable hospitals in 15 provinces. STEMI patients with symptom onset within 30 days will be enrolled in 3 periods. In each period with 6-month interval, 30 patients will be enrolled consecutively from each PCI-capable center initially and from non-primary PCI capable hospitals later, thus at least 18,000 STEMI patients from primary PCI capable hospitals will be enrolled and all of them will be followed up for 1 year. Key performance indicators (KPIs) in STEMI care will be collected using both national PCI online registry and a program STEMI online registry database for the purpose of improvement of medical care. Hospital KPIs rank report and problem-based resolution will be feedback to each hospital after data analysis in each period. Comparison of every two cross-sectional data (self) and within one cross-sectional (inter-hospital) data will be used to evaluate the improvement of medical quality.</brief_summary>
