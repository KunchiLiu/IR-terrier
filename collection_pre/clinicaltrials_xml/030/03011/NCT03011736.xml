	<brief_summary>This clinical trial studies the omission of intact parathyroid hormone testing during surgery in treating patients with primary hyperparathyroidism. Omission of intact parathyroid hormone testing during parathyroid gland removal may help patients with primary hyperparathyroidism to decrease their time under anesthesia, and decrease the overall time and cost of surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Omission of Intact Parathyroid Hormone Testing During Surgery in Treating Patients With Primary Hyperparathyroidism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the non-inferiority of omission of parathyroid hormone (PTH) in patients who meet the biochemical and radiological criteria compared to current standard of care (i.e. use of intraoperative parathyroid hormone testing). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Cost-analysis to determine savings of omission of intraoperative PTH testing. OUTLINE: Patients undergo standard minimally invasive parathyroidectomy without PTH testing during surgery. After completion of study, patients are followed up at 2 weeks.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Positive 4 dimensional computed tomography (4D CT) for single gland (adenoma) primary hyperparathyroidism Preoperative serum calcium levels &gt;= 10.9 mg/dL Preoperative parathyroid hormone (PTH) elevated beyond normal range or inappropriately high for associated calcium level Patient has no history of prior neck surgery or radiation Have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of =&lt; 2 Subject or legal representative must understand the investigational nature of this study and sign an Independent Ethics Committee/Institutional Review Board approved written informed consent form prior to receiving any study related procedure Patient has recurrent hyperparathyroidism 4D CT positive for multiple gland disease Patient has inability to tolerate 4D CT scan (for example; contrast intravenous (IV) allergy, claustrophobia, renal disease) Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements Pregnant or nursing female subjects; may be determined in the preoperative evaluation Unwilling or unable to follow protocol requirements Any condition which in the investigator's opinion deems the subject an unsuitable candidate to undergo observational study (may also include preoperative testing results including electrocardiography [EKG], chest xray, or pulmonary function tests that preclude a wide excision in the operating room)</criteria>
