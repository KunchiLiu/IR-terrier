	<brief_summary>Previous reports have the evidence implicating gait velocity may affect kinematic parameters. However, how the gait velocity will influence kinematic parameters remain unclear. The purpose of this research is to find out kinematic characteristics among different gait velocity. To do this, it will provide a reference for future prospective studies or investigations and make us fully understand the impact of gait velocity.</brief_summary>
