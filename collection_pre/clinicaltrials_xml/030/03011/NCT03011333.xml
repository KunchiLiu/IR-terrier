	<brief_summary>This is a Phase 2B, randomized, assessor-blind, active- and saline placebo-controlled, multicenter study in subjects undergoing augmentation mammoplasty to evaluate the analgesic efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of HTX-011 when administered via ultrasound-guided lateral and medial pectoral nerve block before surgery.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Each subject must meet all of the following criteria to be enrolled in this study: 1. Is able to provide written informed consent, adhere to the study visit schedule, and complete all study assessments. 2. Is female ≥18 years of age. 3. Is scheduled to undergo primary bilateral submuscular augmentation mammoplasty. 4. Has an American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) Physical Status of I, II, or III. 5. Is able to demonstrate motor function by raising both arms above the head unassisted. 6. Is able to assess sensory function by exhibiting sensitivity to cold in the pectoral area (upper outer quadrant). 7. Subjects are eligible only if all of the following apply: 1. Not pregnant (female subject of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test at screening and before study drug administration). 2. Not lactating. 3. Not planning to become pregnant during the study. 4. Surgically sterile; or at least 2 years postmenopausal; or have a monogamous partner who is surgically sterile; or is practicing doublebarrier contraception; or practicing abstinence (must agree to use doublebarrier contraception in the event of sexual activity); or using an insertable, injectable, transdermal, or combination oral contraceptive approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for greater than 2 months prior to screening and commits to the use of an acceptable form of birth control for the duration of the study and for 30 days after study drug administration A subject who meets any of the following criteria will be excluded from the study: 1. Has a planned concurrent surgical procedure. 2. Has a preexisting concurrent acute or chronic painful physical condition that may require analgesic treatment in the postoperative period for pain that is not strictly related to the augmentation mammoplasty and which may confound the postoperative assessments. 3. Has a history of hypersensitivity or idiosyncratic reaction to bupivacaine, or other amidetype local anesthetics, or meloxicam. 4. Has a contraindication/known or suspected hypersensitivity to bupivacaine, meloxicam, oxycodone, morphine, or hydromorphone (eg, Dilaudid®). 5. Has known or suspected daily use of opioids for 7 or more consecutive days within the previous 6 months. 6. Has taken longacting opioids within 3 days prior to surgery, or have taken any opioids within 24 hours prior to study drug administration. 7. Has taken bupivacaine or any other local anesthetic within 72 hours prior to study drug administration other than for pretreatment prior to a needle placement. 8. Has initiated treatment with any of the following medications within 1 month of study drug administration or is taking any of these medications to control pain: selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), gabapentin, pregabalin, duloxetine, or cyclooxygenase2 (COX2) inhibitors. If a subject is taking one of these medications for a reason other than pain control, she must be on a stable dose for at least 1 month prior to study drug administration. 9. Has a medical condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, participating in the study would pose a health risk to the subject. Conditions may include any of the following: 1. History of clinically significant cardiac abnormality such as New York Heart Association class III or IV, myocardial infarction, which resulted in significant clinical abnormalities of ECG or function. 2. Impaired kidney or liver function. 3. Chronic respiratory disease (compromised function requiring regular bronchodilator treatment). 4. Rheumatoid arthritis. 5. Known or suspected coagulopathy or uncontrolled anticoagulation. 6. Loss of sensation in extremities or significant peripheral neuropathy. 10. Has uncontrolled anxiety, psychiatric, or neurological disorder that might interfere with study assessments 11. Has any chronic neuromuscular deficit of either pectoral nerve function or arm/shoulder/truncal musculature. 12. Has any chronic condition or disease that would compromise neurological or vascular assessments. 13. Had a malignancy in the last year, with the exception of nonmetastatic basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or localized carcinoma in situ of the cervix. 14. Has a known or suspected history of alcohol or drug abuse, or a positive drug screen. 15. Previous participation in an HTX011 study. 16. Was administered an investigational product within 30 days or 5 elimination halflives (whichever is longer) prior to study drug administration, or is planning to take another investigational product or undergo another procedure during the subject's participation in this study. 17. Has a body mass index (BMI) &gt;35 kg/m2.</criteria>
