	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to obtain single-center safety and feasibility data on patients managed with reduced anti-coagulation, and the incidence of thrombotic and bleeding adverse events associated with the HeartMate 3 LVAS therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MAGENTUM 1 HeartMate 3 LVAS: A Single Center Prospective Controlled Study (MAGENTUM 1)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with implanted HeartMate 3 device will be bridged with heparin until target International Normalized Ratio (INR) of 2,0 - 3,0 will be reached on anticoagulation therapy with Warfarin. Along with Warfarin, Acetylsalicylic Acid (ASA) will be administered in dose of 100mg per day. Enrollment for the study will take place in 1-6 weeks post implant of HeartMate 3. Low-intensity anticoagulation protocol will be started at 6 weeks after implant. Target INR of 1,5-1,9 will be maintained and ASA will be administered in dose of 100mg per day with adjustments based on VerifyNow testing. Follow up will last for 6 months after HeartMate 3 implantation. Subsequently, the objectives of the study will be analyzed and evaluated.</detailed_description>
