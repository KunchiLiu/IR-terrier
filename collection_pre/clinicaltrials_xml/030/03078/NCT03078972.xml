	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate how the cardiovascular system interacts with mechanical hearts to provide blood flow to the body during exercise. Two aims are proposed: 1) to determine the impact of a mechanical heart on exercise pressor reflexes in heart failure patients; and 2) to define the primary determinant(s) of exercise capacity in heart failure patients before and after device implantation.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Advanced Heart Failure Individuals with severely reduced left ventricular systolic function that are scheduled to undergo LVAD insertion uncontrolled diabetes with peripheral neuropathy (interferes with acquisition of MSNA signal) Individuals with clinical right ventricular failure, defined as moderateseverely reduced RV systolic function on echocardiography, or clinical evidence of RV failure (elevated jugular venous pressures, significant peripheral edema) Individuals with moderatesevere preexisting aortic insufficiency, as these patients will typically undergo a Park stitch at time of CFLVAD insertion to permanently close the aortic valve and prevent worsening aortic insufficiency; and Disorders that adversely influence exercise ability (e.g. arthritis, peripheral vascular disease, pulmonary disease) Mild Heart Failure Individuals with medically managed left ventricular systolic function that are NOT scheduled to undergo LVAD insertion HF patients with ejection fraction &lt;3540% Individuals requiring systemic anticoagulation with vitaminK antagonists or new/direct oral anticoagulants ("NOAC"/"DOAC") Disorders that adversely influence exercise ability (e.g. arthritis, peripheral vascular disease, pulmonary disease) History of uncontrolled arrhythmias (e.g. ventricular tachycardia or nonsustained ventricular tachycardia). Healthy Controls Persons without a past medical history of cardiovascular disease or related disease (e.g. hypertension, diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, arrhythmias, stroke/transient ischemic attack) and are not taking any cardiacrelated medications (e.g. antihypertensive medications) Individuals requiring systemic anticoagulation with vitaminK antagonists or new/direct oral anticoagulants ("NOAC"/"DOAC") Disorders that adversely influence exercise ability (e.g. arthritis, peripheral ascular disease).</criteria>
