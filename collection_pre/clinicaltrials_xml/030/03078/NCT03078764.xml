	<brief_summary>This project explores the feasibility of using automated telephone calls to adult patients with type 2 diabetes to improve diabetes self-management in Thailand. This line of work could significantly extend Thai nurses' ability to manage this growing epidemic, and ultimately reduce the suffering and costs caused by diabetes in Thailand.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Adaptation, Usability, and Feasibility of a Mobile Health (mHealth) System to Improve Type 2 Diabetes Self-management in Thailand</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There is a serious shortage of community nurses to address Thailand's significant and expanding burden of poorly controlled type 2 diabetes. However, mobile health (mHealth) strategies are likely to significantly improve and extend Thai nurses' ability to monitor and manage these patients. This study aims to: 1) investigate the feasibility and acceptability of a culturally- and clinically-adapted mHealth intervention with adult Thai diabetic patients and their community nurses, and 2) estimate the intervention's effect upon glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting blood glucose, self-management behaviors, and diabetes-related distress in uncontrolled type 2 diabetes. Thirty-six patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes (along with their regular nurses) will be recruited through an established community clinic network. After baseline clinical and behavioral assessment, patients will receive 12 weeks of automated 10-minute weekly Interactive Voice Response (IVR) calls to provide monitoring and self-management support related to glycemic symptoms, medication adherence, and several self-care behaviors. Patients' clinical nurse will receive weekly summaries of each IVR call by text message and email with guidance on Thai-appropriate best practices. Principal investigator will receive Short Message Service (SMS) whenever patients report a potentially urgent issue by IVR, i.e., symptoms of hypoglycemia, or inadequate supply of medication. Immediately after the 12-week intervention concludes, clinical and behavioral variables will be reassessed and a mixed-methods process evaluation will be performed.</detailed_description>
