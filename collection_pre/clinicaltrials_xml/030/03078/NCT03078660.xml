This App was tested in a pilot trial to evaluate its feasibility, usability, and acceptability for making smart and healthy choices when purchasing food in grocery stores and test its effectiveness in improving food selection, dietary patterns, and weight status compared with the traditional nutritional counseling.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Trial to Test a Nutrition Application for Making Smart and Healthy Choices</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An innovative nutritional application (App) entitled "MyNutriCart" was developed to create a list of foods and beverages to help individuals make smart and healthy choices when purchasing foods at grocery stores based on the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. A pilot randomized clinical trial was done to test the effectiveness of this App on food selection and purchase, dietary patterns, and weight loss during two months of intervention. We also assessed feasibility, usability, satisfaction and acceptability of the App. A total of 138 overweight and obese adults aged 21-45 years old who own a Smartphone were invited to participate in this study. Participants were randomized into two groups; (1) the intervention group used the App, which generated a healthy grocery list to use when purchasing foods in in the supermarket; (2) the control group had a traditional intervention with a nutritionist. To assess the impact of the intervention on dietary patterns, participants completed three 24-hour dietary recalls, a short food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) and provided grocery receipts at baseline and at the end of the study (8 weeks later). Weight and height were also performed before and after the intervention. Feasibility, usability, satisfaction, and acceptability of the nutrition App were assessed at the end of the study using a questionnaire.</detailed_description>
