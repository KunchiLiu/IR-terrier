	<brief_summary>This is an observational retrospective study. The primary objective is to investigate the expression and potential prognostic role of Programmed Death Ligand 1 (PD-L1) in tumor samples from 350 patients with early stage treatment-naive non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Tissue samples were embedded in a tissue microarray. PD-L1 will be studied by immunohistochemistry using the SP263 antibody. Stained samples will be evaluated independently by two operators. A tumor will be defined as positive when = or &gt;50% of tumor cells express the ligand. The investigators will investigate the relationship between PD-L1 protein expression and overall survival and other clinical characteristics with appropriate statistical methods.</brief_summary>
