	<brief_title>Ticagrelor Versus High-dose Clopidogrel in Patients With High Platelet Reactivity on Clopidogrel After PCI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multi-center, randomized, single-blind, investigator-initiated study with a parallel design. Patients with coronary artery disease undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention and presenting high platelet reactivity on clopidogrel as assessed with the PL-11 analyzer (platelet maximum aggregation ratio [MAR%] ≥ 55 %) at 2 hours post-clopidogrel 300mg LD (Day 0), will be randomized after informed consent, in a 1:1 ratio to the following treatment groups: Group Α: Ticagrelor 180 mg immediate loading (on Day 0) followed by 180mg/day starting from Day 1 until Day 365 (12 months after randomization). Group Β: Clopidogrel 150mg per day, starting from Day 1 until Day 365 (12 months after randomization). Platelet reactivity assessment will be performed before randomization (Day 0), and 3-day after randomization (Day 3). Documentation of major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (death, myocardial infarction, stent thrombosis, stroke, revascularization procedure with PCI or CABG) and serious adverse events (bleeding, other adverse events) will be performed until 12 months.</detailed_description>
