	<brief_summary>Epipage 2 (epidemiologic study on small-for-gestational-age children) is a nationwide study implemented to improve our knowledge of the outcome of preterm children in France. This study was launched on March 28, 2011 and includes three groups of preterm children, all born before 35 weeks: extremely preterm infants (born between 22 and 26 completed weeks of gestation), very preterm children (born between 27 and 31 completed weeks) and moderately preterm children (born between 32 and 34 completed weeks). These children are being studied from their birth up to the age of 12 years. At birth, data on maternal and infants' characteristics were collected from medical records. At one and two years, questionnaires sent to families and to physicians (at two years only) allowed to collect data about the children's life and health. At five and a half years, medical and psychological assessments are specifically implemented for the study in order to evaluate motor and cognitive disorders in this population.</brief_summary>
