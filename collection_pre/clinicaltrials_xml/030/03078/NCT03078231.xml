	<brief_summary>More than 29 million people in the US are living with diabetes, many of whom will develop diabetic retinopathy (DR) or diabetic eye disease (DED), the leading cause of vision loss and blindness in working-age adults. Annual eye screening is recommended for all diabetic patients since vision loss can be prevented with laser photocoagulation and anti-VEGF injections if DR is diagnosed in its early stages. Currently, the number of clinical personnel trained for DR screening is orders of magnitude smaller than that needed to screen the large, growing diabetic population. Therefore, to meet this large unmet need for DR screening, a fully-automated computerized DR screening system is necessary. This study is designed to assess the performance of EyeArt, an automated DR screening tool.</brief_summary>
