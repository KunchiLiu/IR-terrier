	<brief_summary>Despite strong evidence suggesting that vitamin D deficiency is associated with undesirable outcomes in patients with numerous cancers, there has never been a thorough study of vitamin D treatment in subjects undergoing treatment for cancer. The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether modification of vitamin D levels in the blood, through supplementation, can improve outcomes.</brief_summary>
