	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to see how different antibiotics affect the community of friendly bacteria existing in the intestinal tract (gut). Under normal circumstances, these friendly bacteria are not harmful and they help with normal bodily functions such as digestion. When these bacteria are absent, several complications may occur, such as infections with harmful bacteria or other inflammatory reactions, that can complicate the stem cell transplant course. Treatment with antibiotics or chemotherapy is known to kill off these friendly bacteria. In this study we compare the effects of different antibiotics on the community of friendly bacteria in the gut.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Age ≥ 18 years Patients with any hematologic malignancy undergoing unmodified allogeneic HCT Patients must have a related or unrelated marrow or peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) donor as follows: A. Sibling donor must be a 6/6 match for HLAA and B at intermediate (or higher) resolution, and HLADRB1 at high resolution using DNAbased typing B. Unrelated donor must be an 8/8 match at HLAA, B, C and DRB1 at high resolution using DNAbased typing. Patients with any hematologic malignancy undergoing double umbilical cord blood transplantation with or without the infusion of Tcell depleted HLAhaploidentical peripheral blood stem cells. Patients with severe allergies to piperacillintazobactam or cefepime or aztreonam. Severe reactions include anaphylaxis and StevensJohnson syndrome (SJS)/toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). Patients with unconfirmed allergies to piperacillintazobactam, cefepime or aztreonam can be considered for Allergy/Immunology referral, an outpatient evaluation by Dr. Tim Mainardi, and may become eligible after clearance by an Allergy/Immunology specialist. Prolonged antibiotic treatment ( ≥10 days, within 3 weeks of enrollment) as prevention or suppression of an ongoing infection, where treatment involves gutperturbing anti anaerobic antibiotics Patients known to be colonized with multidrug resistant organisms or with history of infection with multidrug resistant organisms. Patients with history of infection with extendedspectrum betalactamase producing organism. Febrile patients Patients with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &lt; 30 mL/min/1.73m^2</criteria>
