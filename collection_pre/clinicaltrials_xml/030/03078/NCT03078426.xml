	<brief_summary>High resolution computed tomography (HRCT) plays a major role in the management of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) by identifying characteristic lesions of usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP). Though HRCT is the standard reference to describe pulmonary structural alterations using a non invasive technique, it is nonetheless a radiating exam which provides limited functional information regarding inflammation. In this trial, the investigators aimed to evaluate whether MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) using ultra-short echotime could be an alternative to HRCT in the assessment of the four morphological criteria required to define an UIP pattern. The investigators also planned to study the clinical value of the additional informations derived from MRI such as contrasts and lung perfusion using functional MRI.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>High resolution computed tomography (HRCT) is an essential component in the diagnostic pathway of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). With the appropriate clinical setting, the presence of an usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) pattern on HRCT is sufficient to diagnose IPF. Four morphological criteria are required: (1) Subpleural, basal predominance, (2) Reticular abnormality, (3) Honeycombing with or without traction bronchiectasis, (4) Absence of features inconsistent with UIP pattern. However, HRCT is a radiating technique and only give data about structural alterations. Recent advances in three-dimensional ultra-short echo time (3D-UTE) imaging have shown promising results in improving lung MR (Magnetic Resonance) imaging quality. Since HRCT is the standard reference in IPF, the investigators aimed to evaluate whether thoracic MRI could be an alternative to HRCT in the assessment of the four radiologic criteria required for the diagnosis of IPF. Moreover, thoracic MRI could give new functional data, expected to relate to lung inflammation. In order to study the diagnostic's accuracy of MRI for each radiological criteria defining UIP pattern, the investigators will compare HRCT and thoracic MRI of patients with IPF to HRCT and thoracic MRI of patients with other lung diseases that do not have all the UIP criteria. Study procedure will be gadolinium-enhanced PETRA (pointwise encoding time reduction with radial acquisition) MR sequencing compared to unenhanced HRCT within 15 days. No follow-up is needed.</detailed_description>
