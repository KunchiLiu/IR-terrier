	<brief_title>Profound Split-thigh Dermal and Subdermal Cellulite Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Up to 60 healthy female volunteers, seeking cellulite treatment, 18 to 60 years of age from up to 3 investigational sites. Prospective, open-label, baseline-controlled, two arms, randomized, clinical study to evaluate the Profound device using the Dermal and SubQ Cartridges for minimally-invasive treatment of the upper thighs and buttocks cellulite appearance. The treatment areas of the study subjects will be divided into two arms: 1. Arm 1 - the upper thigh/buttock on the left or right side of the body will undergo a single Profound treatment utilizing the Dermal and SubQ Cartridges 2. Arm 2 - the contralateral upper thigh/buttock side of the body will undergo a single Profound treatment utilizing the SubQ Cartridge only. Methodology described in protocol to evaluate efficacy of treatments will be carried out at each visit.</detailed_description>
