	<brief_title>Ten Year Implant Survivorship of the ANTHEM™ Total Knee System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The ANTHEM Study is a prospective, multicentre, cohort study to collect relevant patient reported, clinical, surgical and radiological data from 196 subjects implanted with the ANTHEM™ Knee System for degenerative joint disease in up to 6 clinical sites globally. Total study duration for study participants will be 10 years with post-operative follow-up visits planned for 6 weeks, 1 year, 2 years, 5 years, 7.5 years and 10 years. The study will evaluate the 10 year implant survivorship and the safety and outcome of the ANTHEM™ Knee System over 10 years. This is a post-market study of the ANTHEM™ Total Knee System. The primary objective of the study is to demonstrate non-inferiority (5% margin) of 10 year implant survivorship of the ANTHEM™ Total Knee System in patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty for osteoarthritis compared to reported literature. The secondary objectives of the study are to evaluate shorter and long term safety and outcomes of the ANTHEM™ Total Knee System. - Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcomes Score (KOOS) - 2011 Knee Society Score (2011 KSS) - EQ-5D - 3L - Femoral Fit ('Perfect Fit' rate) - Radiographic Assessment - Revision for any reason - Adverse Events (AEs)</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1. Subject is a candidate for primary total knee arthroplasty due to degenerative joint disease 2. Subject is willing to sign and date an ECapproved consent form 3. Subject is male or female between the ages of 18 and 75 years of age 4. Subject plans to be available through ten (10) years postoperative followup 5. Subject agrees to follow the study protocol 1. Subject would receive the ANTHEM™ Total Knee System on the affected knee as a revision for a previously failed total or unicondylar knee arthroplasty 2. Subject received TKA on the contralateral knee as a revision for a previously failed total or unicondylar knee arthroplasty 3. Subject has a history of patellar fracture, patellectomy, patellofemoral instability 4. Subject has inflammatory arthritis 5. Subject possesses a contralateral or ipsilateral revision hip arthroplasty 6. Subject has ipsilateral hip arthritis resulting in flexion contracture 7. Subject has one or more of the following arthroplasties that are not fully healed and wellfunctioning, as determined by the Investigator: Ipsilateral or contralateral primary total hip arthroplasty or hip resurfacing arthroplasty Contralateral primary total knee or unicondylar knee arthroplasty 8. Subject has an active infection or sepsis (treated or untreated) 9. Subject has presence of malignant tumor, either primary or metastatic, or benign tumor on leg with the knee to be treated 10. Subject has conditions that may interfere with the TKA survival or outcome (e.g. Paget's or Charcot's disease, vascular insufficiency, muscular atrophy, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus i.e. not under treatment with oral/injectable medications to control blood glucose levels, fibromyalgia, moderate to severe renal insufficiency or neuromuscular disease) 11. Subject has contralateral lower extremity condition causing abnormal ambulation (e.g. ankle fusion, ankle arthroplasty, previous hip fracture) 12. Subject is pregnant or plans to become pregnant during the study 13. Subject has an emotional or neurological condition that would preempt their ability or willingness to participate in the study, including mental illness, mental retardation, drug or alcohol abuse 14. Subject has a BMI&gt;40 15. Subject is enrolled in another investigational drug, biologic, or device study 16. Subject is facing current or impending incarceration 17. Subject has an inadequate bone stock to support the device which would make the procedure unjustifiable, including but not limited to: severe osteopenia/osteoporosis or family history of severe osteoporosis/osteopenia</criteria>
