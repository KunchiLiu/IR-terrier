	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to determine if the presence of bacterias with probiotic characteristics (Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and Bifidobacterium longum) in a commercial milk, control some measures that indicate cariogenic processes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Lactobacillus Rhamnosus GG and Bifidobacterium Longum in Children Aged 3 to 5 Years of Villavicencio and Pasto</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dental caries is a disease caused by a shift in pH balance, resulting in the formation of a biofilm composed mainly of cariogenic microflora. The interaction between this microflora and host factors conditions the deceleration or acceleration of the disease. Some biotechnology tools have been tried based on all this research, including probiotics, intended for a selective control of the etiological agents of caries and the maintenance of oral homeostasis. Methodology: In this study, preschool children belonging to public preschool in Villavicencio and Pasto, Colombia will be invited to participate. After obtaining parent´s informed consent, the children will start commercial milk (nanPro3 Nestlé) intake without probiotic during 3 months. One week after, they will start commercial milk with probiotic during others 3 months. Clinical and microbiological testing of saliva at baseline, 3 m and 6m will be performed. Differences in salivary pH (before and after a sugar solution), remineralization and demineralization in early Stage Decay and Established decay tooth (according ICDAS) and quantification of Streptococci of the mutans group. Expected results: Statistically significant decrease in pH drop, demineralization in decay tooth and quantification of Streptococci of the mutans group.</detailed_description>
