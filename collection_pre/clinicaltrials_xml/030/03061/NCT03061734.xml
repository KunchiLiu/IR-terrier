	<brief_summary>The product under investigation is an investigational combination of two marketed products in a low dose. Utilizing previously unrecognized properties of the components, the components of the combination inhibits two distinct targets in a newly discovered molecular pathway resulting in reduction of neuro-inflammation induced pain. The investigators propose that migraine is caused by innate immune system-induced neuro-inflammation near the trigeminal nerve system. The use of this combination product holds a strong biological rationale, acting synergistically, the two component contribute to blocking of two distinct neuro-inflammation producing targets. The goal of this study is to establish that the investigational product addresses not only headache pain but also other migraine associated symptoms, especially, nausea. Nausea associated with acute Migraine represents a significant unmet treatment need. Significant efficacy for headache pain and for nausea may suggest that the product's mechanism of action addresses the fundamental pathogenesis of migraine.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study consists of a screening visit, at home treatment of a single migraine attack with a single dose of the study drug, after study eligibility is confirmed, and an End-of-Study Visit 2-4 days after treatment of a migraine attack. Patients will have up to 8-week to treat a Qualified Migraine attack . The duration of patients' participation in the study is up to 10 weeks.</detailed_description>
