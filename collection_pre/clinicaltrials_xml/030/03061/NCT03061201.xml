	<brief_title>Dose-Ranging Study of Recombinant AAV2/6 Human Factor 8 Gene Therapy SB-525 in Subjects With Severe Hemophilia A</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective of the study is to reduce or eliminate the need for FVIII replacement therapy. The proposed SB-525 clinical study uses a recombinant adeno-associated virus 2/6 (AAV2/6) vector encoding the cDNA for the B-domain deleted human F8 (hF8). The secreted FVIII has the same amino acid sequence as approved recombinant anti hemophilic factors (Refacto® and Xyntha®). The SB-525 vector encodes a liver-specific promotor module and AAV2/6 exhibits liver tropism, thus providing the potential for long-term hepatic production of FVIII in hemophilia A subjects. The constant production of FVIII after a single SB-525 administration may provide potential benefit in durable protection against bleeding and the complications thereof without lifelong repetitive IV factor replacement administration.</detailed_description>
