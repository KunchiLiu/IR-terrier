	<brief_summary>This study aims to 1)characterize the differentially expressed metabolites between cardiomyopathy patients and healthy controls,2)identify the specific biomarkers associated with outcomes or risk evaluation in patients with different cardiomyopathies in a follow-up of a cohort and 3)to determine whether differentially expressed may affect the pathological process of cardiomyopathies . Standardized protocols will be used for the assessment of medical history and examinations, laboratory biomarkers, and the collection of blood plasma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Metabolomics Study of Cardiomyopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of this study is to analyze metabolomic profile of patients with cardiomyopathy in order to identify biochemical markers with risk stratification and prognostic value. Clinical data of enrolled patients regarding demographics, cardiovascular risk factorsï¼Œclinical lab data and previous cardiovascular disease will be recorded. Follow up will be at 3 months,6 months,9 months,1 year and 3 years and will be performed by clinical recordings or phone call when necessary. Blood samples of patients with cardiomyopathy are taken when they enrolled. Serum samples will be analyzed by Liquid Chromatograph Mass Spectrometer/Mass Spectrometer.</detailed_description>
