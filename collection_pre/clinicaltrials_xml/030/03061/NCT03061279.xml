	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is assess the safety and efficacy of Acutrak headless screws in comparison to other fixation methods (traditional headed screws, plates, and wires) used in the treatment of medial malleolus fracture of the ankle joint. The investigators hope to learn the following objectives from this study 1. Prospectively establish equivalence with respect to fracture union rate after Acutrak headless compression screw fixation when compared to other fixation methods for medial malleolus fractures. 2. Prospectively establish equivalence with respect Patient Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS) scores after Acutrak headless compression screw fixation when compared to other fixation methods for medial malleolus fractures. 3. Prospectively establish superiority with respect to hardware related pain after Acutrak headless compression screw fixation when compared to other fixation methods for medial malleolus fractures. 4. Prospectively establish superiority with respect to the hardware removal rate after Acutrak headless compression screw fixation when compared to other fixation methods for medial malleolus fractures. Patients scheduled for open reduction and internal fixation for medial malleolus fracture by using Acutrak headless screw or any other method will be asked to enroll by the attending physician, and those patients will be asked to consent to the study. Patients will be randomized by sealed envelope to surgical fixation with traditional headed screws, plates, and wires or Acutrak headless compression screws. At the time of randomization, the fracture pattern and severity, past medical history and medications, and demographic data will be documented. After operative fixation, patients will receive routine fracture follow-up with a clinical evaluation for tenderness, radiographs to evaluate stability and union, and complete the PROMIS and Visual Analogue Pain Scale (VAS) scores to 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years after surgical fixation</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. All ankle fractures that undergo open reduction internal fixation of the medial malleolus in adults at or over 18 yearsofage will be considered for inclusion. 1. All pediatric ankle fractures in children under 18 yearsofage 2. Tibial plafond (pilon) fractures in children and adults 3. Medial malleolar osteotomies to access the talus, perform an ankle fusion, or deal with a pathologic lesion, osteonecrosis, or infection due to their diversity in diagnosis, management, and weight bearing status. 4. Patients with prior surgical treatment of the ankle for fracture, deformity, infection, neoplasia, or other pathologic process on the ipsilateral extremity will also be excluded. 5. Patients that are nonweight bearing on one or both lower extremities prior to sustaining their ankle injury will be excluded.</criteria>
