	<brief_summary>Prospective, single center, double armed, randomized treatment with observation only (standard of care) control group. Subjects receiving study treatment will have 6 months of study follow-up. Stromal vascular fraction (SVF), an adipose-derived tissue preparation, will be injected into salivary glands to determine safety and efficacy to restore saliva production in head and neck cancer patients with chronic xerostomia resulting from radiation therapy.</brief_summary>

No current malignancy or history of previous malignancy within the last five years, other than the head and neck cancer, with the exception of adequately treated nonabdominal, nonmelanoma cutaneous carcinoma (basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin) Willing to undergo a minor surgical procedure (smallvolume liposuction, totaling approximately 60120cc) and a single treatment of an injection of approximately 30ml of autologous Stromal Vascular Fraction taking approximately 10 minutes Abdominal area amenable to liposuction of at least 60120cc of adipose tissue based on Investigator(s) examination Willing to be available for all baseline, treatment and followup examinations required by protocol Willing to forego participation in any other study throughout the duration of this study unless receiving prior approval by Investigator Patients taking immunosuppressive therapy in the prior 3 months Autoimmune disorders Patients who are pregnant or currently breastfeeding children Patients participating in a study of an experimental drug or medical device within 60 days of study entry Uncontrolled hypertension Reported unstable cardiovascular disease (e.g., unstable angina, myocardial infarction within past 6 months, cardiac failure or lifethreatening arrhythmia, congestive heart failure) or symptomatic postural hypotension within 6 months before screening Hemoglobin A1c &gt; 8% within 8 weeks prior to study treatment Current use of steroids or immunosuppressant therapies Any other condition, which, in the opinion of the Investigator, would contraindicate treatment, affect compliance, interfere with study evaluations, limit study participation, or confound the interpretation of study results History of Sjogren's Syndrome or related autoimmune disease.
