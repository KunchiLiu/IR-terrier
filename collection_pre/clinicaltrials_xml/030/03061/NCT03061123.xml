	<brief_summary>The risk of stroke is markedly elevated in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). Oral anticoagulation (OAC) is indicated in individuals with moderate and high risk of stroke to the disadvantage of an increased burden from bleeding. Adequate knowledge of this disorder and understanding the benefits and hazards of antithrombotic treatment are essential to incorporate patient´s values and preferences in these decisions. This will further improve acceptance of recommended therapy and augment compliance with OAC. The objective of this investigation is to compare patient´s perceptions and physician´s assessments of benefits and risks of OAC.</brief_summary>
