	<brief_summary>This study is designed to evaluate men before radical prostatectomy for the incidence of Overactive Bladder (OAB), as well as urge urine incontinence (UUI) development after the surgery. Patients will be evaluated for signs of OAB and for signs of Bladder Outlet Obstruction (BOO). Afterwards they will be divided into four observational groups. Follow up period is designed to be 12 months.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Urinary Bladder Hypertrophy on Urge Urine Incontinence After Radical Prostatectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Radical prostatectomy remains the standard treatment in case of organ-confined and in selected cases of locally advanced prostate cancer. Radical prostatectomy consists of removing the prostate gland and seminal vesicles, ideally with negative surgical margins. Most of the patients who present urinary incontinence after radical prostatectomy have stress urinary incontinence. However in some cases the post-surgical urinary incontinence is also due to urgency caused by overactive bladder development defined as urge urinary incontinence. Recent clinical observations suggest that men can also develop overactive bladder after radical prostatectomy. This study is designed to evaluate men before radical prostatectomy for the incidence of Overactive Bladder (OAB) and it's development after the surgery. Before surgery questionnaire assessment of lower urinary tract symptoms will be performed using International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) questionnaire. OAB symptoms will be analyzed using King's questionnaire, as well as using two different OAB symptom score (OABSS) designed by Blavis et al. and Homma et al. Each patient will have transabdominal ultrasonographic evaluation of the prostate and urinary bladder structure. Prostatic dimensions width (W), height (H), length (L) and volume will be recorded. The ultrasonography will be done in urinary bladder filling related to normal desire to void. Urinary bladder wall thickness (BWT) and detrusor muscle thickness (DWT) will be measured in sagittal plane in anterior bladder wall. The mean of three following measurements BWT and DWT will be obtained. The urinary bladder weight (UEBW: Ultrasound Estimated Bladder Weight) will be also estimated. After ultrasonography each patient will undergo uroflowmetry with post-void residual estimation. On the results above 4 groups will be formed Group 1 OAB (-) BOO (-) Group 2 OAB (-) BOO (+) Group 3 OAB (+) BOO (+) Group 4 OAB (+) BOO (-) The investigators will obtain detail information about the surgery (time, blood loss, histopathological outcome, nerve sparing, complications). After the initial evaluation of the patients before surgery, the control evaluation is set on 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 month after radical prostatectomy in groups 1-4 to define the lower urinary tract symptoms after radical prostatectomy related to pre-surgical patient clinical feature. During each of the following controls the investigator will not have the access to previously obtained data from the patient. In addition, healthy volunteers aged 20 to 40 will be assigned as a control group.</detailed_description>
