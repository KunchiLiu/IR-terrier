	<brief_summary>Pregnant women who are at risk of delivering their infants in the periviable period can suffer a large amount of stress and anxiety. Moreover, many women feel a loss of control over their own pregnancy. There is some evidence that more counseling and planning can help reduce maternal stress and anxiety. Patients at risk of delivering in the periviable period will be randomized to either receive standard counselling or to complete the periviable birth plan.</brief_summary>
