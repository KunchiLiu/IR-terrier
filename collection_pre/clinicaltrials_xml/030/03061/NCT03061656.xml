	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of tandem HDCT/ASCT including high-dose 131I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) treatment. In the present study, a single arm trial of tandem HDCT/ASCT will be carried out.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tandem High Dose Chemotherapy With 131I-MIBG Treatment in High Risk Neuroblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although the outcome of high-risk neuroblastoma has improved after the introduction of HDCT/ASCT, the outcome was still unsatisfactory with 30-40% of survival. We previously reported the results of a single arm prospective trial (SMC NB-2004 study) using tandem HDCT/auto-SCT for high-risk neuroblastoma. In the NB-2004 trial, total body irradiation (TBI) was incorporated in second transplantation. Survival rates were very encouraging; however, short- and long-term toxicities associated with tandem HDCT/auto-SCT, particularly TBI, were also very significant. For this reason, we designed a new prospective trial (SMC NB-2009 study), in which only TBI in the second HDCT/auto-SCT of NB-2004 study was substituted with high-dose 131I-MIBG treatment in order to reduce short- and long-term toxicities without jeopardizing survival rate.</detailed_description>
