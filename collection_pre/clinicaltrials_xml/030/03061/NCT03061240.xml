	<brief_summary>This study is the second phase of a research project called "Smart Pain Assessment Tool based on Internet-of-Things". During the course of this project, a smart pain assessment tool (SPA) to detect and assess pain employing behavioural and physiologic indicators will be developed. We aim to assess pain based on changes in electromyographic (EMG) activity in facial muscles, i.e. changes in facial expressions and simultaneously use physiologic signs such as heart rate, respiratory rate and galvanic skin response as adjuvant measures to develop an algorithm for pain assessment in critically ill patients.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The aim of this "smart pain assessment tool based on internet of things" SPA-research project is to develop an automatic and versatile pain assessment tool algorithm for detection and assessment of pain in a reliable and objective way in non-communicative patients. The final objective of the research project is to develop a smart pain assessment tool to detect and assess pain employing behavioural and physiologic indicators for a wide range of users/patients from infants to elderly people who are unable to communicate normally. The research project consists of three clinical phases (European Commision. Meddev 2.7/4/2010). The clinical phase I of the research project focused on developing pain assessment techniques involuntary working-age healthy study subjects. This current Clinical phase II includes the further development and research of the smart pain assessment tool in elective (non emergency) postoperative surgical patients during their stay after surgery in a recovery room.</detailed_description>
