	<brief_title>Pulsed Low Dose Rate Radiation Therapy for Gastric Cancer Patients With Peritoneal Metastasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase II trial studies the side effects and response of pulsed low dose rate radiation therapy in treating gastric cancer patients with peritoneal metastasis. Radiation therapy uses pulsed low dose rate high energy X rays to kill tumor cells and make less side effects than conventional 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy. Palliative radiation therapy may help gastric cancer patients with peritoneal metastasis live more comfortably.</detailed_description>
