	<criteria>1. Subject voluntarily agrees to participate in this study and signs an Institutional Review Board (IRB)approved informed consent before any of the screening procedures are performed. 2. Male subjects aged between 18 and 55 years (both inclusive) at screening. 3. Body mass index (BMI) of 18.5 to 32.0 kg/m2 (both inclusive) at screening. 4. Medical history, vital signs, physical examination, standard 12lead ECGs and laboratory investigations (clinical chemistry, hematology and urinalysis) must be clinically acceptable or within laboratory reference ranges for the relevant laboratory tests, unless the PI considers the deviation to be irrelevant for the purpose of the study. These assessments may be repeated once at the discretion of the PI. 5. Subjects with partners of childbearing potential must be willing to use medically acceptable double barrier forms of contraception from IMP administration until at least 3 months after the last day of IMP administration. Subjects must not donate sperm for the duration of the study and for at least 3 months after the last day of IMP administration. 6. Is a nonsmoker or nontobacco/nicotine user confirmed with urine cotinine test at screening and on admission to the EPCU. Nicotine products include, but are not limited to, tobacco cigarettes, electronic cigarettes, snuff, cigars, and pipes, including hookah or water pipes. The use of nicotine patches or gum (e.g., products used as part of a smoking cessation program) is not allowed. 1. Has a known hypersensitivity to any component of the formulation of DA 1241 or any of the excipients or to medicinal products with similar chemical structures. 2. Has a history or presence of any clinically significant neurologic, cardiovascular, pulmonary, hepatic, renal, metabolic, gastrointestinal or endocrine disease or other abnormality that may impact the ability of the subject to participate or potentially confound the study results. 3. Has a glycated hemoglobin A1C (HgbA1C) of â‰¥ 6.5% consistent with possible diabetes at screening. 4. Any disorder that would interfere with the absorption, distribution, metabolism or excretion of drugs. 5. Any concurrent disease or condition that, in the opinion of the PI, would make the subject unsuitable for participation in the clinical study. 6. Subject has a history of drinking &gt; 21 units of alcohol per week (1 unit = 10 g pure alcohol = 250 mL of beer [5%] or 35 mL of spirits [35%] or 100 mL of wine [12%]) within 3 months prior to admission to the EPCU. 7. Have positive test results for Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), Hepatitis C virus antibodies (anti HCV) or human immunodeficiency virus 1 and/or 2 antibodies (anti HIV1 and/or 2) at screening. 8. History of drug abuse or has a positive urine drug test (cocaine, amphetamines, barbiturates, opiates, benzodiazepines, cannabinoids, etc.) at screening or on Day 1. 9. Has donated or lost 450 mL or more of his blood volume (including plasmaphoresis), or had a transfusion of any blood product within 3 months before screening. 10. Taking any medication including prescription, herbal remedies, vitamin supplements, dietary supplements or other overthecounter (OTC) products within 14 days or 5 halflives of the product (whichever period is longer) before admission to the EPCU. 11. Has an abnormal (clinically significant) ECG at screening or on Day 1. Entry of any subject with an abnormal (but not clinically significant) ECG must be approved and documented by signature, by the PI or medically qualified Subinvestigator. 12. Has a supine blood pressure (BP) outside the ranges of 90 to 140 mmHg, inclusive, for systolic BP and 50 to 90 mmHg, inclusive, for diastolic BP, or has a resting heart rate outside the range of 45 to 100 beats per minute (bpm). If any of the values are out of range, the assessment may be repeated once for eligibility determination, at screening and admission on Day 1. 13. Has a corrected QT interval using Fridericia's corrected formula (QTcF) interval greater than 450 msec or PR interval outside the range of 120 to 220 msec. If any values are out of range, the ECG may be repeated once for eligibility determination, at screening and admission on Day 1. 14. Has an abnormal laboratory value that suggests a clinically significant underlying disease or has alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) values greater than 1.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN). Laboratory assessments may be repeated once to confirm eligibility at screening and on Day 1. 15. Participation in another study with an experimental drug within 30 days or 5 halflives, whichever is longer, of this study's screening visit. Participation is defined as the date of last dose received in the previous study. 16. Unwilling to abstain from vigorous exercise within 48 hours before Day 1. 17. Intake of any food or drinks containing grapefruit, Chinese grapefruit (pomelo), star fruit, pomegranate or Seville orange (including marmalade) within 48 hours before admission to the EPCU. 18. Have used alcohol within 72 hours prior to screening or within 72 hours prior to admission to the EPCU. 19. Is unlikely to comply with the protocol requirements, instructions and studyrelated restrictions; e.g., uncooperative attitude, inability to return for followup visits and improbability of completing the clinical study. 20. Is a studysite employee or an immediate family member or dependent (e.g., spouse, parent, child or sibling) of a studysite employee who is involved in the conduct of this study. 21. Has difficulty swallowing 2 tablets at the same time.</criteria>
