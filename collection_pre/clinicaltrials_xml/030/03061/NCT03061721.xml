	<brief_summary>This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in up to 104 patients with a diagnosis of NAFLD and/or NASH. The study will be conducted over a period of up to 22 weeks and will include a Screening Phase, a 16-week Treatment Phase following randomization. Patients will be randomly assigned in a ratio of 1:1:1:1 to receive Saroglitazar Magnesium 1mg or 2 mg or 4 mg or matching placebo once daily in the morning before breakfast for 16 Weeks. The primary endpoint of the study is percentage change from baseline in serum ALT levels at Week 16 in the Saroglitazar Magnesium groups as compared to the placebo group.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Males or females, 18 to 75 years of age, with body mass index (BMI) between 25 and 40 kg/m2. 2. Documented diagnosis of NAFLD established either by imaging (ultrasound, CT scan or MRI) or liver biopsy showing NASH or simple steatosis, within the 12 months preceding Visit 1. The diagnosis of NAFLD is made according to the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) criteria (Chalasani et al. Hepatology 2012; 55:20052023). 3. ALT level of ≥ 1.5 × ULN at Visit 1 and Visit 2 with &lt; 30% variance between the levels at Visit 1 and Visit 2. 4. Patient's demonstration of understanding of study requirements and treatment procedures, willingness to comply with all protocolrequired evaluations; provision of written informed consent before any study specific tests or procedures are performed. 1. Consumption of &gt; 3 units of alcohol per day (&gt; 21 units per week) if male and &gt; 2 units of alcohol per day (&gt;14 units per week) if female for at least 3 consecutive months in the 5 years preceding Visit 1 (Note: 1 unit = 12 ounces of beer, 4 ounces of wine or 1 ounce of spirits/hard liquor). 2. Presence of alternative causes of fatty liver, including: 1. Weight change &gt;5% within the 3 months preceding Visit 1 2. Total parenteral nutrition, starvation or proteincalorie malnutrition within the 90 days preceding Visit 1. 3. Use of drugs associated with NAFLD for more than 12 consecutive weeks in the 1 year before Visit 1, including amiodarone, tamoxifen, methotrexate, systemic glucocorticoids, anabolic steroids, tetracycline, estrogens in doses higher than used in oral contraceptives, vitamin A, L asparaginase, valproate, chloroquine or antiretroviral drugs 3. Use of vitamin E (&gt;100 IU/day) or multivitamins containing vitamin E (&gt; 100 IU/day) in the 3 months preceding Visit 1. 4. Use of drugs with potential effect on NASH such as ursodeoxycholic acid, Sadenosylmethionine (SAMe), betaine, pentoxifylline, obeticholic acid or milk thistle in the 3 months prior to Visit 1. 5. Changing doses of statins (simvastatin, pitavastatin, pravastatin, atorvastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, rosuvastatin) or fibrates (clofibrate, fenofibrate) in the 3 months preceding Visit 1. 6. Use of thiazolidinediones (pioglitazone, rosiglitazone). 7. Use of drugs that are known CYP2C8 inhibitors/substrate 8. History of bowel surgery (gastrointestinal (bariatric) surgery or undergoing evaluation for bariatric surgery for obesity, extensive smallbowel resection or orthotopic liver transplant (OLT) or listed for OLT. 9. History of other chronic liver disease (chronic hepatitis C, (HCV) infection, irrespective of their mRNA HCV assay status or active hepatitis B infection, (i.e., serum positive for hepatitis B surface antigen) or autoimmune hepatitis, cholestatic and metabolic liver diseases) or hemochromatosis 10. Patient has known cirrhosis, either based on clinical criteria or liver histology. 11. Patient with INR &gt;1.3. 12. Type 1 diabetes mellitus. 13. Poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus, i.e., glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) &gt; 9%. 14. Unstable cardiovascular disease, including: 1. unstable angina, (i.e., new or worsening symptoms of coronary heart disease within the 3 months preceding Visit 1), acute coronary syndrome within the 6 months preceding Visit 1, acute myocardial infarction within the 3 months preceding Visit 1 or heart failure of New York Heart Association class (III IV) or worsening congestive heart failure, or coronary artery intervention, within the 6 months preceding Visit 1 2. history of (within 3 months preceding Visit 1) or current unstable cardiac dysrhythmias 3. uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure [BP] &gt; 160 mmHg and/or diastolic BP &gt; 100 mmHg) 4. stroke or transient ischemic attack within the 6 months preceding Visit 1. 15. History of myopathies or evidence of active muscle disease. 16. History of malignancy in the 5 years preceding Visit 1 and/or active neoplasm with the exception of resolved superficial nonmelanoma skin cancer. 17. Any of the following laboratory values: 1. Hemoglobin &lt; 9 g/dL 2. White blood cell count &lt; 2.5 × 103/μL 3. Neutrophil count &lt; 1.5 × 103/μL 4. Platelets &lt; 100 × 103/μL 5. Total Serum bilirubin &gt; 1.5 mg/dL (except in patient with known Gilbert bilirubin where TB up to 2.5 mg/dL is allowed), if it is &lt;1.5 mg/dL at screening and &gt;30% variance in the levels at Visit 1 and Visit 2 6. Albumin &lt; 3.2 g/dL 7. Serum creatinine &gt;1.5 mg/dL 8. Serum ALT or AST &gt; 250 IU/L at Visit 1 or Visit 2 and if it is &lt; 250 IU/L at screening, and &gt; 30% variance in the levels at Visit 1 and Visit 2. 18. Contraindications to Saroglitazar Magnesium or has any conditions affecting the ability to evaluate the effects of Saroglitazar Magnesium. 19. Known allergy, sensitivity or intolerance to the study drug, placebo or formulation ingredients. 20. Participation in any other therapeutic clinical study within the 3 months preceding Visit 1, including participation in any other NAFLD/NASH clinical trials. 21.

Pregnancyrelated exclusions, including: 1. Pregnant/lactating female (including a positive serum pregnancy test at Visit 1) 2. Fertile women and men, UNLESS using effective contraceptive methods, such as an intrauterine device or other mechanical contraception method with condom or diaphragm and spermicide) throughout the study. For male patients, contraception measures (condom and spermicide) must be taken during the study, either by the male participant or his female partner. (Note: Enrolled females otherwise must be surgically sterilized for at least the 6 months preceding Visit 1 or postmenopausal, defined as 12 months with no menses without an alternative medical cause). 24. History or other evidence of severe illness or any other conditions that would make the patient, in the opinion of the investigator, unsuitable for the study (such as poorly controlled psychiatric disease, HIV, coronary artery disease or active gastrointestinal conditions that might interfere with drug absorption).</criteria>
