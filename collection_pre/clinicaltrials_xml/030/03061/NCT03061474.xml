	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to test whether nicotinamide, also known as vitamin B3 or niacinamide, taken in high doses, can reduce phosphorylation of tau (the protein that accumulates in neurofibrillary tangles) in people with Mild Cognitive Impairment or mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nicotinamide as an Early Alzheimer's Disease Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nicotinamide, the amide of nicotinic acid (vitamin B3/niacin), is an oral therapy with a wealth of clinical data in a variety of therapeutic areas, including preliminary data supporting its safety in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Preclinical work in a mouse model that develops both plaques and tangles supports the hypothesis that nicotinamide can act as a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor to reduce phosphorylation of tau. The study will implement a group sequential design, incorporating a futility analysis with a go/no-go decision conditional on cerebral spinal fluid CSF biomarker outcomes at 12-months. The primary outcome for the trial is change in p-tau231. This study timeline includes a screening phase of up to 60 days and treatment phase which is expected to last about 48 weeks and will include 4 study visits. An additional 12-month treatment and follow-up period is planned, contingent upon a "go" decision based on the primary outcome (CSF p-tau231) or one planned secondary outcome (CSF p-tau181)</detailed_description>
