	<criteria>Participant must have histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced or metastatic Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC) with documented first disease progression during or following frontline platinumbased systemic regimen Tumor must have high Deltalike protein 3 (DLL3) expression defined as having â‰¥ 75% tumor cells staining positive according to a VENTANA DLL3 immunochemistry (IHC) Assay. Participant must have measurable disease, as defined per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 per the Central Radiographic Assessment Committee (CRAC). Participant must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1. Participant must have recovery to Grade 0 or 1 of any clinically significant toxicity (excluding alopecia) prior to initiation of study drug administration. Participant has a documented history of a cerebral vascular event (stroke or transient ischemic attack), unstable angina, myocardial infarction, or cardiac symptoms consistent with New York Heart Association Class (NYHA) III IV within 6 months prior to their first dose of study drug. Participant has known leptomeningeal metastases. Participant has received more than one prior systemic therapy regimen for SCLC. Participant had a serious infection within 2 weeks prior to randomization, including any Grade 3 or higher viral, bacterial, or fungal infection. Participant has a history of active malignancies other than SCLC within the past 2 years prior to study entry, with the exception of in situ cancer which was curatively treated. Participant had prior exposure to topotecan, irinotecan or any other topoisomerase I inhibitors.</criteria>
