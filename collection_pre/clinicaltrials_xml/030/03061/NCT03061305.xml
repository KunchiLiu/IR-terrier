	<brief_summary>Many patients are treated for advanced cancer without knowledge of underlying molecular features that might indicate FDA approved therapies or potential eligibility for biomarker-selected clinical trials. Strata Oncology is initiating the Strata Trial (STR-001-001) with the primary goal of understanding the proportion of subjects available for clinical trials and approved targeted therapies in advanced cancer while assessing the feasibility of using a large-scale NGS screening program to match subjects for eligibility assessments in clinical trials and/or for approved targeted therapies. The Strata Trial does not require additional procedures but rather uses surplus, or leftover tumor specimens for molecular profiling.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Profiling Biospecimens From Cancer Patients to Screen for Molecular Alterations Related to Treatment Selection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Strata Trial is a precision oncology collaboration structured as an observational master screening protocol with the aim to match patients to genomically-guided therapeutic protocols and/or approved therapies. Subjects enrolled on the Strata trial will submit surplus, clinical formalin fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor specimens for molecular profiling and a test report will be provided back to the investigator. For those subjects identified as having molecular variants associated with an affiliated therapeutic protocol and/or approved targeted therapy, the Strata report will provide additional relevant information. All molecular profiling will be performed in the Strata Oncology CLIA-certified laboratory (Ann Arbor, MI). The molecular profiling assays will include targeted next generation sequencing (NGS) of DNA and RNA covering a range of actionable genomic variants, such as gene mutations (e.g. those in EGFR and BRAF), gene amplifications (e.g. ERBB2) and gene fusions (e.g. ALK). Subjects who have been identified with genetic alterations relevant to a trial or targeted therapy will be followed for treatment changes for three years from the time of signed informed consent.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Subjects must be ≥ 18 years of age. Subjects must have histologically documented solid tumors or lymphoma. Subjects must have measurable (&gt;10mm lesion) metastatic disease (i.e. Stage IV) or unresectable disease (e.g. glioblastoma, Stage III pancreatic cancer) Subjects must have ECOG performance status ≤ 2, see Appendix I. Subjects must have an adequate formalinfixed paraffinembedded tumor specimen for genomic sequencing.</criteria>
