	<brief_summary>This study is designed for patients diagnosed with MET-driven, unresectable and locally advanced or metastatic Papillary Renal Cell Carcinoma. The purpose of this study is to see if an investigational new anti-cancer medication, savolitinib, is effective in treating patients with MET-driven PRCC, how it compares with another medication frequently used to treat this disease called sunitinib, and what side effects it might cause.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Histologically confirmed Papillary Renal Cell Carcinoma, which is unresectable and locally advanced or metastatic with measurable disease as per RECIST 1.1. 2. Confirmation of METdriven PRCC without cooccurring Fumarate Hydratase or Von Hippel Lindau mutations from a tumour sample using the sponsordesignated central laboratory validated MET Next Generational Sequencing assay 3. Patients who have received no prior systemic therapy as well as those who have received prior systemic therapy for PRCC. Patients who have received prior therapy must have had disease progression within 6 months of the last dose of previous systemic therapy 4. Adequate haematological, renal (creatinine &lt; 2xULN), cardiac and liver functions 5. Karnofsky performance status ≥ 80 6. Ability to swallow oral medicines. 1. Most recent cytotoxic chemotherapy, immunotherapy, chemoimmunotherapy, or investigational agents &lt;21 days from the date of randomisation or 5 halflives of the agent, whichever is longer. Most recent noncytotoxic targeted therapy &lt;14 days from the date of randomisation. 2. Prior treatment with a MET inhibitor (e.g. foretinib, crizotinib, cabozantinib, onartuzumab or previous savolitinib) or sunitinb. 3. Treatment with strong inducers or inhibitors of CYP3A4 or strong inhibitors of CYP1A2, taken within 2 weeks or not possible to be stopped for at least 2 weeks before the date of randomisation. 4. History of serious liver disease 5. Serious active infection or gastrointestinal disease 6. Uncontrolled hypertension (BP ≥150/95 mmHg despite medical therapy)</criteria>
