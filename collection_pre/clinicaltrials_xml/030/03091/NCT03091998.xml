	<brief_summary>The worldwide use of left ventricular assist devices (LVAD), which is mechanical device to improve hemodynamic function, has improved the outcomes of severe heart failure (HF) patients leading to the continued annual increase in the number of LVAD implantations. However LVAD support still results in major complications such as renal failure or gastrointestinal bleeding. The investigators hypothesize that such major complications may be due to endothelial dysfunction induced by the lack of pulsatility, which may be improved by an innovative designer natriuretic peptide, CD-NP. They have demonstrated its favorable actions in animal models as well as humans, and tested its safety in LVAD patients. They hypothesize that CD-NP will have renal and endothelial protective actions through its receptor GC-A and GC-B. Thus, the investigators will test their hypothesis with a highly translational approach to examine CD-NP's role in endothelial and renal protection. The aim is to determine safety and tolerability together with cGMP activating, neurohumoral modulating and renovascular protective properties of chronic subcutaneous delivery of CD-NP compared to placebo in stable LVAD patients for 3 days.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Subcu Administration of CD-NP in Heart Failure Patients With Left Ventricular Assist Device Support</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Stable patients with LVAD implantation (3 months s/p implantation) will undergo 3-day testing in the Mayo Clinic's Clinical Research and Trials Unit. They will undergo daily subcutaneous injection of CD-NP, or placebo, for 3 days with hemodynamic monitoring, ECHO, endothelial function assessment, and renal blood flow monitoring. Blood and urine samples will also be collected and assayed.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Male and nonpregnant/postmenopausal/sterile females, ages 1890, in endstage HF with LVAD support who are stable in the healed stage at least 3 months from the LVAD implant (Destination therapy only) (the postmenopausal state is defined as the absence of menses for ≥ 1 year or serum folliclestimulating hormone ≥ 20 IU/L; sterilization in the female is defined as bilateral tubal occlusion for ≥ 6 months, bilateral oophorectomy, or complete hysterectomy) Be willing to provide informed consent. All cardiac medications must be at stable doses 4 weeks prior to enrollment. Known allergy or other adverse reactions to exogenous natriuretic peptides (CDNP or its components, nesiritide, other natriuretic peptides, or related compounds). Women who are pregnant, or breastfeeding. Having received nesiritide within 7 days prior to entry into the study. Having received any investigational drug or device within 30 days prior to entry into the study. Clinically unstable patients (e.g. mean blood pressure &lt; 70 mmHg, ongoing requirement for vasopressors, or mechanical ventilation). Recent hospitalization for decompensated HF or recent defibrillation for cardiac resuscitation within 30 days prior to randomization. Patients with guarded prognosis who are unlikely to derive meaningful benefit from CDNP. Presence of cardiac lesions or comorbidities that may contraindicate the use of natriuretic peptides, such as clinically significant cardiac valvular stenosis, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, restrictive cardiomyopathy, constrictive pericarditis, primary pulmonary hypertension, or uncorrected congenital heart disease that contraindicates the use of vasodilators. Symptomatic carotid artery disease, known critical carotid stenosis, or stroke within the past 3 months Requirement of pressors for maintenance of blood pressure. Intraaortic blood pump use.
