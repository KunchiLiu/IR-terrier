	<brief_summary>To investigate the effect of four single oral doses of BIA 6-512 (25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg and 200 mg) on levodopa pharmacokinetics when administered in combination with a single-dose of controlled release levodopa/benserazide 100/25 mg and to assess the tolerability and safety of four single oral doses of BIA 6-512 (25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg and 200 mg) when administered in combination with a single-dose of controlled release levodopa/benserazide 100/25 mg.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tolerability, Safety and Pharmacokinetics of Four Single-doses of BIA 6-512 (Trans-resveratrol) and Their Effect on the Levodopa Pharmacokinetics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Single centre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, crossover study with five single-dose treatment periods, with a washout period between doses of 5 days or more. In each of the five consecutive treatment periods, eligible subjects were admitted to the UFH in the day prior to receiving the study medication. On the morning of the dosing day, subjects received BIA 6-512/Placebo concomitantly with Madopar® HBS 125 in fasting conditions (at least 8 hours) and remained in the UFH until at least 24 h post-dose; then, they were discharged and returned for the next period or the follow-up visit. Blood samples for the assay of plasma BIA 6-512, levodopa and 3-O-methyldopa (3-OMD) were taken at the following times: pre-dose, ¼, ½, 1, 1½, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 16 and 24 hours post-dose.</detailed_description>
