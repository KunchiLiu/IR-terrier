	<brief_summary>This is an open label randomized, controlled, parallel intervention study. Group 1 will receive usual care for insulin degludec titration using the STEP WISE degludec titration algorithm Group 2 will receive Glooko mobile insulin dosing system, using the STEP WISE degludec titration algorithm.An estimated n= 240 subjects with type 2 diabetes will be enrolled in order to obtain approximately 200 evaluable subjects who will complete the 16 week study.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Insulin Degludec Titration Using Mobile Insulin Dosing System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective randomized controlled two-group parallel design intervention trial. The primary endpoint, change from baseline to week 16 in HbA1c is planned to be tested for superiority of the Glooko Mobile Insulin Dosing System versus standard of care for insulin degludec titration - both with treatment of Tresiba® U-200 FlexTouch®. An estimated n= 240 subjects with type 2 diabetes will be enrolled in order to obtain approximately 200 evaluable subjects who will complete the 16 week study. The subjects, will be already on long-acting insulin or insulin naïve subjects and will be started on long-acting insulin degludec (Tresiba® U-200 FlexTouch®). The subjects will be randomized into one of the two groups: Group 1 will receive standard of care using the STEP WISE degludec titration algorithm for long acting insulin titration. Group 2 will receive standard of care along with treatment facilitated by Glooko mobile insulin dosing system, using the STEP WISE degludec titration algorithm. Major study assessment will be conducted at Baseline (Screening &amp; Visit 1), at a second Visit (Visit 2) after 12 weeks or 3 months and, after 16 weeks or 4 months, a final set of labs, meter download, and subject surveys will be administered (Exit Labs and Meter Download), in addition, any interactions and subsequent care plan changes completed by the HCP during Unscheduled HCP Interactions will be documented. Baseline, Visit 2 and the final screen/Exit Labs visit will include: blood draw, body weight, and questionnaires.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Subject has the ability to sign an informed consent form. Prior to randomization patients has signed the information consent, approved by an Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee, and provided Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act authorization (HIPAA) or other privacy authorization prior to any participation in study. 2. Subject 18 and older who has documented type 2 diabetes diagnosis at least 3 months before the screening 3. Subject has HbA1c 7.5% and 12% measured using a NGSP certified method 4. Subject has a BMI &lt; 40.0 5. Subject is initiating basal insulin therapy with insulin degludec or switching to insulin degludec from another basal insulin which they were on for at least 3 months and/or subject is on antihyperglycemic agents, including oral hypoglycemic (OAs), noninsulin injectables (e.g. GLP1) which they were on for at least 3 months. 6. Subject is a male or nonpregnant, nonlactating female, at least 6 weeks postpartum prior to screening visit. A urine pregnancy test is required for all female subjects unless she is not of childbearing potential, defined as postmenopausal for at least one year prior to screening visit or surgically sterile (bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, or hysterectomy) 7. If female is of childbearing potential, is practicing one of the following methods of birth control (and will continue through the duration of the study): 1. Condoms, sponge, diaphragm, or intrauterine device; 2. Oral or parenteral contraceptives for 3 months prior to screening visit; 3. Vasectomized partner; 4. Total abstinence from sexual intercourse 8. Subject has a Glooko compatible smartphone with an active data plan or access to WiFi and downloaded at least one mobile application on their phone, on their own 9. Subject is currently performing self monitoring of blood glucose(SMBG) 1. Subject has had a severe hypoglycemia episode in the last 90 days 2. Subject has type 1 diabetes 3. Subject does not have access to a Glooko compatible smartphone or tablet 4. Subject must not be using Glooko or any other electronic application for insulin titration 5. Subject is unable to read and understand English 6. Subject is using short acting or premixed insulin for more than 10 days in the last 3 months 7. Subject is going to initiate short acting insulin prior to the study start 8. Pregnant or breastfeeding women, or the intention of becoming pregnant or not using adequate contraceptive measures 9. Visual impairment resulting in inability to see application. 10. Use of systemic steroids for one week or more in the last 90 days from screening 11. Unable to meet protocol requirements (performing SMBG, administering insulin) 12. Known hypersensitivity / intolerance to insulin degludec or any of its excipients 13. Is a participant in another clinical study 14. In the opinion of the PI, if the subject is already on insulin and cannot be properly managed with only long acting insulin (e.g., the introduction of meal time insulin is necessary) 15. Subject has any other condition or event considered exclusionary by the PI</criteria>
