	<brief_summary>High-humidity nasal cannula (HFNC) has been shown to be effective in improving oxygenation and avoiding intubation in multiple randomized control trials, it is also suitable and feasible for long term use. Aerosol delivery via HFNC will minimize interruptions and improve patient compliance, bench study and radionuclide imaging study done in healthy volunteers demonstrated that aerosol can be effectively delivered using HFNC. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of bronchodilator delivered via HFNC in chronic pulmonary obstructive disease or asthma patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation on the Efficacy of Bronchodilator Nebulization Via High Flow Nasal Cannula</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma patients who have positive response in bronchodilator test will be consented and enrolled, patients come back for the second bronchodilator assessment within one to three days after the initial bronchodilator test. Albuterol with different concentration will be provided to the patients via HFNC, patients will be assessed by spirometry after each concentration until bronchodilator response is positive and does not improve after the next dose.</detailed_description>
