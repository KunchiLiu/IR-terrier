	<detailed_description>CASE AF aims to describe the reality of medical care of patients in whom atrial fibrillation is treated by cardiac surgical ablation. In particular, the following questions should be answered: - Indication: Which are the different indications for cardiac surgical ablation in patients with atrial fibrillation? - How often and in which patients the different concepts of surgery and ablation procedures are used? At the same time, how often an intervention at the left atrial appendage is carried out? - Safety: How secure is the cardiac surgical ablation of atrial fibrillation (periprocedural, during hospital stay and during the long-term follow up)? - Effectiveness: How effectively is the cardiac surgical ablation of atrial fibrillation (procedural success)? How often are AF recurrences in the long-term follow up? - What is the concommitant medical treatment after surgical ablation?</detailed_description>
