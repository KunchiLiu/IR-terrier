	<brief_summary>It's hypothesized that a mean and range distance from the cavo-atrial junction to the area where there is complete loss of conductive tissue can be measured to better inform surgeons performing the Cox-Maze procedure. A patient scheduled for any cardiac surgery where visualization and mapping of cavo-atrial junction is possible could be entered into the study if they meet the inclusion/exclusion requirements.</brief_summary>
