	<brief_summary>The goal of this non-randomized, multi-center study in subjects with severe hereditary haemophilia B was to determine and compare the pharmacokinetic and safety profiles of BeneFIX in subjects having had 2 prior pharmacokinetic assessments with AlphaNine.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of AlphaNine Versus BeneFIX in Patients With Severe Hereditary Haemophilia B</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Two pharmacokinetic assessments (studies) were carried out in the same subjects during a previous clinical trial. The first pharmacokinetic study (PK1) was performed after a single dose of AlphaNine. The second pharmacokinetic study (PK2) was performed following 26 Weeks of AlphaNine treatment after PK1. To compare AlphaNine with BeneFIX, a third pharmacokinetic study (PK3) (current study) was performed after a single dose of BeneFIX administered following a 7- to 15-day wash-out period.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Key Participated in the previous study "Efficacy and safety of factor IX (FIX) contained in Alphananine in patients with severe hereditary haemophilia B": Congenital deficiency in Factor IX (FIX) FIX residual activity of ≤2% of normal Had required FIXcontaining products in the past and in clinical records that were collected data to assess a reliable estimation of at least 150 treatment exposure days to previous products Was able to receive treatment for more than 10 days for a 6month period Key Received a dose of FIX in the 7 days prior to the infusion FIX inhibitor level of &gt;0.5 Bethesda units (BU) or clinically relevant presence in the past (≥5 BU) Active bleeding at the moment of infusion Had a known allergic reaction to any BeneFIX component Exhibited symptoms of any intercurrent infection (ie, fever, chills, nausea) at the time of the first infusion Had any disease that might affect the distribution or metabolism of FIX and which could affect interpretation of the study (such as noncontrolled diabetes mellitus) Had noncontrolled arterial hypertension Had abnormal renal function (creatinine &gt;1.5 mg/dL) Had documented liver cirrhosis or any hepatic disorder with alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels 2.5x upper limit of normal (ULN ) Prevision to be concomitantly treated with other FIXcontaining products Had conditions that might affect subject compliance (survivallimiting [in 2 year time] diseases, alcohol or other drug abuse, etc.) Unable to provide a storage plasma sample before the first dose of BeneFIX</criteria>
