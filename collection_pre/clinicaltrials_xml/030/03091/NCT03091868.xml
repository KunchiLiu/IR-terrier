	<brief_summary>To investigate the effect of rising oral single-doses of BIA 6-512 (25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg and 200 mg) on levodopa pharmacokinetics when administered in combination with a single-dose of immediate release levodopa/carbidopa 100/25 mg (Sinemet® 100/25) or with a single-dose of Sinemet® 100/25 plus a single-dose of entacapone (Comtan®) 200 mg and to assess the tolerability and safety of rising single oral doses of BIA 6-512 when administered in combination with a single-dose of Sinemet® 100/25 or with a single-dose of Sinemet® 100/25 plus a single-dose of Comtan® 200 mg.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Single centre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled study in four sequential groups of healthy subjects. Eligible subjects were admitted to the UFH on the day prior to receiving the first study medication. On the morning of the first dosing day (Day 1), subjects received BIA 6-512/Placebo concomitantly with Sinemet® 100/25; on the morning of the second dosing day (Day 2), subjects received BIA 6-512/Placebo concomitantly with Sinemet® 100/25 and Comtan® 200 mg. Products were administered in fasting conditions (at least 8 hours). Subjects remained confined in the UFH from admission (Day 0) until at least 24 h post last dose (Day 3); then, they were discharged and will return for the follow-up visit.</detailed_description>
