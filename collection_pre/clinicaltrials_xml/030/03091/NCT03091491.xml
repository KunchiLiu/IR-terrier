	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether Nivolumab in combination with Ipilimumab is associated with superior response rate compared to Nivolumab alone in patients with advanced Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) mutation positive Non-small Cell Lung Cancer who have failed one line of standard EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor and not more than one line of chemotherapy regimen. This study also aims to determine predictive biomarkers of response/benefit in patients with EGFR mutation positive NSCLC.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Nivolumab Verses Nivolumab and Ipilimumab Combination in EGFR Mutant Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study examines the outcome of nivolumab single agent versus nivolumab-ipilimumab combination in patients with advanced EGFR+ NSCLC who have failed one line of standard EGFR Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (TKI) and not more than one line of chemotherapy regimen. The use of 3rd generation EGFR TKI for patients with acquired mutation that substitute a threonine (T) with a methionine (M) at position 790 of exon 20 (T790M) is allowed. Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to treatment with either nivolumab monotherapy (Arm A) or nivolumab/ipilimumab combination therapy (Arm B) and will be stratified according to the following factors: - Programmed Death-Ligand 1 (PDL1) status: &lt;1% vs ≥1% - Presence of brain metastasis - Institution: National Cancer Centre Singapore, National University Cancer Institute, and Johns Hopkins Singapore-Tan Tock Seng Hospital Both arms will continue with treatment regimen till disease progression or discontinuation of treatment due to adverse events. Arm A patients are allowed to cross over to Arm B in the event of clear-cut disease progression. On-study tumor assessments will be conducted every 6 weeks for 24 weeks and then every 12 weeks till clear-cut disease progression. The radiologist will be blinded to the treatment arm that the patient is randomised to ensure an objective response evaluation.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>i. Signed informed consent ii. Male or female, 21 years or older Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must use appropriate method(s) of contraception. WOCBP should use an adequate method to avoid pregnancy for 5 months (30 days plus the time required for nivolumab to undergo five halflives) after the last dose of investigational drug Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of HCG) within 24 hours prior to the start of nivolumab Women must not be breastfeeding Men who are sexually active with WOCBP must use any contraceptive method with a failure rate of less than 1% per year Men receiving nivolumab and who are sexually active with WOCBP will be instructed to adhere to contraception for a period of 7 months after the last dose of investigational product Women who are not of childbearing potential (ie, who are postmenopausal or surgically sterile as well as azoospermic men do not require contraception WOCBP is defined as any female who has experienced menarche and who has not undergone surgical sterilization (hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy) or who is not postmenopausal. Menopause is defined clinically as 12 months of amenorrhea in a woman over 45 in the absence of other biological or physiological causes. In addition, women under the age of 55 must have a documented serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level less than 40 milliinternational units per millilitre (mIU/mL). Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) receiving nivolumab will be instructed to adhere to contraception for a period of 5 months after the last dose of investigational product. Men receiving nivolumab and who are sexually active with WOCBP will be instructed to adhere to contraception for a period of 7 months after the last dose of investigational product. These durations have been calculated using the upper limit of the halflife for nivolumab (25 days) and are based on the protocol requirement that WOCBP use contraception for 5 halflives plus 30 days and men who are sexually active with WOCBP use contraception for 5 halflives plus 90 days. iii. Advanced EGFR+ NSCLC iv. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) 02 performance status v. Progressed on one line of standard EGFR TKI and not more than one line of chemotherapy; 3rd generation EGFR TKI for patients with T790M mutation is allowed A 14day washout period is required for EGFR TKI for patients who received this as the last therapy before recruitment A 28day washout period is required for chemotherapy for patients who received this as the last therapy before recruitment. All drugrelated toxicities should have returned to baseline with the exception of neuropathy, fatigue, and alopecia. vi. Screening laboratory values must meet the following criteria and should be obtained within 14 days prior to randomization/registration White Blood Cell (WBC) ≥ 2000/µL Neutrophils ≥ 1500/µL Platelets ≥ 100 x 10^3/µL Hemoglobin &gt; 9.0 g/dL Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x Upper Limit of Normal (ULN) or creatinine clearance (CrCl) ≥ 40 mL/min (if using the CockcroftGault formula below): Aspartate Aminotransferase/ Alanine Aminotransferase (AST/ALT) ≤ 3 x ULN Total Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN (except subjects with Gilbert Syndrome, who can have total bilirubin &lt; 3.0 mg/dL) vii. Measurable disease, as defined by RECIST v1.1; Previously irradiated lesions can only be considered as measurable disease if disease progression has been unequivocally documented at that site since radiation. viii. Patients with a history of treated asymptomatic central nervous system (CNS) metastases are eligible, provided they meet all of the following criteria: 1. Measurable disease outside CNS 2. No ongoing requirement for corticosteroids as therapy for CNS disease; anticonvulsants at a stable dose allowed 3. No stereotactic radiation within 7 days or wholebrain radiation within 14 days prior to randomization 4. No evidence of interim progression between the completion of CNSdirected therapy and the screening radiographic study ix. Tumor sites amenable for CTguided core biopsies or trucut biopsies x. Willing to undergo 2 biopsies and contribute research bloods for the study. Archived tissue that is less than 6 months old is acceptable as an alternative to biopsy at screening if a biopsy is not feasible; patients from arm A must be willing to undergo biopsy as baseline upon clearcut disease progression and ontreatment repeat biopsy before they are allowed to cross over to receive ipilimumab in addition to nivolumab. xi. For female patients of childbearing potential and male patients with partners of childbearing potential, agreement (by patient and/or partner) to use a highly effective form(s) of contraception and to continue its use for 90 days after the last dose of nivolumab xii. Women who are not postmenopausal (≥12 months of non−therapyinduced amenorrhea) or surgically sterile must have a negative serum pregnancy test result within 14 days prior to initiation of study drug xiii. Available for followup i. Symptomatic brain or leptomeningeal metastases (patients who have treated stable brain or Leptomeningeal disease are eligible; there is no magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evidence of progression for [lowest minimum is 4 weeks or more] after treatment is complete and within 28 days prior to the first dose of nivolumab administration. There must also be no requirement for immunosuppressive doses of systemic corticosteroids (&gt; 10 mg/day prednisone equivalents) for at least 2 weeks prior to study drug administration). ii. Poor performance status of ECOG &gt;2 iii. Tumour sites not amenable to CTguided core biopsies or trucut biopsies; However waiver for this criterion can be given for selected patients on a casebycase basis for patients with sites of disease that are technically difficult to access after discussion with interventional radiologist. Waivers are allowed for not more than 70 patients for this study in order to allow sufficient number of quality tumour biopsies for biomarker analysis in this study. Waivers would have to be approved by the Principal Investigator. iv. Unwilling to undergo 2 biopsies and contribute research bloods for the study v.
