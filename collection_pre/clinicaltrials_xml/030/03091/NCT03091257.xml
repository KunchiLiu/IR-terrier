	<brief_title>A Study of Dabrafenib and/or Trametinib in Patients With Relapsed and/or Refractory Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study is a Pilot Study, which is the first time investigators are examining this study drug in this disease. "Investigational" means that the combination of drugs is being studied. It also means that the FDA (U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved the drugs for your type of cancer. The FDA has not approved Trametinib or Dabrafenib for your specific disease but they have been approved for other uses. Some cancers have changes (mutations) in a gene called BRAF or other genes, called KRAS or NRAS. These three genes tell the body to make a protein called BRAF, KRAS, or NRAS, respectively, which are all involved in sending signals in cells that can lead to cell growth. Certain mutations in these three genes cause a change in these proteins that can increase the growth and spread of cancer cells. Dabrafenib and trametinib work to prevent these altered proteins from working and sending signals in cancer cells, and thereby may block the growth and spread of cancer cells in people with cancers with BRAF, KRAS, or NRAS gene mutations. Dabrafenib and trametinib have been used in the treatment for other cancers in other research studies, and information from those research studies suggest that these agents may help to kill multiple myeloma cells. Dabrafenib and trametinib, which are investigated in this research study may or may not kill myeloma cells effectively. We would like to see if these drugs given alone or in combination safely and effectively kill these cancer cells.</detailed_description>

Female participants pregnant or breastfeeding. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because dabrafenib, and trametinib may have teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with the study drugs, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with the study drugs. Dabrafenib was teratogenic and embryotoxic in rats at doses three times greater than the human exposure at the recommended clinical dose. A history or current evidence of retinal vein occlusion (RVO) History of interstitial lung disease or pneumonitis Patients with known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with dabrafenib and trametinib.
