	<brief_title>ZOOMit-fMRI Identifies Motor Functional Cortex</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Gliomas will lead motor dysfunction when they are involved in motor cortex. However, tumor resection also have risk to lead postoperatively motor function deficits if destroy patients' motor cortex when tumor removed. Hence, it is important for neurosurgeon to realize the situation of patients' motor cortex locations in order to determine personal operative protocol. The blood oxygen level dependent fMRI (BOLD-fMRI) is a prevalent preoperative method to localization motor cortex. It shows motor relevant cortex by the change of blood oxygen level when patients cooperate to finish motor tasks. The advantage of BOLD-fMRI includes higher time and spatial resolution, higher sensitivity, non-invasive. However, its accuracy of localization has not been satisfactory because neurovascular uncoupling. The ZOOMit-fMRI is a novel technic which is evolved from conventional BOLD-fMRI to localize motor functional cortex.The advantage of ZOOMit-fMRI is smaller field of view (FOV) and higher spatial resolution comparing with BOLD-fMRI. That helps to reduce other region of brain interference and elevate accuracy of localizations. In this study, the investigators plan to enroll 60 patients, whose gliomas are involved in motor cortex, to acquire their BOLD-fMRI and ZOOMit-fMRI data in order to analyze their difference in the accuracy of motor cortex localization.</detailed_description>
