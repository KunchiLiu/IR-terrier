	<brief_title>Acupressure for Cancer-Related Fatigue</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Using Los Angeles Cancer Surveillance Program, we will enroll 124 foreign-born, Chinese-speaking women from the Los Angeles area with moderate to severe levels of fatigue, diagnosed with stage 0-III breast cancer, aged 21-69, and 1-5 years post-primary treatment. Using an adaptive treatment strategy design, participants will be randomized to either the acupressure intervention or control groups. The acupressure group will learn how to press three chief energy acupoints on each side of the body through de novo 11-minute Chinese-language video and practice acupressure every day (one minute per acupoint; a total of 6 minutes per day) for an 8-week intervention period. Participants will be telephone interviewed twice: at baseline and 8-weeks post-intervention follow-up.</detailed_description>
