	<brief_summary>In this randomized, cross‐over study 20 subjects who are undergoing testosterone (T) therapy for the treatment of T deficiency will receive both subcutaneous testosterone therapy and intramuscular testosterone therapy. One group will receive a SQ injection followed by an IM injection and one group will receive an IM injection followed by a SQ injection. The primary objective of this study is to measure testosterone concentration in men after these two treatment routes and determine if there are any significant differences due to modes of administration. Endpoints will include total serum testosterone and calculated free testosterone. A questionnaire will also be administered to assess overall patient experience with each route of administration.</brief_summary>
