	<brief_summary>With the recent addition of carfilzomib as a treatment option for multiple myeloma, no data is available yet on how the drug is being used outside of the clinical trial setting. This study will therefore provide essential data to demonstrate the real world utilization of carfilzomib in routine clinical practice, including dosage, administration schedule, regimen, duration of treatment and reason for discontinuation in Europe.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Real-world Use of Carfilzomib Among Patients With Relapsed MM in Europe</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>With the recent addition of carfilzomib as a treatment option for multiple myeloma, no data is available yet on how the drug is being used outside of the clinical trial setting. The Primary Objective is to describe carfilzomib utilisation in routine clinical practice, including dosage, administration schedule, regimen, duration of treatment and reason for discontinuation. âˆ’ Secondary Objectives: - Describe the population treated with carfilzomib in terms of demographics, multiple myeloma (MM) disease characteristics, treatment history, and comorbidities. - Describe the safety profile of carfilzomib in routine clinical practice. - Describe response to treatment as assessed by the physician and recorded in the medical file. - Describe healthcare resource utilisation of subjects treated with carfilzomib, in terms of unplanned hospitalisations. - Describe the reasons for choosing carfilzomib treatment, dose, and regimen as the MM treatment of choice. - Describe specific concomitant therapy (bisphosphonates, thromboprophylaxis, antihypertensive treatment, anti-infective treatment) and whether these therapies were used as prophylaxis or as treatment. - Describe performance of a cardiovascular assessment at carfilzomib initiation where available per routine care (electrocardiogram [ECG], echocardiography, left ventricular ejection fraction).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age 18 years or older at the time of carfilzomib initiation Experienced a relapse (regardless of the type of relapse; molecular, hematologic, and/or symptomatic) At least one prior line of MM treatment has been received Carfilzomib treatment has been initiated per routine practice and is currently ongoing At least one administration of carfilzomib in a combination regimen (ie, not monotherapy) has been received Provided written informed consent prior to abstraction of any data Subjects who previously received treatment with carfilzomib, either through participation in a clinical trial, or through routine practice, are eligible to take part in the study. Subjects who are enrolled in a carfilzomib clinical trial will not be eligible to additionally take part in this observational study. If a subject who has enrolled into this observational study, also enrolls in a clinical trial in which MM treatment and/or disease management is protocolspecified, the subject becomes ineligible and the subject's data will be censored from the time the subject enrolled the clinical trial.</criteria>
