	<brief_summary>Bariatric surgery markedly improves glycemic control in persons with T2D. Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) a procedure that bypasses the upper gastrointestinal (UGI) tract results in greater rates of diabetes resolution compared to methods that leave the UGI tract intact. Studies suggest that mechanisms beyond weight-loss account for the superiority of RYGB compared to other surgical methods. These weight-loss independent metabolic effects may involve increased postprandial production and release of nutrition- responsive hormones. Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is a nutrition-adaptive hormone with the potential to alleviate symptoms of diabetes and obesity. Preliminary data therefore suggests that RYGB surgery may alter postprandial FGF21 regulation which could be important for achieving post-meal nutrient homeostasis. Therefore, the goal of this study is to test how nutrient content of the meal affects FGF21 concentrations before and after weight loss induced by RYGB or very low calorie diet (VLCD) therapy. The importance of FGF21 for for glucose, insulin, triglyceride and adipose tissue and muscle metabolism in these two groups will also be tested.</brief_summary>
