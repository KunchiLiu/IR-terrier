	<brief_summary>120 Patients with visual acuity &lt;6/12 will be randomized to receive either usual care or participate in a 6-week, 2 hour 'Living with Vision Loss' program led by trained leaders. We hypothesize that a structured self-management low-vision rehabilitation program provides a greater improvement in participation in daily activities, and improves quality of life in vision-impaired people compared to the provision of the usual low vision rehabilitation services. We also plan to document barriers that prevent patients with low vision (visual acuity &lt;6/12) from participating in self-management course.</brief_summary>
