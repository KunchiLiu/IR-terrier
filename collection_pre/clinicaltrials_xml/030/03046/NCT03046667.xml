	<brief_summary>The project is a randomized, 2-way, blinded parallel trial in which 56 healthy adults of both genders with frequent occurrence of stomach trouble.This intervention trial with 6 weeks of daily intake β-glucans will be carried out with a beverage containing β-glucans and a control beverage without β-glucans. The primary aim is to investigate whether β-glucans from barley has an effect on stomach and intestinal health, including stool volume and frequency. Microbiota, concentrations of short chain fatty acids (butyrate, propionate, acetate), calprotectin, and energy and fat content in feces. Furthermore, blood pressure and exhaled hydrogen and methane, before and after the intervention, subjective perception of gastrointestinal problems and digestion as well as the participants' attitudes towards functional foods are measured using Visual Analog Scale (VAS). Further, specific metabolites of β-glucans in urine (exploratory endpoint) and certain toxic metabolites from the microbiota using metabolite profiling (metabolomics) are also analyzed</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>β-glucans from barley slows gastric emptying rate and prolongs the transit time of food in the small intestine." The relatively undigested β-glucans have the ability to increase satiety and stimulate digestion, ensuring regular bowel movements and relieve sluggish bowel movements, including constipation and constipation. β-glucans are fermented down in the large intestine, resulting in production of short-chain fatty acids which inhibit the biosynthesis of cholesterol, hence blood cholesterol levels are lowered (not the goal here). Subsequently, β-glucans may also affect blood pressure. As a direct result of the effects in the intestine, there will be an improvement in the quality of life for people with stomach upsets and maybe a reduction in the risk of cardiovascular disease.</detailed_description>
