	<brief_summary>This study evaluates a new approach to the instruction of pediatric residents in the skill of neonatal intubation. Half of the participants will receive focused simulation training and cognitive instruction while the other half will not. The collected data from both groups will be compared.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Manikin To Patient Intubation: Does It Translate?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Current findings suggest that the training of pediatric residents is not sufficient prior to "live" tracheal intubations in the critical care setting. The current one to two days of airway management training as a part of resuscitation training (such as Pediatric Advanced Life Support (PALS) or Neonatal Resuscitation Program (NRP) is not sufficient to provide safe intubation skills. This study will develop and implement tracheal intubation training using concepts of deliberate practice modeled after Ericsson. The concepts include focused training on a specific task, immediate feedback, time for problem solving and evaluation, and opportunities for repeated performance using a manikin. This proposal is an attempt to develop such a training model. Video recordings of live intubations will be reviewed and evaluated. The data between the two groups will be compared to see if there is improved intubation skills of live patients.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Male and female residents from 1889 years of age who have been assigned to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) for a monthly rotation are eligible to participate. At the beginning of all NICU rotations, all pediatric residents will be invited to participate in this research. Any pediatric resident who does not wish to participate</criteria>
