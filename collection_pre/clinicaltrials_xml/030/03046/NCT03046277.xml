	<brief_title>Short- and Long-Term Renal Outcomes Following Lung Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It is well described that acute kidney injury and development of chronic kidney disease significantly impact short- and long-term survival after lung transplantation. However, there is limited data about prevalence of kidney disease according to current KDIGO consensus guidelines. It is the aim of this study to describe short- and long-Term Renal Outcomes following Lung Transplantation.</detailed_description>
