	<brief_title>Blind and Ultrasound Guided Injection in Morton Neuroma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a evaluator-blinded randomized trial. The final sample size has been calculated to be 100 patients. 50 of group 1 are going to be injected by an experimented orthopaedic surgeon based on anatomic landmark. 50 of group 2 are going to be injected by an experimented musculoskeletal radiologist under ultrasound guidance. The inclusion criteria are clinical suspicion of Morton neuroma confirmed in ultrasound scan. Included patients are assessed clinically by VAS score, the Manchester Foot Pain and Disability Schedule (MFPDS), and a generic quality-of-life instrument, the EQ-5D. Injection includes 1 cc of 2% mepivacaine and 40 mg of triamcinolone in each web space with Morton Neuroma. According evolution until 4 injections were allowed the first 2 months of follow-up, Follow up was performed by phone calls and/or scheduled consultations at 15 days, 1 month, 45 days, 2 months, 3 months, 6 months and 1 year. Statistical analysis was performed by unpaired Student's t test</detailed_description>
