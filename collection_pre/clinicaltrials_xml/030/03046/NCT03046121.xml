	<brief_summary>This study will address the effectiveness of Family-centered Function Focused Care (Fam-FFC). Fam-FFC is a theoretically-based approach to care in which family caregivers partner with nurses to prevent functional decline and other complications related to hospitalization in older adults with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. A systematic care pathway promotes information-sharing and decision-making that promotes physical activity, function, and cognitive stimulation during the hospitalization and immediate post-acute period. Our goal in this work is to establish a practical and effective way to optimize function and physical activity; decrease neuropsychiatric symptoms, delirium, and depression; prevent avoidable post-acute care dependency; and prevent unnecessary rehospitalizations and long-stay nursing home admissions, while mitigating family caregiver strain and burden.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Family-centered Intervention for Acutely-ill Persons With Dementia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Older persons with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) are about two times as likely to be hospitalized as their peers who are cognitively healthy. The care of hospitalized persons with ADRD has traditionally focused on the acute medical problem that led to admission with little attention paid to functional recovery. Older persons with ADRD are at greater risk for functional decline and increased care dependency after discharge due to a combination of intrinsic factors, environmental, policy, and care practices that restrict physical and cognitive activity, and limited staff knowledge of dementia care. Family caregivers (CGs) can play an important role in promoting the functional recovery of hospitalized older adults. They can provide vital information, offer motivation and support of function-focused care, and assume responsibility in varying degrees for post-acute care delivery and coordination. Family-centered FFC (Fam-FFC) incorporates an educational empowerment model for family CGs provided within a social-ecological in-patient framework promoting specialized care to patients with ADRD. The intervention creates an "enabling" milieu for the person with ADRD through environmental and policy assessment/modification, staff education, unit-based champions, and individualized goal setting that focuses on functional recovery. In this patient/family-centered care approach, nurses purposefully engage family CGs in the assessment, decision-making, care delivery and evaluation of function-focused care during hospitalization and the 60-day post-acute period. In the proposed project, we will implement Fam-FFC in a cluster randomized trial of 438 patient/CG dyads in six hospital units randomized within three hospitals (73 dyads per unit) to accomplish the following aims: Aim 1: Validate the efficacy of Fam-FFC on physical function (ADLs/ performance and physical activity), delirium occurrence and severity, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and mood; Aim 2: Evaluate the impact of Fam-FFC on family CG-centered outcomes (preparedness for caregiving, strain, burden, and desire to institutionalize); and Aim 3: Evaluate the relative costs for Fam-FFC v. control condition, and calculate health care cost (post-acute health care utilization) and total cost savings for Fam-FFC. We will also evaluate the cultural appropriateness of Fam-FCC for diverse families in our sample. Dyads will be composed of community-residing, hospitalized medical patients with very mild to moderate dementia (0.5 to 2.0 on the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale) and their CG (defined as the primary person providing oversight and support on an ongoing basis). Outcomes will be evaluated at hospital admission, discharge, two and six months post-discharge. This study will be a critical next step in delineating how to partner with family CGs to change acute care approaches provided to patients with ADRD so as to optimize function after discharge, and promote delirium abatement and well-being in these individuals. The societal implications of helping older individuals with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias avoid functional decline are enormous in terms of aging in place, quality of life, cost, and caregiver burden. The study findings will be relevant for other areas of behavior change research in acute care, specifically those related to engaging patients and families in health care planning, delivery, and evaluation.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patient medical patients who: are age ≥65, speak English or Spanish, live in the community prior to admission to the hospital, screen positive for dementia on wellvalidated scales (Montreal Cognitive Assessment {MoCA} ≤ 25 123127 and AD8 &gt;2 128,129), and score 0.5 to 2.0 on the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale; and have a family CG as the designated study partner for the duration of the study. Patient mild cognitive impairment (CDR 0.5 without functional or ADL impairments), severe dementia (CDR 3), any significant neurological condition associated with cognitive impairment other than dementia (e.g. brain tumor), a major acute psychiatric disorder, have no family caregiver to participate, are enrolled in hospice and/or have a life expectancy of six months or less, are admitted from a nursing home, or experience transfers to another unit for stays longer than 48 hours. Family age 18 and above whose relatives meet inclusion criteria will be eligible if they can speak and read English or Spanish; and are related to the patient by blood, marriage, adoption, or affinity as a significant other (defined as or by the patient/legally authorized person as the primary person providing oversight and support on an ongoing basis); participate, at a minimum, in the initial assessment and development of FamPath; and able to recall at least two words on the MiniCog Staff nurses (at the conclusion of the intervention at each site) who identify the intervention unit as the primary unit worked, and speak English or Spanish, will be included in focus groups For the exploratory aim of assessing the cultural appropriateness of the intervention, we will recruit family caregivers who selfidentify as black, Latino, Asian and white, randomly selected from the FamFFC sample. Approximately 10 percent of families from each ethnic group represented in the study will be approached for consent for participation in interviews. (If theoretical saturation is not reached, interviews will continue until saturation is reached). Additionally, the six nurse champions will be consented and interviewed after the study ends in his/her particular unit/setting to provide their perspective on the cultural appropriateness of FamFFC.</criteria>
