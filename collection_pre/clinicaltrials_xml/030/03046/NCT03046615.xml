	<brief_summary>For procedures involving proximity to the nerves responsible for eye movement, the need to monitor eye movement exists. The current solution is to place needles in the muscles surrounding the eye. The Investigators have invented a non-invasive electrode and software designed to monitor eye movements non-invasively. The electrode is placed on the skin on the corner of the eye and using the natural dipole of the eye, detects the horizontal and vertical movements of the eye. The Investigators would like to prove efficacy compared to the standard monitoring.</brief_summary>
