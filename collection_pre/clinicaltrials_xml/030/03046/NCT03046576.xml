	<brief_summary>Increased plasma DPP4 activity (DPP4a) could predict both subclinical and new-onset atherosclerosis, and our previous study has found that the DPP4a was significantly lower in MI patients compared with patients having chest pain or unstable angina alone, and DPP4a is associated with no-reflow and major bleeding events in STEMI patients during hospital stay. As no-reflow phenomenon and major bleeding events independently associates with a worse in-hospital and long-term prognosis. One may speculate that the DPP4a is associated with long-term follow-up adverse cardiovascular events in these patients.The hypothesis was tested in this study.</brief_summary>
