	<brief_summary>Bone mineral density (BMD) is decreased after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) but whether RYGB induces changes in BMD beyond adaptation to major weight loss is not known. We aim to investigate BMD changes in weight bearing (hip, lumbal columna) and in non-weight bearing (forearm) regions before and after maximal weight loss at 1 year and after weight stabilisation at 4 years after RYGB. Moreover, plasma markers of bone turnover will be studied at fasting and during oral glucose tolerance test.</brief_summary>
