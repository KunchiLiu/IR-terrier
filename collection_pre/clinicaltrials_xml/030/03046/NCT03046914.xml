	<brief_summary>Allopurinol-induced severe cutaneous adverse reaction (SCAR) is a rare but fatal condition. Previous reports have reported that HLA-B*5801 is an important genetic risk factor significantly associated with the development of allopurinol-induced SCAR. However, there has been no prospective study to prove the clinical efficacy of a HLA-B*5801 screening before administration of allopurinol in predicting allopurinol-induced SCAR. The purpose of this prospective study is to test our hypothesis that a pre-screening of HLA-B*5801 will significantly reduce the risk of allopurinol-induced SCAR development compared to the historical control.</brief_summary>
