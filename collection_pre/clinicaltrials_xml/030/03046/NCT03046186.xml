	<brief_summary>After gastric sleeve patients undergo a substantial weight loss, but the physiological mechanisms behind the weight loss is not fully elucidated. Studies suggest that gut-hormone secretion is altered comparable to what is also seen after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, however to which extent is not fully established and furthermore, the mechanisms behind an altered secretion are unclear. The purpose of this study is to investigate absorption and postprandial metabolism of glucose and protein in addition to gut hormonal responses after gastric sleeve compared with a group of un-operated subjects machted on sex, age and BMI. Furter, a group of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass operated patients matched on pre-operative BMI, current BMI, sex and age will be included for comparison.</brief_summary>
