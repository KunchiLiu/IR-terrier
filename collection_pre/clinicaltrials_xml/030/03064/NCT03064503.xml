	<brief_summary>In normal ageing, the impact of myocardial fibrosis on myocardial function is unclear as diastolic function is reported to change according to age. The objective is to explore the relationship between myocardial function changes, with local (T1 and diffusion) fibrosis measures with Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) as well as global measures of fibrosis (skin auto-fluorescence and collagen blood-biomarkers).</brief_summary>
