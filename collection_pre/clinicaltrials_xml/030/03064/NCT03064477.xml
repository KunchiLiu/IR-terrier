	<brief_summary>The present randomized, controlled trial will compare the cost-efficacy and acceptability of the Unified Protocol in group format against traditional individual Cognitive Behavioral Treatment in a sample of patients with emotional disorders. Ultimately, the goal of the current study is to explore whether the Unified Protocol in group format can be a cost-effective psychological intervention for emotional disorders in the Spanish National Health System, that is, one that generates long-lasting changes in symptoms, while reducing both direct and indirect economic costs associated with the treatment of emotional disorders.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Unified Protocol for the Treatment of Emotional Disorders in Spanish Public Mental Health System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Emotional disorders (i.e., unipolar mood disorders and anxiety disorders) have become the most prevalent psychiatric disorders globally. It is estimated that anxiety problems and unipolar mood disorders affect 14% and 6.9% of the population, respectively, and comordibity may be as high as 50%. Comparable results have been obtained in Spain, where mood and anxiety disorders are the most prevalent psychiatric problems, with an estimated life-prevalence of 35.8% and 25.6%, respectively. As a result of their high prevalence in the population, emotional disorders have become a global health problem due to their associated costs.For instance, a study conducted in 36 countries estimated that the annual cost of treatment for depressive disorders and anxiety problems amounted to $91 billion and $56 billion, respectively. If both direct and indirect costs of these emotional disorders were accounted for, expenses increased to $925,000 million. In Spain, when both direct and indirect costs are included, mood and anxiety disorders are estimated to cost €10,763 million and €10,365 million, respectively. Pharmacological treatment and individual cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) are the most frequent interventions for emotional disorders in the Spanish National Health System. Therefore, increasing the efficiency of these treatments may be a way of reducing the current public health costs of emotional disorders. A recently developed form of CBT, the Unified Protocol for the Treatment of Emotional Disorders (UP), might serve the aforementioned purpose, as it can be applied to a variety of disorders simultaneously and it can be easily performed in a group format. The UP was created on the basis of the identification of common psychopathological vulnerability factors in emotional disorders, together with elements and techniques shared by disorder-specific cognitive-behavioral treatments. In the UP, traditional CBT techniques (i.e., cognitive restructuring) and contemporary practices (i.e., mindfulness) are combined to treat emotion regulation deficits, which are argued to be the underlying common factor in all emotional disorders. The UP is a structured, manual-based treatment, so it can be easily applied in a group format. This, together with the fact that the UP can be applied simultaneously to individuals with different emotional disorders, might help reduce existent waiting lists and current costs of individual treatment. So far, studies exploring the effectiveness of the UP in a group format have led to promising findings. Overall, results suggest that the UP has between moderate and strong effect sizes on numerous outcomes, including depression, anxiety, positive and negative affect, quality of life, overall adjustment, and avoidance of negative sensations, for both anxiety and mood disorders. These studies have also revealed that between half and two thirds of patients ceased to meet diagnostic criteria after the treatment and one investigation, conducted by the investigators participating in the present study, revealed that changes remained stable 12 months after treatment completion. Despite the previous results are encouraging, conclusions should be interpreted with caution as sample sizes have been small (11 participants in two studies and 47 patients in one investigation) and cost-effectiveness of the UP in group format compared with traditional individual CBT remains unclear. Methodologically-sound, randomized, controlled trials are needed in order to replicate the aforementioned findings and to elucidate whether the UP in group format is an effective and efficient treatment option for emotional disorders in public settings. It is expected that both interventions (CBT and UP) will be comparable in terms of effectiveness and acceptability, but treatment costs will be lower in the UP condition. To ensure the generalizability of results, the hypotheses will be tested in various public mental health centers in Spain.</detailed_description>
