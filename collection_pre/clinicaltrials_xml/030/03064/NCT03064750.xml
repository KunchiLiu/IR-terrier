	<brief_summary>The lifetime risk for a woman to undergo surgery for either vaginal prolapse or urinary incontinence is high. There are many different surgical techniques for treatment of prolapse, but there is a lack of knowledge about factors that contribute to objective result and patient satisfaction after surgery. The aim of the study is to investigate factors that could be related related to patient satisfaction and objective result such as pelvic floor muscle contractility/strength and muscle injury, objective measures of prolapse and women's symptoms. This study will investigate whether systematic pelvic floor exercise and life style advise before surgery can improve outcomes after surgery for either vaginal prolapse. Another aim is to determine an ultrasound scale for measure of pelvic floor muscle contraction.</brief_summary>
