	<brief_summary>Purpose is to identify if misoprostol in addition to local vasopressin decreases blood loss when compared to vasopressin alone, which is our current practice at this time. The study will be double-blinded with neither the patient nor the researcher knowing whether the placebo or the misoprostol was given. We will monitor patients for decrease in hemoglobin and hematocrit, need for transfusion, and operative time among other measures of perioperative morbidity to see if the addition of misoprostol makes a significant difference. We will also observe patients to see if there are any side effects of misoprostol that make its use undesirable.</brief_summary>
