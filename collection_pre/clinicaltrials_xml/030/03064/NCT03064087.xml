	<brief_summary>The VALHUDES study is a Diagnostic Test Accuracy study that aims to document the clinical accuracy of hrHPV testing with a validated PCR-based hrHPV assay on urine samples, collected under standardised and optimised conditions, and on two types of vaginal self-samples and compare results with those from matching samples taken by a clinician.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The samples are collected from patients referred to colposcopy because of prior cervical abnormalities. The patient takes at home two urine samples with the Colli-Pee device (a device that allows to collect first-void urine), the day before the visit to the colposcopy centre. At the colposcopy centre, two vaginal self-samples are taken by the patient herself: one with a cotton swab and a second with a plastic brush. Finally, the gynecologist takes a cervical Pap smear with a Cervex-Brush Combi. A real-time PCR test will be used to detect DNA of high-risk HPV types. The colposcopy and histological findings will be used as the gold standard. The main purpose of the study is to assess the relative diagnostic tests accuracy of hrHPV testing on self- and urine samples compared to hrHPV testing on cervical samples taken by a clinician. Furthermore, the participating women will receive also a questionnaire which can give insights into the attitudes and preferences of the women with regard to the self-sampling devices.</detailed_description>
