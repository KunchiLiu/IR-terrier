	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate whether enteric-coated nutrients increase some glucose and regulating hormone levels, glucose tolerance and satiety in overweight and obese individuals with type 2 diabetes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Targeted Enteral Nutrient Delivery: A Prospective Randomized Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Direct delivery of nutrient to the upper intestine by enteral feeding tube can increase circulating levels of some glucose and appetite regulating hormones when compared to usual oral ingestion. Such an enhancement could be of value in the management of type 2 diabetes and obesity. In this study enteric-coated nutrients will be ingested to allow for direct delivery of nutrient to the upper intestine. Levels of select hormones and glucose, and measures of satiety and adverse effects will be compared following the ingestion of uncoated and enteric coated nutrient.</detailed_description>
