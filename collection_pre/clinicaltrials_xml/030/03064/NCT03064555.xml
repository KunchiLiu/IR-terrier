	<brief_summary>Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects between 5-10% of the world's population, equating to ~740 million people worldwide. End stage renal disease (ESRD) is the result of a progressive loss of kidney function where the patient requires dialysis to replace the typical functions of the kidney. The quality of life of these individuals can be poor as a result of various complications associated with CKD (e.g. heart disease, diabetes, muscle wastage, decreased fitness). In an attempt to combat reduced physical fitness, many studies have applied long term exercise programmes. However, the body's response to exercise in people with CKD is not well understood and a set of guidelines that informs safe and effective exercise prescription is lacking.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Acute Physiological Response to Exercise in End Stage Renal Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects between 5-10% of the world's population, equating to ~740 million people worldwide. End stage renal disease (ESRD) is the result of a progressive loss of kidney function where the patient requires dialysis to replace the typical functions of the kidney. The quality of life (QOL) of these individuals is severely impaired as a result of various complications associated with CKD (e.g. heart disease, diabetes, muscle wastage, decreased fitness). In an attempt to combat this decrease in physical fitness, many studies have applied long term exercise interventions. However, the acute response to exercise in this population is not entirely understood and a comprehensive set of guidelines that informs safe and effective exercise prescription is lacking. The use of exercise as a therapeutic intervention in ESRD has grown in popularity, and evidence provided by numerous long term studies indicates cardiopulmonary, metabolic and inflammatory system adaptations. Despite these positive findings, the specific mechanisms through which exercise benefits these patients have not yet been fully established. In addition, the extent to which 'normal' physiology is acutely altered by dialysis treatment, and the effect that aerobic exercise may have on this, is unknown. In patients with ESRD, this study aims to characterise the acute physiological response to exercise under different conditions. In doing so, the study aims to inform the development of guidelines for safe and effective intra-dialytic exercise training.</detailed_description>
