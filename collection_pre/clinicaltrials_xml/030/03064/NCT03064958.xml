	<brief_summary>The investigators aim to conduct a 3-period randomized controlled crossover study to investigate the postprandial effects of a high fat meal with spice on endothelial function, lipids/lipoproteins, immune function and plasma markers of antioxidants and oxidative stress. Metabolomic profiling will also be conducted. In random order, participants will consume either a high fat meal (1000kcal, 45g fat) or a high fat meal containing 2g of spice or a high fat meal containing 6g of spice. Between each treatment there will be a washout period of at least 3 days. It is hypothesized that consumption of a high fat meal with spice will attenuate postprandial endothelial impairment and triglyceride levels in a dose response manner compared with a high fat meal.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A 3-period randomized controlled crossover study will be conducted to investigate the postprandial effects of a high fat meal with spices on endothelial function, lipids/lipoproteins, immune function, plasma antioxidants and markers of oxidative stress. Metabolomic profiling will also be conducted. In random order participants will consume either a high fat meal (1000kcal, 45g fat) or a high fat meal containing 2g of spices or a high fat meal containing 6g of spices with a 3 day washout period between each treatment. The following spices will be incorporated into the meal black pepper, basil, bay leaf, cinnamon, coriander, cumin, ginger, oregano, parsley, rosemary, red pepper, turmeric and thyme. Endothelial function will be measured by flow mediated dilation of the brachial artery in the fasting state and 2 and 4 hours after the meal. Participants will also provide a fasting blood sample and samples will also be taken at 1, 2, 3 and 4 hours after the meal.</detailed_description>
