	<brief_summary>Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI) is a rare disorder that causes bones to break easily. People with OI may have broken bones with little or no trauma, dentinogenesis imperfecta (DI), and, in adult years, hearing loss. OI can range from very severe to very mild. The current standard-of-care for severe types of OI involves the use of IV medications (bisphosphonates) and surgery to put rods in bones to strengthen them. These therapies, although often life-saving, are new and very little is known about their long-term effects on bone and other body systems. Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) is a protein important in bone formation. Fresolimumab is an antibody that can silence TGF-β . In studies with mice with OI, it has been shown that silencing TGF-β can lead to higher bone mass, quality and strength. The purpose of this study is to determine if fresolimumab is safe in the treatment of OI.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI) is a rare disorder that causes bones to break easily. People with OI may have broken bones with little or no trauma, dentinogenesis imperfecta (DI), and, in adult years, hearing loss. It is seen in both genders and all races. OI can range from very severe to very mild. Individuals with the most severe type of OI may die at birth. People with severe OI who survive may have bowed arms and legs, very short stature and be unable to walk. People with the mildest form of OI may only break bones occasionally and have normal height and lifespan. Breaks can occur in any bone, but are most common in the arms and legs. The current standard-of-care for severe types of OI involves the use of IV medications (bisphosphonates) and surgery to put rods in bones to strengthen them. These therapies, although often life-saving, are new and very little is known about their long-term effects on bone and other body systems. TGF-β is a protein important in bone formation. Studies have shown that increased TGF-β activity leads to lower bone mass and strength and increased fractures. Fresolimumab is an antibody that can silence TGF-β . In studies with mice with OI, it has been shown that silencing TGF-β can lead to higher bone mass, quality and strength.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Willing and able to provide signed informed consent. 2. Are 18 years or older 3. Have a diagnosis of moderatetosevere OI based on various clinical features 4. Have genetic mutations that include glycine substitution in COL1A1 or COL1A2, or pathogenic variants in CRTAP, PPIB, or LEPRE1 (if genetic information is unavailable at screening, this may be assessed at screening visit on a clinical or research basis). 5. Females of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test, agree to and have the ability to use acceptable birth control method for entire duration of the study. 6. For Males enrolled in the study, partners must agree to use an acceptable form of birth control for the entire duration of the study. 1. Fracture less than 3 months prior to the screening visit. 2. Rodding or instruments that prevents reliable bone mineral density (BMD) assessment. 3. Have a known unhealed fracture involving a long bone. 4. Do not meet laboratory safety requirements such as: Vitamin D &lt; 15 ng/dL Serum albumincorrected calcium levels below 8 mg/dL, Hemoglobin &lt; 10 g/dL, Platelet count &lt; 75,000mm3;, Prothrombin time/(PT/INR) international normalized ratio &gt; 1.5 times Upper Limit of Normal (ULN), Clinical or laboratory abnormality of Grade III or higher as assessed by CTCAE v4.0 which in the view of investigator would compromise safety. 5.
