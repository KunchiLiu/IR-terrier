	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of a session of virtual reality (VR) with the objective of lowering the anxiety level on the clinical pregnancy rate following an In-vitro fertilisation (IVF) procedure. Indeed, anxiety in relation to infertility happens frequently and over time, can become stressful for our patients. This level of stress influences the effect of the infertility treatment. Reducing anxiety levels could promote the ability of the patients to face this stress and promote a greater chance of pregnancy in that context.</brief_summary>
