	<brief_summary>Androgens are important sex steroids in women. Androgens influence protein synthesis and muscle growth, are involved in maturation of the reproductive organs, have a fat reducing effect , have a negative effect on the serum lipid profile, and may also increase insulin resistance and coagulation activity. The role of androgens in women is not clear. This study is aimed at learning about the amount of androgen and its actions in pregnant women. We are looking to see if there are specific patient factors (such as genetics) that change the amount of androgen and its activity.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Pregnancy on Androgenic Steroids in Different Genetic Panels</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There is a lot of information about the main female sex hormones such as estrogens and progesterones (the main female sex hormones and the most important in menstrual , reproductive cycles and pregnancy) . However there is little information about androgens in pregnant women. It is known that certain illnesses, chemicals and dietary products might change the amount of androgen and its actions, which could affect the mother and her baby. It is also known that there are differences between the androgen levels in different people, and in different ethnic groups. These differences are mostly due to genetic factors. The goal of this study is to learn about the androgen levels in healthy pregnant women and if genetic or clinical factors (for example age, trimester of pregnancy, parity, ethnicity, etc.) play a role in changing the androgen amount and action, throughout pregnancy and after delivery.</detailed_description>
