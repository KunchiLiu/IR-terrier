	<brief_summary>Thirty-two subjects diagnosed with COPD were enrolled, received each study treatment and completed the follow-up assessments. During each of the four study periods, subjects were admitted to the clinic on Day -1 and housed overnight until after the last spirometry measurement. Serial pulmonary function tests were performed and PK (pharmacokinetics) samples collected up to 25 hours. Subjects were discharged from the clinic on Day 2 after evaluations.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of TD-4208 on FEV1 in Subjects With Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects were assigned to one of the 4-treatment sequence groups presented in the table above according to a randomization schedule supplied by the Sponsor before study initiation. The randomization scheme did not include assignments for replacement subjects. Subjects reported to their respective clinical research unit (CRU) on Admission/Day −1 for pre-randomization procedures and confirmation of eligibility (and continued eligibility for Periods 2 to 4). The unblinded pharmacist prepared and dispensed the nebulizers, according to the randomization schedule for each of the 4 periods. Dosing occurred in the morning, generally between 7 am and 9 am. For Periods 2 to 4, dosing occurred within ±30 minutes of the dosing time established in Period 1. Study drug was administered in the respective CRU under the supervision of study personnel. Single doses of TD-4208, ipratropium bromide, and placebo were administered in the clinical research unit (CRU) under the supervision of study personnel. Care was taken to avoid eye contact with study drugs. Residual drug solution remaining in the nebulizer (ie, in mL) was measured and recorded. The investigator or designee was responsible for maintaining accountability records for all study drug(s) in accordance with applicable government regulations and study procedures. The accountability record included entries for receipt, distribution or dispensing, and destruction of the material(s). Unused and expired study drugs were to be disposed of in accordance with written instructions from the Sponsor.</detailed_description>
