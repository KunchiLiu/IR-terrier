	<brief_summary>To determine how thyroid status regulates the relationship between brown adipose tissue (BAT) volume/activity, white adipose tissue (WAT) partitioning and basal metabolic rate (BMR) in hyperthyroid patients transitioning to euthyroidism via antithyroid drugs. To compare euthyroid outcomes (BAT, WAT, BMR, body composition, body weight and insulin resistance) achieved by hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) set point vs. normal ranges of plasma free thyroxine 4 (FT4) and throxine stimulating hormone (TSH).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Visit 1 is meant to confirm if participant's hyperthyroidism is due to Graves' disease via a blood test called TSH receptor autoantibody (TRAb). This is a standard test that doctors will routinely order as part of clinical practice to diagnose the cause of participant's hyperthyroidism and is not part of the research procedure. If this TRAb blood test has been done before participants have been referred to the endocrinology clinic at TTSH, investigators will review that result and decide if a repeat test is needed. If participants are confirmed by blood tests to have Graves' disease type of hyperthyroidism, participants are eligible to take part in this study. However, approximately 2 teaspoons (~ 10 mL) of blood will be taken for baseline thyroid function test just prior to the initiation of anti-thyroid drugs. Pre-menopausal women will also undergo a urine pregnancy test to exclude pregnancy prior to participation at study entry. Once participants have consented to participate in this study, participants will be randomized to receive either carbimazole (CMZ) or thiamazole (TMZ) and dosed according to a set point-based strategy (SPT) or by a strategy that moves participant's thyroid function test away from the set point (ASP) but still keeping participant's thyroid hormone levels within the normal ranges. Randomization means assigning participants to one of two groups by chance, like tossing a coin or rolling dice. This study is also a double-blind study, which means that apart from the research coordinator, neither participants nor the investigators will know which of the two treatment arms participants are assigned to. Up to a maximum of three investigators will be designated as the antithyroid drug (ATD) dose prescriber, and the investigators will be in charge of deciding on the ATD dose required based on the latest FT4, FT3 and TSH blood test results though investigators will not know who the test results belong to. After deciding an appropriate ATD dose, investigators will then inform the research coordinator who in turn feedback to the doctor in-charge to alter and prescribe the dose of ATD accordingly. On Study Visit 2, participants will be asked to come to the Clinical Nutrition Research Centre (CNRC) at the Centre for Translational Medicine at the National University of Singapore in the morning at 0800 h after an overnight fast of 8-10 hours. An intravenous indwelling cannula will be inserted into an arm vein from which a fasting blood sample will be taken. At first, 30 mL of blood will be taken (about 6 teaspoons) in which 10 mL will be tested for thyroid function while the other 10 mL will be tested for liver and kidney function and the remaining 10mL for fasting glucose, insulin and lipids. The liver and kidney function tests are done as part of safety lab tests which will only be done once at Visit 2. An additional 20 mL blood (about 4 teaspoons) (baseline) will be taken for analysis of markers of fat metabolism and protein profiles reflective of brown fat activity. A urine (baseline) sample will also be collected. Participants will then undergo anthropometry (ie. measures of body weight, height, waist and hip circumference), non-invasive percentage fat estimation using bioelectrical impedence analysis (BIA) and body composition evaluation using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) which allows quantification of fat, lean and bone mass. Participants will then undergo metabolic rate measurement in a whole body calorimeter coupled with infrared thermography (IRT) using a thermal camera mounted on a tripod stand focusing on participant's neck and area above the collar bone in a whole body room calorimeter for the next 45 minutes. Participants will next be served 8 gel capsules (= 12 mg) of capsinoids to be swallowed with some plain water. Capsinoids are non-pungent, non-spicy forms of the spice called capsaicin found in chillies and peppers. These substances taken orally have been shown to be able to effectively stimulate BAT in the body. Use of capsinoids to stimulate BAT is essentially safe as capsinoids are naturally occurring plant derived substances from Capsicum annuum and generally recognised as safe for human consumption. The US FDA has approved capsinoids as 'Generally Recognised as Safe' (GRAS) status and allows this to be taken as foods ingredients. Metabolic rate measurement and IRT in the whole body calorimeter will continue for the next 120 min after the capsinoids have been ingested. At the end of this period of capsinoids stimulation, another sample of blood (20 mL ~ 4 teaspoons) will be drawn again from your intravenous cannula inserted into your arm vein earlier for analysis of markers of fat metabolism and protein profiles reflective of brown fat activity. Another urine sample will also be collected. After at least 48 hours later to allow for washout of the capsinoids from participant's body but to no more than 1 week, participants will be asked to return for Study Visit 3 to the CNRC. Participants will be prescribed propranolol (PPL) 20mg by the endocrinologist at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) and instructed to bring it along so that participants can take the 20mg of propranolol upon arrival. This is a drug called a beta-blocker which is typically used to treat excessive palpitations and finger tremors of hyperthyroidism. Propranolol at doses of 20mg-40mg daily to thrice daily is part and parcel of standard management of hyperthyroidism such as in Graves' disease to control tremors, anxiety, palpitations and also reduce activation of FT4 to FT3. At these doses, propranolol has been shown to be safe and efficacious as long as there are no contraindications such as bronchial asthma, decompensated cardiac failure or allergy to propranolol. In this study, only a low dose of propranolol 20mg is used on Visit 3 and on Visit 6 prior to infrared thermography and indirect calorimetry to suppress BAT activity which should be very safe. The reason for using propranolol is to suppress BAT activity so that we can detect differences in metabolic rate and heat signatures in the thermograms of the IRT compared with capsinoids stimulation. After participants have taken the 20mg of propranolol, participants will undergo metabolic rate measurement in the whole body calorimeter and IRT for 120 minutes. Participants will then proceed to the Clinical Imaging Research Centre (CIRC) also located in the same building at the basement for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of abdominal white fat, magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) of liver fat and fat fraction MRI scanning of BAT. On Study Visit 4, participants will need to come to the Clinical Imaging Research Centre (CIRC) in the morning after an overnight fast of 8-10 hours for fat fraction MRI scanning of BAT which is a repeat of the last procedure on Study Visit 3. Study Visits 2, 3 and 4 will be done within an interval not exceeding 2 weeks. After that, participants will then be required to go to the endocrinology clinic at TTSH for control of their hyperthyroidism via ATD that will be dosed according to the set point targeted (SPT) or away from set point (ASP) strategy as decided by randomization. This may take about 6 months to attain stable thyroid hormones levels (FT4, FT3, TSH) that satisfy the SPT or ASP endpoints. You will be followed up monthly by your TTSH endocrinologist and have your ATD doses adjusted in a double-blinded fashion till their thyroid function tests are stable according to either the SPT or ASP endpoint. When this happens, participants will continue with the remaining part of the research, which are Study Visits 5, 6, and 7. With the exception of the liver and kidney function tests done at Visit 2, the remaining study visits are exactly the same as Study Visits 2, 3 and 4 respectively.</detailed_description>
