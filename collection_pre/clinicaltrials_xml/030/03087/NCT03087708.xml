	<brief_summary>This randomized pilot clinical trial studies the side effects and best dose of naloxegol and to see how well it works in treating patients with stage IIIB-IV non-small cell lung cancer. Naloxegol may relieve some of the side effects of opioid pain medication and fight off future growth in the cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Naloxegol in Treating Patients With Stage IIIB-IV Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine feasibility and safety of long-term administration of two doses of a peripheral opioid receptor antagonist in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) receiving first-line pemetrexed-based chemotherapy. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To explore whether patients randomized to one or both of the two study drug arms have less decline in health-related quality of life (HRQoL) than patients randomized to placebo. II. To estimate the difference in the pain levels and opioid/non-opioid analgesic requirements between patients receiving naloxegol or placebo. III. To estimate the difference in the adverse peripheral effects of opioids (e.g. constipation, nausea/emesis, dry mouth and urinary retention) between patients receiving naloxegol or placebo. IV. To explore whether there is a signal that naloxegol may be associated with longer progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). V. To evaluate the difference in discontinuation rate of chemotherapy due to adverse events (AEs) and deaths attributable to chemotherapy. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To examine if MOR expression or activation is a prognostic marker in advanced NSCLC, and whether its expression/activation can be used to guide pain management. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 groups. GROUP I (LOWER DOSE NALOXEGOL): Patients receive lower dose naloxegol orally (PO) once daily (QD) and placebo PO QD. Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. GROUP II (HIGHER DOSE NALOXEGOL): Patients receive placebo PO QD and higher dose naloxegol PO QD. Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. GROUP III (PLACEBO): Patients receive placebo PO QD. Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months.</detailed_description>
