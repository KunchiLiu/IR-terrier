	<brief_summary>The overall goal of this study is to evaluate biomarkers of oxidative stress, mitochondrial function, and DNA methylation (epigenetics) in order to determine the extent to which these biomarkers are related to cognitive, behavioral and adaptive function in Down Syndrome. The inter-relationship between measurable biomarkers and functional/cognitive abilities will move beyond genetics to provide unprecedented new knowledge and a broader understanding of the underlying pathophysiology and abnormal gene expression induced by trisomy 21.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The Investigators preliminary evidence indicates that people with DS have metabolic biomarkers associated with oxidative stress (GSH/GSSG) and reduced methylation capacity (SAM/SAH) as well as abnormal DNA methylation (epigenetics). The investigative team hypothesize that these abnormal metabolic processes contribute to abnormalities in behavior and development associated with trisomy 21; this connection has never been investigated. Confirming and expanding on the preliminary data would provide new understanding of the biological and functional etiology of the behavioral and developmental delays associated with Trisomy 21. Further, establishing the underlying relationship between metabolic abnormalities and behavioral/cognitive function over the age spectrum can provide strong support for the design of future treatments of individuals with DS aimed at improving their behavior and development. In addition, these biomarkers may also prove to be predictive biomarkers for the risk of developing ASD like behaviors or Alzheimer's disease in this population. Finally, examining the modulating role of diet in the severity of biological abnormalities will provide new information for lifestyle guidance to improve biomarkers and potentially minimize the medical co-morbidities associated with trisomy 21.</detailed_description>
