	<brief_summary>A previous phase II trial entitled Treatment of Follicular non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma with High Dose Therapy and Stem Cell Support Followed by Consolidative Immunotherapy with Rituximab and Alpha Interferon was conducted at the Odette Cancer Centre between 2005 and 2012. The primary objectives of this previous trial was to assess progression free survival and overall survival. Of the 36 patients in this trial, approximately 18 remain in remission. In this new follow up trial, follow up data will prospectively be collected on patients who provide informed consent to do so.</brief_summary>
