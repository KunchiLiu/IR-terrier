	<brief_title>Monitored vs Standard Supplementation of Vitamin D in Preterm Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Vitamin D (vit D) deficiency is a risk factor of osteopenia of prematurity, which leads to rickets or decreased bone mass mineral density. Recently multiple studies have been published on vit D adjust biological functions. Dosage, safety and effectiveness of vitD supplementation in preterm infants still remains a controversial topic. We hypothesize that monitored supplementation of vit D is more effective and safer than standard therapy 500IU in preterm infants. The study will be carried out in 138 preterm infants, born at 24-32 week of gestational age (GA) at the Princess Anne's Hospital in Warsaw, Poland. We will determine if monitored supplementation of vit D decreases the incidence of vit D deficiency and/or overdosing at 40 week (GA). For secondary objective we shall assess if monitored therapy reduces the incidence of vit D deficiency and/or overdosing at 35, 52 week (GA), prevalence of osteopenia, low bone mass, nephrocalcinosis and nephrolithiasis.</detailed_description>
