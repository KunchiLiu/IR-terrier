	<brief_summary>Denosumab is an antibody against receptor-activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand that prevents recruitment and differentiation of mature osteoclasts. Treatment markedly decrease bone resorption and fracture risk, and many patients will reach osteopenic BMD levels on treatment with denosumab. The treatment effect on bone turnover and BMD has, however, been demonstrated to be reversible. This study will show if the bone mass can be maintained by administrating zoledronic acid and if timing of the first dose of zoledronic acid after last dose of denosumab matters.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment With Zoledronic Acid Subsequent to Denosumab in Osteoporosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: Denosumab is an antibody against receptor-activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand that prevents recruitment and differentiation of osteoclasts. Treatment decreases bone resorption and fracture risk. After discontinuation, however, bone resorption increases and the bone mass gained during 2 years of therapy is lost within 1 year. At present denosumab treatment is considered to be life-long. Aim: To investigate if infusion of zoledronic acid can prevent increases in bone turnover and bone loss in patients previously treated with denosumab and if there is difference between infusing zoledronic acid at six or nine months after the last injection of denosumab or when bone turnover is increased. Methods: The study is a randomized, open label, interventional study in 60 patients with osteoporosis. Treatment with zoledronic acid will be administrated six months (6-months group, n=20) or nine months (9-months group, n=20) after the last injection of denosumab or when bone turnover is increased (observation group, n=20). The patients in the observation group and the 9-months group will be monitored monthly a few months after baseline with s-carboxy-terminal collagen crosslinks (s-CTX), and if s-CTX increases above 1.26ug/l (50% above the normal range for postmenopausal women and elderly men) or if a patient suffers a vertebral or hip fracture infusion of zoledronic acid will be administered. Furthermore, a DXA scan (lumbar spine and hip sites) will be performed after 3 months in the observation group, and if BMD decreases more than 5% at any site, infusion of zoledronic acid will be administered. If s-CTX increases above 1.26 ug/l during the second year another infusion of zoledronic acid will be administered. Perspectives: Many patients will reach osteopenic BMD levels on treatment with denosumab, however the treatment effect on bone turnover and BMD has been demonstrated to be reversible and it is therefore important to find out if denosumab treatment can be discontinued and bone mass maintained by other measures. This study will show if the bone mass can be maintained by administrating zoledronic acid and if timing of the first dose of zoledronic acid after last dose of denosumab matters. If bone loss can be prevented by zoledronic acid expenses on otherwise life-long denosumab treatment can be saved and long-term side effects of denosumab (atypical femur fractures and osteonecrosis of the jaw) can be prevented.</detailed_description>
