	<brief_summary>Intraoperative monitoring of the motor evoked potentials has been shown to be both a sensitive and specific indicator for detecting intraoperative neurologic injuries during spine surgery.(Fehlings, Brodke et al. 2010) It is utilised whenever there is risk for injury of nerve roots or the spinal cord during the procedure. Anaesthetic agents, especially the inhaled volatile anaesthetics and muscle relaxants, are confounders for motor evoked potential monitoring as they have deleterious effects on the amplitude of motor evoked potentials.(Sekimoto, Nishikawa et al. 2006) Hence, total intravenous anaesthesia with no intraoperative muscle relaxants, are the standard anaesthetic technique for these surgeries. Muscle relaxants are usually required during the induction of anaesthesia and endotracheal intubation of larynx. Current practice is to wait for the resolution of residual neuromuscular blockade before the motor evoked potential recordings (MEPs) are initiated and this makes it difficult to assess if there was any neurological injury associated with positioning of the patient. A previous case series has shown that reversal of muscle relaxant can improve the amplitude of MEPs.(Batistaki, Papadopoulos et al. 2012) The aim of this study is to perform a randomised controlled trial to study the changes in motor evoked potential amplitudes comparing sugammadex and placebo.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Motor evoked potential monitoring is a well-established and safe intervention to assist in prevention of intraoperative injury during spine surgery.(Schwartz, Sestokas et al. 2011) There is no current consensus for criteria for change in amplitude for trans-cranial motor evoked potential monitoring. The peak-peak amplitude of the baseline motor evoked potential is utilised as a monitoring tool during surgery. The smaller the change in amplitude that is utilised as alarm criterion the more false positives that will be conveyed to the surgeons. (Legatt, Emerson 2016) Our neurophysiologists use a decrease in the amplitude by more than 50% or loss of the signal as a trigger to warn the surgeon of potential development of a neurological insult or injury. The usual anaesthetic practice at our institution for patients undergoing posterior cervical spine surgery is to administer muscle relaxation to aid intubation at the start of the case and occasionally small doses of rocuronium (10-20mg) prior to turning the patient prone. The neuromuscular blockade is then allowed to wear off and the neurophysiologist will attempt to record their baseline motor evoked potentials during or just prior to surgical exposure. The issues with this current technique are; 1. Patients cannot be monitored for neurological changes during their transfer into the prone position 2. There is likely residual neuromuscular blockade decreasing the amplitude of motor evoked potentials. We plan to perform a randomised controlled cross over trial comparing the change in MEP amplitudes with administration of sugammadex or placebo. This will be performed on at risk patients (e.g. cervical myelopathy) undergoing posterior cervical spine surgery where MEPs can be more difficult to attain but of higher utility.(Kombos, Kopetsch et al. 2003) The purpose of this study is to determine the increase in amplitude of the motor evoked potentials when residual neuromuscular blockade is reversed with sugammadex or placebo.</detailed_description>
