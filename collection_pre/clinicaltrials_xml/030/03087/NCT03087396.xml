	<brief_title>A Longitudinal Outcomes Study of the Subchondroplasty® Procedure in the Foot/Ankle</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a post-market, multi-center, patient outcomes centered study to evaluate the on-label use of AccuFill during the Subchondroplasty procedure (SCP). Enrolled subjects will sign an informed consent form, satisfy the inclusion/exclusion criteria and have at least one bone marrow lesion, such as a cyst or stress fracture confirmed by diagnostic imaging in the foot and/or ankle joint. Demographics, medical history and medications will recorded at the time of enrollment. Surgical details including the SCP procedure, concomitant surgical procedures and intraoperative safety events will be recorded. Subjects will complete validated patient reported outcomes measures pre-operatively including the Foot Function Index (FFI) revised short form, the EQ-5D™ and numeric pain score. These measures plus a subject satisfaction survey will also be administered post-operatively at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years. At 3 years, 4 years, and 5 years, numeric pain scores and a patient satisfaction survey will be collected. Screening for adverse events and revision surgeries will occur throughout the study. Target enrollment is 250 patients at up to 25 clinical sites. Subjects will complete the study at 5 years or will be withdrawn if the patient undergoes revision surgery of the Subchondroplasty site.</detailed_description>
