	<brief_summary>This is an observational study in which data on consecutive patients who undergo ureterorenoscopy with the use of a flexible ureterorenoscope are collected. In total 4 new ureteroscopes are used (2 from Olympus and 2 from Storz) to study the durability of the ureteroscopes and the possible microbiological load.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is an observational study in which data on consecutive patients who undergo ureterorenoscopy with the use of a flexible ureterorenoscope are collected. In total 4 new ureteroscopes are used (2 from Olympus and 2 from Storz) to study the durability of the ureteroscopes and the possible microbiological load. Before the procedure is started the endoscope is tested for its microbiological load in two different ways: Shake the tip of the flexible ureterorenoscope 5 seconds in a sterile container filled with 100 cc of NaCl 0.9% Using a well-fitting single use sterile brush or sponge brush the biopsy channel. Shake the brush during 5 seconds in a sterile container filled with 100 cc of NaCL 0.9%. After the procedure is finished, the endoscope is tested for its microbiological load in two different ways: Shake the tip of the flexible ureterorenoscope 5 seconds in a sterile container filled with 100 cc of NaCl 0.9% Using a well-fitting single use sterile brush or sponge brush the biopsy channel. Shake the brush during 5 seconds in a sterile container filled with 100 cc of NaCL 0.9% Before dismissal of the hospital and at the first visit of the patient in the outpatient clinic: Sample a urine culture and measure the temperature of the patient Mark and date the samples. Complete the lab form with all required information and the reason for sampling. Transfer all samples to the lab as soon as possible but at least within four hours after collecting the samples. As for the clinical efficacy during each procedure a detailed questionnaire about the use of each ureteroscope is filled out. This includes the ease of use making mention on quality of the image, torque, flexibility and durability. Data will be collected through electronic case report forms (eCFRs), with use of an online Data Management system (DMS).</detailed_description>
