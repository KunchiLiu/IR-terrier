	<brief_summary>Obesity, associated with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is often involved in cardiovascular diseases. In our study, we want to promote sport practice to reduce that burden in the first place, and all associated diseases (e.g. cardiovascular diseases) consequently. The aim of this clinical trial is to determine which type of program, conducted in a digital environment associating a mobile application and individual coaching, better improves exercise habits over a 3-month period in overweight or moderate obese OSA patients.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>With automation equipment and the comfort, it has brought, less natural physical activities are required and people do not take the time to do some. Therefore, obesity, associated with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) up to 60% of cases, has become a heavy burden on the society and the healthcare system, besides the fact that it often involves cardiovascular diseases. Assistance is urgently needed and the investigators want to promote sport practice to reduce that burden in the first place, and all associated diseases (e.g. cardiovascular diseases) consequently. In order to do that, the investigators will integrate sport in the patient pathway and support in his/her involvement. This last point means that a link between medical and sport specialists should be established, and this is missing today. This study aims to reconcile the world of patients and the world of sport, by offering a trajectory and an organization that help patients to initiate physical activity. The investigators plan to measure the physical activity of overweight or moderate obese, apneic patients in the different programs at the end of the 3-month period by physical activity objective parameters: number of steps/day. The secondary objectives of this study are to: - Evaluate the effect of the different programs of sport "prescription" on patient motivation, over a 3-month period by a motivational questionnaire. - Analyze the cost effectiveness of the different programs of sport "prescription" over a 3-month period. - Evaluate the effect of the different programs of sport "prescription" on weight and blood pressure (BP), assessed by home self-measurements each month, over a 3-month period and recorded in the application.</detailed_description>
