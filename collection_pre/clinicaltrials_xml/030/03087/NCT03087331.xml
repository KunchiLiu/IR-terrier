	<brief_title>An Evaluation of the Effect of Community-based Pharmacist Intervention on Patients With Chronic Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will evaluate the effectiveness of community-based pharmacist interventions on the quality of life of patients with chronic pain as determined by self-reported pain levels using an established scoring system. Participating pharmacists will enroll chronic pain patients from their normal practice to receive a consultation, which consists of an assessment of their current pain, a medication review, and education about their condition. Based on the information provided by the patient, the pharmacist will prepare a care plan, contact the patient's prescriber, and, in conjunction with the prescriber, implement the plan to help relieve their pain. Follow-up assessments will be done after 2 weeks, and 3 months.</detailed_description>
