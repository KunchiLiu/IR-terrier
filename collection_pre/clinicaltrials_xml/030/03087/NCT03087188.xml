	<brief_summary>There are different therapy strategies for patients suffering on obstructive lung disease like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and asthma bronchial available. One of these strategies includes inhalative drugs, e.g. ß2-mimetics, anticholinergic drugs, or glucocorticoids, which are indicated often and which can be used with different inhalation devices. Dry powder inhalators, and dosieraerosol are used the most in clinical routine. Further strategies in treating obstructive lung disease are innovative systems like Respimat or systems with liquid inhalation. However, the success of the therapy depends on the correct application technique. In the clinical routine a high error rate was observed. Consequently, the initiative of the German league of respiratory tracts published internet-based film sequences in order to demonstrate how to use an inhalator correctly. These films are available in the internet for everyone and can be watched as often as needed in order to improve technique and facilitate training. Therefore, in this study we aim to evaluate the following aspects: - amount of wrong applications in ambulant and hospitalized patients (wrong in terms of lack of knowledge on how to use the inhalator or incorrect utilization) - amount of correct applications in patients who had first used the inhalator incorrectly but improved technique by watching the film sequences - evaluation of learning success within 2 weeks to 2 months (follow-up visit in the ambulance)</brief_summary>
