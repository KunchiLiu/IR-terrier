	<brief_summary>Patients with Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) often report more fatigue and sleep disturbances compared to their healthy counterparts and compared to patients with other GI disorders. This pilot study will evaluate the feasibility of a Brief Behavioral Treatment for Insomnia (BBT-I) in Irritable Bowel Syndrome. 40 participants will be recruited; 20 will receive 4 weeks of BBT and 20 will be assigned to a wait list control group (WLC). The primary aim of the current project is to assess feasibility of administering BBT-I to a sample of patients with IBS. Because behavioral sleep treatment has not yet been studied in IBS or any other GI population, this project will provide information about treatment adherence, recruitment, and effect sizes. Secondary aims include evaluating the impact of BBT-I on sleep quality and IBS symptom severity.</brief_summary>
