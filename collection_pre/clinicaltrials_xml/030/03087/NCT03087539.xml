	<brief_title>Exploratory P2 Trial to Evaluate Efficacy and Safety of Clotinab® (Abciximab) in Acute MI Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study was an exploratory phase 2 of Clinical Trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Clotinab® (Abciximab) in the acute myocardial infarction patients and was designed as a multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled and parallel group study. The objective of this phase 2 clinical trial is to evaluate correlation between infarct size and major adverse cardiac event (MACE) of acute myocardial infarction patient, prearranged for percutaneous coronary intervention(PCI), to measure possibility to use infarct size as a primary efficacy test variable in phase 3 for final confirmation of safety and efficacy. Also to determine exploratively an average variance estimation of infarct size between study drug and placebo to confirm safety and efficacy of study drug, compared to placebo and to use the estimation for calculating sample size for phase III clinical trial.</detailed_description>
