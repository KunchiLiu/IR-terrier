	<brief_summary>This single-center, randomized, double-blinded trial will compare the safety and efficacy of FMT given enema in subjects 18-60 months of age with uncomplicated, non-edematous SAM not responsive to standard therapy. Subjects must meet inclusion criteria, no exclusion criteria prior to randomization. Subjects will then be randomized by stratified random sampling (by age, diarrhea, MUAC and hyponatremia) in a 1:1 ratio at each site to 1 of 2 treatment groups: - FMT by enema: 10mL/kg (maximum 60mL) of donor fecal material will be infused. - Placebo by enema: 10mL/kg (maximum 60mL) of placebo material will be infused. Subjects will be evaluated through 56 days (±5) after randomization for primary outcomes (safety) as well as secondary outcomes (nutritional, clinical and microbiological response). See definition under endpoints/outcome measures above). Stool samples will be collected at enrollment and through days 3, 7, 14, 21, 42 and 56. Samples will be used for microbiome determination and other exploratory microbiological endpoints. An aliquot of donor stool will also be stored for microbiome determination and other exploratory microbiological endpoints and assessment of newly acquired infectious agents.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subjects eligible to participate in this study must meet the following inclusion criteria: 1. Age 18 to 60 months. 2. Uncomplicated SAM defined as: A WHZ of less than −3 according to the 2006 WHO Growth Standards or a midupperarm circumference of less than 115 mm No medical complications present Participant is sufficiently alert and successfully passes the appetite test which involves consumption of breastmilk or a ready to use therapeutic food (RUTF) under supervision. 3. No bilateral pitting pedal edema or generalized anasarca. 4. HIV negative, exposed but negative or HIV positive on HAART with CD4 count &gt; 500 cells/l. 5. Optimal WHO treatment for uncomplicated SAM: 7day course of amoxicillin as part of standard therapy for uncomplicated SAM within the last 3 months. Deworming in the last 3 months. Micronutrient supplementation (Vitamin A, zinc and iron) as recommended by local guidelines. Nutritional rehabilitation as recommended by local guidelines. Written informed consent obtained by parent or caregiver. Subjects will not be able to participate if they meet any of the following exclusion criteria: 1. Evidence of complicated SAM, defined as any of the following: 1. Signs of acute infection. 2. One or more WHO Integrated Management of Childhood Illness danger signs.(2) 3. Failure to pass appetite test. 4. Presence of known comorbid diseases such as pulmonary Tuberculosis, cystic fibrosis, type I diabetes mellitus, intestinal malabsorptive syndromes, chronic lung disease, chronic liver disease, chronic renal disease or malignancy undergoing active chemotherapy. 5. Bilateral pitting pedal edema or generalized anasarca 2. Ongoing antibiotic use for indication other than SAM (e.g. infection, HIV prophylaxis). 3. Congenital malformations, syndromic conditions and metabolic abnormalities (inborn errors of metabolism) that may adversely affect growth. 4. Kwashiorkor or marasmickwashiorkor. 5. Bilateral pitting edema Grade 2. 6. Contraindications to enema: 1. Anorectal malformations 2. Rectal prolapse 3. Hirschsprungs disease 4. Other contraindication to enema. 7. HIV positive children who are not on HAART or on HAART with a CD4 count &lt;500 cells/l. 8. Primary immune deficiencies 9. Neutropenia 10. Persistent and chronic diarrhea (&gt;7 days of loose or water stools). 11. Dysentery 12. Intestinal abnormalities including malformations, Hirschsprungs disease and short bowel syndrome</criteria>
