	<brief_summary>This is a phase I/II study of ceritinib and trametinib in Stage IIIB or IV anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearranged non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The Phase I portion will investigate the safety and tolerability of the combination of ceritinib and trametinib in ALK or ROS-1 rearranged NSCLC. The Phase II portion will investigate the clinical efficiency of the combination of ceritinib and trametinib in 3 single arm cohorts: ALKi (ALK inhibitor) naïve patients; post-crizotinib progressed disease (PD) patients; and PD second line ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) patients.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is a phase I/II study of ceritinib and trametinib in Stage IIIB or IV ALK rearranged NSCLC. The phase I portion is a standard 3+3 dose escalation study starting at dose level 1 and will be open to any patient with ALK-rearranged, or ROS-1 rearranged NSCLC. The phase II portion will consist of 3 single arm cohorts in ALK-rearranged NSCLC: - Cohort A (ALKi Naïve): 20 evaluable patients - Cohort B (Post-crizotinib PD): 21 evaluable patients - Cohort C (PD second line ALK TKI (e.g., alectinib, ceritinib, PF-06463922 or - AP21163): 10 evaluable patients. The aim will be to enroll up to 69 patients. Patients may continue treatment for up to 24 months from the time of study entry, and will receive 12 months of follow-up following completion of the drugs.</detailed_description>

Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women, where pregnancy is defined as the state of a female after conception and until the termination of gestation, confirmed by a positive human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG) laboratory test. 11. Women of childbearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of becoming pregnant, unless they are using highly effective methods of contraception during dosing and for 3 months after the last dose of study treatment. Highly effective contraception methods include: Total abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception. Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking study treatment. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment. Male sterilization (at least 6 months prior to screening) with the appropriate postvasectomy documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate. For female subjects on the study the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that subject. Combination of any two of the following (a+b or a+c or b+c): 1. Use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception or other forms of hormonal contraception that have comparable efficacy (failure rate &lt; 1%), for example hormone vaginal ring or transdermal hormone contraception. 2. Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS). 3. Barrier methods of contraception: Condom or Occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal suppository. In case of use of oral contraception, women should have been stable on the same pill for a minimum of 3 months before taking study treatment. Women are considered postmenopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile. (e.g., age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks prior to screening. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she considered not of child bearing potential. 12. Sexually active males unless they use a condom during intercourse while taking drug and for 3 months after the last dose of study treatment. Male patients for 3 months should not father a child in this period. A condom is required to be used also by vasectomized men in order to prevent delivery of the drug via seminal fluid. 13. Patient has a history of pancreatitis or history of increased amylase or lipase that was due to pancreatic disease. 14. Patient has other severe, acute, or chronic medical conditions including uncontrolled diabetes mellitus or psychiatric conditions or laboratory abnormalities that, in the opinion of the investigator, may increase the risk associated with study participation or may interfere with the interpretation of study results. 16. Patient has had major surgery (e.g., intrathoracic, intraabdominal or intrapelvic) within 4 weeks prior to starting study treatment or has not recovered from side effects of such procedure. Videoassisted thoracic surgery (VATS) and mediastinoscopy will not be counted as major surgery and patients can receive study treatment ≥ 1 week after these procedures. 17. History of another malignancy. Exception: Subjects who have been diseasefree for 3 years, or subjects with a history of completely resected nonmelanoma skin cancer and/or subjects with indolent (early stage breast cancer or prostate cancer) second malignancies are eligible after discussion with the study principle investigator (PI). 18. History of retinal vein occlusion (RVO) 19. Symptomatic brain metastases or leptomeningeal (LM) disease requiring corticosteroids for symptom management.
