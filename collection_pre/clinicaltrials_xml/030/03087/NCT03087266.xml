	<brief_summary>Thirty-eight periodontitis- and diabetes-affected subjects will be randomly allocated to non surgical periodontal treatment with either Full-Mouth Approach (FM-SRP) or Quadrant approach (Q-SRP). Patients will be seen one day and three months (study completion) after treatment. The 24 hours appointment will be occurring after the entire completion of the FM-SRP or the first quadrant of the Q-SRP. In the latter group other sessions of treatment will be performed within the following 3 weeks. At baseline, 24 hours and three months, anthropometric, inflammatory and endothelial parameters will be collected. Periodontal parameters will be checked at baseline and at three months. Main outcome of the study is the level of C-reactive protein 24 hours after treatment.</brief_summary>
