	<brief_summary>Xylitol and erythritol have become increasingly popular as sugar substitutes in the food industry. Both substances are freely available. While glucose ingestion stimulates satiation hormone secretion in the gut and slows down gastric emptying, artificial sweeteners such as aspartame, sucralose and acesulfame-K have no such effect. However, acute intake of 50g xylitol or 75g erythritol in 300mL tap water leads to a marked increase in the satiation hormones and induces a significant retardation in gastric emptying. The concentrations used to Show this effect were rather high (50g xylitol and 75g erythritol) and led to bloating and diarrhea in 60-70% of all subjects two hours after administration. The aim of the present study is to find an effective concentration of xylitol and erythritol still stimulating satiation hormone release without any gastrointestinal adverse events.</brief_summary>
