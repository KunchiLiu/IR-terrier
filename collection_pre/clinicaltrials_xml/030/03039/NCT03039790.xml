	<brief_title>Long-Term Immunogenicity of the Norovirus GI.I/GII.4 Bivalent Virus-Like Particle (VLP) Vaccine in Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug being tested in this study is called Norovirus GI.1/GII.4 bivalent Virus-Like Particle Vaccine (NoV Vaccine). NoV vaccine is being tested for protection against acute gastroenteritis (AGE) due to norovirus. The study will enroll approximately 800 participants. Participants who previously received NoV vaccine in studies NOR-107, NOR-210, NOR-204 and NOR-222 will be enrolled. Participants from study NOR-107 will enter the study at the time of their 3rd year post-primary vaccination, from studies NOR-210 and NOR-204, at their 2nd year post-primary vaccination, and from study NOR-222, at the time of their 1st year post-primary vaccination. The duration of participation in the study will be different for each participant. This multi-center trial will be conducted in Belgium and United States. The overall time to participate in this study is maximum 5 years after primary NoV vaccination. Participants will have a maximum of 5 visits over 5 years.</detailed_description>
