	<brief_summary>Transurethral resection of the bladder tumor (TURB) for bladder tumor excision is the mainstream treatment. However, the beneficial effects of sugammadex after general anesthesia for TURB have not been thoroughly evaluated. Investigators hypothesized that deep NMB and the use of sugammadex as a reversal agent may be associated with better endoscopic surgical condition and recovery profile compared with moderate NMB during TURB. This study was designed to compare patients with deep neuromuscular blockade (NMB) with moderate NMB during transurethral resection of the bladder tumor (TURB) in terms of surgical condition and postoperative recovery.</brief_summary>
