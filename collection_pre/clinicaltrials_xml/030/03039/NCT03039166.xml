	<brief_summary>the investigators hypothesize that hub alteration occurs both in diffuse diseases (MS, AD) as well as in more 'network specific' diseases (Parkinson, ALS, Epilepsy). This could impact on functional dysfunction not directly related to each disease, but that could induce common syndrome such as cognitive impairment observed in Parkinson, partial epilepsy or ALS. The objective here is to test this hypothesis and provides better understandings on pathophysiological processes affecting those highly connected regions in 'diffuse' and 'focal' neurological diseases. The ultimate goal is to identify new clinical targets for trans-nosological approaches (DBS, cognitive rehabilitation ...). Practically, the investigators will explore 200 patients classified in 5 cohorts of 40 patients suffering for MS, AD, Parkinson, ALS, Epilepsy, using the last advanced methods to assess structural and functional brain connectivity implemented on the human 7T MR scanner equipping the CEMEREM (CHU Timone, Marseille, only 50 similar MR scanners worldwide). In addition to high resolution diffusion MRI and rs-fMRI, metabolic and ionic (sodium) mapping will complement the MR protocol to characterize the pathophysiological processes of hub injury. Sixty healthy controls will also be explored wih the same protocol for normal database. The proposal aims at characterizing and comparing from a morphological-functional point of view, the hub regions of patients suffering from these five diseases, to demonstrate the pertinence to preserve hub integrity as a major therapeutic target whatever the disease.</brief_summary>
