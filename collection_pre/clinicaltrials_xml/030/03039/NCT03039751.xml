	<brief_title>Adenovirus Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor D (AdvVEGF-D) Therapy for Treatment of Refractory Angina Pectoris</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study overview: The purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of catheter mediated AdVEGF-D regenerative gene transfer in patients with refractory angina to whom revascularisation cannot be performed. Primary objectives: To test the efficacy of the therapy to improve functional capacity using 6 minute walking test after 6 months follow-up and improvement of symptoms assessed by Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) class. Secondary objectives: Efficacy of the gene transfer to increase to improve functional capacity using 6 minute walking test and improvement of symptoms assessed by CCS class after 12 months as well as increase in myocardial perfusion assessed 6 months after the gene transfer. In addition, at 6 and 12 months timepoints, the improvement quality of life (QoL), the use of angina pectoris medication, major adverse cardiac events related to coronary artery disease (cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, revascularization and hospital admission due to coronary artery disease) or a combined endpoint of the above (Major Adverse Cardiac Events, MACE) will be evaluated. Study design: ReGenHeart is a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled multicentre phase II study which will be conducted at 6 centers. The study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of catheter mediated endocardial AdVEGF-D regenerative gene transfer in 180 patients with angina pectoris or equivalent symptom despite optimal medical therapy and who are not suitable candidates for coronary revascularization with coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) (refractory angina patients). Study population: 180 patients will be recruited from the six centers in 2 years. The patients will be selected for the trial on the basis of medical history, general status, laboratory analyses, coronary angiogram and 6-minute walking test. Patients with CCS 2-3 angina pectoris despite optimal medical therapy and who are not eligible for coronary angioplasty or bypass operation due to diffuse coronary stenosis, small coronary vessels, repeated revascularization or too high risk for operation, will be included. The number of subjects to be recruited and randomized to the trial will be 180 (2:1 ratio to the treatment and control groups). Investigational drug product: First generation replication-deficient AdVEGF-D produced in 293 cells will be injected into ten sites in the endocardium. The dose of 1x1011 vp in a total volume of 2 ml (10 times 0.2 ml) will be used. Control patients will be treated and operated exactly in the same way except that placebo (buffer solution without gene) injection into the myocardium is used.</detailed_description>
