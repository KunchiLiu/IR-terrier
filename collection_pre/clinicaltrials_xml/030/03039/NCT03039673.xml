	<brief_summary>MIROCALS is a phase II study of ld-IL-2 as a therapeutic agent for ALS. A randomized (1:1), placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel group trial will be carried out to assess ld-IL-2 safety and clinical efficacy on survival and functional decline in newly diagnosed ALS patients treated for 18 months. Randomization will be stratified according to (i) country (n = 2 levels: UK, France) and (ii) site of onset (n= 2 levels: bulbar vs limb onset). The primary objective to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of the experimental drug (ld IL-2) over an 18 months period in order to establish the proof of concept (PoC) that modifying immune responses through the enhancement of regulatory T cells modifies the rate of ALS disease progression.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The secondary objectives of MIROCALS are: To validate a new phase-II study design to improve the efficiency of drug development in ALS with early determination of drug response using established biomarkers (BMs). The aims of this new trial design are: (i) To shorten future trials duration in ALS using an early drug responding surrogate marker of disease activity; (ii) To establish the proof of mechanism (PoM) of the tested drugs; (iii) To identify drug responder status. Additional exploratory objectives are: (i) Deep immune &amp; inflammatory phenotyping (ii) Brain biomarkers (iii) Genomics and Transcriptomics</detailed_description>
