	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of intranasal esketamine 84 milligram (mg) compared with intranasal placebo in addition to comprehensive standard of care in reducing the symptoms of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), including suicidal ideation, in participants who are assessed to be at imminent risk for suicide, as measured by the change from baseline on the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score at 24 hours post first dose.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of the Efficacy and Safety of Intranasal Esketamine in the Rapid Reduction of Symptoms of Major Depressive Disorder, in Adults at Imminent Risk for Suicide</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized (study medication assigned to participants by chance), double-blind (neither the researchers nor the participants know what treatment the participant is receiving), placebo-controlled (an inactive substance which contains no drug) that is compared in a clinical trial with a drug to test if the drug has a real effect), multicenter (when more than one hospital or study team work on a medical research study) study. Study will enroll participants with suicidal ideation who are assessed to be at imminent risk for suicide. The study will consist of a screening evaluation performed within 48 hours prior to the Day 1 intranasal dose immediately followed by a 25-day double-blind treatment phase (Day 1 to 25), and a 65 day follow-up phase (Day 26 to Day 90). The total study duration for each subject will be approximately 13 weeks. Participants' safety will be evaluated throughout the study.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participant must meet Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th edition) (DSM5) diagnostic criteria for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), without psychotic features, based upon clinical assessment and confirmed by the Mini International Psychiatric Interview (MINI) In the physician's opinion, acute psychiatric hospitalization is clinically warranted due to participant's imminent risk of suicide Participants must have current suicidal ideation with intent, confirmed by a "Yes" response to Question B3 [Think (even momentarily) about harming or of hurting or of injuring yourself: with at least some intent or awareness that you might die as a result; or think about suicide (ie, about killing yourself)?] AND Question B10 [Intend to act on thoughts of killing yourself?] obtained from the MINI. Note: the response to B3 must refer to the present, whereas the response to B10 may reflect the past 24 hours. If the screening period is longer than 24 hours, assessment of B3 and B10 of MINI must be repeated prior to randomization to confirm eligibility Participant has a Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score of greater than (&gt;) 28 predose on Day 1 As part of standard of care treatment, participant agrees to be hospitalized voluntarily for a recommended period of 5 days after randomization (may be shorter or longer if clinically warranted in the investigator's opinion) and take prescribed noninvestigational antidepressant therapy(ies) for at least the duration of the doubleblind treatment phase (Day 25) Participant is comfortable with selfadministration of intranasal medication and able to follow instructions provided Participant has a current DSM5 diagnosis of bipolar (or related disorders), antisocial personality disorder, or obsessive compulsive disorder Participant currently meets DSM5 criteria for borderline personality disorder. Participant not meeting full DSM5 criteria for borderline personality disorder but exhibiting recurrent suicidal gestures, threats, or selfmutilating behaviors should also be excluded Participant has a current clinical diagnosis of autism, dementia, or intellectual disability Participant has a current or prior DSM5 diagnosis of a psychotic disorder, or MDD with psychotic features Participant has a history of moderate or severe substance or alcohol use disorder, according to DSM5 criteria, except nicotine or caffeine, within 6 months before screening</criteria>
