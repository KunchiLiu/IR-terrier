	<brief_title>Serum miR-122 as a Real-time Detection Biomarker of Drug-induced Liver Injury by Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The endorsed standard serum biomarkers, like ALT, AST, total bilirubin, are not tissue-specific, and cannot detect drug-induced liver injury (DILI) at a very early stage, thus unable to properly guide risk assessment and patient management. miR-122 is a liver-enriched miRNA. Many studies have demonstrated that miR-122 is a sensitive and specific biomarker when DILI occurred. However, there is a lack of a standard quantification method for miR-122 and confirmatory studies using a comprehensive list of drugs and patients. The investigators have developed the miRNA-derived Fragment Length Polymorphism (miRFLP) assay for the simultaneous quantification of multiple miRNAs.The methodology improves detection reliability by eliminating intra-assay variables. In this study, the investigators will investigate the role of miR-122 as a real-time detection biomarker of drug-induced liver injury utilizing the miRFLP assay. In addition, the investigators will try to identify the normal physiological range of miR-122 in healthy population and the relationship of miR-122 and hepatic failure in patients of intensive care unit.</detailed_description>
