	<brief_summary>Hemodialysis patients frequently develop catheter-related blood stream bacteremia (CRBSI). Procalcitonin is a marker of sepsis in bacterial infection. this study for detection of its role as a surrogacy marker in CRBSI.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Procalcitonin Level as a Surrogate for Catheter-related Blood Stream Bacteremia Among Hemodialysis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Catheter-related blood stream bacteremia is common among hemodialysis patients. Clinically, fever and/or rigors with laboratory indicator of inflammation as leucocytosis and elevated c-reactive protein level are considered as markers for CRBSI before blood culture results became available. Procalcitonin is a valid indicator of sepsis. In this study, Procalcitonin level will be measured in any patient with suspected CRBSI and correlation will be tested for proved CRBSI by blood cultures.</detailed_description>
