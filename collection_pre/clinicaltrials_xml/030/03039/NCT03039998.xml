	<brief_summary>The main objective of project is to compare validity of sampling methods performed routinely (bronchial secretion, stomach content, oropharyngeal smear) for determination of etiological agent responsible for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) in critically ill patients to bronchoscopy-assisted protected brush method. Evaluation of the present clinical praxis using bronchial secretion sampling in HAP diagnostics and detection of the most common etiological agents in patients with HAP are other priorities of the project. Aiming to confirm or exclude the diagnosis of HAP, determine the sources and possible routes of bacterial pathogens transmission molecular biology analysis of etiological agents is performed. Finally, percentage of HAP etiological agents resistant to initial empiric antibiotic therapy will be observed.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Validity of Biological Material Sampling in Patients With Hospital-acquired Pneumonia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The main objective of project will be comparing validity of sampling methods performed routinely (bronchial secretion, stomach content, oropharyngeal smear) for determination of etiological agent responsible for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) in critically ill patients to bronchoscopy-assisted protected brush method. Obtained results of different methods will enable to determine if the bronchial secretion sample, stomach content sample or oropharyngeal smear are comparable to precise but technically difficult protected brush. Evaluation of the present clinical praxis using bronchial secretion sampling in HAP diagnostics and detection of the most common etiological agents in patients with HAP will be other priorities of the project. The role of atypical and fungal pathogens in HAP initiation will be discovered as well. Aiming to confirm or exclude the diagnosis of HAP, determine the sources and possible routes of bacterial pathogens transmission molecular biology analysis of etiological agents will be performed. Finally, percentage of HAP etiological agents resistant to initial empiric antibiotic therapy will be observed. Project fulfills program objectives of molecular-biologic approaches and research support in infectious diseases domain. It will make contribution to faster and more precise HAP diagnosis and adequate antibiotic therapy.</detailed_description>
