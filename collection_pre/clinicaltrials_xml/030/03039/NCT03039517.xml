	<brief_summary>This is a two arm, prospective, single center, randomized clinical trial. Subjects will be randomly assigned into one of two groups using block randomization technique in a 1:1 ratio. The control group will receive care using elastic compression stocking and the intervention group will use the ACTitouch device. Stratified randomization will occur based on whether the Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) has iliac or non-iliac involvement. Subjects will be followed for 2 years with clinic visits occurring at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Post Thrombotic Syndrome Prevention Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to determine if use of a pneumatic compression device (ACTitouch, Tactile Medical) is beneficial in improving or preventing the development of Post Thrombotic Syndrome (PTS). We plan to enroll 84 patients who have a history of an acute proximal unilateral leg DVT diagnosed one or more months prior to enrollment, or diagnosed with a chronic proximal unilateral leg DVT at time of enrollment, on duplex or other imaging study. They will be randomized into two groups: the control group receiving the standard of care compression stockings and the intervention group receiving ACTitouch device.</detailed_description>
