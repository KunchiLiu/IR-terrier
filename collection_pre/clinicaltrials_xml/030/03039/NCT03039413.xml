	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial studies how well copper Cu-64 TP3805 positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) works in imaging patients with urothelial cancer undergoing surgery or biopsy. Radioactive tracers, such as copper Cu-64 TP3805, may bind to tumor cells. PET/CT imaging performed with copper Cu-64 TP3805 may be a better way to detect urothelial cancer.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine if copper Cu-64 TP3805 (Cu-64-TP3805) shall image urothelial carcinoma (UC) as confirmed by postsurgical or biopsy histology. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine blood clearance of Cu-64-TP3805. II. To determine in vivo stability of Cu-64-TP3805. TERTIARY: I. To determine if Cu-64-TP3805 is bound to malignant cells and if it is internalized.</detailed_description>
