	<brief_summary>The post-operative treatment of pediatric patients operated for the correction of flat foot, sees today the use of preformed leg-foot splint (Walker) as an alternative to the application of plaster casts. The change of the immobilization system has led to the appearance of problems of tolerability in particular in the skin. The aim of the study is to assess whether by placing a polyurethane foam dress at the heel in the immediate postoperative period until removal of the Walker, the rate of skin lesion and pain is reduced.</brief_summary>
