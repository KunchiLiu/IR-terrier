	<brief_summary>There is around 60 000 births annually in Finland. Around 1-5% of all vaginal deliveries in Finland complicate in a Grade III- IV perineal tear. Because the diagnosis of a sphincter lesion after birth can be challenging the total amount of women having obtained a sphincter lesion could be even grater. The aim of our study is to compare different tools in the diagnosis of obstetric anal sphincter injury. In doing so we hope to achieve early diagnosis of this pathology and thus facilitate early treatment of a possible sphincter defect.</brief_summary>
