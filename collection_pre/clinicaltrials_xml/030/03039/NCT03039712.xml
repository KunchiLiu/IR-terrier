	<detailed_description>Micra CED study is a study of the Medicare beneficiary population implanted with single-chamber ventricular pacemakers, and will be executed by analyzing administrative claims data. The study consists of two primary objectives: estimate the: (1) acute overall complication rate and (2) the 2-year survival rate of patients implanted with a Micra leadless pacemaker. As part of the secondary objectives of the study, a comparative analysis of Micra leadless pacemakers to single-chamber ventricular transvenous pacemakers will be conducted.</detailed_description>
