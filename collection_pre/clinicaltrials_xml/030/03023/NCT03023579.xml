	<brief_summary>PURPOSE: The investigators estimated the reliability, standard error of measurement (SEM), and minimum detectable change (MDC) of the star excursion balance test (SEBT) in children with cerebral palsy (CP). METHODS: Eight children with CP (four boys and four girls, sixteen legs) participated in this study. Each child carried out the SEBT and was assessed by two examiners. To determine intra-rater reliability, the investigators calculated the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) model (3,3). The investigators also calculated the ICC model (2,3) to determine the inter-rater reliability.</brief_summary>
