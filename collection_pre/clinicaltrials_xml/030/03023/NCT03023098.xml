	<brief_title>Drug-eluting Balloon vs. Conventional Balloon in the Treatment of (re)Stenosis - a Randomized Prospective Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Drug-eluting devices have proved beneficial in the treatment of stenosis in native coronary and lower limb arteries. Stenosis and restenosis is a known problem in bypass vein grafts, and drug-eluting devices might be beneficial in this field as well. In the procedure a conventional balloon is passed through the stenosis which is then dilated. After this patients are randomized before a second dilatation with either a conventional balloon or a drug-coated balloon. The stenosis is evaluated preoperatively and followed up by means of ultrasound by a vascular technician. Follow-up will end at 12 months.</detailed_description>
