	<brief_title>An Exploratory Study to Assess the Efficacy of the Avène Hydrotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- To assess the benefit of the Avène hydrotherapy in subjects with pruritic plaque psoriasis in the: - Improvement of pruritus - Improvement of psoriasis severity - Improvement of quality of life - Change of pruritus and psoriasis biological markers - Intake/application of treatments and skin care products for psoriasis and pruritus management, evaluated during a follow-up period - To assess the time to pruritus relapse evaluated in subjects with pruritic plaque psoriasis, during the period following the Avène hydrotherapy (for the hydrotherapy group only) - To assess the global efficacy of the Avène hydrotherapy in pruritic plaque psoriasis, according to subjects' and investigators' opinion (for the hydrotherapy group only) - To assess the global cutaneous tolerance of the Avène hydrotherapy in subjects with pruritic plaque psoriasis (for the hydrotherapy group only)</detailed_description>
