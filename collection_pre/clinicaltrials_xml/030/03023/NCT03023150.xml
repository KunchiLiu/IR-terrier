	<brief_summary>This study will be the first study to use ischemic preconditioning (IPC) as an intervention to improve stroke rehabilitation. IPC is a well studied, well tolerated intervention which has been shown to improve regional blood flow, motor neuron excitability and muscle function in multiple patient groups and in young, healthy subjects. Because IPC targets three physiological systems which are all affected by stroke, we hypothesize that repeated bouts of IPC during the first days to months following stroke (when the majority of recovery occurs) will make traditional rehabilitation strategies more effective.</brief_summary>
