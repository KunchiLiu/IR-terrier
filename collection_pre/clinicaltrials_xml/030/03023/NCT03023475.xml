	<brief_summary>Endoscopic radial artery harvesting in coronary bypass surgery is routinely performed by the investigators. In this study, the investigators want to compare the MiFusion TLS2 (Endotrust GmbH, Germany) device to the LigaSure Maryland Jaw (Medtronic, USA). The vessel harvesting is performed in the standard fashion according to the institutional routine. The patients are randomized preoperatively to one of the devices. The proximal end of the radial artery will be preserved and deep-frozen for histological assessment. Endothelial integrity will be investigated using Hematoxylin-Eosin, CD31 and endothelial nitrogen monoxide synthase.</brief_summary>
