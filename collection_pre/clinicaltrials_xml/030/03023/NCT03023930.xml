	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of (1) Implementation Facilitation (IF) on rates of provision of Emergency Department (ED)-initiated buprenorphine/naloxone (BUP) treatment with referral for ongoing medication-assisted treatment (MAT) and the (2) effectiveness of IF on patient engagement in formal addiction treatment at 30 days.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Opioid Use Disorder in the Emergency Department: CTN 0069</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study uses a Hybrid Type 3 Effectiveness-Implementation framework and a modified stepped wedge design. The study will be conducted at four EDs with a high prevalence of patients with untreated opioid use disorder (OUD). The four sites will receive the same sequence of evaluations and interventions: the baseline evaluation period after the standard dissemination practice, the IF phase, and continuation of facilitation into the IF evaluation period. The timing of initiation of the study activities at each site will be randomly offset by ~ 3 month increments to accommodate logistical constraints of simultaneous implementation at all sites. The study populations will include (1) ED providers and staff involved in the treatment of patients with OUD; (2) Community opioid treatment provider and program staff involved in providing care for patients with OUD referred from the ED; and (3) ED patients with moderate to severe OUD.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patient Patients who are treated in the ED during study screening hours with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM)5 criteria for moderate to severe OUD and provide an opioid positive urine sample will be eligible to participate. Patient Patients who test positive for fentanyl only are not eligible due to lack of uniformly available rapid urine tests. Patients will be excluded if they have a medical or psychiatric condition requiring hospitalization at the index ED visit, are acutely suicidal or severely cognitively impaired precluding informed consent, present from an extended care facility, require continued prescription opioids for a pain condition, are a prisoner or in police custody at time of index ED visit, are currently (past 30 days) enrolled in formal addiction treatment including by court order, are unable to provide 2 contact numbers, are unwilling to follow study procedures, have been previously enrolled in the current study or do not speak English. ED and Community Participants ED and community providers and administrators (i.e. physicians, residents, fellows, nursing, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, pharmacists, social workers, counselors, administrative directors, officebased physicians and opioid treatment program representatives) as well as ED patients with OUD.</criteria>
