	<brief_title>HPV Antibody Response After GARDASIL 9 Vaccination in Participants After Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>If participant agrees to take part in this study, about 6-12 months after their stem cell transplant: - Participant will receive Gardasil as 3 injections at 3 separate timepoints under the skin in the arm or thigh. Participant will receive the vaccinations at about 6 months (+/- 8 weeks) after the stem cell transplant, then again about 2 months after the first injection, and then again about 4 months after the second injection. - Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn to test for HPV antibodies before the first vaccination, and again at 1 month and 6 months after that. HPV antibodies are created by the immune system and may protect participant against infections such as HPV-related disease in the future. Participant will be given a dosing diary to record any side effects after each vaccination. Follow-Up: Participant will be called within 3 days after each vaccination and asked about how they are doing and about any side effects. If the doctor thinks it is needed, participant will visit the clinic for a physical exam. Length of Study: Participant will receive up to 3 vaccinations. Participant will not receive all 3 vaccinations if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if they are unable to follow study directions. Participation on this study will be over after participant's last follow-up phone call (within 3 days after their third vaccination). This is an investigational study. Gardasil is FDA approved and commercially available for the prevention of HPV infection and HPV-related disease. Studying the effectiveness of Gardasil after patients have received a stem cell transplant is considered investigational. The study staff can explain how Gardasil is designed to work. Up to 48 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>
