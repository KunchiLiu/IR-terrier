	<brief_title>Effects and Mechanisms of n-3 PUFAs and Irisin on the Incidence of Abnormal Glucose Metabolism After GDM</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is an important risk factor for type 2 diabetes in women. Studies have shown that n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) are associated with improving insulin resistance and prevent type 2 diabetes in the general population; a newly discovered myokine, irisin, is associated with reduced insulin resistance and plays an important role in human glucose metabolism; and results from cell studies suggested that n-3 PUFA might increase the expression of irisin. Therefore, the investigators hypothesize that n-3 PUFA could improve glucose metabolism via the IRS-1/PI3K/AKT insulin signaling pathway by increasing expression of irisin and thus improving postpartum glucose metabolism in women with GDM. In order to test this hypothesis, the investigators plan to establish a prospective GDM cohort and collect related information at 24-28 weeks' gestation, 42 days postpartum, 1 year postpartum and 2 years postpartum, respectively. Then the following would be tested: the changes of n-3 PUFA and irisin during pregnancy and after delivery, and their association with postpartum abnormal glucose metabolism; and the correlation of n-3 PUFA and irisin. Furthermore, using a cell model of insulin resistance the investigators would examine the dose-response and time-response relationships between n-3 PUFA and irisin, and next explore the role of irisin in n-3 PUFA regulation of IRS-1/PI3K/AKT insulin signaling pathway. This study would help to clarify the relationship between n-3 PUFA and irisin in regulating the glucose metabolism, and might provide scientific evidence for the prevention of type 2 diabetes after GDM.</detailed_description>
