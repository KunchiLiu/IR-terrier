	<brief_summary>A new conceptual regional anesthesia the PECs II block (modified pectoral and serratus nerves block) has been described for pain control after thoracic surgery, one of the indications to perform this method is analgesia for surgeries or procedures involving lateral chest wall</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pectoralis and Serratus Nerves Block in Thoracic Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The PECs I block was found to be very effective after breast cancer surgery and sub-pectoral prosthesis for pain control management. This block is provided by injection into another myofascial plane, this time between pectoralis minor and serratus anterior muscle at the level of 3rd and 4th rib.PECs II block is simple in performance with a high success rate and minimal incidence of complications, especially, if used ultrasound approach that gives a good understanding of anatomy of the lateral thoracic wall. In present clinical trial we are going to compare PECs block for pain control with traditional pain management techniques based on IV opioids and NSAIDs treatment in patient undergoing thoracic surgery in early postoperative period.</detailed_description>
