	<brief_summary>This study aims to provide intravenous paritcalcitol treatment for the sick and poor hemodialysis patients with severe secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) resistant to existing vitamin D analogs therapy or with hypercalcemia precluding the use of existing vitamin D analogs. The study aims to evaluate the effect of paricalcitol on control of SHPT, biochemical parameters of chronic kidney disease-mineral bone disease, cardiac parameters, vascular calcification and stiffness parameters and nutrition status in patients receiving chronic hemodialysis treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intravenous Paricalcitol in Chronic Hemodialysis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a 2-year single-arm intervention study of which intravenous paricalcitol will be provided as a second-line treatment to 30 chronic hemodialysis patients with severe SHPT (defined as intact parathyroid hormone [iPTH] ≥ 800pg/mL) resistant to existing vitamin D analogs treatment (including rocaltrol and alfacalcidol) or with hypercalcemia (defined as serum calcium ≥2.56mmol/L) precluding the use of existing vitamin D analogs. The study aims to evaluate the control of SHPT, various biochemical parameters of chronic kidney disease-mineral bone disease, left ventricular mass and volumes, vascular calcification and stiffness parameters, handgrip strength and serum albumin with the use of intravenous paricalcitol in patients receiving chronic hemodialysis treatment.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Chronic hemodialysis patients with severe SHPT (defined as iPTH ≥ 800pg/mL) resistant to rocaltrol or alfacalcidol (defined as iPTH not controlled in the range between 2 9 times of lab upper limit reference). Chronic hemodialysis patients with severe SHPT and at the same time hypercalcemia (defined as serum calcium ≥2.56mmol/L) but still &lt; 2.8mmol/L precluding the use of rocaltrol or alfacalcidol but still feasible to use paricalcitol. Patients with metastatic malignancy, Patients with extremely poor general condition (eg. bedbound) and expected lifespan is below 6 months</criteria>
