	<brief_title>Management of Post Endodontic Re-treatment Pain With Lowâ€‘Level Laser Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this clinical trial, 61 patients requiring endodontic retreatments in the posterior teeth were selected. A single visit Endodontic retreatment was done. After biomechanical preparation, Low Level Laser was irradiated to the buccal and lingual mucosa overlying the apices of the target tooth in the experimental group. In the control group patients received placebo laser to eliminate the probable psychological effects of laser. Laser irradiation was done with a single dose of 808 nm wavelength (Whitening Lase II- Laser DMC, Samsung, Korea) with 100 mw power, and dose of 70 J/cm2 for 80 seconds. Pain severity was recorded before the treatment, immediately after the treatment and 4, 8, 12, 24 and 48 hours after the treatment by visual analogue scale (VAS). The pain scores were statistically analyzed by chi-square test between two groups. The effects of different variables on the post-operative pain experience were also studied by means of Logistic regression.</detailed_description>
