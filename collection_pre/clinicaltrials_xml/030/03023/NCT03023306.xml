	<brief_summary>Female patients aged between 20 and 70 years, ASA physical status I-II, and scheduled for thyroidectomy under general anaesthesia will be enrolled in the study. Patients will be randomized to the preemptive group to receive an antiemetic regime the day before surgery or to the intraoperative group to receive the same antiemetic drugs in the same doses intraoperatively. In the operating room standard monitoring and a standardized anesthetic technique will be implemented in all patients. Nausea, vomiting, retching and PONV (cumulative) will be recorded immediately after extubation and six hourly thereafter for the first 24 hours. Pain scores assessed by VAS (verbal analogue scale) will be recorded at the same time points. Also, if patients received fluids and solid food by mouth.</brief_summary>
