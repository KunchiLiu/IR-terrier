Evaluation measures were diabetes knowledge, medication adherence, and hospital admissions plus emergency department visits at and/or 3months before baseline and at 2 weeks and 3 months post-discharge. There was improvement in diabetes knowledge and medication adherence, which was sustained to 3 months. A trend was observed toward reduction in emergency department and/or hospital admissions from 3 months pre-intervention to 3 months post-discharge for uncontrolled diabetes.
