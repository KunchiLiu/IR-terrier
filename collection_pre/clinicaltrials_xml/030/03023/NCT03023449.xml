	<brief_summary>This study is a non-randomized, Phase 2 clinical trial designed to measure the cerebral blood flow (CBF) response to inhaled nitric oxide in acute ischemic stroke patients and healthy subjects. The monitoring is a 35 minute session during which cerebral hemodynamics will be monitored with both diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS) and transcranial doppler ultrasonography (TCD) while blood pressure, heart rate, cardiac output, respiratory rate, end oxygen saturation, and inhaled nitric oxide (NO)/nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentration, are continuously monitored.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Stroke Patients: 1. Age greater than 18 2. Acute ischemic stroke in the territory of the anterior, middle, or posterior cerebral artery, on either side of the brain 3. Study can be initiated within 72 hours of stroke symptom onset 3. Ability and willingness to sign informed consent Healthy subjects: 1. Age greater than 18 2. Ability and willingness to sign informed consent Stroke subjects: 1. History of prior stroke or transient ischemic attack 2. Known cerebrovascular abnormality 3. History of congestive heart failure 4. Presence of pneumonia or active pulmonary infection 5. Current use of any NO donor medication (sodium nitroprusside or nitroglycerin) 6. Age less than 18 years 7. Skull defect that would interfere with CBF monitoring 8. Pregnancy 9. Structural brain lesion 10. Prior neurosurgical procedure 11. History of psychiatric disease 12.
