	<brief_summary>Macular schisis associated with macular detachment is a one of the complications of high myopia. There is controversy in the primary treatment for this situation. This study will compare the effects of macular buckling + gas injection versus vitrectomy + internal limiting membrane peeling + gas tamponade in a cohort of highly myopic eyes with macular retinal detachment associated with macular hole.</brief_summary>
