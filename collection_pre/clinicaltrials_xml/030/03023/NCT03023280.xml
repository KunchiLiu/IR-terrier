	<brief_summary>Symptomatic heterotopic gastric mucosa also known as cervical inlet patch (CIP) may be present in varying shapes and causes symptoms of laryngopharyngeal reflux like globus sensations, hoarseness and chronic cough. Unfortunately, argon plasma coagulation, standard treatment of small symptomatic CIP, is limited for large heterotopic gastric mucosa due to concerns of stricture formation. Therefore, the investigators aimed to investigate the effect of radiofrequency ablation (RFA), a novel minimal-invasive ablation method, in the treatment of large symptomatic CIP.</brief_summary>
