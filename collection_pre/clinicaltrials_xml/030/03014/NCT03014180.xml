	<brief_title>Clinical Evaluation of LEft VEntricular Auto Threshold Alogrithm (LEVEA)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>"In-Clinic LVAT" feature is a non CE-marked feature designed to be activated by the physician during 2 hospital follow-ups: - first visit: planned to be conducted 15 days maximum after inclusion - second visit: planned to be conducted between 1 and 3 months after the first visit The evaluation consists in the comparison between the threshold value provided by the algorithm and the threshold value obtained manually by the physician.</detailed_description>
