	<brief_summary>Hypercytokinemia contributes a major role in the pathogenesis and is associated with the high mortality in sepsis-related acute kidney injury(AKI). This pilot randomized controlled trial was conducted in sepsis-related AKI patients to compare the efficacy of cytokine removal including interleukin(IL)-6, IL-8, IL-10, and tumor necrotic factor(TNF)-α by six-hour SLED-f between using HCO dialyzer(HCO-SLED-f) and HF dialyzer(HF-SLED-f).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Cytokine Clearance Between SLED-f Using High Cut-off Dialyzer and High-flux Dialyzer in Septic AKI Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypercytokinemia contributes a major role in the pathogenesis and is associated with the high mortality in sepsis-related acute kidney injury(AKI). Reductions of these cytokines have been reported to improve clinical outcomes. Online sustained low-efficiency diafiltration(SLED-f) using traditional high-flux(HF) dialyzer could remove some cytokines. Interestingly, the potential of enhancing cytokine removal by using newly designed high cut-off(HCO) dialyzer that could theoretically remove larger molecular weight solutes has never been studied in SLED-f before.This pilot randomized controlled trial was conducted in sepsis-related AKI patients to compare the efficacy of cytokine removal including interleukin(IL)-6, IL-8, IL-10, and tumor necrotic factor(TNF)-α by six-hour SLED-f between using HCO dialyzer(HCO-SLED-f,n=8) and HF dialyzer(HF-SLED-f,n=8).</detailed_description>
