	<brief_title>Posterior Maxillary Ridge Augmentation With Sinus Lift Using Mineralized Plasmatic Matrix Versus Autogenous Bone Graft</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To study the effectiveness of MPM in ridge augmentation with implant insertion compared with autogenous bone graft. -PICO Population(P) : Patients with defective posterior maxillary alveolar ridge. Intervention (I) :Implant placement and ridge augmentation with MPM. Comparator (C) : Autogenous bone graft. Outcome (O) : Patient satisfaction - Implant stability.</detailed_description>
