	<brief_title>Efficacy of Two Vaginal Solutions in Preoperative Use</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It is well known from the literature that the use of Povidone-iodone based solution for vaginal preparation before surgery is fraught with side effects and sensitivity, and often does not provide sufficient eradication of colonies of pathogens from the operation field. It is also known that Chlorhexidine gluconate in low concentration provides a better result and does not cause side effects more than Povidone-iodone, but the chlorhexidine is still not approved for washing the mucous membranes. This study is necessary in order to provide proof of its effectiveness and safety.</detailed_description>
