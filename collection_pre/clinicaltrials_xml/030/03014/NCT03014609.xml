	<brief_summary>The principal objective of the study is to measure parameters of inflammation, oxidative stress, and vascular, respiratory, and peripheral muscle function parameters, and identify parameters indicative of evolving cardiovascular risk (CVR) in COPD patients, using multivariate analysis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cardiovascular Risk and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Reduced lung function is a major risk factor for cardiovascular mortality (CV), regardless of age, sex and history of smoking. Similarly, CV events are known causes of mortality in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The investigators propose to determine the parameters influencing the evolution of CV risk in a cohort of COPD patients followed over 5 years. For this the investigators will study the role of inflammation, oxidative stress, and vascular, respiratory and peripheral muscle function parameters. In order to study a sufficient number of patients the investigators propose to group data from two cohorts: a first cohort of 121 COPD patients that already exists (currently closed to inclusions but still undergoing follow-up (NCT00404430)) and a new cohort of 150, decompensated or not, COPD patients. This study is of major scientific interest and will enable to obtain extremely important information to better understand COPD.</detailed_description>
