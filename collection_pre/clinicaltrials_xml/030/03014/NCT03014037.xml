	<brief_summary>Musculoskeletal conditions are common sources of pain. Specifically, osteoarthritis affects nearly 27 million people in the United States. This disease leads to the breakdown of the cartilage surfaces of the joints, which serve as the connection points between the bones of the body, causing a large amount of pain and disability in patients. Increasing the number of available treatment options for osteoarthritis is becoming increasingly more important as Americans continue to age. Using stem cells taken from bone marrow is one of the non-operative treatments that has been gaining popularity in the recent past. This study aims to clarify how this procedure should best be done by comparing stem cell concentrations and patient outcomes (short and long term) in patients who have stem cells taken from one area vs two (unilateral vs bilateral posterior superior iliac spine (PSIS) aspirations).</brief_summary>

This disease leads to the breakdown of the cartilage surfaces of the joints, which serve as the connection points between the bones of the body, causing a large amount of pain and disability in patients.

This study aims to clarify how this procedure should best be done by comparing stem cell concentrations and patient outcomes (short and long term) in patients who have stem cells taken from one area vs two (unilateral vs bilateral posterior superior iliac spine (PSIS) aspirations). This research study involves the participant being randomly placed into one of two groups; one group will have cells taken from one hip, and the other will have cells taken from both hips. Both of these approaches are performed in clinics currently, and both are considered to be standard of care. All bone marrow collected for the purposes of this study will be obtained by the principal investigator while performing the standard procedure. In obtaining these sample the physicians will abide by the standard of care set forth for the Bone Marrow Aspiration Concentrate procedure.</detailed_description>
