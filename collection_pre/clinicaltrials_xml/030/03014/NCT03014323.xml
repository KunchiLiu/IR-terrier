	<brief_title>Racial Differences in Vagal Control of Glucose Homeostasis, Chronic Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Investigators will test the hypothesis that chronic restoration of parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) activity with a central acetylcholinesterase inhibitor improves insulin sensitivity and reduces adipose tissue oxidation in obese African American women (AAW) compared to white women (WW). A cross-over study will be performed in matched cohorts of AAW and white women subjected to chronic central acetylcholinesterase inhibition with galantamine versus placebo, given orally over a 4-week period. Insulin sensitivity will be measured using the gold standard hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp. Adipose tissue will be obtained through subcutaneous fat biopsies where F2-isoprostanes will be quantified.</detailed_description>
