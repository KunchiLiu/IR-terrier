	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the clinical and functional outcomes of patients with mild to moderate arthroscopically confirmed osteoarthritis between the following two groups: 1. Partial fat pad harvest with Adipose-Derived Stem Cell (ADSC) transplantation with standard arthroscopic treatment consisting of: partial meniscectomy, cartilage stabilization, loose body removal and selective synovectomy. 2. Standard arthroscopic treatment (above) with out cell transplant.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect of Adipose-Derived Stem Cells for Knee Osteoarthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Adipose-derived stem cells (ADSC) may be beneficial to patients with OA because they may differentiate into chondrocytes, promote endogenous tissue repair, and have potent anti-inflammatory properties. Early studies show promising clinical results using ADSCs to treat patients with osteoarthritis, but no clinical trials have been completed comparing cellular therapy to standard arthroscopic treatment. The investigators aim to determine whether ADSC transplantation as adjuvant therapy in patients with arthroscopic findings of mild to moderate arthritis will result in improved clinical outcomes scores at one and two-year follow-up compared to standard arthroscopic treatment.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age between 35 and 70 yearsold Patient is scheduled to undergo one or a combination of the following procedures: Meniscal debridement or partial menisectomy Meniscal repair that does not necessitate a different postoperative protocol from meniscal debridement or partial menisectomy Removal of loose bodies Chondroplasty Synovectomy Soft tissue releases for flexion or extension contracture. Diagnosis of preexisting mild to moderate osteoarthritis of the medial or lateral femoral condyle (KellgrenLawrence Grade 2 or 3) &lt; 6 months of knee pain or &lt; 6 months of a significant exacerbation of existing knee pain Physical examination findings consistent with the proposed surgical procedure. Failure of conservative therapy consisting of a minimum of 6 weeks of physical therapy and trial of antiinflammatory medications, with or without concomitant bracing and/or injections Age &lt; 35 or &gt; 70 years old Radiographs demonstrating either no, little or severe osteoarthritis (KellgrenLawrence Grade 0, 1 or 4) Previous injury or surgery to the infrapatellar fat pad (assessed by MRI) Patient scheduled to undergo any concomitant surgical procedures with the exception of: Meniscal debridement or partial menisectomy Meniscal repair that does not necessitate a different postoperative protocol from meniscal debridement or partial menisectomy Removal of loose bodies Chondroplasty Synovectomy Soft tissue releases for flexion or extension contracture Prior surgery on ipsilateral knee involving cartilage regeneration (microfracture, Autologous Chondrocyte Implantation, etc) or meniscal transplant/implant Previous arthroscopy within 1 year Subchondral edema</criteria>
