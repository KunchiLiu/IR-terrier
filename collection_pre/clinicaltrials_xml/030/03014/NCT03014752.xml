	<brief_summary>Epilepsy is one of a common neurological disorder. Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are usually the primary treatment of epilepsy. However, almost 30% of patients do not respond to AEDs and other treatments including ketogenic diet (KD) are used. The Ketogenic Diet (KD) is a low-carbohydrate, high fat, adequate-protein diet. In this study, investigators are going to compare two kinds of the ketogenic diet namely classical ketogenic diet and modified Atkins diet. Fifty children and adolescents with intractable epilepsy will be included, 25 patients in each group, and will receive the diet for three months on non-randomised basis. In the classical ketogenic diet, the diet with a ratio of 4 to 1 (4:1), each 4 grams of fat to each gram of carbohydrate plus protein, will be introduced. Classical ketogenic diet will be established on outpatient setting, without fasting and gradually. The modified Atkins diet will be applied by the ratio of 1:1 or 2:1, each 1 or 2 grams of fat to each gram of carbohydrate plus protein.</brief_summary>
