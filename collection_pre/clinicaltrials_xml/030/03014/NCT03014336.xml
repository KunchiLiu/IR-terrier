	<brief_summary>The drawbacks of chemical CO2 absorbers include the production of compounds harmful to patients that also lead into increased cost and environmental impact, as well as the daily disposal of compound special waste. Sustainable management of general anesthesia is a growing concern. Continually diluting anesthetic circuits, and the disposal of chemical granulate are serious environmental problems.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A New and Innovative Method for CO2 Removal in Anesthetic Circuits: Replacing Chemical Granulate</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>DMF Medical has developed a next-generation CO2 filter in order to address the safety issues with current chemical CO2 absorbers in anesthesia. memsorb uses patented advanced medical membrane technology to filter CO2 from anesthetic circuits rather than absorbing via a chemical reaction. This game changing technology relies on a polymeric membrane core (similar to the ones used in oxygenators for cardiac surgery) that selectively allows CO2 to leave the rebreathing system, while maintaining the anesthetic vapor in the circuit. memsorb is a cartridge similar in size and shape to current solutions that simply clicks in place.</detailed_description>
