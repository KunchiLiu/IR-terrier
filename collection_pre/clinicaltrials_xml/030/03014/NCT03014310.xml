	<brief_summary>This is a Phase I cohort-randomized, double-blind, controlled trial designed to assess the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of a monovalent inactivated influenza A/H5N8 virus vaccine administered at different dosages (3.75 and 15 mcg of HA per dose) given with or without AS03 or MF59 adjuvants. This study will be conducted at 6 sites and enroll 150 (up to 380) males and non-pregnant females, 19 to 64 years old, inclusive who are in good health and meet all eligibility criteria. The entire study duration is approximately 24 months and each subject participation duration is approximately 13 months. The primary objectives are: 1) To assess the safety and reactogenicity of a monovalent inactivated influenza A/H5N8 virus vaccine following receipt of two doses administered intramuscularly at different dosages (3.75 and 15 mcg of HA per dose) given with or without AS03 or MF59 adjuvants approximately 21 days apart. 2) To assess the serum HAI and Neut antibody responses to a monovalent inactivated influenza A/H5N8 virus vaccine following receipt of two doses administered intramuscularly at different dosages (3.75 and 15 mcg of HA per dose) given with or without AS03 or MF59 adjuvants approximately 21 days apart.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is a Phase I cohort-randomized, double-blind, controlled trial designed to assess the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of a monovalent inactivated influenza A/H5N8 virus vaccine manufactured by bioCSL administered at different dosages (3.75 and 15 mcg of HA per dose) given with or without AS03 or MF59 adjuvants manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals (GSK) and Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics (NVD), respectively. This study will be conducted at 6 VTEU sites and enroll 150 (up to 380) males and non-pregnant females, 19 to 64 years old, inclusive who are in good health and meet all eligibility criteria. The entire study duration is approximately 24 months and subject participation duration is approximately 13 months. Subjects will be enrolled in one of two cohorts, and within each cohort subjects will be randomized in a 2:2:1 ratio. Subjects in Cohort 1 will be randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatment arms to receive two doses of the A/H5N8 vaccine at varying antigen dosages (3.75 or 15 mcg HA) with AS03 (30-76 subjects per treatment arm), or to a comparator arm receiving two doses of the A/H5N8 vaccine (15 mcg HA) without adjuvant (15-38 subjects). Subjects in Cohort 2 will be randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatment arms to receive two doses of the A/H5N8 vaccine at varying antigen dosages (3.75 or 15 mcg HA) with MF59 (30-76 subjects per treatment arm), or to a comparator arm receiving two doses of the A/H5N8 vaccine (15 mcg HA) without adjuvant (15-38 subjects). All subjects will receive the same dosage of vaccine with or without the same adjuvant at both of their first and second study vaccinations, with the exception that subjects in Cohort 1 who do not receive Vaccination 2 prior to February 28, 2017 will receive a second unadjuvanted vaccination with the same antigen dosage as their randomized assignment. All doses will be administered intramuscularly approximately 21 days apart. Primary objectives are: 1) To assess the safety and reactogenicity of a monovalent inactivated influenza A/H5N8 virus vaccine following receipt of two doses administered intramuscularly at different dosages (3.75 and 15 mcg of HA per dose) given with or without AS03 or MF59 adjuvants approximately 21 days apart. 2) To assess the serum HAI and Neut antibody responses to a monovalent inactivated influenza A/H5N8 virus vaccine following receipt of two doses administered intramuscularly at different dosages (3.75 and 15 mcg of HA per dose) given with or without AS03 or MF59 adjuvants approximately 21 days apart. Secondary objectives are: 1) To assess study vaccine-related unsolicited non-serious AEs following receipt of two doses of a monovalent inactivated influenza A/H5N8 virus vaccine administered intramuscularly at different dosages (3.75 and 15 mcg of HA per dose) given with or without AS03 or MF59 adjuvants approximately 21 days apart. 2) To assess medically-attended adverse events (MAAEs), including new-onset chronic medical conditions (NOCMCs), and potentially immune-mediated medical conditions (PIMMCs) following receipt of two doses of a monovalent inactivated influenza A/H5N8 virus vaccine administered intramuscularly at different dosages (3.75 and 15 mcg of HA per dose) given with or without AS03 or MF59 adjuvants approximately 21 days apart. 3) To assess the serum HAI and Neut antibody responses to a monovalent inactivated influenza A/H5N8 virus vaccine following receipt of one dose administered intramuscularly at different dosages (3.75 and 15 mcg of HA per dose) given with or without AS03 or MF59 adjuvants.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Provide written informed consent prior to initiation of any study procedures. 2. Are able to understand and comply with planned study procedures and be available for all study visits. 3. Are males or nonpregnant females, 19 to 64 years old, inclusive. 4. Are in good health. As determined by medical history and physical examination to evaluate acute or currently ongoing chronic medical diagnoses or conditions, defined as those that have been present for at least 90 days, that would affect the assessment of the safety of subjects or the immunogenicity of study vaccinations. Chronic medical diagnoses or conditions should be stable for the last 60 days. This includes no change in chronic prescription medication, dose, or frequency as a result of deterioration of the chronic medical diagnosis or condition in the 60 days prior to enrollment. Any prescription change that is due to change of health care provider, insurance company, etc., or that is done for financial reasons, as long as in the same class of medication, will not be considered a deviation of this inclusion criterion. Any change in prescription medication due to improvement of a disease outcome, as determined by the site principal investigator or appropriate subinvestigator, will not be considered a deviation of this inclusion criterion. Subjects may be on chronic or as needed (prn) medications if, in the opinion of the site principal investigator or appropriate subinvestigator, they pose no additional risk to subject safety or assessment of reactogenicity and immunogenicity and do not indicate a worsening of medical diagnosis or condition. Similarly, medication changes subsequent to enrollment and study vaccination are acceptable provided there was no deterioration in the subject's chronic medical condition that necessitated a medication change, and there is no additional risk to the subject or interference with the evaluation of responses to study vaccination. Note: Topical, nasal, and inhaled medications (with the exception of inhaled corticosteroids as outlined in the Subject Exclusion Criteria (see Section 5.1.2), herbals, vitamins, and supplements are permitted. 5. Oral temperature is less than 100.0°F. 6. Pulse is 50 to 115 bpm, inclusive. 7. Systolic blood pressure is 85 to 150 mmHg, inclusive. 8. Diastolic blood pressure is 55 to 95 mmHg, inclusive. 9.

Have any medical disease or condition that, in the opinion of the site principal investigator or appropriate subinvestigator, is a contraindication to study participation. Including acute or chronic medical disease or condition, defined as persisting for at least 90 days, that would place the subject at an unacceptable risk of injury, render the subject unable to meet the requirements of the protocol, or may interfere with the evaluation of responses or the subject's successful completion of this trial. 3.
