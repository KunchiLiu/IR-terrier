	<brief_summary>Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor dysfunction, cognitive impairment, and other non-motor symptoms. Here, we propose to use "Bio Electro Stimulation Therapy" (B.E.S.T.) using the "e-Tapper TT-R1"owned by Immumax International Co. Ltd., a Hong Kong based company. The "e-Tapper" is a non-invasive, handheld electronic device designed to apply micro current stimulation to a person's hand at specified points representing various body parts, such as the head, leg, or foot. This is one form of Bio Electro Stimulation Therapy, known as "11-point Hand Treatment System". The current delivered is less than one milliampere. Anecdotal evidence suggests that this micro current stimulation may reduce resting tremor, restore facial expressions, and improve ease of movement, mood, and sleep quality in patients with PD. Scientific evidence for the effectiveness of the B.E.S.T. Hand Therapy appears to be lacking in the English language (Western) literature. The goal of this pilot study is to examine whether B.E.S.T. can increase physical activity and functional fitness, enhance cognition, improve mood and subjective sleep quality, and modulate resting tremor and gait parameters in PD patients over a 6-week period.</brief_summary>
