	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if cannabidiol is safe and effective at different doses as an additional treatment for pediatric drug-resistant epilepsy. Pure cannabidiol has potentially therapeutic properties, such as anti-convulsant effects, that may reduce seizure frequency. There are only a few open label studies that have demonstrated the safety and tolerance of cannabiodiol in both adult and pediatric epileptic populations--these studies were performed either retrospectively or with varying cannabidiol preparations. There are no well-documented studies and completely analyzed data for pediatric epileptic patients.</brief_summary>
