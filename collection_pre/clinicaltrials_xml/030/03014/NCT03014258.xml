	<brief_summary>This is a phase I study that will assess the acquisition of immunity to Pf malaria over the course of 4 sequential Controlled Human Malaria Infections (CHMI) over 3 years, in 10 healthy adult participants. The study is expected to last for 48 months and will include 28 healthy male and female volunteers (10 study volunteers and 18 naïve controls to confirm Pf infectivity during the 2nd -4th CHMI challenges) ages18 to 45 years, inclusive, from the greater Baltimore community. The primary objective of this study is to determine whether protective immunity against parasite infection develops following repeat CHMI.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is a phase I study that will assess the acquisition of immunity to Pf malaria over the course of 4 sequential Controlled Human Malaria Infections (CHMI) over 3 years, in 10 healthy adult participants. 10 subjects will initially be challenged with 5 uninfected mosquitoes (mock), followed by 4 challenges with 5 mosquitoes infected with drug sensitive, P. falciparum parasites (strain NF54) 2, 8, 20, and 32 months later. For the final three infective CMHIs six additional immunologic malaria-naïve subjects will be enrolled and challenged as infectivity controls. All volunteers (repeat CHMI subjects and infectivity controls) will be evaluated as part of an inpatient stay to diagnose Pf malaria infection and treat with Coartem® (artemether/lumefantrine) or Malarone® (Atovaquone/proguanil). Inpatient observation will occur from Study Days 9-19 or until three-day directly observed therapy for P. falciparum infection is complete and two negative smears separated by a time interval &gt;12 hours have been documented. A third negative smear &gt;12 hours after the previous two inpatient smears will be documented to affirm malaria cure. The repeat CHMI subjects will have additional outpatient visits days 1, 3, 5, and 7 after the challenge to obtain blood samples to monitor the development of immunity. The study is expected to last for 48 months and will include 28 healthy male and female volunteers (10 study volunteers and 18 naïve controls to confirm Pf infectivity during the 2nd -4th CHMI challenges) ages18 to 45 years, inclusive, from the greater Baltimore community. The primary objective of this study is to determine whether protective immunity against parasite infection develops following repeat CHMI. The secondary objectives are to: 1) determine whether clinical signs and symptoms of malaria decrease in intensity and duration following repeat CHMI, 2) identify which PBMCs are activated and proliferate after each exposure to compare responses over time and to sequential CHMI, 3) track the production of antibodies that react with P. falciparum sporozoites and blood stage parasites.</detailed_description>

Women with a history of amenorrhea (&gt; 1 year duration) or surgical or chemical sterilization (e.g. tubal ligation, hysterectomy, other) must provide written documentation of infertility from a health care provider). 1. Women who are breastfeeding or planning to become pregnant during the time interval needed to complete the study. 2. Receipt of a malaria vaccine in a prior clinical trial. 3.

Known history of anaphylactic response to mosquitobites; or known allergy to artemether lumefantrine or atovaquone or proguanil or other component of the product. 8. Participation in any study involving investigational vaccine or drug within 12 weeks prior to enrollment, or plan to participate in another investigational vaccine/drug research during the study. 9. Use or planned use of any drug with antimalarial activity that would coincide with challenge. 10. Anticipated use of medications known to cause drug reactions with atovaquoneproguanil (Malarone®) such as cimetidine, metoclopramide, antacids, and kaolin. 11.
