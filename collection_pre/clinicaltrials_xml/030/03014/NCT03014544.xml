	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the psychometric properties (performance validity) of 8 individual cognitive tests in a computer-administered cognitive test battery intended for the assessment of cognitive function in participants with major depressive disorder (MDD) either in partial or full remission against 8 corresponding standard, non-reference, examinerâ€‘administered cognitive tests.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>a) Substudy A and Main Study: Primary diagnosis of Major depressive disorder (MDD) in partial or full remission, made or confirmed by the investigator according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders5 (DSM5) criteria Demonstrated an adequate clinical response within the past 12 months, and is currently maintaining this response, to a stable oral antidepressant treatment regimen of no more than 2 Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), Serotoninnorepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), or bupropion antidepressants, without any dosing changes for the most recent 6 weeks. The dose and duration of treatment will be documented by the investigator using the Massachusetts General Hospital Antidepressant Treatment Response Questionnaire (MGHATRQ) and verified against the available medical and pharmacy records Required to have a MontgomeryAsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score of less than or equal (&lt;=)17 at screening and baseline (Test Day 1) visits as well as less than or equal (&lt;=)19 during subsequent testing days (main study). Participants are also required to have a Clinical Global Impression Severity (CGIS) total score of &lt;=3 during testing days (main study) Must have normal visual and hearing acuity as determined during physical examination b) Substudy B (Healthy Participants): Must be healthy on the basis of physical examination, vital signs examination, and medical history performed at screening. This determination must be recorded in the participant's source documents and initialed by the investigator Body mass index (weight [kilogram (kg)]/height^2 [meter (m)]^2) between 18 and 30 kg/m2 (inclusive) Blood pressure (after the participant is sitting for 5 minutes) between 90 and 140 millimeter of mercury (mmHg) inclusive, systolic, and no higher than 90 mmHg diastolic Must sign an Informed consent form (ICF) indicating that he or she understands the purpose of, and procedures required for, the study and is willing to participate in the study a) Substudy A and Main Study: Has any of the following acute or chronic psychiatric conditions, according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders5 (DSM5) criteria: Major depressive disorder (MDD) with psychotic features (lifetime), bipolar disorder (including lifetime diagnosis), obsessivecompulsive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, borderline personality disorder, anorexia nervosa, schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or minor and major neurocognitive disorders (including dementia) History of any acute or chronic neurological condition (for example (eg), stroke, epilepsy, Parkinson's disease) b) Substudy B (Healthy Participants): History of drug or alcohol abuse, with a severity of at least moderate or severe, according to DSM5 criteria, within 6 months before screening or positive test result(s) for alcohol or drugs of abuse (including barbiturates, opiates, cocaine, cannabinoids, amphetamines and benzodiazepines) at screening Participant has clinically significant liver or renal insufficiency; cardiac, vascular, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, endocrine, neurologic, hematologic, rheumatologic, psychiatric, or metabolic disturbances. A significant primary sleep disorder is exclusionary, including primary insomnia and hypersomnia, narcolepsy, breathingrelated sleep disorders, circadianrhythm sleep disorders, and dyssomnias not otherwise specified Has any condition for which, in the opinion of the investigator, participation would not be in the best interest of the participant (for example, compromise the wellbeing) or that could prevent, limit, or confound the protocolspecified assessments</criteria>
