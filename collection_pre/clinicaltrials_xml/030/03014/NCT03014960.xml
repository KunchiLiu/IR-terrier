	<brief_title>Effects of Leader Sleep Improvement on Leadership</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators seek to extend the findings of a recent research which demonstrated that treating insomnia has several beneficial effects on employee work outcomes (Barnes, Miller, &amp; Bostock, in press). In the present study, the investigators propose that the treatment of leader insomnia would beneficially influence leadership, specifically abusive supervision, charismatic leadership, and laissez-faire leadership.</detailed_description>
