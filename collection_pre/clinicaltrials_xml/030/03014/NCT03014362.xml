	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if the use of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) provides rapid reduction and sustained attenuation of suicidal crisis. TMS is a treatment for suicidal crisis that is quicker, less invasive, better tolerated, and with fewer side effects than current treatments such as Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT) and medication therapies. There will be 6 months of follow-up, in order to establish the ongoing and lasting therapeutic effect of TMS.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>TMS for Suicidal Crisis in Active Duty SMs</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The programmatic-level objective of the study is to address the goals of the Army STARRS Program and the Suicide Prevention for America's Veterans Act through implementation of an effective acute treatment for patients psychiatrically admitted in suicidal crisis as well as other patients at high-risk for suicide. This is achieved by application of TMS, which provides a treatment for suicidal crisis that is quicker, less invasive, better tolerated, and with fewer side effects and less incapacitation than current treatments such as ECT and pharmacologic therapies. A recent study led by the senior consultant of this proposal demonstrated tolerance and efficacy for a new, high-dose regimen of TMS in a VA population with an average age of 47. The objective of the proposed study is to extend the application of TMS to a younger population of Active Duty Service Members (SM) in order to demonstrate efficacy for returning veterans of the Middle East wars, in particular, as well as the civilian young adult population. TMS dosage in the proposed study is recalibrated to commercially-standard levels in order to provide consistency with devices currently in clinical operation. In addition, follow-up in the proposed study continues for 6 months in order to establish persistence and durability of the therapeutic effect of TMS.</detailed_description>
