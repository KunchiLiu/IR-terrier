	<brief_summary>The storage and use of biomaterial samples is an important requirement for accompanying research and the acquisition of new knowledge to improve prognosis and therapy. Biobanking is explicitly recommended in official guidelines. In order to preserve the biomaterial, the patient must consent to the removal, transfer and storage of the biomaterial separately from the consent to the register. The biomaterial is taken at times at which a blood or urine sampling takes place anyway in the clinical routine. Therefore no additional interventions are necessary.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The storage and use of biomaterial samples is an important requirement for accompanying research and the acquisition of new knowledge to improve prognosis and therapy. Biobanking is explicitly recommended in official guidelines. In order to preserve the biomaterial, the patient must consent to the removal, transfer and storage of the biomaterial separately from the consent to the register. The biomaterial is taken at times at which a blood or urine sampling takes place anyway in the clinical routine. Therefore no additional interventions are necessary. Sample volumes are defined as follows: - Peripheral blood: up to a total of 150 ml distributed to a maximum of 10 morning blood samples (approximately 15 ml blood per blood sample) during the inpatient stay in the intensive care unit (fixed times are admission and discharge of the intensive care unit) - Urine: a total of up to 200 ml of catheter urine distributed to a maximum of 10 morning withdrawals during inpatient stays in the intensive care unit (defined times are admission and discharge from the intensive care unit)</detailed_description>
	<criteria>patients after admission to the intensive care unit 18 years or older signed informed consent No exclusion criteria are formulated with regard to the objective of the register to record intensive care patients in general. Patients with multiple comorbidities, organ dysfunctions, and noncompliance for a curativelyintended therapy should also be recorded in the register. A palliative treatment or decision for best supportive care is not an exclusion criterion for registering.</criteria>
