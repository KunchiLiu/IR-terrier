	<brief_summary>Imbalance of gut bacteria is suspected to play a key role driving the progression of cirrhosis and there is hope manipulation of these bacteria may be beneficial. This study will determine if fecal microbiota transplantation is an effective and safe treatment for decompensated cirrhosis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fecal Microbiota Transplantation for Decompensated Cirrhosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Two groups of inpatients with decompensated cirrhosis will be randomized using random sequence generator into experimental and control groups. Two groups will given traditional treatments and experimental group will added treatment with fecal microbiota transplantation via endoscope and/or cenema.The liver function parameters, adverse events complication, systemic inflammatory markers, Intestinal mucosa structure, permeability changes in the intestinal mucosal barrier, Microbiota composition will be assessed and thereafter at 1 month and 3 months &amp; subjects will be clinically assessed for improvement or worsening.</detailed_description>
