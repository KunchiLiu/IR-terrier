	<brief_summary>This phase II trial studies the side effects of autologous dendritic cells pulsed with tumor lysate antigen vaccine and nivolumab and to see how well they work in treating patients with glioblastoma that has come back. Vaccines made from a person's tumor cells may help the body build an effective immune response to kill tumor cells. Monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving dendritic cell-autologous lung tumor vaccine and nivolumab may work better in treating patients with glioblastoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Autologous Dendritic Cells Pulsed With Tumor Lysate Antigen Vaccine and Nivolumab in Treating Patients With Recurrent Glioblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of the combination treatment of autologous dendritic cells pulsed with tumor lysate antigen vaccine (DCVax-L) and nivolumab. II. To compare overall survival (OS) from the date of surgery in a pooled evaluation of group 1 subjects receiving DCVax-L and group 2 subjects receiving DCVax-L and nivolumab to recent historical standards. III. To compare OS between the two groups. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Safety. II. Feasibility. III. Tumor response. IV. Immune response. V. Quality of Life (QoL). VI. Overall survival (OS). VII. Overall survival rate at 9, 12, and 18 months. VIII. Progression-free survival (PFS). IX. Evaluation of the safety of the DCVax-L + nivolumab combination regimen. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. Estimate correlation of quantitative assessments of tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) proliferation (CD8+/Ki-67+ staining). II. Estimate difference in PD-1 and PD-L1 immunohistochemistry expression between density or clonality with clinical responses to combination therapy in recurrent glioblastoma subjects. III. Estimate differences between outcome groups in monocytic PD-L1 expression at baseline and over time. IV. Estimate differences between outcome groups in circulating tumor DNA, circulating tumor cells, and CD4+ T cells at baseline and over time. V. Estimate difference in PD-1 and PD-L1 immunohistochemical (IHC) expression between archived and study samples. VI. Explore patterns of tumor proteomic profiling. VII. Estimate efficacy of combination therapy by progression-free survival (PFS), rates of contrasted tumor change over time, and overall survival (OS). VIII. Explore effect of nivolumab on TIL proliferation (CD8+/Ki-67+ staining). IX. Explore whether oligoclonal T cell populations within tumor tissue are similarly expanded in peripheral blood after nivolumab, the magnitude of which correlates with clinical responses. X. Explore if changes in specific MRI parameters correlate with tumor and peripheral blood immune responses. XI. Explore if a mesenchymal gene expression signature present in the initial archived tumor sample correlates with T lymphocytic response in tumor after nivolumab. XII. Correlate changes of positron emission tomography (PET) in tumor with the following: TIL density or clonality, clinical outcome, T cell measures in peripheral blood, clinical toxicity. XIII. Correlate changes in PET in lymph nodes with the following: TIL density or clonality, clinical outcome, T cell measures in peripheral blood, clinical toxicity. XIV. Correlate changes in PET in organ tissue with TIL density or clonality. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups. GROUP I: Patients receive dendritic cell-autologous lung tumor vaccine intradermally (ID) on days 0, 7, 14, and weeks 4, 6, 8, 11, 14, 17 and 20. GROUP II: Patients receive dendritic cell-autologous lung tumor vaccine as in Group I, and nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 0, 14, and weeks 4, 6, 8, 11, 14, 17, and 20. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for up to 12 months.</detailed_description>

subjects who underwent resection confirmed beyond biopsy remain eligible for the screening process; subjects undergoing a biopsy only will be excluded; central confirmation is required before the subject can proceed to leukapheresis Patients with recurrent unilateral GBM, confirmed through central pathology (grade IV), without metastases, remain eligible for this protocol For the purposes of this study, pathology reports for all histologically confirmed GBM includes the recognized variants of glioblastoma (small cell glioblastoma, giant cell glioblastoma, gliosarcoma, and glioblastoma with oligodendroglial components) All subjects must have sufficient tumor lysate protein generated from the resected tumor tissue; this determination will be made by the sponsor's contracted manufacturer and communicated to the clinical site through the sponsor or its designee; this confirmation is not required prior to the preleukapheresis visit, but is required before the subject can proceed to leukapheresis PRELEUKAPHERESIS EVALUATION Hemoglobin &gt;
