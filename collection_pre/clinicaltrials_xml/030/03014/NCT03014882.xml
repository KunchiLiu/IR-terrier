	<brief_summary>Accumulation of iron in patients with beta thalassemia major causes free radical formation which leads to damage of biological membranes. Sperm DNA damage may result from these generated antioxidants. We aimed at investigating the current DNA damage in the sperms of adult patients with beta thalassemia major and the effect generated by giving antioxidant treatment for 6 months.</brief_summary>
