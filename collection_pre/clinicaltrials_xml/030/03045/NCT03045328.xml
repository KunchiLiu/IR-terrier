	<brief_summary>This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of venetoclax when given together with ibrutinib and to see how well they work in treating patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma that has come back or does not respond to treatment. Venetoclax and ibrutinib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Venetoclax and Ibrutinib in Patients With Relapsed/Refractory CLL or SLL</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of orally administered venetoclax combined with ibrutinib in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) who have been previously treated with at least one agent but who are naive to ibrutinib and venetoclax. (Escalation Phase) II. To confirm the safety and to determine feasibility and preliminary efficacy of venetoclax combined with ibrutinib in relapsed/refractory CLL/SLL patients. (Expansion Phase) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the duration of response in relapsed and refractory CLL/SLL patients who have not been previously treated with either venetoclax or ibrutinib. II. To determine the time-to-progression in relapsed and refractory CLL/SLL patients who have not been previously treated with either venetoclax or ibrutinib. III. To determine the progression-free survival in relapsed and refractory CLL/SLL patients who have not been previously treated with either venetoclax or ibrutinib. IV. To determine the overall survival in relapsed and refractory CLL/SLL patients who have not been previously treated with either venetoclax or ibrutinib. V. To determine minimal residual disease status of the bone marrow aspirate by flow cytometry in relapsed and refractory CLL/SLL patients who have not been previously treated with either venetoclax or ibrutinib. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the time to next treatment. II. To perform tumor profiling of baseline and relapse peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) and bone marrow samples using whole exome or whole genome sequencing and ribonucleic acid-sequencing (RNA-seq) to identify potential mechanisms of resistance. III. To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of ibrutinib and venetoclax when administered in combination. OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of venetoclax followed by a phase II study. Patients receive ibrutinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) beginning on week 1 day 1. Treatment with ibrutinib continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive venetoclax PO QD beginning on week 9 day 1. Treatment with venetoclax continues up to week 61 day 7 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 3 years.</detailed_description>
