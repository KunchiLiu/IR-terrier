	<brief_summary>The investigators have recently shown in two pilot incomplete SCI patients that long-term paired associative stimulation is capable of restoring voluntary control over some paralyzed muscles and enhancing motor output in the weak muscles (1). In this study, the investigators will administer long-term paired associative stimulation to incomplete SCI patients in a long-term manner, keeping each patient in the study for as long as continuous improvement is observed.</brief_summary>
