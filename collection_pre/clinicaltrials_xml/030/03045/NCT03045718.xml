This is an intervention study where 100 subjects will be randomized into an active horticultural therapy group, or a waitlist control group. Baseline demographic data will be collected at the start of the study. Assessments will be done at the start, at 3 months and at 6 months, which will include neuropsychological tests of cognitive functioning, psychological tests for depression and anxiety, assessment of psychosocial well-being, and tests of functional status. The Horticultural Therapy intervention will be delivered by trained facilitators at the Therapeutic Garden at Hort Park, and consists of 1 hour sessions weekly for 9 months. The Horticultural Therapy program is designed to stimulate the senses through interaction with the tasks and the environment, promote social interaction and also to promote a sense of self-worth through completion of projects. It encompasses a range of activities including general gardening and also project-based craft activities. The control group will be placed on a waiting list and only be contacted for assessments. They will receive intervention after the active treatment group at a later date.</detailed_description>
