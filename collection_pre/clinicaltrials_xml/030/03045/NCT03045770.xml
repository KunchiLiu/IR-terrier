	<brief_title>mFOLFOX Versus mFOLFIRI Versus FOLFPTX as First-line Treatment in AGC or EGJA</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In previous studies, we found that mFOLFOX(a Combination of Oxaliplatin, Fluorouracil), mFOLFIRI(a Combination of Irinotecan, Fluorouracil), FOLFPTX (a Combination of Paclitaxel, Fluorouracil) are active in patients with AGC or EGJA.This study is being done to find out which one has the best efficacy.</detailed_description>
