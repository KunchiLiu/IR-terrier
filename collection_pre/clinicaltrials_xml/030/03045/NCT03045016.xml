	<brief_summary>After a traumatic event such as an accident or an assault, victims may experience intense stress symptoms that may evolve into "post-traumatic stress disorder" (PTSD). It is a frequent and serious pathology, which can be complicated by depression, addiction or suicide. Few means are available to prevent PTSD in people who have just undergone trauma. Prazosin is an antihypertensive drug that blocks α1 adrenaline receptors which could help to stop the vicious circle of stress and prevent the development of the disease. The objective of this study is to demonstrate the efficacy of prazosin to prevent PTSD in patients who visit an emergency department after trauma.</brief_summary>
