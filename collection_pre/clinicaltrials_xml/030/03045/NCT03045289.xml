	<brief_summary>This research will examine the feasibility of conducting a strict whole-food, plant-based dietary intervention with intensive group education in women with stable metastatic breast cancer currently undergoing conventional treatments. In addition, this research will provide preliminary data on dietary intakes and the effect of plant-based nutrition on numerous outcomes reflecting cancer prognosis and overall health using advanced imaging, various blood biomarkers linked to cancer progression, and numerous symptom questionnaires.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Whole-food, Plant-Based Nutrition Intervention in Women With Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description />
	<mesh_term>Breast Neoplasms</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Women with a confirmed diagnosis of metastatic breast cancer on systemic treatment with radiographically stable disease, demonstrated by at least one imaging test (Computerized tomography (CT), bone scan, or positron emission tomography (PET)) within last 6 months which was interpreted as stable compared to prior imaging study. No new clinical symptoms suggestive of progression of disease. If patient had previously received palliative radiation to a metastatic site, there must be at least one additional unirradiated metastatic site. Brain and small (&lt;1cm) liver and lung mets do not qualify as they are not reliably measured by positron emission tomography (PET). Systemic therapy may consist of any conventional treatment including antihormonal, cytotoxic, targeted monoclonal antibody or small molecule kinase inhibitors or any combination of the above. Expected to survive for at least 6 months. No changes in cancer treatment regimens in the past 2 months. Eligibility classification for enrollment into the study T: any; N: any; M:1. Any estrogen receptor (ER)/progesterone receptor (PR)/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status is eligible. Age &gt; 18. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) status &lt; 3 Must be willing to adopt a strict, wholefoods, plantbased diet for 6 weeks. Participant must be willing and able to comply with the protocol for the duration of the study including group classes, testing, and scheduled individual visits. Able to speak and read English fluently. Inability to tolerate a normal diet. Diabetes The following metastatic lesions will not qualify for study: brain or small (&lt;1cm) liver and lung lesions due to limitations of PET measurements. Diagnosed malabsorption syndrome. Diagnosed eating disorder. Uncontrolled diarrhea. Food allergies or intolerances. Recent consumption (in the past 6 months) of a vegan diet. Pregnancy. Body Mass Index (BMI) &lt; 20. Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) &lt; 30 in the past 30 days. Repeated hyperkalemia (Potassium &gt; 5.1 on more than 2 tests) in the past 30 days. Major surgery within 2 months of starting study program and patients must have recovered from any effects of major surgery Psychiatric disorder that prohibits giving informed consent. Current smoking. Current high risk alcohol use (&gt; 7 drinks per week). Current illicit substance use.</criteria>
