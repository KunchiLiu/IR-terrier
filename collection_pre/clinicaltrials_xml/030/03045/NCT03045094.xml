	<brief_summary>This study evaluates the effect of head and neck movement in children on endotracheal tube (ETT) tip displacement undergoing head-and-neck surgeries. The tube-tip displacement will be measured using flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Neck Movement Implicate the Tracheal Tube-tip Displacement in Pediatric Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In clinical application, especially in head-and-neck surgeries, the operators often change the position of children's head-neck for easy operating. Flexing the head resulted in the ETT moving towards the carina, and extension resulted in the tube being displaced in the opposite direction. Head and neck movement change the length of trachea as well: extending the head resulted in the extension of trachea, while flexing resulted in the opposite. Serious complications following from head and neck movement, such as accidental extubation and endobronchial intubation, threat children's life. In pediatric anesthesia, insertion depth (cm) of orotracheal intubation equals to age/2+12, according to classic intubation formulae. The ETT will be put in the depth calculated by the classic formulae under general anesthesia. The distance of ETT-tip displacement and the length change of trachea will be measured as the head and neck placed as follows: fully extended, neutral position, or fully flexed. These three head and neck positions imitate the head-neck movement during those head-and-neck surgeries.</detailed_description>
