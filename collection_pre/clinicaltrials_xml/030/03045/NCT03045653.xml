	<brief_summary>Background: Endocrine therapy is an effective and safe treatment for hormone receptor positive breast cancer. Unfortunately , endocrine treatment resistance occurs and there is an urgent need for treatment alternative. Laboratory researches and clinical case reports indicate that hormone receptor-high expressed breast cancer patients may potentially benefit from high-dose Tamoxifen therapy, providing a new option for treatment strategy. Aim: To explore the efficacy and safety of high-dose Tamoxifen to advanced hormone receptor-high expressed endocrine therapy resisted breast cancer. Methods: Eligible patients will be treated with tamoxifen 100 mg/d. Blood and tumor samples will be obtained from the patients. Primary endpoint: clinical benefit rate at 16 weeks(CBR)</brief_summary>
