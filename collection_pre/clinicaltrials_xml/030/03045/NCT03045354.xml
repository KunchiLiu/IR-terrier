	<brief_title>Dietary Carbohydrate Consumption at Breakfast on Food Intake, Glycemic Response, and Subjective Appetite</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Regular breakfast eating NW and OW/OB children, 9-14 years of age, will participate in the experiment. Four isocaloric (450 kcal) breakfasts (eggs with a side of French fries, mashed potatoes, or beans, and control breakfast of milk, cereal and toast) and breakfast skipping will be examined. On five separate mornings, 7 days apart and after a 12 hour overnight fast, each participant will receive one of the four breakfasts or skip breakfast, in a randomized counterbalanced order. Participants will be given an ad libitum lunch 3 hours after breakfast and parents will report the rest of day food record for food intake analysis. Blood glucose will be measured via finger-prick at baseline, and 30, 60, 120, and 180 minutes after breakfast consumption. Subjective appetite will be measured with a visual analogue scale at baseline and every 15 minutes for 1 hour, and every hour for 3 hours.</detailed_description>
