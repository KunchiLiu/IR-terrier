	<brief_summary>There are an increase number of patients with cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) such as pacemakers (PM) and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) worldwide. The current medical practice guidelines warn on performing bioimpedance analysis (BIA) in this group of patients to avoid any electromagnetic interference. These recommendations restrict the use of BIA in many patients with heart failure in whom BIA might be of great interest in detecting peripheral congestion and in guidance of treatment. However, it is not well known whether BIA can affect the function of cardiac devices. Investigators aimed to test the incidence of electromagnetic interference between BIA and CIEDs.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>BIA and Cardiac Implantable Electronic Devices</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients enrollment were during routine face-to-face consultations, scheduled for PM and ICDs interrogations. Investigators recorded before and after each BIA measure, the battery voltage of the device, lead impedance and stimulation thresholds. The device electrograms were monitored during BIA measurements to detect any electromagnetic interference or oversensing.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Patient having a cardiac device with or without cardiac resynchronization 18 years of age and above Patients with no pacingdependent status Patients who read, understood and signed written informed consent letter Patients with acute heart failure Patients implanted in less than 2 months Dysfunction of the device in a followup visit or in the inclusion visit Patients with a particular device lead model prone to develop electronical problems such as Sprint Fidelis of Medtronic (Minneapolis, USA) or Riata of St. Jude Medical (St. Paul, USA) Pregnancy</criteria>
