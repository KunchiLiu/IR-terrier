	<brief_title>Effects of Salvianolate Injection on Myocardial Microcirculation in Patients With Acute STEMI After Primary PCI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, randomized, double-blind and controlled study.536 subjects of STEMI who underwent primary PCI within the first 12 hours will be enrolled.all patients were assigned to receive 300mg of asprin and ≥300mg of clopidogrel as loading dose,and following 100mg and 75mg once daily respectively.Patients were assigned to receive Salvianolate injection or 0.9% sodium chloride injection in catherter room setting,and following similar medicine once daily respectively for 7 days.Myocardial circulation perfusion will be checked with mmediate coronary angiography parameters,ECG,echocardiographic，CK-MB.The major adverse cardiovascular events will be observed.</detailed_description>
