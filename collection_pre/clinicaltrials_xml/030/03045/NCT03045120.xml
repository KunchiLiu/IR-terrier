	<brief_summary>This non-interventional, prospective study will characterize the impact of three approved first and second generation BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitors on cardiovascular and metabolic risk factors in chronic phase CML (CP-CML) patients who are TKI naive and initiating first-line TKIs in routine clinical practice in the US. All treatment decisions will be determined at the discretion of the treating physician(s) and data identifying the cardiovascular and metabolic risk factors will be collected. Additional fasting blood samples (collected following 8 hours of fasting) will be collected during standard of care (SOC)/routine office visits. Additional research imaging will be performed and will be reviewed by core imaging laboratory. As the study is collecting data on management of CML, this study will not influence the prescribing or management practices at participating sites.</brief_summary>
