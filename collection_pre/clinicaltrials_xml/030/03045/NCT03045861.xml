	<brief_summary>GSK2838232 is a novel HIV-1 maturation inhibitor (MI) that is being developed for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in combination with other antiretroviral therapy (ART). This study will be a 10-day monotherapy, open-label, adaptive, dose ranging, repeat-dose study. This study will be conducted in two Parts (Part A and Part B) consisting single daily doses of GSK2838232 and Cobicistat from Day 1 to Day 10. This proof of concept open-label study will be aimed to characterize the acute antiviral activity, pharmacokinetics (PK), the relationship between PK and antiviral activity, and safety of GSK2838232/cobi administered across a range of doses over 10 days in HIV-1 infected patients. A cohort of 10 subjects will be studied in Part I followed by interim (go/no-go) analysis of Part A data. On completion of an interim analysis of part A data, further cohorts of 8 subjects will then be studied in Part B in a parallel design in two or more cohorts (depending upon the data obtained in Part A). Approximately 34 HIV-1 infected treatment-naive subjects will be enrolled during the study. Subjects in both parts will have a screening visit within 30 days prior to first dose and a follow-up visit 7-14 days after the last dose. Maximum duration of study participation will be approximately 6 Weeks.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Between 18 and 55 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the informed consent. Healthy (other than HIV infection) male or female as determined by the investigator or medically qualified designee based on a medical evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and cardiac monitoring, defined as no other chronic medical conditions and taking no chronic medications. A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameter(s) which is/are not specifically listed in the inclusion or exclusion criteria, outside the reference range for the population being studied may be included only if the investigator in consultation with the medical monitor agree and document that the finding is unlikely to introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures. A creatinine clearance &gt;80 mL/minute as determined by CockcroftGault equation creatinine clearance CLcr (mL/minute) = (140 age) x weight (Wt) divided by (72 x serum creatinine [Scr]) (times 0.85 if female) where age is in years, Wt is in kilogram (kg), and Scr is in units of mg/decilitre (dL). Confirmed HIV positive; CD4+ cell count &gt;=350 cells/millimetre (mm)^3 and plasma HIV1 RNA &gt;=5000 copies/mL at screening. No current and no prior ART. Body weight &gt;=50 kg (110 pound [lbs.]) for men and &gt;=45 kg (99 lbs) for women and body mass index (BMI) within the range 18.531.0 kg/meter^2 (inclusive) A female subject of reproductive or nonreproductive potential is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant (as confirmed by a negative serum or urine human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) test at screening and prior to first dose), not lactating, and at least one of the following conditions applies: females of reproductive potential may only be enrolled if they are using two forms of complementary contraception, which must include one barrier method. They will be counselled on safer sex practices; there is no definitive drugdrug interaction (DDI) information with GSK2838232 and an interaction with oral contraceptives is possible, so other (barrier, interuterine device etc.) methods of contraception will be required; fertile females, who have an established, longterm lifestyle of sexual abstinence, or only same sex partners, require no other means of birth control. Premenopausal females with one of the following: documented tubal ligation; documented hysteroscopic tubal occlusion procedure with followup confirmation of bilateral tubal occlusion; hysterectomy; documented bilateral oophorectomy; postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and estradiol levels consistent with menopause. Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status prior to study enrolment. Male subjects with female partners of child bearing potential must comply with the following contraception requirements from the time of first dose of study medication until one week after the last dose of study medication; vasectomy with documentation of azoospermia; male condom plus partner use of one of the contraceptive options as: Contraceptive sub dermal implant including a &lt;1 percent rate of failure per year; intrauterine device or intrauterine system including a &lt;1 percent rate of failure per year; oral contraceptive, either combined or progestogen alone or injectable progestogen; contraceptive vaginal ring; percutaneous contraceptive patches. These allowed methods of contraception are only effective when used consistently, correctly and in accordance with the product label. The investigator is responsible for ensuring that subjects understand how to properly use these methods of contraception. Capable of giving signed informed consent. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and bilirubin (BIL) &gt;1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN), isolated BIL &gt;1.5xULN is acceptable if BIL is fractionated and direct BIL &lt;35 percent. Current or chronic history of liver disease, or known hepatic or biliary abnormalities (with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones); hepatitis B virus (HBV) and/or hepatitis C virus (HCV) positive.
