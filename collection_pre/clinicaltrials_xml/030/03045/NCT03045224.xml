	<brief_title>PTA-Registry, a Prospective, Multicenter Study With 24-Month Follow-up</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The registry was created for the following purposes: evaluation of the clinical effectiveness, safety and quality of the endovascular therapy, and history of the disease after endovascular therapy. The resulting specific research questions were determination of the technical and clinical success of the procedure, monitoring of periinterventional complications, evaluation of vessel patency, amputation rate, mortality, and major adverse cardiac events during the follow-up. In addition, the quality of life after endovascular peripheral intervention over a period of two years was evaluated.</detailed_description>
