	<detailed_description>In year 1 of the two-part research study, an observational, prospective study of 75 Veterans preparing for elective surgery will be conducted. The purpose of this study will be to select appropriate nutrition screening and assessment tools and to employ them to characterize malnutrition prevalence and severity and establish cut-off values associated with malnutrition in this population. In years 2-5 of the research two-part research study, a pilot randomized controlled trial will be conducted. The purpose of this study will be evaluate the feasibility, fidelity, and acceptability of a perioperative protein-enhance intervention compared to an educational control. Veterans who are malnourished or at risk of being malnourished will be randomly assigned on a 1:1 ratio to either an education (nutritional counseling) control or high-protein perihabilitation arm. Participants in the high-protein perihabilitation arm will be provided with high quality protein supplements that will bring their protein intakes to at least 30 grams for 3 meals per day. The study will take place two weeks prior to an elective abdominal or GI surgery and will continue 4 weeks post surgery.</detailed_description>
