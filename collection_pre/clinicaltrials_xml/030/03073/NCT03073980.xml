	<brief_summary>This research study is being done to compare how effective certain medications are at reducing pain after oocyte (egg) retrieval surgery and how effective they are at reducing the time between the retrieval and discharge from the hospital. The investigators will compare intravenous (IV) acetaminophen (Tylenol) to oral (PO) acetaminophen with IV fentanyl and to IV fentanyl only. The investigators also want to find out whether IV acetaminophen can reduce a person's need for opioid pain medications (such as morphine) to "rescue" breakthrough pain.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVE: To compare time to discharge from PACU and pain scores between patients who receive IV acetaminophen, PO acetaminophen and IV fentanyl, or IV fentanyl alone for pain control while undergoing oocyte retrievals. HYPOTHESIS: The investigators' hypothesis is that patients receiving IV acetaminophen will have improved or equivalent pain scores, require less opiate medication, and have shorter time to discharge from PACU than those receiving PO acetaminophen and IV fentanyl or IV fentanyl alone. Participants will be enrolled for the study one to two days before their oocyte retrieval. If and when informed consent is obtained, the patient will be randomized to one of three treatments. Groups will receive medications as follows: Group 1: In the PACU, 30 minutes before the planned start of the procedure, will receive IV 1 gram acetaminophen and PO placebo; followed by standard propofol for conscious sedation Group 2: In the PACU, 30 minutes before the planned start of the procedure, will receive PO 1 gram acetaminophen and IV placebo, followed by IV fentanyl and standard propofol for conscious sedation Group 3: In the PACU, 30 minutes before the planned start of the procedure, will receive the current standard of care of IV placebo and PO placebo, followed by IV fentanyl and standard propofol for conscious sedation The participant group will be blinded to the reproductive endocrinologist, RN, study staff, and patient. The anesthesiologist will NOT be blinded to the study group. A member of the investigators study staff will review participants' medical record to collect data regarding demographic, non identifying information, as well as cycle and pregnancy outcomes. This will occur at three instances, occurring at one month, three months, and one year after the participants' procedure</detailed_description>
