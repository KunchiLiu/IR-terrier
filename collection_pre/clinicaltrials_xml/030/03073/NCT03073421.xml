	<brief_summary>The Positive Pregnancy Program is an innovative, unique, interprofessional model of care for HIV-positive pregnant women. This program has been in place at St. Michael's Hospital for five years. This study is important because it will allow for a critical evaluation of the Program, and to identify strengths and weaknesses. This will in turn provide the opportunity to improve delivery of care for HIV positive women.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The aim of the P3 program is to provide supportive and comprehensive care from a variety of perspectives, including medical, social, and psychological. The premises on which the program are built include: a commitment to the respect, confidentiality, dignity and medical care of clients; health promotion; normalizing the care of HIV-positive pregnant women; knowledge translation; and the intentions to build a model of care that is transferable to other clinicians and to other conditions. During antenatal visits, pregnant women are seen by a multidisciplinary team of professionals including an Obstetrician, Midwife, Prenatal Nurse and Social Worker. Different rooms are used for routine antenatal care maneuvers and for consultation and counseling. The Midwife attends the births of the women in the program, and does home post partum care visits. Care is provided that is patient- and family-centered. Partners are invited to attend as many visits as the couple wishes. Because of this team approach, significantly more time is spent with each woman than would occur at a routine prenatal visit. The patient population at the St. Michael's clinic is largely made up of immigrant women. Many of these women are refugees, and have fled conflict zones or wars to come to Canada. More than 50% have lived in Canada for less than five years. Many of these women are marginalized, and may not access care elsewhere. They have many issues beyond HIV, and some of the social determinants of health that we observe during their time in the program include issues surrounding housing, finance, immigration, legal issues, social support, co-morbid conditions and substance use. Since the launch of the program, there has been a rapid increase in the number of women attending each year. The program has also attracted significant attention, both from within the medical and health care communities and beyond. This study seeks to determine if women cared for in the Positive Pregnancy Program will have a high degree of satisfaction with this model of care.</detailed_description>
