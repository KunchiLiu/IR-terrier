	<brief_title>The Acute Effect of Egg-Based High Protein Meal on Hypertensive Response to Exercise</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is designed to assess BP changes during and post- exercise after consumption of a test breakfast. The design consists of three visits. The first visit will assess each participants aerobic exercise capacity (VO2 max). Visit 2 and 3 will be clinical testing days where the subject will consume either the 13g or 30g protein breakfast in a randomized cross-over manner and perform the exercise intervention. BP changes will be monitored before and after breakfast consumption, during the exercise intervention,</detailed_description>
