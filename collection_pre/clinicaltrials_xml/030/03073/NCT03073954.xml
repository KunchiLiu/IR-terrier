	<brief_summary>General cognitive impairment is highly prevalent in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients. Domain-specific cognitive impairments include deficits in domains such as cognitive flexibility, verbal memory, working memory, planning, and psychomotor speed; which in general are associated with poor health behaviours, such as infrequent exercising and poor diet. Additional cognitive training may reverse these effects. Recent evidence suggests that working memory training is linked to self-control and, indirectly, to improved lifestyle behaviour including increased physical activity. The investigators hypothesise that enhancing cognitive performance through administering specific working memory training not only improves cognitive function but that it facilitates better adherence to a more active lifestyle and a healthier diet in COPD patients.</brief_summary>
