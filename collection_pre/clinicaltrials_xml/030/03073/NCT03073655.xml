	<brief_title>The Effects of Kinesio Tape Application With Different Verbal Input Given to With Patients With Rotator Cuff Tear</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rotator cuff tears are most common of shoulder pain and functional limitations. Kinesio tape (KT) are frequently used in the conservative treatment of shoulder pathology. Even if some studies showed that KT is effective on pain, we think that it is due to positive thoughts of the patients about KT. The aim of the study to investigate the effectiveness KT application with different verbal inputs on pain, function and range of motion (ROM) on patient with rotator cuff tear. 97 patients (Group 1, n=32; Group 2, n=33, Group 3, n=32) were randomized into 3 groups according to verbal input given to patients about the effectiveness of KT; Group 1 (it has been limited evidence of KT is effective), Group 2 (it has been not known that KT is effective or not), Group 3 (it has been known that KT has excellent result). The same standard KT was applied to 3 groups. The rest, night and pain in activity were assessed by Visual Analog Pain Scale (VAS) before, after 30 min and 24 hours after KT application. ROM assessed by goniometer and the function was evaluated by Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) and the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgery score (ASES) before and 24 hours of KT application. Minimal clinically important difference and effective were calculated for the assessments used in the study.</detailed_description>
