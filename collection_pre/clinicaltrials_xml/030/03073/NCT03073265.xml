	<brief_summary>The objective is to demonstrate the performances of STA® - Apixaban Calibrator &amp; STA® - Apixaban Control used in combination with STA® - Liquid Anti-Xa to measure apixaban concentration in plasma. Anti-Xa results will be compared to LCMS (liquid chromatography - mass spectrometry) for validation of the assay. For this study, the anti-Xa assay will be performed on fresh samples only. The results will be used to complete results obtained previously on frozen samples.</brief_summary>
