	<brief_title>Trial of Atezolizumab and Vigil for Advanced Gynecological Cancers (A Companion Study to CL-PTL-119)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized, open label intra-patient crossover study of Vigil, the checkpoint inhibitor Atezolizumab and the combination of the two agents, in patients with epithelial ovarian cancer, or other gynecological cancers (i.e., cervical, uterine). Eligible patients will be randomized to receive two cycles of Vigil alone or two cycles of atezolizumab alone, followed by combination treatment with the two agents.This study is intended as a companion study to protocol CL-PTL-119, A Randomized, Double Blind, Placebo Controlled Phase 3 trial of Vigil Engineered Autologous Tumor Cell Immunotherapy in Subjects with Stage IIIb-IV Ovarian Cancer in Clinical Complete Response following Surgery and Primary Chemotherapy, otherwise known as the VITAL study. Patients who have tumor harvested at surgery and Vigil successfully manufactured, but then are ineligible for randomization onto the VITAL study, will be offered the opportunity to participate in this protocol.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Study Enrollment Subjects will be eligible for registration into the trial if they meet all of the following inclusion criteria: 1. Successful manufacturing of at least 4 vials of Vigil. 2. Failure to meet the eligibililty criteria for Protocol CLPTL119 because of failure to achieve a complete clinical response following primary debulking surgery and standard paclitaxel/carboplatin therapy OR, because of a histologic diagnosis of another gynecologic malignancy which is not ovarian cancer. 3. ECOG performance status (PS) ≤ 1 4. Estimated survival ≥ 6 months. 5. Measureable or evaluable disease. 6. Adequate organ and bone marrow function as defined below: 1. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 × 10e9/L (1500 per mm^3) 2. Platelets &gt;100 × 10e9/L (100,000 per mm^3) 3. Hemoglobin ≥9.0 g/dL (5.59 mmol/L) 4. Creatinine clearance (CrCL) &gt;50 mL/min by the CockcroftGault formula or by 24hour urine collection for determination of creatinine clearance: Females: CrCL (mL/min) = Weight (kg) × (140 Age) × 0.85/72 × serum creatinine (mg/dL) 5. Serum bilirubin ≤1.5 × upper limit of normal (ULN). This will not apply to patients with confirmed Gilbert's syndrome (persistent or recurrent hyperbilirubinemia that is predominantly unconjugated in the absence of evidence of hemolysis or hepatic pathology) who will be allowed in consultation with their physician. 6. AST and ALT ≤2.5 × ULN in patients with no liver metastasis 7. AST or ALT ≤5 × ULN in patients with liver metastasis 8. TSH within institutional limits. If TSH is greater or less than institutional limits patients may participate if their T4 is within normal limits (WNL); patients may be on a stable dose of replacement thyroid medication; dose adjustments are allowed if needed 7. Subject has recovered to CTCAE Grade 1 or better from all adverse events associated with prior therapy or surgery 8. Preexisting motor or sensory neurologic pathology or symptoms must be recovered to CTCAE Grade ≤ 2 or better 9. Patients with irreversible toxicity that is not reasonably expected to be exacerbated by the IPs may be included (e.g., hearing loss) after consultation with the Principal Investigator 10. Receipt of the last dose of anticancer therapy (chemotherapy, immunotherapy, endocrine therapy, targeted therapy, biologic therapy, tumor embolization, monoclonal antibodies, other investigational agent) prior to tissue procurement and at least 21 days prior to the first dose of study drug (at least 21 days prior to the first dose of study drug for subjects who have received prior TKIs [e.g., erlotinib, gefitinib and crizotinib] and within 6 weeks for nitrosourea or mitomycin C). (If sufficient washout time has not occurred due to the schedule or PK properties of an agent, a longer washout period may be required.) 11. Subjects who are not rendered surgically sterile as a result of surgery for ovarian cancer, must have, negative urine or serum pregnancy test. If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a negative serum test will be required for study entry. 12. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed protocol specific consent. 13. Willing and able to comply with the protocol for the duration of the study including undergoing treatment and scheduled visits and examinations including follow up. Study Enrollment Subjects will NOT be eligible for study registration and enrollment if meeting any of the following criteria: 1. Have received more than two additional chemotherapy regimens for platinum resistant/refractory ovarian cancer, after their initial treatment with paclitaxel/carboplatin, OR have received more than two additional chemotherapy regimens for the treatment of another gynecologic malignancy 1. Patients must have fully recovered from chemotherapy associated toxicities prior to starting treatment on this protocol. 2. Palliative radiotherapy is permitted provided: i. More than 3 weeks have elapsed between the end of radiotherapy and the first dose of study therapy, AND ii. The lung is not in the radiation field, AND iii. The irradiated lesion(s) cannot be used as target lesions. 2. Participation in another clinical study with an investigational product within the last 3 weeks prior to study start. 3. Patients with autoimmune diseases are excluded from enrollment with the exception of patients with hypothyroidism on stable thyroxine replacement, and patients with T1DM on stable insulin replacement. 4. Receipt of steroid therapy within the 2 weeks of the first dose of study therapy. 5. Live vaccine used for the prevention of infectious disease administered &lt; 30 days prior to the start of study therapy. NOTE: Subjects, if enrolled, should not receive live vaccine during the study and for 5 months after the last dose of atezolizumab. 6. Postsurgery complication that in the opinion of the treating investigator would interfere with the subject's study participation or make it not in the best interest of the subject to participate. 7. Mean QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTc) ≥470 ms calculated from 3 electrocardiograms (ECGs) using Frediricia's Correction. 8. Female subjects who are pregnant, breastfeeding or of reproductive potential who are not employing an effective method of birth control defined in the protocol. Effective contraception is required for women receiving atezolizumab for 5 months after the last dose. 9. Any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would interfere with evaluation of study treatment or interpretation of patient safety or study results.</criteria>
