	<brief_summary>Randomized, open-label, multi-center, comparative trial to assess the efficacy and safety in immunocompromised subjects with acyclovir resistant mucocutaneous HSV infection, treated with pritelivir 100 mg qd (following a loading dose of 400 mg as first dose to rapidly reach steady-state plasma concentration) or foscarnet 40 mg/kg iv tid/60mg/kg iv bid.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial on Efficacy and Safety of Pritelivir Tablets for Treatment of Acyclovir-resistant Mucocutaneous HSV (Herpes Simplex Virus) Infections in Immunocompromised Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Immunocompromised male or female subjects with acyclovir-resistant mucocutaneous HSV infection based on clinical failure requiring switch to foscarnet treatment. The acyclovir resistance status will be documented by genotypic testing, if the results from genotypic testing are negative or inconclusive phenotypic testing will be performed. Pritelivir trial medication will be given orally as single daily doses until 7 days after the mucocutaneous HSV lesions are healed or up to a maximum of 28 days, whichever is earlier. Foscarnet will be given as intermittent infusions at a dose of 40 mg/kg every 8 hours or 60mg/kg every 12 hours (to be adjusted in case of renal impairment) for a minimum of 1 hour duration until 7 days after the mucocutaneous HSV lesions are healed or up to a maximum of 28 days, whichever is earlier.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Immunocompromised men and women of any ethnic group aged ≥18 years. 2. Acyclovir resistant mucocutaneous HSV infection based on clinical failure requiring switch to foscarnet treatment. 3. Lesion accessible for size measurement and photography. 4. Willingness to abstain from the application of lotions and/or creams to the area with HSV lesions. 5. Ability to swallow tablets. 6. Willing to use nonhormonal birth control: Male subjects who are surgically sterile (eg, after vasectomy) or who must agree to use an adequate method of contraception during participation in the trial and for at least 1 complete month after the final dose of trial medication. Female subjects who are surgically sterile (eg, 2sided tubal ligation, resection or ovariectomy, hysterectomy) or postmenopausal (defined as at least 50 years of age and who have a history of no menses for at least 24 months) or female subjects of childbearing potential with no male partner, or use an adequate method of contraception during participation in the trial and for at least 1 complete month after the final dose of trial medication. An adequate method of contraception is defined as one of the following acceptable birth control methods: the use of the copperreleasing intrauterine device (to have been in place for at least 2 months prior to screening) the use of one of the following: diaphragm, Lea's shield, FemCap, sponge, and monogamous relationship with vasectomized partner the use of a male condom during each act of sexual intercourse. 7. Subject must be willing and able (in the opinion of the investigator) to understand the informed consent form 8. Negative serum β HCG (beta human chorionic gonadotropin) test for female of child bearing potential at screening and a negative urine pregnancy test at randomization. 9. Subject must give written informed consent. 1. Known intolerance to pritelivir and/or foscarnet or any of the excipients. 2. Need to use drugs that have a narrow therapeutic index and are substrates for CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, and OCT1 (organic cation transporter 1), ie warfarin, digoxin, phenytoin, paclitaxel, Smephenytoin 3. Baseline safety laboratory abnormalities: ANC (absolute neutrophil Count) &lt; 1000 cells/mm3, platelet count &lt; 25,000 cells/mm3, hemoglobin &lt; 8.0 g/dL, AST (aspartate transaminase) or ALT (alanine transaminase) &gt; 5 x ULN (upper Limit of normal), bilirubin &gt; 2.5 x ULN 4. History or current evidence of gastrointestinal malabsorption which, in the opinion of the investigator, may affect the extent of absorption of pritelivir. 5. Severe renal insufficiency (GFR ≤ 29). 6. History or current evidence of significant cardiovascular, pulmonary, hepatic, renal, gastrointestinal, hematological, endocrinological, metabolic, neurological, psychiatric, or other diseases, which, in the opinion of the investigator, may affect the subject's safety or interfere with the trial. 7. Abnormalities in hematological, clinical chemical or any other laboratory variables at Screening measured by the central or local laboratory regarded as clinically relevant by the investigator unless they are due to underlying disease or condition. 8. Not able to communicate meaningfully with the Investigator and site staff. 9. Any other condition which in the opinion of the investigator would interfere with successful completion of this clinical trial. 10. Any other local condition including bacterial superinfection which in the opinion of the investigator would interfere with the efficacy evaluation. 11. Pregnant and/or breastfeeding women. 12. Participation in investigational drug trials within the last 30 days before randomization for this clinical trial.</criteria>
