	<brief_summary>An early phase I study to evaluate the uptake of [68Ga]P16-093 in known or suspected metastatic prostate or renal cancer to establish the feasibility of using [68Ga]P16-093 to image PSMA expressing cancer. Measurement of the whole body biodistribution of [68Ga]P16-093 in man to generate human radiation dosimetry data.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>DYNAMIC GROUP: History of histologically confirmed cancer that meets criteria for either a) or b) 1. Prostate cancer with known or suspected recurrent or metastatic disease based on clinical imaging (e.g. CT, bone scan, MRI, ultrasound, FDG PET/CT) within 3 months of screening. If subject is post curativeintent local treatment (e.g. radical prostatectomy, local radiotherapy, brachytherapy) they must meet one of the following criteria: PostProstatectomy (with or without adjuvant RT): detectable or rising PSA level that is ≥ 0.2 ng/mL with a second confirmatory level of ≥ 0.2 ng/mL measured at least 2 weeks apart OR PostRadiotherapy: detectable or rising PSA level that has risen from nadir in at least 3 consecutive tests measured at least 2 weeks apart OR 2. Renal Cell cancer with known or suspected metastatic disease based on clinical imaging (e.g. CT, bone scan, MRI, ultrasound, FDG PET/CT) 1. Estimated creatinine clearance (eGFR) &lt; 30 mL/min (calculated from serum creatinine result within 30 days of screening) 2. Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) within 3 months prior to screening 3. Chemotherapy or radiation therapy within 2 weeks of screening 4. Inability to tolerate imaging procedures in the opinion of an investigator or treating physician 5. Any current medical condition, illness, or disorder as assessed by medical record review and/or selfreported that is considered by a physician investigator to be a condition that could compromise participant safety or successful completion of the study BIODISTRIBUTION GROUP: History of prostate cancer that is post curativeintent local treatment (e.g.radical prostatectomy, local radiotherapy, brachytherapy) with clinical PSA levels that meet one of the following criteria 1. PostProstatectomy (with or without adjuvant RT): PSA level that is &lt; 0.2 ng/mL measured over at least 2 consecutive tests OR 2. PostRadiotherapy: PSA level that has not risen from nadir measured over at least 2 consecutive tests If clinical imaging (e.g. bone scan, CT, MRI, ultrasound, PET/CT) has been done within 3 months of screening as part of standard clinical surveillance it must be negative or equivocal for sites of recurrent or metastatic disease (clinical imaging is not required for enrollment) 1. Estimated creatinine clearance (eGFR) &lt; 30 mL/min (calculated from serum creatinine result within 30 days of screening) 2. Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) within 3 months prior to screening 3. Chemotherapy or radiation therapy within 2 weeks of screening 4. Inability to tolerate imaging procedures in the opinion of an investigator or treating physician 5.
