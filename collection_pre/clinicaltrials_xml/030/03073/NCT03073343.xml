	<brief_title>A Prospective, Randomized, Open Label Trial of Two Doses of Oral Betaine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, unblinded, randomized study of oral betaine in diabetic and non-diabetic patients who have a clinical diagnosis of NAFLD and an ALT≥ 50 IU/mL. A clinical diagnosis of NAFLD is based on the presence of risk factors for NAFLD (such as overweight and insulin resistance) and the exclusion of other causes of liver disease, such as alcohol or viral hepatitis. Two cohorts of patients will be studied: Cohort 1 (diabetic) will consist of patients with a clinical diagnosis of non-insulin dependent type II diabetes mellitus; Cohort 2 (non-diabetics) will consist of patients without a clinical diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus. 24 patients will be enrolled in each cohort (total of 48 patients enrolled in the study) with an anticipated drop out of 4 subjects per cohort. Patients will be given dietary instructions and advice on exercise appropriate for the management of NAFLD (NIDDK and liverfoundation.org handouts). Patients will be prescribed 4 grams of betaine/day (2 grams PO BID) for the first 4 weeks of the study. After 4 weeks, patients in each cohort (NIDDM and non-diabetic) will be randomized (1:1) to continue receiving betaine 4 grams per day or increase to 8 grams per day for an additional 8 weeks. All patients will be seen in clinic on a monthly basis during treatment, and again 4 and 12 weeks after completion of betaine treatment. The total duration of the study is 24 weeks (12 weeks of betaine treatment and 12 weeks of follow-up). The primary outcome is change in ALT during 12 weeks of betaine treatment (i.e., ALT at week 12 compared with ALT at baseline (entry). Secondary outcomes include safety, efficacy of betaine in each cohort, and are changes in laboratory tests related to NAFLD.</detailed_description>
