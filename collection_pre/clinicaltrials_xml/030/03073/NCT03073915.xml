	<brief_summary>Patients hospitalized in internal wards are at risk for VTE. The current guidelines recommend the use of thromboprophylaxis for 7-10 days among patients who are at increased risk for VTE. Yet several retrospective studies have shown that the compliance with this guideline is low. Physicians are often reluctant to administer LMWH to their fragile patients mainly because they are not convince that the risk associated with such therapy is greater than the risk for VTE. In the current study, data concerning the use of thromboprophylaxis among patients admitted to the medical wards will be collected. The occurrence of bleeding or thrombotic event will be evaluated prospectively.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of the Risk of VTE Among Patients Hospitalized in Non-surgical Departments</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Data concerning the use of LMWH among patients admitted to the medical wards at the Hadassah University Hospital will be collected prospectively from the electronic medical records. The occurrence of bleeding episodes or thrombotic events will be followed for the next 90 days following discharge from the hospital. The percent of patients actually treated by LMWH among patients entitled for such therapy according to the most updated international guidelines will be evaluated. The risk of minor and major bleeding will be compared among those given thromboprophylaxis and those who were not treated. Similar comparison will be made for thrombotic events.</detailed_description>
