	<brief_summary>This pilot study aims to evaluate the sensitivity, variability and responsiveness of a number of predefined clinical and psychological outcome measuring tools in an ambulant cancer treatment setting (home vs. hospital). The measuring tools will be evaluated in two patient cohorts. One cohort is treated as per standard of care at the outpatient hospital, the other cohort is receiving (partial) cancer treatment at home. A second objective is to create a costs inventory representing total costs for an ambulant treated cancer patient.</brief_summary>
