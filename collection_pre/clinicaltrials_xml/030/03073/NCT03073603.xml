	<brief_summary>Natural history research in MS suggests that risk of relapses and new Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) changes diminish significantly as people age, especially in MS patients 55 or older. Thus, the need to continue MS medicines that reduce relapses and new MRI lesions may also decrease as people age, especially in those who have not had relapses or MRI scan changes for prolonged times. This study plans to learn more about the safety of stopping MS medication in this population, as compared to continuing on the medication.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Discontinuation of Disease Modifying Therapies (DMTs) in Multiple Sclerosis (MS)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will have 2 different groups of research subjects. One of these groups will stay on their current MS medication, and one group will discontinue their medication. To decide which group the participant will be in, the investigators will use a method of chance. This method is like flipping a coin or rolling dice. This is called "randomization". Participants will be randomized to one of the 2 groups as described above. They will also have some extra assessments done at their regular routine MS clinic appointment and every 6 months for the next 2 years. The following items will be done in addition to any assessments or procedures they are already having done as part of their clinical care and are the only items to be paid for by the study: - Some questionnaires about the participant's quality of life including questions about health, mood, thinking, and social life - Some questionnaires about the participant's MS symptoms - A test of the participant's attention, concentration, and thinking that involves adding and repeating numbers - A test of the participant's physical symptoms - Along with the MRIs the participants get as part of their routine care, they will also have one 6 months from their start in the study as part of the study.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients with either Relapsingremitting MS (RRMS), Secondary progressive MS (SPMS), or Primary progressive MS (PPMS) by McDonald 2010 criteria. Patients defined by subtype based on 2013 updated phenotypic criteria. Progression of MS defined by the local PI either: prospectively with an EDSS change of at least 1.0 points over the last two years, or retrospectively, with any significant change in motor function over at least one year, unrelated to relapse. 55 years of age or older at time of randomization; No evidence of new inflammatory disease activity (inactive by the Lublin criteria16) for at least five years Using any of the FDAapproved MS DMTs (to include: interferon β1a, interferon β1b, glatiramer acetate, natalizumab, fingolimod, dimethyl fumarate, or teriflunomide; continuously for no less than 5 years. Taking most recent DMT continuously* for no less than two years. Willing to be randomized per this protocol; each patient will be questioned as to their willingness to stay in the trial regardless of the group to which group they are randomized. Willing to follow the protocol Able to undergo a brain MRI without anesthesia Continuously will be defined as no less than 75% of all prescribed doses, with no time of greater than four weeks from last intended dose to have missed a dose (8 weeks for natalizumab, i.e. one missed dose). Any MS relapse in the last five years, as determined at the screen visit by the PI Any new or definitely enlarging T2/FLAIR lesion or new gadoliniumenhancing lesion within the past 5 years (at least 2 scans separated by at least 5 years must be reviewed) on brain or spine MRI scan Significant (as defined by the PI) intolerance of presentlyused DMT Use of any nonFDAapproved DMT or systemic corticosteroids in the last 5 years. Use of inhaled or topical steroids are not an exclusion criteria. Use of oral steroids for no greater than 14 days given for a nonMS condition is not exclusionary. Prior use of the following in the past 10 years: alemtuzumab, mitoxantrone, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, cyclosporine, or rituximab Prior use of any experimental agent used as a DMT for MS in the last five years Other significant medical or psychiatric illness, if uncontrolled. Examples: uncontrolled hypertension, uncontrolled diabetes, uncontrolled asthma, or uncontrolled depression Cancers other than basal cell skin cancers within the last 10 years Unable to give informed consent or follow the protocol Unable to undergo brain MRI Unwilling to be randomized per this protocol History of other chronic neurological illnesses that might mimic MS with chronic or intermittent symptoms (i.e. ALS, myasthenia gravis, chronic neuropathy, etc.)</criteria>
