	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial studies how well hypofractionated stereotactic body radiation therapy and fluorouracil or capecitabine with or without zoledronic acid work in treating patients with pancreatic cancer that has spread from where it started to nearby tissue or lymph nodes. Hypofractionated stereotactic body radiation therapy is a specialized radiation therapy that sends higher doses of x-rays over a shorter period of time directly to the tumor using smaller doses over several days and may cause less damage to normal tissue. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as fluorouracil and capecitabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Zoledronic acid is used in cancer patients to reduce cancer symptoms and may make tumor cells more sensitive to radiation. Giving hypofractionated stereotactic body radiation therapy and fluorouracil or capecitabine with or without zoledronic acid may work better in treating patients with pancreatic cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hypofractionated Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy and Fluorouracil or Capecitabine With or Without Zoledronic Acid in Treating Patients With Locally Advanced Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the efficacy of hypofractionated radiation therapy concurrently with zoledronic acid (Zometa). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To examine the toxicity of Zometa while it is used concurrently with hypofractionated radiation therapy. II. To evaluate local failure-free survival and overall survival, surgical resection rate and tumor response rate. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To quantify the amplitude of the expression of genes that are involved in cholesterol biosynthesis (ACAT2, DHCR7, ELFN2, FASN, SC4MOL, and SQLE) in pancreatic tumor tissue prior to and following the Zometa and radiation therapy if the pancreatic cancer tissue is available. II. To measure Zometa pharmacokinetics at steady-state. III. To evaluate tumor and organ motion with 4 dimension(D) computed tomography (CT) and respiratory gating system and to evaluate the effect of tumor/organ motion on the dosimetry, local control and survival. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms. ARM A: Patients undergo hypofractionated stereotactic body radiation therapy in 5 fractions on days 1-5. Patients receive fluorouracil intravenously (IV) over 24 hours on day 1 weekly for 4 weeks or capecitabine orally (PO) every 12 hours 5 days per week starting the evening before day 1 of radiation therapy for 4 weeks as per standard of care. Patients then undergo surgery 6-8 weeks after completion of radiation therapy. ARM B: Patients receive zoledronic acid IV over no less than 15 minutes 1 week prior to radiation therapy.Patients undergo hypofractionated stereotactic body radiation therapy and receive treatment with fluorouracil IV or capecitabine PO as in Arm A. Patients then undergo surgery 6-8 weeks after completion of radiation therapy. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days, every 3 months for the first year, every 4 months for the second year, and then every 6 months thereafter.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Pathologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the pancreas; patients with either initially diagnosed or recurrent locally advanced disease; the maximum dimension of the treatment target must be =&lt;10 cm; locally advanced disease defined as: T34 NxMo, or borderline resectable and unresectable adenocarcinoma without distant metastatic disease or resectable T34 NxMo disease or M1 with controlled distant disease Karnofsky performance status of 60% or better Patients who received recent chemotherapy for pancreatic cancer are eligible; patients who received chemotherapy &gt; 5 years ago for malignancies other than pancreatic cancer are also eligible, provided that chemotherapy was completed &gt; 5 years ago and that there is no evidence of the second malignancy at the time of study entry Patients who received radiation therapy &gt; 5 years ago for malignancies other than pancreatic cancer and whose radiation therapy field is not overlapping with the 20% isodose line of current radiation field are eligible, provided that radiation therapy was completed &gt; 5 years ago and that there is no evidence of the second malignancy at the time of study entry All malignant disease must be able to be encompassed within a single irradiation field All patients must have radiographically assessable disease Patients must have an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater than or equal to 1500/uL Platelet count greater than or equal to 100,000/uL Patients must have a serum creatinine less than or equal to 2.0 mg/dL and total bilirubin less than or equal to 2.0 mg/dL in the absence of biliary obstruction; if the patient has biliary obstruction, biliary decompression will be required; either endoscopic placement of a biliary stent or percutaneous transhepatic drainage is acceptable; once biliary drainage has been established, institution of protocol therapy may proceed when the total bilirubin falls to 4.0 mg/dL or lower) The patient must be aware of the neoplastic nature of his/her disease and willingly provide written, informed consent after being informed of the procedure to be followed, the experimental nature of the therapy, alternatives, potential benefits, sideeffects, risks, and discomforts Patients who cannot undergo staging laparoscopy; for example, this may include patients with a prior history of multiple abdominal operations in which laparoscopy may not be technically feasible or potentially harmful; the patient is eligible if they have a common bile duct stent adjacent to the tumor that may be used as an internal marker, or if the patient has already had a staging laparoscopy without marker implantation and the markers can be implanted (by interventional radiology) prior to the beginning of radiation therapy Patients with a known allergy to Zometa or to antiemetics appropriate for administration in conjunction with protocoldirected therapy Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active infection requiring intravenous antibiotics, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, or serious, uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia, that might jeopardize the ability of the patient to receive the therapy program outlined in this protocol with reasonable safety Pregnant and nursing women are excluded from this study Patients with prior malignancy will be excluded except for adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, adequately treated noninvasive carcinomas, or other cancers from which the patient has been diseasefree for at least 5 years Patients with active duodenal ulcer or bleeding or history of a gastrointestinal fistula or perforation or other significant bowel problems (severe nausea, vomiting, inflammatory bowel disease and significant bowel resection) Patients with known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, or hepatic insufficiency Patients may not be receiving or have received Zometa during/or within 3 weeks prior to treatment with Zometa</criteria>
