	<detailed_description>Bioresorbable stents are promising in treatment of coronary artery disease. The concept of bifurcation treatment using BRS is particular appealing as struts covering the side branch ostium may resorb over time. The aim of this study is to investigate the feasibility and safety of the Magmaris BRS for treatment of coronary bifurcation lesions. Hypothesis: treatment of coronary bifurcation lesions using the Magmaris BRS is safe and feasible. Methods: The study is a proof-of-concept, prospective, single arm study with inclusion of 10 patients. Planned 1-month follow-up by optical coherence tomography (OCT) and follow-up for clinical endpoints until 5 years. Written informed consent is required before the procedure is performed. Eligible patients with a bifurcation lesion are treated by the provisional technique with mandatory jailing of the side branch and provisional opening of side branch ostium by the mini-kiss technique in case of severe pinching or TIMI-flow less than III. Proximal post-dilatation is mandatory. No dilatation beyond the expansion limits of the stent. At baseline, the target lesion is assessed by OCT before, during and after implantation of the Magmaris BRS. OCT assessment is performed again at 1-month follow-up, or before if the patient is readmitted with a possible target lesion failure. The operator is not blinded to the OCT images as pre-PCI images should be used for sizing and positioning of the stent, and procedural OCT images are used to optimize stent implantation before performing final OCT.</detailed_description>
