	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to explore the efficacy and feasibility of an integrated, prescriptive, and trackable wellness intervention combining five wellness elements including exercise, mindfulness, sleep, social connectedness, and nutrition in Beloit College students. This program is called "WILD 5 Wellness: A 30-Day Intervention". Results for this study will be quantified through the use of standardized self-report questionnaires administered prior to and after students complete the WILD 5 program (Group 1) or 30 days of inactive participation (Group 2), and again approximately 30 days later when the initially inactive group (Group 2) will have just completed their active participation in the WILD 5 program and the first WILD 5 group (Group 1) will be approximately 30 days out from completion of their WILD 5 active portion. Data will be collected to evaluate participants' adherence and response to each element of WILD 5, a 5-pronged 30-day wellness intervention. It is expected that this 30-day integrated, prescriptive, and trackable program will be found to be an efficacious wellness intervention for Beloit College students as compared to the control (inactive) group of students not participating in the Active program.</brief_summary>
