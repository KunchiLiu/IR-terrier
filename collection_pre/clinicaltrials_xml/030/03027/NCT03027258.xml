	<brief_summary>The investigators propose to adopt sustainable community networks (in this case churches) to implement an integrated community-based screening that incorporates mobile health technology (mHealth) to make prenatal results available at the point-of-delivery and a simplified medical decision algorithm to guide medical management.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Point-of-Delivery Prenatal Test Results Through mHealth to Improve Birth Outcome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators will develop and test the feasibility, acceptability, and usability of a web-based database and medical decision model that captures results for HIV, Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and sickle cell genotype obtained from participants during the Healthy Beginning Initiative (HBI) program; store data in a secure, web-based database; encrypt data on a "smart card" which is given to participants, and make these data available at the point-of-delivery using a cell-phone application to read the "smart card". Data on the web-based database can also be accessed directly using the cell phone application. Evidence exists that when clinician have maternal records available at the point of delivery, they are more likely to initiate antiretroviral prophylaxis for HIV-exposed infants, administer the first dose of hepatitis B vaccine with 24 hours for infants born to women who have positive hepatitis B surface antigen and screen infants born to mothers with sickle cell trait to allow early identification and initiation of penicillin prophylaxis for infants who have sickle cell disease. The ultimate endpoint of the Phase III trial is a reduction in mortality among children with sickle cell disease and prevention of perinatal transmission of HIV and HBV infections. This proposal is collaboration among Sunrise Foundation (local PEPFAR-supported partner in Nigeria); the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (concept mapping, focus group and key informant interviews); Xavier University (data management and analysis) and the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (overall oversight and evaluation of program effectiveness).</detailed_description>
