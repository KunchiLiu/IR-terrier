	<brief_summary>The investigators propose a small pilot proof of concept study to not only prove the existence of, but also probe the mechanisms underlying cardio-renal effects of empagliflozin in patients with heart failure. The investigators propose a 50 patient randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study with patients with stable HF, type II diabetes and an eGFR &gt;45ml/min/1.73 m2 who are chronically receiving loop diuretics.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Empagliflozin in Heart Failure: Diuretic and Cardio-Renal Effects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Objectives 1. Study the acute/short term effect and cardio-renal mechanisms of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibition in patients with heart failure. 2. Determine the effect of chronic combined SLLGT2 and loop diuretic exposure in patients with heart failure. Primary Outcomes 1. Aim 1 (Acute): Determine if acute SGLT2 inhibition will improve the natriuretic effect of a loop diuretic compared to placebo. 2. Aim 2 (Chronic): Determine the effect of 14 days of SGLT2 inhibition on blood volume.</detailed_description>
