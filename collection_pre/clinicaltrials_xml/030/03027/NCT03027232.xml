	<brief_summary>The protocol is to draw peripheral blood from healthy volunteers for in vitro studies. The aims of these in vitro studies are to determine the cellular and intracellular mechanisms by which hypertonic saline and ATP release regulate neutrophil and lymphocyte functions.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Control of Leukocyte Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The proper regulation of leukocyte function is critical for immune defense and to prevent autoimmune diseases. Many aspects of immune cell regulation are unknown. A better understanding could lead to novel therapeutic approaches to improve immune function in patients suffering from various diseases. The investigators have found that hypertonic conditions regulate leukocyte functions through feedback mechanisms involving ATP release and purinergic receptors. The purpose of the proposed protocol is to obtain access to peripheral blood from healthy volunteers to study these complex regulatory mechanisms in more detail.</detailed_description>
