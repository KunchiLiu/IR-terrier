	<brief_summary>Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a progressive disease that affects mainly small and medium joints and, in the absence of appropriate background therapy, leads to progressive joint destruction, functional, psychological, social and occupational repercussions. Several biomedicine treat this pathology, including rituximab (RTX). It is recommended to evaluate the therapeutic response to RTX and re-administer it from the 24th week when the goal of remission has not been achieved. However, the optimal modality for reprocessing remains to be determined. To this end, different approaches have been explored, such as lymphocyte typing or ultrasound monitoring. The pace of these examinations, however, remains wide and their cost is not negligible. This is why we propose here to explore the track of a tight follow-up nurse DAS28. The hypothesis is that a tight nursing follow-up can detect the symptomatic recovery earlier than the current medical follow-up.
