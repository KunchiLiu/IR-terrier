	<brief_summary>This is a randomized controlled trial designed to test an intervention (Remote ischemic preconditioning) in patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy (CEA).Remote ischemic preconditioning(RIPC) with transient upper limb ischemia/reperfusion is a novel, simple, cost-free,non-pharmacological and non-invasive strategy.The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of Remote Ischaemic Preconditioning on perioperative ischaemic injury in patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy compared to control intervention.The outcomes of interest include neurocognitive function,clinical outcomes,and biomarkers of brain injury.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) protocol will be induced during anesthesia by 3 cycles of 5-min upper limb ischemia and 5-min reperfusion using a blood pressure cuff inflated to a pressure 200mmHg</detailed_description>
