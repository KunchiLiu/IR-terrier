	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to describe the diaphragm electromyographic activity (Edi) in healthy lung patients due to obtain a reference to guide the weaning in those patients</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Diaphragmatic Activity During Weaning With NAVA, a Pilot Study (NAVA: Neurally Adjusted Ventilatory Assist)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We obtained the Edi recording data at each NAVA level during the weaning in NAVA group, and we compared the respiratory parameters between the PSV and NAVA groups</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Patients who were scheduled for elective major surgery in which admission to the CCU (critical care unit) for postoperative care and shortterm mechanical ventilation with rapid weaning were anticipated. Preoperative altered central nervous system, neuromuscular or lung disease and ASA (american society of anesthesiologists) classification group IV or NYHA (New York heart association) class IV in the case of cardiac patients. At the CCU, before randomisation, we also excluded patients requiring reoperation, and those who exhibited significant postsurgical bleeding, the development of myocardial infarction, and hemodynamic instability.</criteria>
