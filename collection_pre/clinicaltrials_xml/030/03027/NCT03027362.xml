	<brief_summary>The goals of this study are: 1) to investigate the efficacy of combining ketamine with intensive cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) to sustain the antidepressant effects of ketamine; and 2) to determine ketamine's delayed effects on learning and memory, and to explore the relationship between any ketamine-induced changes in learning and memory and duration of antidepressant efficacy, with and without CBT augmentation. Subjects with a diagnosis of MDD who are treatment-resistant to at least 2 antidepressants and have chosen to pursue clinical ketamine treatment at Yale Psychiatric Hospital will be recruited for the study.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Suffering from a major depressive episode based on Diagnostic and Statistical manual (DSM) 5 criteria and having failed one or more standard antidepressant treatments during the current episode Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (17HAMD) score of 21 or more prior to ketamine treatment. Planned clinical treatment with ketamine at Yale Psychiatric Hospital (YPH) As the purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility and efficacy of CBT to sustain the antidepressant effects of ketamine, only those who achieve a clinical response (i.e., 50% reduction in depression symptoms, as measured by the MontgomeryAsberg Depressive Rating Scale (MADRS) will be eligible for randomization. Patients must be treatment resistant to at least two drugs used to treat depression. Any Axis I or Axis II Disorder, which at screening is clinically predominant to their depressive episode or has been predominant to their depressive episode at any time within 6 months prior to screening Active suicidal thoughts with a plan Current or recent (&lt;6 months ago) substance use disorder Nonaffective psychosis (such as schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder) Inability to speak English fluently A clinically significant abnormality on the screening physical examination that might affect safety, study participation, or confound interpretation of study results Dementia, delirium, or any other neurological or mental disease that might affect cognition or the ability to meaningfully participate in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).</criteria>
