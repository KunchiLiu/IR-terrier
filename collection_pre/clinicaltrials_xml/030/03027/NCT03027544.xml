	<detailed_description>This is a single-arm, single center, phase II trial to investigate the feasibility and toxicity of tomotherapy for refractory brain metastases, which are defined as A: multiple brain metastases(≥3 lesions); B: large brain metastases(with one lesion's volume is no smaller than 6cc or the longest diameter is no shorter than 3cm); C: meningeal metastases.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologic or cytologic diagnosis of primary tumor and conformed brain metastases by enhanced MRI or CT; the lesion number is no less than 3; or the tumor volume is no smaller than 6cc; or tumor diameter is no shorter than 3cm; or uncontrolled brain tumor after whole brain radiotherapy(WBRT); or the tumor is adjacent to essential structures of the brain, such as brain stem, optic chiasma, optic tract, etc; KPS ≥60,or KPS ≥40 and the limitation of motion is simply caused by brain tumor that is adjacent to the motor function areas; Age: 1875 years old; Adequate endorgan function: WBC≥4.0x109/L Neu ≥ 1.5x109/L Hemoglobin ≥ 110 g/L Platelets ≥100 x109/L Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5x ULN AST and ALT ≤ 1.5x ULN BUN and Cr: within the normal range. • Other clinically significant diseases (e.g.myocardial infarction within the past 6 months, severe arrhythmia). Unable or unwilling to comply with the study protocol. The expected survival time is less than 3 months. Patients who are anticipated in other clinical trials of brain metastases. Patients who has been treated with SRT in other hospitals Pregnant patients or female patients whose HCG is positive Unsuitable to participate in study, that in the opinion of the treating physician.</criteria>
