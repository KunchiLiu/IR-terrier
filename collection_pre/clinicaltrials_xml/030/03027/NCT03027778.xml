	<brief_summary>The purpose of this pilot study is to evaluate 1) the effect of intradialytic pedaling exercise on arterial stiffness and other arterial hemodynamic parameters over 4 months, and 2) the longer-term effect of pedaling on arterial stiffness and other arterial hemodynamic parameters 4 months after finishing the exercise intervention (8 months after study initiation). The investigators also aim to examine the impact of intradialytic pedaling exercise on general health, anthropometric measures, physical function, and routine laboratory blood markers as secondary outcome measures, as well as to assess feasibility, safety and adverse events associated with the intradialytic pedalling exercise. Qualitative assessments will be conducted among participants to evaluate the acceptability, feasibility and sustainability of intradialytic pedalling exercise. Recruitment of more participants in the future will be considered if warranted.</brief_summary>
