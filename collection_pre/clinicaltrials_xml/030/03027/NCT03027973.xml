	<brief_title>Quality of Life Outcomes for Ulipristal Acetate and Tranexamic Acid in the Management of Heavy Menstrual Bleeding</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>UPA is approved by Health Canada for the treatment of signs and symptoms of uterine fibroids in adult women of reproductive age who are eligible for surgery. UPA is considered investigational for this study, as it has not been approved by Health Canada for the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding in women who do not have uterine fibroids. TEA is approved by Health Canada for prevention or reduction of bleeding in different conditions, including heavy periods. This treatment is available as part of routine care for regular heavy menstrual bleeding and is being used as the comparison treatment in this study.</detailed_description>
