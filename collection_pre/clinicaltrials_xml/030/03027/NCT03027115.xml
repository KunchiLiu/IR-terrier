	<brief_title>Hernia Surgery Urinary Retention</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study will be to investigate whether pre-operative treatment with a selective alpha1-adrenoceptor antagonist affects the likelihood of male patients developing post-operative urinary retention following hernia repair surgery. It is also of interest to determine whether or not a well-known urological screening tool, the IPSS, can identify patients at risk for urinary retention following elective laparoscopic or open hernia repair surgery. We will investigate if it is possible to pre-treat patients with a selective alpha1-adrenoceptor antagonist which we think can reduce the incidence of post-operative urinary retention and the associated adverse consequences, especially in those patients at higher risk.</detailed_description>
