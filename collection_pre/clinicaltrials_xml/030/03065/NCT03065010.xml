	<brief_summary>A Multicenter Open-label Non-comparative 2-Stage Phase 1a/1b Study to Assess the Safety and Pharmacokinetics of Oral BCD-115 (JSC BIOCAD, Russia) in Combination with Endocrine Therapy in Women with ER(+) HER2(-) Local Advanced and Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of BCD-115 in Women With ER(+) HER2(-) Local Advanced and Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multicentre dose-finding open-label non-comparative phase Ia/Ib clinical trial for investigation of the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics of BCD-115 administered p.o. with intrapatient dose escalation in the population of patients with ER(+) HER2(-) advanced breast cancer in combination with a standard dose of endocrine therapy. The trial will be conducted in two stages: Stage 1 - finding of the maximum tolerated dose, determination of the recommended dose for Stage 2. Stage 2 - study of the recommended dose from Stage 1 of BCD-115, analysis of tolerability and safety of selected dose/doses in additional cohorts, and determination of the estimated therapeutic dose/doses for further clinical studies.</detailed_description>
