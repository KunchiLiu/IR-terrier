	<brief_summary>The feasibility randomised controlled trial is part of the EU funded project "PreventIT" (2016-2018) responding to the Horizon 2020, Personalised health and care (PHC), call PHC-21: Advancing active and healthy ageing with ICT: Early risk detection and intervention. The PreventIT project focuses on a new behaviour change activity approach for young older adults (61-70 years of age) with an overall aim of early prevention of functional decline and to empower people to take care of their own health.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The PreventIT Trial in Young Older Adults, Comparing Two Lifestyle-integrated Exercise Interventions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this feasibility randomised controlled trial two interventions are compared with a control group. The aLiFE programme includes instructor and paper manual delivery of life-style integrated activities, while the eLiFE programme delivers the same activities by use of smartphone and smartwatch applications. The control group is asked to follow the World Health Organisation's physical activity recommendations. The main aim is to assess feasibility of the aLiFE and eLiFE programmes and a second aim to suggest sample size and design for a future Phase III clinical trial. OBJECTIVES: How is the feasibility of having young older adults (between 61-70 years) to perform the aLiFE and eLiFE interventions. Specifically: 1. Participation: How is the adherence of specific activities and to the entire aLiFE and eLiFE interventions of young older adults? 2. Technology: How is the feasibility and usability of the eLiFE intervention delivered using smartphones and smartwatches as platform, regarding user interface, goal setting, feedback, motivational messages, and social interaction? 3. Outcome measures: How is the risk reduction of functional decline, measured by the Later Life Function and Disability Instrument and behavioural complexity, for the aLiFE and the eLiFE interventions compared to a control group, and what are the estimates of effect sizes for the primary and secondary study outcome measure? 4. Health economics evaluation: Is it feasible to collect data on, and estimate, health care resource utilization, costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and model incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of aLiFE, eLiFE compared with the control group over a 6-month, 12-month, and 24-month time horizon? The study is approved by the three ethical sites prior to study start.</detailed_description>
