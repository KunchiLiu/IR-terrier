	<criteria>a. Patients must be over 18 years old and capable and willing to provide informed consent. b. Patients of childbearing potential must have a negative urine or serum pregnancy test within 7 days prior to PET/CT imaging per institution's standard of care; c. A female of childbearing potential is any woman (regardless of sexual orientation, having undergone a tubal ligation, or remaining celibate by choice) who meets the following criteria; i. Has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or ii. Has not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 12 consecutive months (i.e., has had menses at any time in the preceding 12 consecutive months). d. Medically stable as judged by patient's physician. e. Life expectancy must be estimated at &gt; 6 months. f. Patients must have an ECOG performance status of 03 (restricted to ECOG PS 02 if age &gt;70 years). g. Patients with known allergic or hypersensitivity reactions to previously administered radiopharmaceuticals of similar chemical or biologic composition to FES are NOT eligible. h. Patients with liver failure are NOT eligible. i. Patient must NOT be breastfeeding. j. Histologically confirmed metastatic breast cancer k. Primary tumor and/or metastatic site must be ER+ and may be progesteronereceptor positive (PgR+) or progesteronereceptor negative (PgR) by IHC. Patients with a history of an estrogenreceptor negative (ER) primary tumor and a documented ER+ metastatic site are eligible. l. Patients receiving molecular targeted therapy (such as everolimus or palbociclib) or HER2 directed therapy, in addition to endocrine therapy are NOT eligible. m. Patients with a history of adjuvant endocrine therapy is allowed, as long as the date of diagnosis of metastatic disease is &gt; 2 years following initiation of adjuvant endocrine therapy. Patients who develop metastatic disease while still receiving adjuvant endocrine therapy must have a change in the type of endocrine agent used for subsequent metastatic disease treatment. Patients on blocking adjuvant therapy (with a blocking agent such as toremifene or tamoxifen) must be off the agents for a minimum of 60 days to allow for adequate uptake of FES n. Patients with human epidermal growth factor2 positive (HER2+) metastatic tumors are NOT eligible o. Postmenopausal women, men, or premenopausal women for whom endocrine therapy alone (tamoxifen, aromatase inhibitor (AI) with or without ovarian suppression is planned for standard clinical care, after FESPET/CT is completed p. Disease may be measurable (by RECIST 1.1 criteria) or nonmeasurable but must be present in at least one nonliver site, 1.5 cm or greater and visualized on PET/CT with [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). Patients with effusion only disease or disease only in the liver are not eligible for the study q. Patient must be able to lie still for a 20 to 30 minute PET/CT scan. Patients not meeting inclusion criteria.</criteria>
