	<detailed_description>The aim of this study was to evaluate the immediate effects of diaphragmatic release techniques on posterior chain flexibility and lumbar spine amplitude; Respiratory muscle strength and chest cavity mobility in healthy women. This is an intervention study with a randomized controlled trial design. The randomized study in two groups, the Intervention Group in which two diaphragmatic release techniques were performed and the Control Group where two placebo techniques were applied in 75 participants between 18 and 35 years of age.
