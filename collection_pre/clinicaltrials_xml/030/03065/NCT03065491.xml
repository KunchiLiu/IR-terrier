	<brief_summary>A large body of evidence confirm the cholesterol lowering effect of red yeast rice, phytosterols and L-tyrosol. Because their mechanisms of action mime the ones of chemical statins and cholesterol absorption inhibitors, it is plausible that their association will provide a more relevant (and safe) LDL cholesterolemia reduction.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Red Yeast Rice, Phytosterols and L-tyrosol on Lipid Profile and Endothelial Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>European Food Safety Authority approves some health claim related to the cardiometabolic effects of some nutraceuticals, and in particular of red yeast rice, phytosterols and L-tyrosol. In a previous study the investigators have already demonstrated the synergistic effect of red yeast rice and phytosterols in term of lipid-lowering activity. Preliminary data suggest that these nutraceuticals could also exert a positive effect on vascular health beyond the direct effects on serum lipids. No data are available on the combined effects of these dietary supplement in humans.</detailed_description>
