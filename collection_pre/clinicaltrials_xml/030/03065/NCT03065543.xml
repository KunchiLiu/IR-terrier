	<brief_summary>A study conducted to evaluate the efficacy of lipid-lowering therapy in patients with high and very high risk treated by interventional cardiology. Study endpoints: 1. Achievement of the target LDL-C at 1-year follow-up LDL-C &lt;70 mg / dl in the group of very high-risk and LDL-C &lt;100 mg / dL in high-risk patients 2. Assessment of the lipid profile of the severity of coronary artery disease in patients undergoing invasive diagnosis of coronary artery disease 3. Evaluation of trends in the treatment of lipid-lowering in patients in different years</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hyperlipidemia Therapy TERCET Zabrze Registry</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The TERCET Zabrze Registry is an observational study of all patients hospitalized due to the cardiovascular diseases. The date include information on the hyperlipidaemia treatment, clinical characteristics, any treatment modalities and prognosis in this population. Data collection is patient-based (not event-based). The study population is formed by all-comer patients hospitalized in cardiology wards and intensive cardiac care units with a diagnosis of coronary disease, both stable angina, and acute coronary syndromes (ACS). For the purpose of this study hyperlipidaemia is defined in accordance with European Society of Cardiology guidelines. Complete patient demographics; medical history, complete hospitalization data (diagnostic and therapeutic), in-hospital and out-hospital results are collected in an electronic form by the attending physician. The patients are under constant follow-up for all cause mortality and major adverse events.</detailed_description>
