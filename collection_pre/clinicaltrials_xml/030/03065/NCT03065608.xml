	<brief_summary>Temporomandibular joints dysfunction is a functional disorder concern with the abnormal functioning of the muscles of the stomatognathic system, temporomandibular joints involved in the dynamic movements of the jaw and surrounding structures. The aim of the study was to compare the level of C-reactive protein in patients with pain and painless form of temporomandibular joints dysfunction.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Temporomandibular joints dysfunction is a functional disorder concern with the abnormal functioning of the muscles of the stomatognathic system, temporomandibular joints involved in the dynamic movements of the jaw and surrounding structures. The aim of the study was to compare the level of C-reactive protein in patients with pain and painless form of temporomandibular joints dysfunction. Material and methods The research material consisted of 72 patients who reported to the prosthetic treatment because of temporomandibular joint dysfunction. The study group included 36 patients with pain form of dysfunction, and control group - 36 patients with painless form of disorder. Each patient underwent specialized examination of functional disorders, in order to diagnose the type of dysfunction and commissioned to carry out a study of the blood test concern with evaluation of the C-reactive protein (CRP) level in the same analytical laboratory. The results of the investigation were subjected to statistical analysis.</detailed_description>
