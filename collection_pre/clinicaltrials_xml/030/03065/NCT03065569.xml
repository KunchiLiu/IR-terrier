	<brief_title>A Comparison of Epidural Techniques for Labour Analgesia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Epidurals are the most common form of pain relief in labour. There are two techniques in use at the moment to place the epidural: epidural or combined spinal epidural (CSE). CSE has been shown to work faster and provide better pain relief than epidural alone. The investigators aim to show that CSE also requires less medication over the course of labour as this may mean it has fewer side effects. The amount of medication needed during labour between the two different techniques given in a standardized way will be compared.</detailed_description>
