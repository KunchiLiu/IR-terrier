	<brief_title>Breathing Counts: Evaluating Adherence in the Presence of Asthma Navigation Support</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will aim to use technology to evaluate the effectiveness of a patient navigator for childhood asthma. The Investigators will place adherence monitoring devices on patient inhalers, and track use of patient asthma medicines. The Investigators will also utilize an asthma navigator who will discuss adherence with families and help to address any barriers to adherence that families identify. Additionally, the navigator will communicate patient specific adherence information to the patient's primary care physician (PCP) and school nurse. The adherence monitor will monitor communications between these providers.</detailed_description>
