	<brief_summary>This is a prospective, 24-month, longitudinal study of patients planning to undergo bariatric surgery (Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass or Sleeve Gastrectomy) in which we aim to identify correlates and predictors of observed weight loss trajectories following bariatric surgery. This approach will expand current knowledge by examining the combined impact of empirically supported behavioral and biological data in a large sample over time. Intensive measurement of problematic eating behaviors, mood, and compliance with diet and exercise regimens post-surgery will be analyzed in the context of lterations in parallel with, or in response to, changes observed in the gut microbiota. Identifying these post-surgical predictors of weight loss and comorbidity resolution will allow for the development of individualized interventions to optimize surgery-related outcomes.</brief_summary>
