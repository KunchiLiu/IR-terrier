	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the ocular hypotensive effect of the Hydrus Aqueous Implant (Standard and Low-Profile), as determined by the change in IOP from baseline (preoperative) and change in the number of glaucoma medications from baseline.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy Study of the Hydrus Aqueous Implant in Subjects With POAG</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, multi-center study that will examine subjects with documented mild to advanced primary open angle glaucoma (POAG), who may or may not have a cataract requiring removal and placement of an intraocular lens. Study subjects will be grouped by the severity of their disease (either mild/moderate or advanced). If all inclusion and exclusion criteria are met subjects in all four groups will be implanted with the Hydrus Aqueous Implant. Subjects in whom a cataract is present will undergo standard cataract removal and IOL implantation concurrent with implantation of the Hydrus. Postoperatively, subjects will undergo a complete ophthalmic evaluation at regularly scheduled intervals.</detailed_description>
