	<brief_summary>Introduction and evaluation of a new technique for socket preservation involving internal expansion of the buccal plate of the extraction socket using internal flapless corticotomy and bone grafting the extraction socket with application of bioresorbable membrane biomaterials in comparison with the conventional guided bone regeneration technique for a conventional socket preservation method hoping to maintain or improve hard and soft tissue contour of the alveolar ridge post tooth extraction.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients requiring tooth extraction in the maxillary anterior teeth and premolars ranging to the second premolar. Cause of tooth extraction is due to caries, trauma or failed endodontic treatment. Only teeth with intact buccal bone plate will be considered for this study. Patients who are cooperative, motivated and hygiene conscious. Patients whose age is &gt;18 years Systemic conditions/disease that contraindicated surgery. Patients on drugs that may compromise bone healing. Radiation therapy in the head and neck region or chemotherapy during the 12 months prior to surgery. Smokers. Patients with Psychologic disorder.
