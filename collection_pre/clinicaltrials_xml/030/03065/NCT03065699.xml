	<brief_summary>The First-In-Man study is a multi-centre, randomised, controlled, study to generate data for the evaluation of safety and performance of DIALIVE Liver Dialysis Device in 24 evaluable patients with Acute on Chronic Liver Failure (ACLF) versus standard of care (SOC).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Performance Trial of DIALIVE Liver Dialysis Device in Acute On Chronic Liver Failure Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The First-In-Man study will evaluate the safety and performance of DIALIVE Liver Dialysis Device in Acute on Chronic Liver Failure (ACLF) patients and will compare the outcome with patients treated under standard of care (SOC). The hypothesis is that DIALIVE will significantly improve the prognosis of ACLF patients by modulating systemic inflammation. The target patient population are men and women ≥18 years, ≤81yr. Patients with ACLF grade 1 and ACLF grade 2 on the background of alcoholic cirrhosis. Treatment will be undertaken in an intensive care (ICU) or renal dialysis unit setting if the patients are randomised to the DIALIVE treatment arm. For patients randomised to the 'Standard of care' arm, the location of treatment (ICU or general ward) will be determined by their clinical need and will be decided by the site Principal Investigator. This project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 733057.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Male or female subjects aged ≥18 years ≤81yr who have given informed consent to participate in the study and are able to understand and comply with the requirements of the study. History indicative of alcoholrelated cirrhosis based on clinical, radiological and/or histological evidence. History of an acute decompensating event (including but not limited to ascites, gastrointestinal bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy and/or acute bacterial infections), occurring within ≤6 weeks of screening. Subject meets the definition of ACLF Grade 1 or Grade 2 (using the CLIFC OF score system [Moreau et al. Gastroenterology 2013; Jalan et al. J Hepatol 2014]). Where a subject has received corticosteroids for alcoholinduced ACLF, is unresponsive to at least 7 days of treatment (where lack of response defined as a reduction in bilirubin &lt;25% over a 7 day treatment period). No evidence of untreated infection. Where a subject has one or more underlying infections, he/she may be entered into the study provided that appropriate antibiotics (as determined by the investigator) have been administered for at least 48 hours prior to randomisation. Coinfection with HIV and AIDS defining illness. Subjects with acute or subacute liver failure without underlying cirrhosis. Subjects with severe thrombocytopaenia, defined by the platelet count of &lt; 40,000 / mm3 or rapid reduction in platelet count (&gt; 50% reduction) 24 hrs prior to inclusion. Subjects with cirrhosis who develop decompensation at any time in the postoperative period following partial hepatectomy. Subjects with evidence of uncontrolled infection. Subjects with chronic and/or preexisting kidney disease defined as eGFR (estimated glomerular filtration rate) &lt;30 mL/min for 3 months or longer prior to screening. Subjects with hypotension requiring the use of vasopressors (other than terlipressin for the treatment of hepatorenal syndrome, or following variceal bleeding). Subjects with evidence of significant and/or uncontrolled bleeding; patients with gastrointestinal bleeding can be enrolled 48 hours after the control of bleeding. Hepatic encephalopathy Grade 3 or 4 (West Haven Criteria). Subjects with active or history of non hepatic malignancy unless adequately treated or in complete remission for five or more years. Patients with HCC outside Milan criteria. Significant systemic or major illness other than liver disease, including coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, pulmonary disease, renal failure, serious psychiatric disease, that, in the opinion of the Investigator would preclude the subject from participating in and completing the study. Any subject who has received any investigational drug or device within 30 days of dosing or who is scheduled to receive another investigational drug or device in the course of the study; concomitant observational studies are allowed. Uncontrolled seizures. Subjects diagnosed with CreutzfeldtJakob disease. If female: known pregnancy or lactating. Subjects unable to consent for themselves.</criteria>
