	<brief_summary>During pregnancy, pregnant women adopt an atypical pattern position with the intention to maintain stability and balance.These postural changes can cause instability at the level of the sacroiliac joint with painful condition during pregnancy and postpartum. 40 % of women have postpartum lumbopelvic instability. In 17 % of cases the lumbopelvic pain is perpetuated. Another alteration influenced by the gestational status and progress of labor is urinary incontinence (UI). The mechanism developed by Masai Barefoot Technology (MBT) provides an unstable base. Some studies reviewed, indicate that this shoe increases muscle activity, contributes to the decrease of joint overload and thereby, decreases pain. Objective To compare the efficacy of shoes with unstable sole MBTÂ®, over the use of conventional sports shoes, in primiparous women with lumbopelvic postpartum pain. Material and Methods Randomized clinical trial. 24 postpartum women from the Gynecology Service of the Hospital Universitario Madrid Chiron were included in the study. The subjects were randomly divided into experimental and control group.</brief_summary>
