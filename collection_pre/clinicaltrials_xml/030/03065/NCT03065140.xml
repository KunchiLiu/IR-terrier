	<brief_summary>Early research found that high levels of fat within muscle meant poorer control of blood sugar. However, more recent research has shown that athletes have similar levels of fat within muscle, but in contrast, they have very good control of blood sugar. The investigators are not sure why this is and want to find out if the fat within muscle can be changed to improve blood sugar control, as good blood sugar control reduces the risk of heart disease, diabetes and stroke.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Muscle Fat Compartments and Turnover as Determinant of Insulin Sensitivity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Higher levels of triglycerides (TG) and diacylglycerols (DAG) are found in skeletal muscle of patients with obesity/diabetes as well as in trained athletes. Despite similar metabolic storage, patients and athletes have opposite insulin sensitivity phenotypes and an explanation for this is lacking. The investigators' objective is to understand how these fat compartments can be beneficially modulated to improve insulin resistance and cardio-metabolic risk. The investigators will investigate if either structural differences (saturated versus unsaturated balance of TG and DAG side-chains) or different handling abilities (fast versus slow lipid pool turnover) will be induced by exercise capacity interventions in athletes and in diabetic patients. In a longitudinal study pre- and post-exercise, the investigators will use novel, non-invasive 1H-Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy to benchmark the saturated/unsaturated compartments against skeletal muscle biopsies for the first time and stable isotope analysis for fat compartments' rate of turnover.</detailed_description>
