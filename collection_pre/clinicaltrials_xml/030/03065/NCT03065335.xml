	<brief_summary>Background: Most medications that treat depression take weeks or months to work. Researchers want to develop fast-acting treatments. One dose of ketamine has a rapid antidepressant effect. For most people, this lasts a week or less. Repeated doses of ketamine may help maintain this effect. Objective: To study the effects of ketamine in treating depression. Eligibility: People ages 18-65 with major depressive disorder and healthy volunteers Design: Participants will be screened in another study, with: - Medical and psychiatric history - Psychiatric and physical exam - Blood, urine, and heart tests Participants will be inpatients at NIH for 4 phases totaling 14-20 weeks. Phase I (2-7 weeks): - Gradually stop current medications - MRI: Participants lie and perform tasks in a machine that takes pictures of the body. - Mood and thinking tests - Blood and urine tests - Sleep test: Monitors on the skin record brain waves, breathing, heart rate, and movement during sleep. - Transcranial magnetic stimulation: A coil on the scalp gives an electrical current that affects brain activity. - Stress tests: Electrodes on the skin measure reactions to loud noises or electric shocks. Phase I tests are repeated in Phases II and III and in the final visit. Phase II (4 5 weeks): - 4 weekly IV infusions of ketamine or a placebo during an MRI or MEG. For the MEG, a cone over the head records brain activity. Phase III (optional): - 8 infusions of ketamine over 4 weeks Phase IV (optional): - Symptoms monitoring for 4 weeks - Participants will have a final visit. They will be offered standard treatment at NIH for up to 2 months.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Neuropharmacologic Imaging and Biomarker Assessments of Response to Acute and Repeated-Dosed Ketamine Infusions in Major Depressive Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective Intravenous ketamine and other glutamatergic modulating agents have demonstrated rapid improvement in depressive symptoms. In previous investigations conducted by our group, a non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist (i.e. ketamine) was effective in patients who had failed at least 2 antidepressant treatments (i.e. treatment-resistant depression). Response to a single dose of ketamine typically occurred within 2 hours and lasted approximately 1 week. While several studies have investigated acute neural response to ketamine infusion in healthy volunteers, data regarding neuropharmacodynamic effects of ketamine in patients is limited. Therefore, further investigations of biological mechanism and neural correlates of response (or non-response) associated with single dose ketamine administration are needed. Furthermore, few studies have investigated the safety and efficacy of prolonged, repeated administration (i.e., more than one administration) of subanesthetic doses of intravenously infused ketamine to achieve a sustained antidepressant response. Therefore, there is great need and potential in identifying biomarkers of both response to single infusion and to repeated ketamine administration. The current protocol has a two-fold purpose. In the pharmacodynamic imaging phase, we plan to investigate the neuropharmacodynamics of acute ketamine administration in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and healthy volunteers (HV) using functional MRI (fMRI) and electrophysiological modalities [electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG)]. Additionally, we plan to investigate whether specific signatures from functional neuroimaging, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) associated evoked potentials (TMS-EP), sleep EEG (S-EEG), and psychophysiologic responses can be used to classify specific subpopulations of patients with MDD; preliminary findings from such an approach may be important in forging further studies identifying those who will respond to ketamine infusions. In the repeat-dosing phase, we plan to expand upon our previous findings of the immediate efficacy of glutamatergic modulators by investigating the safety and efficacy of repeated dose administrations of IV ketamine infusions for patients with MDD. We plan to include all MDD patients regardless of antidepressant response to single infusions of ketamine to allow for potential identification of MDD patients who are able to eventually attain and/or maintain an antidepressant response over a course of a series of infusions. In an effort to reduce any potential biases due to partial blinding, all patients will be administered ketamine but randomized into either a group who will receive ketamine at 0.5 mg/kg or a group who will receive ketamine at 0.1 mg/kg (an active comparator). Study Population The study population will consist of 50 individuals between the 18 and 65 years of age, with a diagnosis of treatment-resistant Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and 50 age/gender matched healthy volunteer subjects (HV). Within the MDD group, 25 participants will be enrolled into each treatment group in the repeat-dosing phase. Study Design This study is a Phase I Clinical Trial that comprises four phases. Phase I includes screening, medication taper (as needed), medication-free period, and baseline assessments. Some of the baseline assessments include optional tests that are designed to probe neurobiological function: a transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) test with associated evoked potential test (TMS-EP), an overnight sleep adaptation in a sleep lab in preparation for overnight sleep electroencephalography (S-EEG), and a psychophysiology paradigm called the None, Predictive, Unpredictive (NPU)-threat test, and blood samples to assess plasma neurochemicals and peripheral blood biomarkers. In Phase II, all subjects will then receive an alternating series of placebo and ketamine 0.5 mg/kg infusions, occurring once per week, for a total of 4 infusions (2 ketamine and 2 placebo). Patients will be randomized to receive either ketamine first or placebo first; subjects who are randomized to receive ketamine for the first infusion will receive placebo for the second infusion and vice-versa if randomized initially to placebo. Concurrently with each infusion, subjects will be administered either a resting-state (task free) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG), or a resting state magnetoencephalography (MEG) recording such that each subject receives fMRI+EEG and MEG for both a placebo and ketamine infusion. Of note, subjects for whom one imaging modality is not acquired due to unforeseen issues, may still be administered the other. Therefore, all subjects will potentially participate in both imaging modalities, with the order of the fMRI+EEG and MEG scans counterbalanced across participants. Also during Phase II, if MDD and HV participants have agreed to the optional testing, S-EEG will may be obtained one day prior to and one day after the first two infusions in the series, TMS-EP will may be obtained on the same day of the first two infusions with subsequent testing if a patient responds to any of the first two infusions, and NPU will may be obtained 1-3 days after the first two infusions. Phase III involves participants with MDD whose depression symptoms have relapsed after the final infusion in Phase II.. Patients whose symptoms did not relapse may receive an additional one-week washout before randomization in Phase III. During this phase, subjects will be randomized to receive ketamine at a higher dose of 0.5 mg/kg, or at a lower dose of 0.1 mg/kg (an active comparator) that will occur twice weekly for 4 additional weeks and a total of eight infusions. Optional tests, including S-EEG, TMS-EP, and NPU, may be conducted at specified time points between ketamine infusions. Clinical rating scales will be administered to assess depression symptomology and blood will be drawn for pharmacokinetics testing and biomarker analyses. Phase IV includes MDD participants who completed Phase III and who are responders (defined as MADRS reduced by 50% from baseline) will be followed up for an additional 4 weeks, or until relapse (defined as having 2 consecutive ratings demonstrating less than or equal to 25% improvement from baseline MADRS), to determine durability of response. The final study day includes clinical rating scales, medical evaluations, and blood tests. As a safety measure, the sMRI will be repeated to assess for structural changes that may have occurred as a result of repeated ketamine infusions. Outcome Measures The primary outcome measure of Phase II will be the pharmacodynamic fMRI [(ph)fMRI] and MEG responses to ketamine 0.5 mg/kg compared to placebo. Secondary outcome measures will include the difference in MADRS score from baseline to 24 hours between the placebo and ketamine 0.5mg/kg infusion, correlations between an antidepressant response and TMS-EP, S-EEG, neuroimaging (fMRI+EEG and MEG), and psychophysiology (NPU-threat test) measures. In Phase II, the healthy volunteer (HV) group will act as another level of control to identify a potential neuropharmacodynamic signature associated with an antidepressant response to ketamine. The primary outcome measure for Phase III will be the difference or change of score on the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) from baseline to the end of 4 weeks of twice-weekly ketamine 0.5 mg/kg compared to 0.1 mg/kg. An antidepressant response is defined as a reduction of at least 50% from baseline on the MADRS. Secondary outcome measures include TMS-EP, S-EEG, and psychophysiology (NPU-threat test) measures. Other outcome measures for both Phase II and III include clinical rating scales, neurocognitive tests,: The Amsterdam Resting-State Questionnaire (ARSQ), Barratt Impulsivity Scale (BIS), Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire (BP), Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), Borderline Symptom List (BSL), Clinician-Administered Dissociative State Scale (CADSS), Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS), Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), Discontinuation-Emergent Signs and Symptoms (DESS), Family History Screen (FHS), Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A), Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS), Massachusetts General Hospital Cognitive and Physical Functioning Questionnaire (MGH-CPFQ), Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), Patient-Rated Inventory of Side Effects (PRISE), Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (QIDS), Ruminative Rating Scale (RRS), Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHAPS), Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS), ketamine levels (e.g, ketamine and metabolites), plasma neurochemicals, and peripheral blood biomarkers. Additional outcomes in Phase III are baseline and post-repeated dose infusion 3T MRI scans as well as performance on the Stroop test, Trail Making Test (TMT), immediate recall assessment from the California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT), and the Spatial Span Test. The clinical rating scales outcomes measures of Phase IV are the BIS, BP, BPRS, BSL, CADSS, C-SSRS, CTQ, DESS, HAM-A, HDRS, MADRS, MGH-CPFQ, PANAS, PRISE, QIDS, RRS, SHAPS, and YMRS. Subjects will continue Phase IV for 4 weeks or until relapse (defined as less than or equal to 25% decrease in MADRS compared to baseline for two consecutive ratings).</detailed_description>
