	<brief_title>Risk Stratification in Primary Care Combined With Stratified-specific Physical Therapy Care for Low Back Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The University of Vermont Health Network is a five hospital network that serves primarily a rural population of approximately 1 million people in Vermont and upstate New York. The primary aim of this prospective, longitudinal, pragmatic, non-randomized clustered, non-blinded, controlled trial is to examine whether PT treatment stratified to match the patient's risk factors based on the STarT Back Tool is more effective than the current treatment in primary care for non-specific low back pain (LBP) in improving short- (6 months) and long-term (12-month) patient outcomes (disability). To do the risk stratification, investigators will use the STarT Back Tool which is designed for primary care settings and is validated for non-specific LBP (acute flare-ups or chronic pain). The tool is designed to identify the prognostic risk (low, medium, high) for progression to chronic LBP. In addition, the tool assists clinicians in decision making to ensure that low risk patients are not over treated or medicalized, that 'at risk' patients get access to the right provider early on and that enhanced care is given for complex cases. Thus, the tool assists in matching the 'right patient to the right treatment' at the 'right time' which is critical given the high prevalence and cost of LBP. Patients with a primary diagnosis of LBP (acute flare-up or chronic) who are seen in any of the six Family Medicine sites will complete the STarT Back Tool and the Modified Low Back Pain Disability Questionnaire (mODI). With the non-randomized, cluster design, three of the Family Medicine sites are identified as "Participating Sites" and three are identified as "Comparator Sites." Patients with low back pain from "Participating Sites" who are stratified as medium- or high-risk patients will be referred to physical therapy (PT) for a matched (i.e., stratified-specific treatment). Those patients who are identified as low-risk will be retained in Family Medicine for management using advice, reassurance, patient education, NSAIDs (no imaging or specialist referral is encouraged). Patients with low back pain from "Comparator Sites" will be managed according to current care practices in Family Medicine. Using the mODI, the investigators will compare the two study arms at short- (6 months) and long-term points (12 months).</detailed_description>
