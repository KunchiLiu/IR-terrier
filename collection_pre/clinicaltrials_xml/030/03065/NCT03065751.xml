	<brief_summary>Sepsis is defined by the occurrence of a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) in the context of infection. Unfortunately, its incidence appears to be rising, and the mortality of septic shock remains extraordinary high (&gt; 60%). Death in sepsis arises from shock and multi organ dysfunction that are - at least in part - triggered by an inadequate response of the host's immune system to the infection. Given the injurious role of 1) this overwhelming immune response and 2) the consumption of protective plasmatic factors (e.g. vWF cleaving proteases, hemostatic factors etc.) while the disease is progressing the investigators hypothesize that early therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) in the most severely ill individuals might improve hemodynamics, oxygenation and ultimately survival. This therapeutic strategy combines 2 major aspects in 1 procedure: 1. removal of harmful circulating molecules and 2. replacement of protective plasma proteins. The investigators designed the EXCHANGE trial to analyze in a randomized fashion the benefit of TPE as an add-on treatment to state of the art standard sepsis care. Only patients with early septic shock (&lt; 12 hrs) and high catecholamine doses (noradrenaline &gt; 0.4 ug/kg bodyweight/min) will be included. Those in the treatment group will receive 3 TPEs within three consecutive days. The primary outcome is 28-day all cause mortality. To show an assumed reduction from 60% to 45% in the experimental group, a sample size of 173 patients per group has been calculated. The overall sample size is therefore n=346. The recruitment period is 3 years (+3 months observation) and will be performed in 11 national centers in Germany. Secondary endpoints (including hemodynamics, oxygenation, coagulation, and microcirculation) will be assessed on day 1, 2, 3 before and after TPE and on day 4, 5, 7 and 14. Project management and data monitoring will be organized by the Hanover Clinical Trial Center and biostatistics including a web-based randomization will be performed by the Institute of biometrics (Prof. Koch) at Hannover Medical School. The investigators hope to demonstrate a potential benefit of an additive treatment approach to improve the outcome of patients suffering from an under-recognized but deadly disease.</brief_summary>
