	<brief_summary>The heart rate variability (HRV) is a measure of the autonomic nervous system (ANS). In the model of anorexia nervosa, ANS is disturbed with mostly a predominance of activation of the parasympathetic nervous system and a decrease of the sympathetic system. Various explanations of this these dysfunctions are proposed in literature, mainly malnutrition, physical hyperactivity, anxiety, that are known characteristics of anorexia nervosa. The primary aim of this study is to evaluate correlation between ANS dysfunction and anxiety in anorexia nervosa. Other objectives of this study are firstly to evaluate correlation between ANS dysfunction and others parameters (weight, body mass index, depression, physical activity, purgative ou restrictive type, duration of disease, smoking) in anorexia nervosa and secondly to see if HRV is a predictive parameter of the evolution of anorexia nervosa.</brief_summary>
