	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether a new treatment, Unstuck and On Target (UOT), works better, worse, or the same as the best treatment that is available now, Contingency Behavioral Management (CBM), for low income children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) or Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Researchers predict that UOT will be better than CBM for children with ASD and ADHD at improving cognitive problem solving, executive functioning, self-control and use of medical care, but equal to CBM at improving behavior and coping.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Community Based Intervention for Children With ADHD and ASD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This project will compare the effectiveness of an innovative community-based cognitive-behavioral Executive Functioning (EF) treatment, Unstuck and On Target (UOT) to the current standard of care, a Contingency Behavioral Management (CBM) program in typically underserved children with ASD or ADHD. Minimizing the impact of EF deficits in these pediatric disorders has broad public health implications, providing the opportunity for improvement in the real-world, long-term outcomes that stakeholders have told us are most important to them: more educational and vocational success, more functional independence and improved Activities of Daily Living skills, and better physical health, with reduced morbidity and mortality. The health disparity that this project addresses is the poorer outcomes and limited treatment choices associated with being a child from a low-income family who also has ADHD or ASD. The research questions are: 1. Which works better for low-income children with ASD, UOT or CBM? Researchers will test the comparative effectiveness of UOT to CBM treatments with low-income children with ASD. Hypothesis 1: UOT will be more effective for children with ASD than CBM treatment of equal intensity at improving cognitive problem-solving (WASI Block Design (BD)), real-world executive functioning (BRIEF Shift and Plan/Org, class observation Transitions and Follows Directions, Challenge Task Plan/org, Flexibility scores), self-regulation (BRIEF Emotional Control and CBCL Affective Problems scores), and fewer non-routine medical visits (service use) and equal to CBM in improving behavior and coping skills (classroom observation Negativity and Participation scores and CBCL Aggression score) 2. Which works better for low-income children with ADHD, UOT or CBM? Researchers will test the comparative effectiveness of UOT to CBM with low-income children with ADHD, a new patient population for UOT. Hypothesis 2: UOT will be more effective for children with ADHD than CBM treatment of equal intensity at improving executive functioning, cognitive problem-solving, and equal to CBM in improving behavior and coping skills. 3. Are the effects of UOT and CBM sustained 9-12 months after treatment? Researchers will assess whether any benefits ascribed to the interventions are maintained about a year after the treatment is completed. Hypothesis 3: Improvements in cognitive abilities, EF, problem solving and behavior regulation will be maintained about a year following treatment in the UOT children, while gains in behavior and coping skills seen with CBM will fade after the treatment ends. Patients with ASD and ADHD will be recruited for the study from school systems. Half will receive UOT and half will receive CBM. Researchers will recruit interested Title 1 schools that serve very different and diverse populations. Recruitment will occur in several stages. Specifically, school districts will invite individual schools to participate in the trial that have a sufficient number of qualifying children. Interested schools will then contact families and provide information about the study. Interested families will initiate contact with study staff, and individual schools will be entered into the study if they have three or more patients whose families contact study staff. Children will then be scheduled for cognitive/diagnostic evaluation. Recruitment will continue until the target enrollment is reached, and all remaining interested families from enrolled schools are included. Subjects with appropriate assent and consent will be evaluated for eligibility and their school will be randomly assigned to treatment condition. Cognitive problem-solving abilities, flexibility, planning and organizing, self-regulation, behavior problems, coping skills, and the child's use of non-routine urgent medical care will be measured before and after treatment through a multi-method, multi-informant format, including parent/teacher report, blinded classroom observations and blinded direct child measures. Researchers chose measures that have the greatest relevance to functional outcomes and "real world" functioning. Rather than define a single outcome, researchers chose multiple outcome variables, anticipating differential impacts of the treatment modalities on the outcome domains. All of the measures and observations will be gathered at pre- and post-treatment time-points in each treatment year. Data will be analyzed using a Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) v20 and R. A comparison of baseline characteristics will be performed between the treatment groups to assess that the randomization was successful. The characteristics will include demographics as well as the direct child assessments and the behavioral scales. These comparisons will be performed using standard statistical methods, such as t-tests for continuous variables or (exact) chi-squares for dichotomous variables. If any characteristic is unbalanced between treatments, which will be possible with the sample size, secondary analyses will adjust for that characteristic. Analysis for Specific Aim 1- Which works better for low-income children with ASD, UOT or CBM? To test the comparative effectiveness of UOT to CBM treatment with 50 low-income children with ASD. RER analysis will be used to determine the effect of treatment on the change scores on the primary outcomes. This analysis will also uncover any significant covariates, which will be further examined by pairwise comparisons. Effect sizes will be calculated and compared to the effect sizes obtained in previous trial with UOT with ASD children from middle-income families. Finally, RCI will be calculated to provide an easy to interpret guide for families and clinicians to use when making choices among treatments. Analysis for Specific Aim 2- Which works better for low income children with ADHD, UOT or CBM? To test the comparative effectiveness of UOT to CBM with 100 low-income children with ADHD, analyses will proceed as described above, except that the effect sizes for the children with ADHD will be compared to the effect sizes obtained with children with ASD in Specific Aim 1. Analysis for Specific Aim 3- Are the effects of UOT and CBM sustained about a year after treatment? To assess whether treatment benefits are maintained about a year after treatment, RER analyses will be repeated with the additional time-point included for the patients who have multiple post testing assessments.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>We will recruit children who are referred by teachers and staff at their school for concerns of flexibility (rather than those who are responding to an advertisement), so that we have a "real world" group of children with whom we will test the effectiveness of the treatments. We will participants who have symptoms of ASD or ADHD, are receiving a combination of mainstream and special education supports, and qualify to attend pullout groups in school. All the schools involved are eligible for Title 1 governmental support, indicating that the children are from primarily lowincome communities, although we are not requiring that participant's families themselves meet income cutoffs. The school systems included are: KIPP DC Charter schools, Latin American Montessori Bilingual (LAMB) Charter Schools, Arlington County Public Schools, and Fairfax County Public Schools. Potential participants will be evaluated individually and included in the study if they achieve a Full Scale IQ score&gt;70, a verbal mental age&gt;6 years old, and meets DSMIVTR criteria for either a Pervasive Developmental Disorder or ADHD. IQ and verbal mental age will be measured with the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI) Verbal, Performance and Full Scale IQ scores (represented as Standard Scores: mean=100; SD=15). Higher scores indicate better performance. To evaluate for ASD, researchvalid clinical psychologists will administer the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, Second Edition Module 3 (ADOS2), a gold standard structured play/conversational interview that elicits symptoms of ASD. It produces nonstandardized raw scores; higher scores indicate more symptoms. To be included in the study, each child must obtain an ADOS diagnostic algorithm &gt;'ASD' threshold and parents will be asked to complete the Social and Communication Questionnaire (SCQ). In order to include the full autism spectrum, these criteria are relatively inclusive. To confirm diagnosis of ADHD, parents completed the ADHD portion of the MINIKid ADHD interview with a trained interviewer, and their child must meet DSMIV criteria for any Attention Disorder. We included children who had observable symptoms in one of three settings. All children were referred for the study because teachers or staff at their school observed symptoms. Thus the children either had to meet criteria on the MINIKid interview or the trained clinician completing their testing had to observed symptoms, or both, for the child to be included in the study. Subjects will be excluded from the study if they have a diagnosis of bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, or major depression that is currently preventing them from participating in classroom activities. Students with anxiety, mild depression, obsessivecompulsive disorder or other problems that do not prevent them from participating in the majority of classroom activities will not be excluded. We will determine who will be excluded through a twostage process. First, subjects will be screened for comorbid symptoms using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). The CBCL for 618 year olds has 118 items that describe specific behavioral and emotional problems. Parents rate their child for how true each item is now or within the past 6 months. One of the PIs, both of whom are licensed psychologists with active clinical practices, will followup with a child's teacher if a child scores above a T score of 75 on any of the six DSMoriented scales other than Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Problems (Affective Problems; Anxiety Problems; Somatic Problems; Oppositional Defiant Problems; and Conduct Problems). We will ask teachers targeted questions to determine to what degree the identified symptoms interfere with the child's ability to participate in the classroom activities or in the treatment group such as "Do you feel that the child can participate in most classroom activities? If not, why? Can they listen to and follow written and verbal instructions? Can they participate in activities with other children when given structure and support?" Note that we are not using the Achenbach Teacher Report Form instead of the CBCL because we aim to qualify the subjects by September, when the teachers may not know the children well enough to answer the questions (the TRF asks the teacher to rate the child's behavior over the past two months). However, because the school programs we are partnering with for this study use an inclusion model, students in these mainstream classrooms are unlikely to meet</criteria>
