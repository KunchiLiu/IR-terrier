	<brief_summary>The incidence of atopic dermatitis and type 2 diabetes, respectively, has increased over many years. Novel research shows an association between the two conditions. While this relationship at least in theory can be explained by lifestyle factors, there is reason to believe that other pathophysiological mechanisms are involved. Hence, our hypothesis is that patients with atopic dermatitis are insulin resistant due to their chronic inflammatory state. Insulin resistance might play an unknown part in the increased frequency of type 2 diabetes among patients with atopic dermatitis. In the present project, the investigators aim to measure insulin sensitivity by means of the 'golden standard' hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic clamp in patients suffering from atopic dermatitis compared to a healthy control group (matched case-control study). The project is a close collaboration between The Department of Dermatology and Allergy and Center for Diabetes Research at Gentofte Hospital.</brief_summary>
