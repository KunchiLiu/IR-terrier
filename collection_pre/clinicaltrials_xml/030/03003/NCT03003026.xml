	<brief_summary>An assessor blinded multi-centre randomized controlled trial will be conducted in which 60 participants will be randomized to either a novel task-specific approach to training bike skills or a parent-led home program comparison group. Baseline assessment will take place within 6 weeks prior to starting the intervention (T0) and outcomes will be assessed within a week following (T1); and at 12 - 14 weeks following (T2) the week long intervention. The primary outcome is attainment of individualised two-wheel bike specific goals at T1. All statistical analysis will be conducted on an intention-to-treat basis. Logistic regression will be used to assess the effect of providing the novel intervention compared to the parent-led home program on bike-specific goal attainment.</brief_summary>
