	<brief_title>ACURATE TF™ Transfemoral Aortic Bioprosthesis for Implantation in Patients With Severe Aortic Stenosis (2011-03)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A single arm, prospective, multicenter, non-randomized, open trial, up to 5 Years follow-up with the Symetis ACURATE TF™ Transfemoral Aortic Bioprosthesis for minimal invasive implantation via transfemoral access to treat patients with severe aortic stenosis where conventional aortic valve replacement(AVR) via open heart surgery is considered to be associated with high risk for evaluating the feasibility and performance of the implantation and the safety at 30-Day Follow-up.</detailed_description>
