	<brief_summary>This is a single center, phase I pilot study of sequential ONCOS-102 and pembrolizumab in patients with advanced or unresectable melanoma progressing after PD1 blockade. The primary objective of the study is to determine the safety of sequential treatment with ONCOS-102 followed by pembrolizumab. The protocol aims to enroll 6 patients into each of two cohorts: prior PD1 monotherapy or prior combination PD1 plus ipilimumab combination therapy.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Adults 18 years of age or older. Histopathologically confirmed melanoma with an injectable cutaneous or lymph node metastasis that has progressed in the opinion of the treating investigator despite administering a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved antiPD1 agent, with or without ipilimumab, as the most recent systemic intervention. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 to 1. Measurable disease according to RECIST 1.1. Acceptable coagulation status: international normalised ratio (INR) of blood clotting, prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time within ≤1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN). Completion of local therapy, such as radiation, surgical resection, injectable immunebased therapy, or topical proinflammatory agent, 21 days prior to first dose of protocol therapy. Resolution or stabilization of clinically significant immunemediated adverse events from prior therapy such that continued PD1 blockade is not contraindicated in the opinion of the principal investigator. Clinical stability of brain metastases for at least 4 weeks prior to first day of study therapy. Acceptable liver and renal functions defined as: Total bilirubin ≤1.5 x ULN (does not include patients with Gilbert's Disease) Aspartate aminotransferase (AST, SGOT), alanine aminotransferase (ALT, SGPT) ≤3.0 x ULN Serum creatinine ≤1.5 x ULN Acceptable haematological function defined as (Patients can be transfused to meet the haemoglobin entry criteria): Haemoglobin ≥10 g/dL Neutrophils ≥1.5 x 10^9/L Platelet count ≥75 x 10^9/L Able to provide valid written informed consent. All women of childbearing potential must have a negative urine or serum pregnancy test at screening. All patients must agree to use barrier contraception (i.e. condom) during study treatment and for 2 months after the last virus treatment and 4 months after the last dose of chemotherapy and pembrolizumab. A concomitant medical condition requiring receipt of a therapeutic anticoagulant that in the opinion of the treating physician cannot safely be held to allow for therapeutic injection of ONCOS102 and tumor biopsies. A concomitant medical condition that in the opinion of the treating physician would pose unreasonable additional risk to therapeutic injection of ONCOS102. Receipt of any systemic therapy for melanoma, other than an antiPD1 agent, after the most recent episode of documented progression on an antiPD1 agent (with or without ipilimumab) prior to enrollment. Targeted therapies such as dabrafenib and/or trametinib and injectable therapy with talimogene laherparepvec are allowed if they were followed by progression on antiPD1 therapy. Any symptomatic autoimmune disease (such as lupus, scleroderma, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis) that requires administration of &gt;10mg of prednisone equivalent. Lower dose steroids for conditions such as hypophysitis are allowed. Any prior severe adverse event attributed to prior antiPD1 therapy that, in the Principal investigator's opinion, would contraindicate pembrolizumab administration such as: Grade 2 or higher pneumonitis Grade 4 AST or ALT elevation Grade 3 or higher colitis attributable to PD1 blockade; note that colitis attributable to ipilimumab is not excluded Note: in the absence of clinical symptoms of pancreatitis, elevations of amylase or lipase are not contraindications to therapy on this trial Known active infection with Hepatitis B Virus (HBV), Hepatitis C Virus (HCV), or HIV. Cleared HBV/HCV infection is not an exclusion, nor is HIV infection with cluster of differentiations 4 (CD4) counts &gt;500 and an undetectable viral load. Active bacterial, viral, or fungal infections, requiring systemic therapy. History of organ transplant. Patients requiring chronic systemic immunosuppressants, including steroids (prednisone daily equivalent of &gt;10 mg). Brain metastases that are clinically unstable (e.g. showing unequivocal growth on imaging, requiring radiation therapy, or steroids &gt;10mg of prednisone equivalent) within 4 weeks of first dose of study drug. Known severe congenital or acquired cellular or humoral immunodeficiency such as common variable immunodeficiency. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding currently or are planning to do so during or up to 3 months after the end of protocol therapy.</criteria>
