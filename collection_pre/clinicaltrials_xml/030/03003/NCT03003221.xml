	<brief_summary>Participation in routine dental care is a significant challenge for children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) due to a variety of factors, including considerations related to ASD symptoms and associated anxiety and behavioral challenges. Lack of routine, effective dental care has contributed to a substantial unmet healthcare need for children with ASD, who are at increased risk for excessive plaque, caries, and oral infections. The purpose of this study is to test a parent-training intervention designed to improve home dental hygiene, compliance with dental office visits, and oral health outcomes in children with autism spectrum disorder. Families of children ages 3 to 13 years with an existing diagnosis of ASD will be recruited for participation. All families will receive the Autism Intervention Research Network on Physical Health (AIR-P) Dental Toolkit, which is designed to provide parents with guidance and information about dental care and support strategies for children with ASD. Some families will also participate in a 10-week behavioral parent-training intervention focused on improving home dental care and dental office visit experiences. The study has three primary aims: 1) To improve children's functional and behavioral compliance with home dental hygiene, 2) To improve children's oral health, and 3) To reduce child anxiety and improve compliance with dental visits.</brief_summary>
