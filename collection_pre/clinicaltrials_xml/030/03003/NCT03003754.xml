	<brief_summary>Despite exercise training decrease blood fasting glycemia in 'average' terms, there is a wide interindividual variability after exercise training explored mainly in adults but not in children. Thus, is yet unknown what baseline health status as well as the influence of what health variable may produce more/less non-responder (NR) prevalence (i.e., percentage of subjects who experienced a non-change/worsened response after training in some metabolic outcomes) after exercise training in school children.</brief_summary>
