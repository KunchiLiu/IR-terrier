	<brief_summary>This Phase 2, two-arm, open-label study is designed to evaluate the safety, clinical activity, predictive biomarkers and pharmacokinetics/ pharmacodynamics of durvalumab in combination with R-CHOP (Arm A) or R2-CHOP (Arm B), followed by durvalumab consolidation therapy in previously untreated subjects with high-risk DLBCL. Patients with non-ABC subtype (determined by gene expression profiling) will be allocated to Arm A while patients with ABC (activated B-cell type) subtype will be allocated to Arm B. Approximately 120 patients may be enrolled and assigned into the appropriate treatment arms dependent upon their cell of origin status. Induction treatment with R-CHOP (± Lenalidomide) will last for a total of up to 6 to 8 treatment cycles (21 days cycle), and the total time on study treatment, including durvalumab consolidation, will last up to 12 months.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of Durvalumab in Combination With R-CHOP or Lenalidomide Plus R-CHOP in Previously Untreated High-Risk Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study is conducted in patients with previously untreated, high-risk Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL). Patients with high-risk DLBCL typically have insufficient therapeutic outcomes. Therefore, the addition of novel agents to the currently used induction therapy (R-CHOP backbone) is a rational approach to improve therapeutic outcomes in this disease setting. Based on pre-clinical and clinical observations, it is hypothesized that durvalumab will have activity in DLBCL because the PD 1/PD L1 pathway is involved in the pathophysiology of DLBCL. In particular, the addition of durvalumab may significantly augment the anti-tumor activity of R-CHOP against high-risk DLBCL subtypes. There are different subtypes of DLBCL which are distinguished by their Cell of Origin (ABC, GCB, unclassifiable). About a third of DLBCL is of the ABC subtype and as those patients have a worse outcome when treated with R-CHOP, lenalidomide plus R-CHOP (R2-CHOP) will be used for patients with the ABC subtype. The safety of durvalumab has already been explored. However, as there is limited clinical experience with durvalumab in DLBCL, the study is divided into two stages: - A Safety Run-in Stage to evaluate the safety of the treatment combinations until at least 10 subjects are included in each of the two treatment arms for a total of 20 subjects - An Expansion Stage to analyze the clinical activity of the treatment combinations in up to 100 additional subjects</detailed_description>
