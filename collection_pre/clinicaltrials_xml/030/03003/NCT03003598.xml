	<brief_title>The Effects of Intubation Via McGrath Videolaryngoscope on Intraocular Pressure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Total of 50 American Society of Anesthesiologist Grade 1-2, Mallampati score 1 or 2, age between 18 to 65 patient planned to undergo nonopthalmic surgery will be included to study. Patients with glaucoma, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases, American Society of Anesthesiologist Grade III and IV, Body mass index more than 35, difficult intubation, undergo obstetrical surgery and propofol, fentanyl, rocuronium contraindicated will be excluded from the study. Patients will be divided randomly into 2 groups as direct laryngoscopic and videolaryngoscopic intubation group. Patients will be preoxygenated with %100 O2 for 3 minutes then anesthesia will be induced using propofol 2 mg / kg, fentanyl 1 mcg/kg, and rocuronium 0,5 mg / kg in both groups. After 3 minutes mask ventilation, patients will be intubated (women with No:7-7,5, men with No:8-8,5 intubation tube) by oral route. systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, mean arterial pressure, peripheral oxygen saturation, perfusion indexwill be recorded and intraocular pressure measured by ophthalmologist by tonopen device will be recorded pre-induction (basal), after induction, 1,2,3,5 minutes after intubation, respectively. Period between handling of laryngoscope or videolaryngoscope after termination of mask ventilation and obtain end tidal carbon dioxide will be accepted as application time and recorded. Study will be terminated after 5th minute values taken.</detailed_description>
