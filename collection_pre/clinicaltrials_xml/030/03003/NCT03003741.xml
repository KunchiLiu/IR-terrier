	<brief_title>Postoperative Pain Control After Enucleation or Evisceration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>During eye removal surgery, bupivacaine is injected, which is a numbing medicine that helps with pain, but it lasts for only 4 to 8 hours. After eye removal, some patients have pain in the eye socket that lasts for several days or up to a week. While this pain can be treated with broad based prescription pain medication, but this may cause side effects, therefore if Exparel reduces the need for additional pain medication, patients may experience better recovery.</detailed_description>
