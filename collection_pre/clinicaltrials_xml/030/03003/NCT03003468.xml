	<brief_title>Pembrolizumab + Imprime PGG for Metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer After Progression on First-Line Chemotherapy: Big Ten Cancer Research Consortium BTCRC-LUN15-017</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OUTLINE: This is a multi-center study. The phase Ib dose escalation will evaluate the combination of pembrolizumab and Imprime PGG for subjects with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) after progression on first-line platinum-based chemotherapy. The phase II trial will test whether addition of Imprime PGG to pembrolizumab will increase median progression-free survival (PFS) in second line therapy setting in NSCLC. PHASE Ib DOSE ESCALATION INVESTIGATIONAL TREATMENT: Cohort 1 will consist of 3-6 patients who will receive - Imprime PGG 2 mg/kg IV on Days 1, 8, 15 - Pembrolizumab 200 mg IV on Day 1 (cycle = 21 days) Cohort 2 will consist of 3-6 patients who will receive - Imprime PGG 4 mg/kg IV on Days 1, 8, 15 - Pembrolizumab 200 mg IV on Day 1 (cycle = 21 days) If none of the 3 subjects experience a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) during the first cycle of therapy, an additional three subjects will be enrolled at dose level 2. If all subjects in dose level 2 complete the first cycle of therapy without DLT, 3 more subjects will be enrolled into dose level 2 to ensure only 0-1 of 6 subjects have a DLT. There will be no further escalation beyond dose level 2. PHASE II INVESTIGATIONAL TREATMENT: Pembrolizumab will be given on Day 1 of each 21 day cycle after Imprime PGG, and the RP2D dose of Imprime PGG will be given on Days 1, 8 and 15 of each 21 day cycle. Treatment will continue up to 16 cycles, or until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, subject refusal, or subject death either from progression of disease, the therapy itself, or from other causes. Life expectancy: of 6 months or greater The following baseline labs must be completed within 28 days prior to registration for protocol therapy: Hepatic: - total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × upper limit of normal (ULN) OR direct bilirubin ≤ ULN for subjects with total bilirubin levels &gt; 1.5 x ULN (except subject with Gilbert's Syndrome, who can have total bilirubin &lt; 3.0 mg/dl) - aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤ 2.5 × ULN or ≤ 5 × ULN for subjects with known hepatic metastases - alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤ 2.5 × ULN or ≤ 5 × ULN for subjects with known hepatic metastases Renal: - Serum creatinine ≤ 3 mg/dL OR - if serum creatinine &gt; 3mg/dL, estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) ≥ 20 mL/min Hematopoietic: - hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL, subjects requiring transfusion will not be eligible to start study - and absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 × 10^9/L - and platelet count ≥ 100 × 10^9/L Coagulation: - INR &lt; 1.5 × ULN OR - for subjects receiving anticoagulant, the subjects must, in the investigator's opinion, be clinically stable with no evidence of active bleeding while receiving anticoagulant therapy. The INR for subjects on warfarin should be in the therapeutic range. Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is allowed.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects with histologically or cytologically confirmed nonsmall cell lung cancer (NCSLC). Subjects with stage IV nonsmall cell lung cancer as defined by American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC). Subjects without EGFR activating mutation or ALK translocation. Subjects who progressed after firstline platinumbased chemotherapy and who are candidates for secondline therapy. Measurable disease according to RECIST v1.1 obtained by imaging within 28 days prior to study registration. Has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0, 1, or 2 within 28 days prior to study registration. Provided written informed consent and HIPAA authorization for release of personal health information, approved by an Institutional Review Board (IRB). NOTE: HIPAA authorization may be included in the informed consent or obtained separately. Women of childbearing potential (WOCP) must not be pregnant or breastfeeding. A negative serum or urine pregnancy test is required within 72 hours of study registration. If the urine test cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required. Women of childbearing potential (WOCP) must be willing to use two effective methods of birth control such as an oral, implantable, injectable, or transdermal hormonal contraceptive, an intrauterine device (IUD), use of a double barrier method (condoms, sponge, diaphragm, or vaginal ring with spermicidal jellies or cream), or total abstinence for the course of the study until 120 days after the last dose of study drug. NOTE: Women are considered to be of childbearing potential unless they are postmenopausal (≥45 years of age and has not had menses for greater than 12 consecutive months), surgically sterile (bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, or hysterectomy) or not heterosexually active for the duration of the study and at least 120 days after the last dose of study drug. Men who are not surgically sterile (vasectomy) must agree to use an acceptable method of contraception. Male subjects with female sexual partners who are pregnant, possibly pregnant, or who could become pregnant during the study must agree to use condoms from the first dose of study drug through at least 120 days after the last dose of study drug. Total abstinence for the same study period is an acceptable alternative. Willingness and ability to comply with scheduled visits (including geographical distance), treatment plans, laboratory tests, and other study procedures. Surgery within 4 weeks prior to study registration except for minor procedures. NOTE: Hepatic biliary stent placement is allowed. NOTE: Subject must have adequately recovered from the toxicity and/or complications of major surgery prior to study registration, as determined by the treating physician. Known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis. Subjects with neurological symptoms must undergo a head CT scan or brain MRI to exclude brain metastasis.
