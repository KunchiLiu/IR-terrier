	<brief_summary>This is a randomized, open-label, multi-center Phase III study to determine the efficacy and safety of durvalumab versus platinum-based SoC chemotherapy in the first-line treatment of advanced NSCLC in patients who are epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) wild-type and with PD-L1-high expression</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of Durvalumab Versus Standard of Care in Advanced Non Small-Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 2 treatment arms (durvalumab or SOC therapy). The Co-primary objectives of this study are to assess the efficacy of durvalumab compared to SoC in terms of PFS (Progression Free Survival) and OS (Overall Survival) in patients with NSCLC</detailed_description>
