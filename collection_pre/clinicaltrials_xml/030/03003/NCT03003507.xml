	<brief_summary>Hyperglycemia is a known risk factor for mortality in critically ill patients. Most of these patients receive enteral feeding. There is controversy about ideal carbohydrate composition of these diets. The aim of this study was to compare an enteral formula with the same proportion of carbohydrates with and without fructose on blood glucose levels.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Randomized, cross-over, controlled, double-blind clinical trial without washout. Adult patients admitted to the ICU who presented capillary glycemia values&gt; 180mg / dl with a full and exclusive enteral diet. They were randomized and observed for 4 days (2 days with each diet: with / without fructose). Capillary glycemia was measured 4 / 4h.</detailed_description>
