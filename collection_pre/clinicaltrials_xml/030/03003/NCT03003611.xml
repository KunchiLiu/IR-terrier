	<brief_summary>The investigators will compare the operated patients for a beginning breast cancer in the Hypnose arm and the patient in the classical general anesthesia arm. It is a Observational study as we cannot randomized patient, (they need to be compliant with Hypnose). Patient will be informed that some parameters, about his recovery, will be collected from their medical file. They will not have another particular treatment because they are in the study. It is just a prospective data collection. The patient will be compared on several items after the surgery ( as pain and pain killer intake, the heal process of the scar, etc...) Also the investigators will compare the impact of hypnose on the other treatments the patient received. The investigators need approximately 150 patients (Half in each arm).</brief_summary>
