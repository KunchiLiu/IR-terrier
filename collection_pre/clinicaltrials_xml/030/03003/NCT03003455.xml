	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether nasal intubation over a bougie placed via a nasal trumpet will decrease nasal trauma when compared to the conventional technique of blind nasal endotracheal tube passage.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nasotracheal Intubation Over a Bougie</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Conventional nasotracheal intubation techniques (or "Conventional Videolaryngoscopic Techniques," CVT) are known to be associated with significant trauma to the patient's nares and the endotracheal tube itself. The investigators propose an alternative technique (Nasotracheal intubation over a bougie placed via a subsequently removed nasal trumpet, or NIB) which involves using Seldinger technique over a bougie placed via a nasal trumpet which promises to not only be less traumatic to the patient and the endotracheal tube, but also to take less time to perform and have a higher first-attempt success rate than conventional methods. The investigators propose a randomized prospective interventional study comparing this new technique with conventional technique to see if a significant difference exists.</detailed_description>
