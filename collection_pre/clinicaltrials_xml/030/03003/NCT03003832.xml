	<brief_summary>The goal of this research is to investigate the impact of changing opioid analgesic prescribing defaults on the quantity of opioids prescribed for acute non-cancer pain in adult primary care and emergency department settings. We will change prescribing defaults for select short-acting opioid analgesics including immediate release oxycodone and hydrocodone as well as codeine and tramadol, including their co-formulations with acetaminophen. In a cluster-randomized trial of matched pairs of Montefiore Medical Center clinical sites, stratified by specialty and teaching status, we will evaluate the impact of this intervention on patient-level outcomes using 18 months of data (6 months pre-intervention and 12 months post-intervention).</brief_summary>
