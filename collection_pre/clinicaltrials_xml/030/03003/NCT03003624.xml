	<brief_title>Comparing the Outcomes of Incisions Made by Colorado® Microdissection Needle</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Commercially, many microdissection needle systems are available, such as Stryker Colorado® microdissection needle (CMN) (Stryker-Leibinger, Freiburg, Germany) and optimicro™ microdissection needles. Colorado® microdissection needle (CMN) combine the advantages of scalpel and electrosurgery. CMN® was introduced into clinical practice in 1997, with a wide array of applications in the field of Ophthalmology, Neurosurgery, and others. The primary feature of the Colorado® microdissection needle is the ultra-sharp tungsten tip that delivers the wave-form from the electrosurgery generator to a very small spot. This allows the use of extremely low wattages, resulting in less tissue necrosis, precision cutting and cautery, and less post-operative pain. The instrument tip is a delicately machined, insulated tungsten diathermy needle that is compatible with any standard cautery hand piece. Tungsten, with its extremely high melting point (&gt;3400°C) provides a heat resistant tip that maintains sharpness compared to stainless steel tips that dull rapidly.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Systemically healthy individuals within the age group of 2545 years having at least 20 teeth remaining in the mouth of which at least 4 teeth in each quadrant requiring periodontal surgery, patients with periodontal pockets with ≥5 mm in depth suitable for modified Widman flap were included in the study. Patients who underwent periodontal therapy in the past 6 months, medically compromised patients, patients with poorly shielded cardiac pacemakers were excluded from the study.</criteria>
