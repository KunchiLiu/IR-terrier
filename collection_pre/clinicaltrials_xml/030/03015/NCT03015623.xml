	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of the investigational product, SBI-101, in subjects with Acute Kidney Injury (AKI). SBI-101 is a biologic/device combination product designed to regulate inflammation and promote repair of injured tissue using allogeneic human mesenchymal stromal cells. Patients will be randomized to receive one of three treatments, low dose SBI-101, high dose SBI-101, or sham control. SBI-101 will be integrated into the renal replacement circuit and patients will be treated for up to 24 hours.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>AKI, as determined by the Investigator based on his/her clinical judgment Able to tolerate indwelling intravascular access Has tolerated Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy for at least 12 hours prior to randomization Likely to require Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy for at least an additional 48 hours Ability to give informed consent Female subjects who are pregnant, planning to become pregnant, or lactating Known endstage liver disease Hepatorenal syndrome Acute glomerulonephritis (e.g. rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis; membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis; poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis); acute interstitial nephritis (e.g. toxin or drug induced interstitial nephritis) or hereditary renal disease (e.g. Alport's Syndrome; polycystic kidney disease) AKI due to postrenal outflow obstruction Acute or chronic vasculitis of any etiology At the time of randomization, clinical evidence (e.g. febrile) suggestive of an uncontrolled or inadequately treated systemic infection History of a chronic systemic infection of any etiology regardless of therapy Active malignancy(ies) and/or receiving active treatment for a malignancy(ies), with the exception of nonmelanoma skin cancer Subjects, who in the opinion of the Investigator, are likely to require escalating doses of vasopressors to attain and/or maintain hemodynamic stability History of renal replacement therapy in the preceding 2 months Systemic immunosuppressive therapy including chronic corticosteroid therapy within the past 30 days Organ failure affecting more than 2 nonrenal organs Known coagulopathy Platelet count &lt;50,000/mL or other serious hematological abnormalities that would place subject in imminent danger of death Any prior medical condition that, in the judgment of the Investigator, would prevent the subject from safely participating in and/or completing all study requirements</criteria>
