	<brief_summary>It was previously proved an association of TGF-β1 and PDGF-BB with the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis (OA) by experiments of OA animal models. In this study, we aimed to determine whether serum concentrations of TGF-β1, PDGF-BB and CTX-1 were related to the knee OA. knee OA cases were collected from the first affiliated hospital of Shihezi university and healthy controls were recruited from the community. The severity of knee OA was defined as kellgren-lawrence (K-L) classification criteria.Serum levels of chemical biomarkers were compared between knee OA cases and controls or among K-L grade 2 to grade 4 groups. The serum concentrations of the TGF-β1, PDGF-BB and CTX-1 were determined by ELISA .</brief_summary>
