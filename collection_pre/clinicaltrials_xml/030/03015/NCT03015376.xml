	<brief_summary>Purpose: To investigate the prevalence of the germline mutations in the BRCA 1/2 and mismatch repair genes in patients with epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) and their relatives, and related somatic mutations in tumor tissues in the northern part of china. Patients and methods: A multicenter prospective study will be hold in the northern part of china form 2017. About 1000 female patients with epithelial ovarian cancer and their ralatives will be tested for germline mutations in the BRCA 1/2 and mismatch repair genes and related somatic mutations in tumor tissues, regardless of the family history. Study type: Observational Official title: Prevalence study of germline mutations in susceptibility ovarian cancer genes in patients with epithelial ovarian cancer and somatic mutations in their tumor tissures in the northern part of china. Enrollment: 1000</brief_summary>
