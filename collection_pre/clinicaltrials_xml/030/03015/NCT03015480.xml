	<brief_summary>This study will test the effectiveness of remotely delivered medical nutrition therapy (MNT), focused on increasing fruit/vegetable intake, and decreasing sodium and red/processed meat intake, in the treatment of patients with stage 1-2 chronic kidney disease (CKD) and diabetes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Facilitating Improvements in Kidney Health Using a Smartphone App Counseling Program in Patients With Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants with diabetes and early CKD (stage 1-2) will be invited to participate in a prospective matched cohort study design to evaluate the effectiveness of an intensive remote dietary counseling program on kidney health. A total of 40 diabetic patients with early CKD and Geisinger Health Plan (GHP) insurance will be recruited for the intensive dietary modification, which will consist of having the patients complete a weekly telephone visit with the dietician as well as enter dietary information on the MyFitnessPal mobile app or website for a total of 8 weeks. To increase generalizability of this study, the investigators will recruit 20 patients with smartphone/internet access and 20 patients who have internet but no smartphone access. During the following year, patients will receive a bi-annual phone call to review participants progress. The need for further intensive weekly counseling will be assessed by the dietician and provided if indicated. Each intervention patient will be matched by demographics and comorbidities to 5 control patients with diabetes, early CKD and GHP insurance, who have previously been seen by a nutritionist at Geisinger. Control patients will receive no specific intervention. Aim 1 - The investigators will examine whether remotely delivered MNT can improve dietary quality over a 12-month period. Aim 2 - The investigators will compare rates of eGFR (estimated glomerular filtration rate) decline in study participants over a 3-year period, compared to a matched cohort who receive standard care.</detailed_description>
