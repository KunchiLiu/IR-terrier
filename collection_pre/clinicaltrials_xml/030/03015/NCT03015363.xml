	<brief_summary>The objective of the Cloud DX Pulsewave Health Monitor study is to prospectively calibrate and validate a novel, non-invasive wrist cuff blood pressure device against the gold standard for hemodynamic monitoring (intra-arterial pressure) in voluntarily consented patient participants who are scheduled for an elective cardiac catheterization procedure for clinically valid reasons.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The Cloud DX Pulsewave Health Monitor is a non-invasive wrist cuff blood pressure device that is licensed by Health Canada with Food and Drug Administration approval. Systolic and diastolic pressures are measured via the arterial pulse waveform of the left radial artery. Initially, the blood pressure algorithm was created and calibrated using the auscultatory method. The purpose of this study is to calibrate the device to the clinical gold standard of peripheral and central intra-arterial pressures. The device acquires a pulse signal in real-time, stores signal and measurement data, and displays stored signal and measurement data for interpretation via internet servers where it is accessible by end-users (physicians and/or patients). The system provides secure accounts for both in-patient and out-patient monitoring. Cloud DX's Pulsewave Health Monitor servers are housed in a secure data center. Privacy measures are to SSAE16 SOC-1 Type-II compliance: 1) restricted secure access, 2) dedicated firewall, 3) HTTPS channel communication via website, 4) self-encrypting hard-drives rendered useless if removed from the server.</detailed_description>
