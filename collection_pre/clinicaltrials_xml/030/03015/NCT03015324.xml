	<criteria>Histologically confirmed solid tumor that is surgically resected Have completed all planned adjuvant therapy or are not planned for adjuvant therapy Age ≥18 years ECOG performance status ≤1 (Karnofsky ≥80%) Patients must be able to ingest oral medications (crushing and administering via PEG tube is acceptable) Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below: absolute neutrophil count ≥1,500/mcL platelets ≥100,000/mcL total bilirubin Less than 1.5 x ULN AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) ≤2.5 × institutional upper limit of normal creatinine within normal institutional limits OR creatinine clearance ≥50 mL/min/1.73 m2 for patients with creatinine levels above institutional normal Women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study participation, and four months after completion of hydroxychloroquine administration. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document. Approval for hydroxychloroquine treatment by an eye doctor, based on a screening eye exam. Patients with metastatic cancer and/or cancer that is not amenable to surgery. Patients with significant malabsorption as determined by the treating physician. Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents. Patients with known brain metastases are excluded from this clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events. Patients with primary brain tumors amenable to surgery are allowed on this protocol. History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to hydroxychloroquine or received HCQ in the past six months. Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illnesses including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements. Pregnant women are excluded from this study. HIVpositive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible Patients that are on enzymeinducing antiepileptic medications.</criteria>
