	<brief_title>Effect of Diode Laser Activated Irrigation Versus Ultrasonic on Post-Operative Pain in Single Visit of Necrotic Teeth</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>the investigator will choose from patients entering clinic of endodontics in faculty of oral and dental medicine Cairo university who are eligible to the criteria. After the patients is found eligible,the patients will be randomly assigned to either the control (ultrasonic activated irrigation )or to the intervention ( diode laser activated irrigation) treatment done in both in single visit. At the end of treatment, patients will be asked to record post operative pain by NRS .</detailed_description>
