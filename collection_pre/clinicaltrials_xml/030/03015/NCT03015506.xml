	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to determine the glycemic index of 4 pulse-based breads in at least 10 normal healthy human volunteers. Participants will be studied in the morning on 6 separate days after overnight fasts. On the first and last days they will consume a test meal consisting of about 2 slices of white bread (50g carbohydrate) and on the other 4 days they will consume 2-3 slices (50g carbohydrate) from 4 different test breads containing starch obtained from pulses (beans and/or lentils). Blood glucose will be measured at intervals over 2 hours. Glycemic index is calculated as 0.71 times F/WB where F is the incremental area under the curve of blood glucose (AUC) after each test bread and WB is the mean AUC after white bread.</brief_summary>
