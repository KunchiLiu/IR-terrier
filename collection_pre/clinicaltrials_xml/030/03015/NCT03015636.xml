	<brief_summary>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is treatment of choice for insomnia (CBT-i). Many patients in psychiatric care have sleep problems including insomnia, but are rarely given the choice to participate in CBT to improve their sleep. Patients with ADHD is a patient group with high levels of sleep difficulties. Sleep problems in this patient group can be both more general such as insomnia, but can also be related to the ADHD itself and to the use of ADHD medication. In a previous pilot study, the investigators developed a version of CBT-i that would target sleep problems in this population. The basis was CBT-i, but with more emphasis on sleep promoting behaviors specific to ADHD (e.g. appropriate timing of ADHD-medication), techniques that would also alleviate sleep phase problems, (e.g. the systematic use of light and darkness), and techniques to target more general sleep disturbing habits (e.g. not winding down before bed time), that are also common in patients with ADHD. This treatment was well tolerated and gave moderate effects on insomnia severity in the pilot study. In a naturalistic randomized controlled trial, the investigators now evaluate the effects of this psychological treatment on sleep and symptoms of ADHD in patients at the ADHD-clinics, Northern Stockholm Psychiatry, Sweden.</brief_summary>
