	<criteria>Informed consent obtained before any trialrelated activities. Trialrelated activities are any procedures that are carried out as part of the trial, including activities to determine suitability for the trial Japanese male or female, age above or equal to 20 years at the time of signing informed consent Diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus for at least 60 days prior to day of screening HbA1c (glycosylated haemoglobin) between 7.0%10.5% (5391 mmol/mol) (both inclusive) OAD (oral antidiabetic drug) monotherapy with stable daily dose for at least 60 days prior to the day of screening of one of SU (sulphonylurea) glinide , TZD (thiazolidinedione), αGI (alphaglucosidase inhibitor) or SGLT2 (sodiumglucose cotransporter2) inhibitor according to Japanese labelling Female who is pregnant, breastfeeding or intends to become pregnant or is of childbearing potential and not using an adequate contraceptive method. Adequate contraceptive measures are abstinence (not having sex), diaphragm, condom (by the partner), intrauterine device, sponge, spermicide or oral contraceptives Any disorder, which in the investigator's opinion might jeopardise subject's safety or compliance with the protocol Family or personal history of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN 2) or medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) History of pancreatitis (acute or chronic) History of major surgical procedures involving the stomach potentially affecting absorption of trial product (e.g. subtotal and total gastrectomy, sleeve gastrectomy, gastric bypass surgery) Any of the following: myocardial infarction, stroke or hospitalisation for unstable angina or transient ischaemic attack (TIA) within the past 180 days prior to the day of screening and randomisation Subjects presently classified as being in New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class IV Planned coronary, carotid or peripheral artery revascularisation known on the day of screening Subjects with alanine aminotransferase (ALT) above 2.5 x upper normal limit (UNL) Renal impairment defined as estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) below 30 mL/min/1.73 m^2 as per Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration formula (CKDEPI) Treatment with onceweekly glucagonlike peptide1 receptor agonists (GLP1 RA) or once weekly dipeptidyl peptidase4 (DPP4) inhibitor in a period of 90 days before the day of screening For subjects treated with an OAD other than TZD at screening: Treatment with TZD in a period of 90 days before the day of screening Treatment with any medication for the indication of diabetes or obesity in addition to background OAD medication (SU, glinide, TZD, αGI or SGLT2 inhibitor) in a period of 60 days before the day of screening with the exception of shortterm insulin treatment for acute illness for a total of at least 14 days Proliferative retinopathy or maculopathy requiring acute treatment.
