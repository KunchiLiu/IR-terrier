	<brief_summary>This I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of lenalidomide when given together with nivolumab and to see how well they work in treating patients with non-Hodgkin or Hodgkin lymphoma that has come back and does not respond to treatment. Monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as lenalidomide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving nivolumab and lenalidomide may work better in treating patients with non-Hodgkin or Hodgkin lymphoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nivolumab and Lenalidomide in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Non-Hodgkin or Hodgkin Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the safety and tolerability of the combination of lenalidomide and nivolumab in patients with relapsed/refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). (Phase I) II. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of the combination of lenalidomide and nivolumab in patients with relapsed/refractory NHL. (Phase I) III. To evaluate the feasibility and toxicities of the combination of lenalidomide and nivolumab in patients with relapsed/refractory Hodgkin's disease (HD). (Phase IB) IV. To evaluate the efficacy of the combination of lenalidomide and nivolumab in terms of overall response rate in patients with relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma (FL) and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). (Phase II) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the efficacy of the combination of lenalidomide and nivolumab in patients with relapsed/refractory NHL in terms of overall response rate (ORR), duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). (Phase I) II. To evaluate the efficacy of the combination of lenalidomide and nivolumab in patients with relapsed/refractory HD in terms of complete response rate (CR). (Phase IB) III. To evaluate the efficacy of the combination of lenalidomide and nivolumab in patients with relapsed/refractory HD in terms of duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). (Phase IB) IV. To evaluate the efficacy of the combination of lenalidomide and nivolumab in patients with relapsed/refractory FL and DLBCL in terms of duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). (Phase II) TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To explore the relationship between prognostic parameters including ki-67 staining, PD-1 staining and cell of origin (activated B-cell or ABC versus germinal center B-cell or GCB) with ORR to the combination of lenalidomide and nivolumab in patients with relapsed/refractory NHL. (Phase I) II. To evaluate and monitor effects on B-, T-, and natural killer (NK)-cell function with the combination of lenalidomide and nivolumab in patients with relapsed/refractory NHL. (Phase I) III. To explore the relationship between prognostic parameters including ki-67 staining, PD-1 staining and cell of origin (activated B-cell or ABC versus germinal center B-cell or GCB) with ORR to the combination of lenalidomide and nivolumab in patients with relapsed/refractory FL and DLBCL. (Phase II) IV. To evaluate and monitor effects on B-, T-, and NK-cell function with the combination of lenalidomide and nivolumab in patients with relapsed/refractory FL and DLBCL. (Phase II) OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of lenalidomide followed by a phase II study. Patients receive lenalidomide orally (PO) on days 1-21 and nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on days 1 and 15 of courses 1-4 and on day 1 of courses 5-12. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years, then every 6 months for up to 3 years.</detailed_description>
