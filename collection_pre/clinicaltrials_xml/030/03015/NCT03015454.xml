	<brief_summary>A sepsis early warning predictive algorithm, InSight, has been developed and validated on a large, diverse patient cohort. In this prospective study, the ability of InSight to predict severe sepsis patients is investigated. Specifically, InSight is compared with a well established severe sepsis detector in the UCSF electronic health record (EHR).</brief_summary>
