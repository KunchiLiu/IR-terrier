	<brief_summary>Transcatheter mitral valve replacement (TMVR) is an option to treat mitral valve failure when no surgical options exist. In as many as half of patients, TMVR can cause life-threatening blockage of the left ventricle by displacing the existing mitral valve leaflet. For these patients the only options appear to avoid TMVR or in some to cause a focused heart attack and to wait 6 weeks. The investigators have developed and tested a technique to tear the existing mitral valve leaflet and enable TMVR in patients who have no other options. The procedure is called intentional laceration of the anterior mitral leaflet to prevent left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (LAMPOON). Although there are no dedicated TMVR devices commercially available, there has been short-term success with implanted transcatheter aortic valve devices in the mitral position for TMVR. The purpose of this study is to perform LAMPOON and TMVR in patients who have no good options to treat their mitral valve failure, using heart valve devices designed to implant in the aortic valve position.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA: Adults age greater than or equal to 21 years Severe symptomatic native mitral valve failure after mitral annuloplasty repair or related to mitral annular calcification. Unacceptably high or prohibitive risk for surgical mitral valve replacement and indicated for transcatheter mitral valve replacement (TMVR) as determined by the multidisciplinary institutional heart team, including at least one cardiovascular surgeon who has examined the patient. High or prohibitive risk of LVOT obstruction or transcatheter heart valve dysfunction from long/redundant anterior mitral valve leaflet, as determined by the multidisciplinary institutional heart team. Anatomic eligibility for LAMPOON based on core lab assessment of the baseline CT and echocardiogram. Concordance of the study selection team EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Subjects unable to consent to participate, unless the subject has a legally authorized representative Subjects unwilling to participate or unwilling to return for study followup activities. TAVR within 6 weeks Intended concurrent structural heart procedure, such as aortic or tricuspid valve implantation Pregnancy or intent to become pregnant prior to completion of all protocol followup procedures</criteria>
