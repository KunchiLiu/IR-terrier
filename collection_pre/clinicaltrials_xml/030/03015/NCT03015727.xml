	<brief_summary>In this study, the investigators aim to compare the progression-free survival (PFS) and side effects of radiotherapy (RT) and concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) in locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients with a satisfactory tumor response (complete response or partial response) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT).</brief_summary>
