	<brief_title>Auricular Acupressure for Hemodialysis Patients With Insomnia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Insomnia, a worldwide health problem, is much more frequently complained in maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) patients and impairs their quality of life and long term outcome. Hypnotic sedative agents are often reluctantly prescribed with doses mounting up. Patients are concerned about drug dependence and drug-related adverse effects. As a non-drug therapy, auricular acupressure therapy (AAT) is attractive to both patients and practitioners and is widely used to treat many conditions in China. The investigators had been applying AAT for MHD patients with insomnia in recent years and yielded favorable results. However, the effect and safety of AAT for insomnia in MHD population still lacks high quality evidence. Therefore, the investigators aimed to perform a randomized controlled clinical trial in MHD patients with insomnia to evaluate the effect and safety of AAT.</detailed_description>
