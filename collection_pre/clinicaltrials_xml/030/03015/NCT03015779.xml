	<brief_title>Transplantation of Autologous Oral Mucosal Epithelial Stem Cell Sheet for Treating Limbal Stem Cell Deficiency Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A number of external factors can result in limbal stem cell deficiency(LSCD), causing pain, pathological corneal epithelium regeneration, inflammation reaction and seriously visual loss. For patients with unilaterally damaged eye, transplantation of limbal tissue from the healthy eye can be used in the past years in the risk of inducing limbal stem cell damaged in the healthy eye. While graft of human leukocyte antigen matched allogenic limbal stem cells require immune suppressive medications, it can cause side effects in the body. Over the past 10 years, the clinical trials of application of cultured autologous oral mucosal epithelial cell sheet to treat LSCD have been emerged as a promising strategy in many countries. However, little study has been reported in China. This study investigates the therapeutic effects of application autologous oral mucosal epithelial cell sheets in the treatment of limbal stem cell deficiency disease in China.</detailed_description>
