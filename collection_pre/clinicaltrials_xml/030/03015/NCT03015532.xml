	<brief_summary>This is a Phase 2b, randomized, double-blind, saline placebo- and active-controlled, multicenter study in subjects undergoing primary unilateral total knee arthroplasty (TKA) to evaluate the analgesic efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of HTX-011 administered via infiltration to the surgical site.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Each subject must meet all of the following criteria to be enrolled in this study: 1. Is able to provide written informed consent, adhere to the study visit schedule, and complete all study assessments. 2. Is male or female, and ≥18 years of age at screening. 3. Is scheduled to undergo primary unilateral TKA under general or spinal anesthesia. 4. Has an American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status of I, II, or III. 5. Is able to demonstrate motor function by performing a timed 20meter walk unassisted, but with the optional use of a 4legged walker for balance. 6. Female subjects are eligible only if all of the following apply: 1. Not pregnant (female subject of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test at screening and on Day 0 before surgery). 2. Not lactating. 3. Not planning to become pregnant during the study. 4. Surgically sterile; or at least 2 years postmenopausal; or have a monogamous partner who is surgically sterile; or is practicing doublebarrier contraception; or practicing abstinence (must agree to use doublebarrier contraception in the event of sexual activity); or using an insertable, injectable, transdermal, or combination oral contraceptive approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for greater than 2 months prior to screening and commits to the use of an acceptable form of birth control for the duration of the study and for 30 days after study drug administration. Male subjects must be sterile (biologically or surgically) or commit to the use of a reliable method of birth control for the duration of the study. A subject with any of the following criteria will be excluded from the study: 1. Has a planned concurrent surgical procedure (eg, bilateral TKA). 2. Has a preexisting concurrent acute or chronic painful/restrictive physical condition that may require analgesic treatment in the postoperative period for pain that is not strictly related to the knee surgery and which may confound the postoperative assessments. 3. Has a contraindication or a known or suspected history of hypersensitivity or idiosyncratic reaction to bupivacaine (or other local anesthetics), meloxicam (or other NSAIDs), oxycodone, morphine, fentanyl, or hydromorphone. 4. Has known or suspected daily use of opioids for 7 or more consecutive days within the previous 6 months. 5. Has taken longacting opioids within 3 days prior to surgery, or has taken any opioids within 24 hours prior to the scheduled surgery. 6. Has been administered bupivacaine or any other local anesthetic within 72 hours prior to the scheduled surgery, other than for pretreatment prior to a needle placement. 7. Initiated treatment with any of the following medications within 1 month prior to surgery or is taking any of these medications to control pain: selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), gabapentin, pregabalin, duloxetine, or COX2 inhibitors. (Note: If a subject is taking one of these medications for a reason other than pain control, then (s)he must be on a stable dose for at least 1 month prior to surgery.) Anxiolytics prior to surgery are permitted, if necessary. 8. Has a medical condition such that, in the opinion of the Investigator, participating in the study would pose a health risk to the subject. Conditions may include any of the following: 1. History of clinically significant cardiac abnormality such as New York Heart Association class III or IV, myocardial infarction, which resulted in significant clinical abnormalities of electrocardiogram (ECG) or function. 2. History of impaired kidney or liver function, as defined by aspartate aminotransferase or alanine aminotransferase &gt;3 × the upper limit of normal (ULN) and/or creatinine &gt;2 × ULN. 3. History of known or suspected coagulopathy or uncontrolled anticoagulation. 4. Loss of sensation in extremities or significant peripheral neuropathy. 9. Has uncontrolled anxiety, psychiatric, or neurological disorder that might interfere with study assessments. 10. Has any chronic neuromuscular deficit of either femoral nerve function or thigh musculature. 11. Has any chronic condition or disease that would compromise neurological or vascular assessments. 12. Had a malignancy in the last year, with the exception of nonmetastatic basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or localized carcinoma in situ of the cervix. 13. Has a known or suspected history of drug abuse or a positive drug screen, or a recent history of alcohol abuse. 14. Previously participated in an HTX011 clinical study or received investigational product in a clinical trial within 30 days or within 5 elimination halflives (whichever is longer) prior to surgery, or is planning to take part in another clinical trial while participating in this study. 15. Has a body mass index (BMI) &gt;38 kg/m2.</criteria>
