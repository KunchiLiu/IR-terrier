	<brief_title>Influence of Routine Use of Narrow Band Imaging on Heterotopic Gastric Mucosa of the Proximal Esophagus Detection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Heterotopic gastric mucosa, also called inlet patch, is area of ectopic gastric mucosa with common location at proximal part of esophagus. Because of the location, lesions are likely to be missed during routine gastroscopy. The clinical significance of inlet patches remains unknown, however they may be symptomatic and may cause morphologic changes such as strictures, ulcers, webs, stenoses or even adenocarcinomas. Moreover inlet patches may be correlated with reflux symptoms up to 73,1%. Several studies were conducted to determine whether NBI improves detection of cervical inlet patches, some of them were also prospective studies, however no randomized study was conducted.</detailed_description>
