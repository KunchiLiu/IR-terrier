	<brief_summary>Cellceutix has developed Kevetrin (thioureidobutyronitrile), belonging to an anti-proliferative p53 activator pharmacological class, for the treatment of cancer. Nonclinical studies have demonstrated that Kevetrin induces apoptosis by activation of wild type p53 and induces apoptosis in mutant p53 cells by degradation of oncogenic mutant p53. In this Phase 2 study, two different short-term treatment regimens of Kevetrin will be evaluated for safety, tolerability, changes in biomarkers/objective tumor response, and to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of Kevetrin when administered to subjects with platinum-resistant/refractory ovarian cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase 2 Study of Kevetrin in Subjects With Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open label, dose-escalation trial to study the safety, biomarker changes (including modulation of p53), objective tumor response changes, and pharmacokinetics following administration of two different treatment regimens of Kevetrin over a 3-week period to subjects with platinum-resistant/refractory ovarian cancer. Following the 3 weeks of Kevetrin dosing, subjects are to be followed up for 3 weeks after completion of Kevetrin treatment. Standard of care treatment, as medically appropriate and per local guidelines, outside of this study protocol can commence after the collection of the post-Kevetrin treatment biomarker samples (collected on Day 21±1 day). The patient population recruited into this study includes those ovarian cancer patients that have platinum resistant/refractory disease, defined as disease progression/relapse within 6 months following the last administered dose of platinum therapy (resistant), or lack of response or disease progression while receiving the most recent platinum based therapy (refractory), respectively. Patients may or may not have had additional treatment (e.g., Doxil) prior to entry in this study. A total of approximately 10 study participants are planned to be enrolled in two cohorts of approximately 5 subjects per cohort, with enrollment in a sequential, dose-escalating fashion. Investigators and subjects will be aware of the treatment cohort into which they are recruiting. Cohort details and the planned doses are: Cohort 1 (n=5) Kevetrin Cycle - Kevetrin 250 mg/m2 IV per dose every other day (q.o.d.)/ 3 doses per week (750 mg/m2 per week), for 3 weeks (single cycle; total 9 doses); Follow-up for 3 weeks after Kevetrin treatment ends Cohort 2 (n=5) Kevetrin Cycle - Kevetrin 350 mg/m2 IV per dose every other day (q.o.d.)/ 3 doses per week (1050 mg/m2 per week), for 3 weeks (single cycle; total 9 doses); Follow-up for 3 weeks after Kevetrin treatment ends Cohorts 1 and 2 will be conducted in a sequential fashion, with safety data from cohort 1 evaluated by an independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC). The DMC will make appropriate recommendations based on the available safety data as regards the intent of progressing to the higher dose cohort 2.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Evidence of a personally signed and dated written informed consent to participate in the clinical study 2. Nonpregnant female adults at least 18 years of age at time of informed consent 3. Histologically confirmed serous epithelial ovarian cancer with peritoneal metastases 4. Platinum resistant/refractory disease, defined as disease progression/relapse within 6 months following the last administered dose of platinum therapy (resistant), or lack of response or disease progression while receiving the most recent platinum based therapy (refractory), respectively 5. Measurable disease, as determined by radiologist evaluator, with at least 1 unidimensional measurable lesion (target lesion) by RECIST v.1.1 that has not previously been irradiated or biopsied 6. Presence of nontarget lesions that have not previously been irradiated or biopsied; to allow for collection of needlebiopsies at Screening and after completion of Kevetrin treatment 7. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1 8. Adequate hematologic and organ function as confirmed by laboratory values at Screening: 1. Bone marrow function: Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1500 Cells/μL (with no evidence that this ANC was induced or supported by granulocyte colony stimulating factors) 2. Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL (with no RBC transfusions within 7 days of Screening) 3. Platelets ≥ 100,000 cells/μL (with no evidence that this platelet count was induced or supported by a plateletstimulating agent) 4. Renal function: creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN 5. Hepatic function: total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN; ALT and AST ≤ 3 x ULN; alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2.5 x ULN 6. Neurologic function: neuropathy (sensory and motor) ≤ CTCAE Grade 1 7. Coagulation status: prothrombin time (PT) ≤ 1.5 ULN or INR within normal limits; and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) ≤ 1.2 × ULN 9. Women of childbearing potential are required to use effective contraception throughout the study period. Effective contraception methods include: 1. Total abstinence (if this is the usual lifestyle of the subject). Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception. (Subject must agree to use contraception should they become sexually active while on the study.) 2. Surgical sterilization (hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks before start of study treatment. 3. Male partner sterilization, occurring at least 6 months prior to screening. For female subjects on the study, the vasectomized male partner should be their sole partner. 4.
