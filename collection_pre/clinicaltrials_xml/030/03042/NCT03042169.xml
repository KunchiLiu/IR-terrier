	<brief_summary>Due to the late onset of symptoms, gastric cancer is frequently diagnosed at an advanced stage and therefore in an incurable situation. Standard treatment for these patients is palliative chemotherapy, combining 2 or 3 drugs (Wagner et al) However chemotherapy efficacy remains insufficient, while exposing patients to severe toxicity. Taking into account the low complication rates of gastric surgery today, chemotherapy alone therefore may not be sufficient for stage IV gastric cancer patients. The purpose of palliative gastrectomy is to relieve the symptoms associated with cancer, to prevent subsequent tumour complications which are likely to occur, and to improve quality of life. In addition reducing the tumour burden, may be associated with a prolonged survival time. This study is designed as a multicentre trial. Patients with diagnosis of a primary stage IV gastric adenocarcinoma who are willing to participate in the trial will be randomized to the surgical (gastric resection with peri-operative chemotherapy) or the control (chemotherapy only) group. Primary objective will be overall survival and secondary objectives will be quality of life, progression free survival, surgical related postoperative morbidity and mortality, chemotherapy related toxicities, overall duration of hospitalization and number of interventional palliative procedures</brief_summary>
