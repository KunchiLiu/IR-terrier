	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is evaluate the efficacy and safety of FOLFIRINOX in patients with gastroenteropancreatic high-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas. This is a prospective Phase II open-label trial, stratifying gastroenteropancreatic high grade neuroendocrine carcinomas participants equally into two cohorts (first-line versus beyond first-line).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Histologically or cytologically confirmed neuroendocrine carcinoma of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Potential participants with unknown origin for the neuroendocrine carcinoma in which a gastroenteropancreatic origin is suspected (per pathologist or investigator discretion) will be eligible for the study. Tumors must have a Ki67 index greater than 20% and/or &gt;20 mitotic figures/10 highpower fields. Must have metastatic disease. Must measurable disease, as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1. Any line of treatment (first line versus beyond first line). Age &gt;18 years. Life expectancy of greater than 12 weeks. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0, 1 or 2. Must have adequate organ and marrow function. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document. Have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 3 weeks prior to entering the study. Receiving any other investigational agents. Untreated brain or meningeal metastases. Prior treatment with 5fluorouracil (5FU), irinotecan or oxaliplatin. Pretreatment peripheral neuropathy greater than grade 1 per the CTCAE, version 4.0. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements. A secondary primary cancer (excluding baso/squamous cell carcinoma of skin) within 1 year. Active viral hepatitis or autoimmune hepatitis. The workup to confirm active hepatitis or autoimmune hepatitis will only be done if clinical suspicion based on investigator discretion. Potential participants with childbearing potential who are not willing to use adequate contraception precautions during the study and for 3 months after stopping study chemotherapy.</criteria>
