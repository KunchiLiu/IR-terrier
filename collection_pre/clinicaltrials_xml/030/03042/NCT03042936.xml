	<brief_title>Diabetes Prevention Program in Youth</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Insulin Superheroes Club (ISC) is based on the Diabetes Prevention Program for adults (Knowler WC et al., 2002), which was developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). We have adapted the curriculum for youth to serve a supplement to the adult program. This program lasts 12 months, and the goals are to improve participants' health and reduce their risk of developing pre-diabetes or type 2 diabetes. The ISC program includes 16 weekly (Phase 1), 3 bi-weekly (Phase 2), and 6 monthly (Phase 3) sessions. Sessions include 60 minutes of physical fitness and 30 minutes of education. The education portion includes interactive teaching of a health-related topic (e.g., nutrition, exercise, physiology, mindfulness, and stress reduction) using a hand-on learning activity (e.g., cooking, crafts, games, and role play). All physical fitness activities incorporate moderate intensity exercises (e.g., push-ups, yoga, basketball, tag, and dance).</detailed_description>
