	<brief_summary>A comparison of baseline tumor characteristics in EGFR mutant lung cancers to tumor characteristics after early response of EGFR-TKI targeted treatment to allow identification of early adaptive mechanisms of cell survival in the setting of oncogene-targeted therapy. This identification will facilitate targeting and termination of these survival/resistance pathways before they develop with rational combination of therapeutic agents to improve outcomes.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Carry a diagnosis of stage IV lung adenocarcinoma with an EGFR activating mutation Aged 18 85 years or older ECOG 02 Have a histologically confirmed diagnosis of lung adenocarcinoma harboring an EGFR sensitizing mutation (including, but not limited to: G719X, del exon 19, or L858R). No prior therapy for metastatic disease. Planned treatment with a single agent EGFR TKI including but not limited to: 1. erlotinib, 2. gefitinib, 3. rociletinib (CO1686), 4. afatinib, or 5. osimertinib (AZD9291). Patients must have at least one site of measurable disease â‰¥ least 2cm. Primary disease site or site of metastatic disease must be amenable to biopsy. Patients must have the ability to understand and willingness to sign an informed consent document. Patients must be willing to undergo an initial pretreatment biopsy of tumor tissue (or have previously collected frozen tissue) and a followup biopsy 2 weeks (+/ 1 week) after treatment start Concurrent health problem which would preclude tissue biopsy (eg hemophilia or other bleeding predisposition). Patients whose only source of biopsiable disease is: 1. intracranial, 2. pleural effusion or any lesion that is deemed unsafe to biopsy by the treating physician or, 3. interventional radiology.</criteria>
