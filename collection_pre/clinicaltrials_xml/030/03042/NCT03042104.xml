	<brief_summary>This clinical trial is a prospective, randomized, controlled, multi-center study. Patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive either transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) with the Edwards SAPIEN 3 THV or clinical surveillance. Patients will be stratified by whether or not they are able to perform a treadmill stress test. Patients who have a positive stress test will be followed in a registry to collect data on subsequent treatment and mortality, as applicable.</brief_summary>
