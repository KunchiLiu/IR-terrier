	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: To evaluate the long-term outcomes including liver related morbidity, mortality and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development as compared to those of historical control with interferon(IFN)-based treatment. Secondary Objective: 1. To access liver fibrosis progression/regression in CHC patients after sofosbuvir-based treatment. 2. To investigate the long-term outcomes of extrahepatic manifestations of the sofosbuvir-based treated cohort as compared to their pretreatment status.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Long-term Outcomes of Chronic Hepatitis C Patients Post Sofosbuvir-based Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Endpoint: To evaluate the long-term event-free effect after sofosbuvir-based therapy, in terms of free of major liver events (including HCC, decompensation with ascites, variceal bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy, and liver-related mortality) in CHC patients. Secondary Endpoints: 1. To evaluate hepatic fibrosis progression or regression in CHC patients after sofosbuvir-based therapy. 2. To evaluate the durability of sustained viral response (SVR) in patients achieving SVR after sofosbuvir-based therapy. 3. To evaluate long-term effect of sofosbuvir-based therapy on the extra-hepatic manifestations of the cohort. The items include mixed cryoglobulinemia, chronic kidney diseases, insulin resistance, diabetic status, cardiovascular events and dyslipidemia. 4. To evaluate long-term effect of sofosbuvir-based therapy on quality of life on the cohort. Study Design Prospective, longitudinal observational study Study procedure A total of 200 patients receiving sofosbuvir based direct antiviral agents (DAAs) in the parent studies will be included for following up to 5 years. Their serological, image study and disease status description will be prospectively documented to present the long term effects of sofosbuvir-based therapy. The presentation of illness will be specified as: 1. Main hepatic complications as liver fibrosis, hepatic malignancy, liver decompensation with ascites, hepatic encephalopathy and variceal bleeding, and liver-related mortality. 2. Life quality, extrahepatic symptoms as cryoglobulinemia, diabetes mellitus, insulin resistance, lipid profiles, renal insufficiency and other non-liver morbidities and malignancy.</detailed_description>
