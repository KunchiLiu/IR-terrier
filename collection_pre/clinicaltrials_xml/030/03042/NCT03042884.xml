	<detailed_description>Inpatient: If participant agrees to take part in this study, participant will complete a questionnaire about any symptoms participant may have had in the past 24 hours. The questionnaire should take about 5 minutes to complete. Participant will receive a wearable exercise tracker watch and an iPod touch. Participant should wear the exercise tracker watch on participant's wrist for 24 hours a day (or as much as possible) while participant is in the acute inpatient rehabilitation unit, even when participant sleeps. The iPod touch will be used to sync the data from the tracker watch to the study's activity database so the study team can view participant's activity. Instructions on how to use the tracker and how to sync the trackers to the iPod touch will be given to participant and demonstrated by the research staff. The research coordinator will be available to help participant with any issues participant may have while taking part in the study and will call participant to answer any questions. Participant will be called on Day 3 of the study and again at the end of the study. These calls should last about 5 minutes each time. The wearable tracker will record participant's steps, sleep time, time spent doing physical activity, heart rate, and distance. Participant may choose to record the food participant eats and mood. Participant's ability to keep wearing the watch will be measured. Participant should wear the band loosely enough that it can move back and forth on participant's wrist. If it becomes too bothersome, participant can take the watch off and put it back on after an hour. Participant should regularly clean the band and participant's wrist, especially after participant's rehabilitation sessions. Rinse the band with water or wipe it with a small amount of rubbing alcohol. Do not use hand soap, body soap, dish soap, hand sanitizers, cleaning wipes or household cleaners which could get trapped beneath the band and irritate participant's skin. Always dry the band well before putting it back on. If any of the devices are lost, stolen, or broken, participant should tell the study staff right away. They will be replaced at no cost to participant as long as participant has followed the study doctor's instructions. After participant completes the study, we ask that participant return the devices to the study staff. Within 24 hours before participant is discharged, participant will return the devices to the research staff. Participant will be asked to complete the same questionnaire about participant's symptoms and a questionnaire about participant's experience with the wearable exercise tracker. These questionnaires should take about 10 minutes total to complete. If participant is unable to complete them in person, participant will be given the option to complete them over the phone or electronically after participant has been discharged. If participant chooses to complete them electronically, participant's e-mail address will be collected so the survey link can be sent to participant. We ask that participant completes the questionnaires within 1 week after participant is discharged. Information will be collected from participant's medical records about participant's daily living at the beginning and at the end of the study. Basic information, such as participants's name, date of birth, race, gender, economic background, and medical record number will also be collected. Length of Study: Participation on this study will be over after participant completes the second set of questionnaires. This is an investigational study. Up to 100 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson. Outpatient: If participant agrees to take part in this study, participant will complete 2 questionnaires about any symptoms participant may have had in the past 24 hours and participant's current level of physical function. These should take about 10 minutes total to complete. Participant will receive a wearable exercise tracker watch and an iPod touch. Participant should wear the exercise tracker watch on participant's wrist for 24 hours a day (or as much as possible) while participant is in the acute inpatient rehabilitation unit, even when participant sleeps. The iPod touch will be used to sync the data from the tracker watch to the study's activity database so the study team can view participant's activity. Instructions on how to use the tracker and how to sync the trackers to the iPod touch will be given to participant and demonstrated by the research staff. The research coordinator will be available to help participant with any issues participant may have while taking part in the study and will call participant to answer any questions. Participant will be called on Day 3 of the study and again at the end of the study. These calls should last about 5 minutes each time. The wearable tracker will record participant's steps, sleep time, time spent doing physical activity, heart rate, and distance. Participant may choose to record the food participant eats and mood. Participant's ability to keep wearing the watch will be measured. No identifying information will be used on the devices. Participant should wear the band loosely enough that it can move back and forth on participant's wrist. If it becomes too bothersome, participant can take the watch off and put it back on after an hour. Participant should regularly clean the band and participant's wrist, especially after participant's rehabilitation sessions.

They will be replaced at no cost to participant as long as participant has followed the study doctor's instructions. After participant completes the study, we ask that participant return the devices to the study staff. At the end of the 14-day period, participant will be called by the study staff to remind participant to complete the same 2 questionnaires about participant's symptoms and level of physical function. Participant will complete another questionnaire about participant's experience with the wearable exercise tracker. These questionnaires should take about 15 minutes total to complete. If participant chooses to complete these forms electronically, they will be made available online with a link on the iPod. Participant may also choose to complete the questionnaires over the phone. Participant will be asked to return the wearable tracker and iPod Touch to the research coordinator at participant's next routine clinic visit. If participant is unable to return to the clinic, participant will be asked to mail back the devices with the FedEx postage paid envelope provided to participant when participant started the study. Basic information, such as participant's name, date of birth, race, gender, economic background, and medical record number will also be collected. Length of Study: Participation on this study will be over after participant completes the second set of questionnaires. This is an investigational study. Up to 100 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>
