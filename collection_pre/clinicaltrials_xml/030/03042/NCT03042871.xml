	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy (times of injection, change of visual acuity and Cva/ I) and safety (macular visual function and choroidal thickness) of different dosing of ranibizumab intravitreal injection (1+PRN vs. 3+PRN) in treating with pathological myopia choroidal neovascularization (PM-CNV).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dosing Strategy of Intravitreal Ranibizumab for Pathological Myopia Choroidal Neovascularization</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PM is a common disease in east asia, while PM-CNV affect 5%-10% PM patients.PM-CNV has specific characteristics, including small dimensions and limited exudative manifestations comparing with age-related macular degeneration. However, treatment regimen and re-treatment criteria follow the PrONTO protocol. The question of the optimal dose and treatment regimen in myopic CNV management is still unresolved. There is no unequivocal evidence suggesting hat PRN treatment is more effective than a loading phase followed by an as-needed variable dosage regimen.</detailed_description>
