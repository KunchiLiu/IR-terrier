	<brief_title>Lutetium-177 (Lu177) Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSMA)-Directed EndoRadiotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary goal of this study is evaluation of safety and efficacy of 177Lu-PSMA-617. Safety of 177Lu-PSMA-617 (Radioligand Therapy) RLT will be assessed by analysis of toxicity. Descriptive statistics (number and percentage) will be reported separately for Adverse Events (AE) in total and Serious Adverse Events (SAE). These descriptive statistics will be presented for the whole treatment as well as separate for each cycle. In addition, the relationship of AE to the study drug (related, not related) will be reported. Both results from laboratory test, physical examinations and patients surveys will be included. Efficacy of 177Lu-PSMA-617 will be reported using descriptive statistics by means of number and percentage of patients with ≥50% decline at 12-weeks from baseline.</detailed_description>
