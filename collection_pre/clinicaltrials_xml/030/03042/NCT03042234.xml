	<brief_summary>According to the literature, high-intensity interval training (HIIT) emerges as a potential training strategy capable of promoting positive adaptations to the health of obese children and adolescents, as it demands less execution time (less volume) and can be considered motivationally, More attractive to this audience. However, few studies have adopted the "anaerobic threshold" concept and high intensity interval cardiorespiratory training to evaluate the oxidation of energetic substrates during and after physical activity in obese adolescents with and without insulin resistance. In this context, this study aims to analyze the effects of high intensity interval training on lipid and glycemic profile, cardiorespiratory parameters, metabolism of substrates, and functional capacity of obese adolescents with and without insulin resistance.</brief_summary>
