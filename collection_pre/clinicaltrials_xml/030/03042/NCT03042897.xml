	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial studies exercise and diet intervention in promoting weight loss in obese patients with stage I endometrial cancer. Exercise and diet may cause weight loss and minimize the risk of gynecologic surgery related to being overweight in patients with endometrial cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Exercise and Diet Intervention in Promoting Weight Loss in Obese Patients With Stage I Endometrial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine if participation in a 16-week exercise and diet intervention would elicit weight loss, assessed by a 10% decrease in fat mass, in endometrial cancer (EC) patients. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine if participation in a 16-week exercise and diet intervention would improve cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) and muscular strength. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine if participation in a 16-week exercise and diet intervention could improve quality of life (QOL), fatigue, and depression. II. To determine the effects of a 16-week exercise and diet intervention on cardiovascular (CV) health. OUTLINE: Patients undergo aerobic exercise thrice weekly over 95 minutes for up to 16 weeks. Patients also undergo multi-lifestyle interventions based on the dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet once weekly over 1 hour for up to 16 weeks. After completion of study, patients are followed up for 16 weeks. After completion of study, patients are followed up for 16 weeks.</detailed_description>
