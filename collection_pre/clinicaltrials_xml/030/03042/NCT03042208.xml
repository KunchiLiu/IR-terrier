	<brief_summary>Research suggests that when one spouse loses weight, the other spouse does too. This study will examine whether a ripple effect is observed in untreated spouses and children of individuals participating in a nationally available weight loss program. Participants will be randomly assigned to either receive Weight Watchers immediately or at the end of a 6-month waiting period. Participants and untreated spouses (and any children in the home) will be assessed at baseline, 3, and 6 months.</brief_summary>
