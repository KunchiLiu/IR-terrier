	<brief_summary>This study aims to Analyze and compere the hemodynamic and respiratory variables before, during and after the applying of technic as well as evaluate respiratory pressures generated during applying of this same technic and correlate them with the effort noticed by device user.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of the Breath Stacking Technic in Healthy Individuals</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The breath stacking technic (BS) is an inspiratory maneuver used for recruitment of collapsed alveoli and, consequently, improves oxygenation and, therefore, used by respiratory physiotherapy aiming promoting lung re-expansion being. The BS was described by Marini as an attempt of optimizing vital capacity in little co-operative individuals and hemodynamics has been considered a way of incentive spirometry that provides high lung volume, in situations, in which, inspiratory maneuver duration can be as important as the volume reached, composing an alternative incentive of inspiration technic4. The system used is composed by an interface (facial mask) connected to the patient, an inspiratory unidirectional valve and the respiratory branch which is kept occluded during the carrying out of maneuvers.</detailed_description>
