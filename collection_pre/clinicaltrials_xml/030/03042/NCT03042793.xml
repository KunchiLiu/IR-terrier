	<brief_title>Vaccination With PD-L1 Peptide Against Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: Multiple myeloma is the second most common hematologic cancer which is despite advances in treatment is still incurable for most patients. In this trial the investigators assess a new immunotherapeutic strategy targeting the immune checkpoint molecule PD-L1 to investigate the potential of vaccination against PD-L1 as a possible anticancer target. PD-L1 has been recognized as an important factor in immune regulation and development of immune tolerance in the microenvironment of cancer cells. Cells that express PD-L1 on their surface are known to inhibit the immune system. As seen with the recent advances in immunotherapy against cancer with antibodies against PD-L1, the the immunosuppressive role of the molecule PD-L1 can be antagonized to the benefit of patients with cancer. PD-L1 is expressed on both cancer cells, antigen presenting cells and immunosuppressive cells in the tumor micro-environment. Vaccination against PD-L1 is therefore two sided. The investigators aim to stimulate PD-L1 specific T-cells, hence eliminating both PD-L1 positive tumor cells as well as PD-L1 positive immunosuppressive and antigen presenting cells in the tumor microenvironment. The primary endpoints are safety and toxicity evaluation. Secondary endpoint is immunological response. Clinical response will be described.</detailed_description>
