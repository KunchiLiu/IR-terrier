	<brief_summary>This study was designed to establish the clinical evidence for effect of Robot-Assisted upper arm training and Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation on upper limb function of subacute stroke patients. - Purpose : to elucidate the effect of Robot-Assisted upper arm training and Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation on upper limb function of stroke patients compared to conventional occupational therapy - Subjects : total 99 patients with stroke whose upper limb functions are impaired - Intervention : 4 weeks of therapy (5 days per week) - Studies : upper limb functional assessment (FMA, MFT, WMFT), computerized motion analysis - Evaluation plan : 1) pre-intervention, 2) post-2 weeks of intervention, 3) post-4 weeks of intervention, 4) 4 weeks after end of intervention</brief_summary>
