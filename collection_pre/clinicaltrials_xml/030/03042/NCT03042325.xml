	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy of Alogliptin in Indian Participants With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug being tested in this study is called alogliptin. Alogliptin is being tested to treat people who have Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). This study will look at side effects and glycemic control in people who take alogliptin in addition to standard care. The study will enroll approximately 300 patients. All participants will receive alogliptin tablets at a dose determined based on the creatinine clearance. The recommended dose of alogliptin is 25 mg once daily with normal or mildly impaired renal function (creatinine clearance [CrCl] ≥60 mL/min), dose of 12.5 mg for participants with moderate renal impairment (CrCl ≥30 to &lt;60 mL/min), and 6.25 mg for participants severe renal impairment (CrCl ≥15 to &lt;30 mL/min). Participants with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) (CrCl &lt;15 mL/min or requiring hemodialysis) will be excluded, in addition to standard care for the management of T2DM. All participants will be asked to take one tablet every morning each day throughout the study. This multi-center trial will be conducted in India. The overall time to participate in this study is up to 33 weeks. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic, and will be contacted by telephone 30 days after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.</detailed_description>
