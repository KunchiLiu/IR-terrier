Patients who have asymptomatic failed endodontically treated teeth were included in this study and routine channel treatment procedure will be applied to these teeth. All of the patients have been recruited from the Istanbul Medipol University Dental Clinics in Istanbul. Eighty asymptomatic teeth were randomly participated into four treatment groups in terms of intracanal medicament applied.
