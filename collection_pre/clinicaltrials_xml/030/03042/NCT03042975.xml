	<brief_summary>The contribution of genetic risk factors to the development of focal dystonias is evident. However, understanding of how variations in the causative gene expression lead to variations in brain abnormalities in different phenotypes of dystonia (e.g., familial, sporadic) remains limited. The research program of the investigators is set to determine the relationship between brain changes and genetic risk factors in spasmodic dysphonia (or laryngeal dystonia). The researchers use a novel approach of combined imaging genetics, next-generation DNA sequencing, and clinico-behavioral neurotesting. The use of a cross-disciplinary approach as a tool for discovery of the mediating neural mechanisms that bridge the gap from DNA sequence to pathophysiology of dystonia holds a promise for the understanding of the mechanistic aspects of brain function affected by risk gene variants, which can be used reliably for discovery of associated genes and neural integrity markers for this disorder. The expected outcome of this study may lead to better clinical management of this disorder, including its improved detection, accurate diagnosis, and assessment of the risk to develop spasmodic dysphonia in family members.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Spasmodic dysphonia (SD) is an isolated focal laryngeal dystonia characterized by selective impairment of voluntary voice control during speech production. Despite well-characterized clinical features of SD, its causes and pathophysiology remain unclear. Consequently, the absence of objective biomarkers of SD leads to diagnostic inaccuracies, while the lack of understanding of neural and molecular targets of SD pathophysiology hinders the development of novel therapeutic opportunities for SD patients. The objective of this application is to identify imaging and genetic biomarkers of SD development and manifestation. The central hypothesis is that functional and structural brain abnormalities, shaped, in part, by underlying causative genetic factors, exhibit disorder-characteristic features, which can be used as diagnostic and predictive SD biomarkers. The rationale for the proposed studies is that identification of SD neural and genetic biomarkers would have direct clinical impact by establishing enhanced criteria for accurate differential diagnosis, screening of potential persons at-risk, and evaluation of mechanism-based novel pharmacological and/or surgical therapies for these patients. Using a comprehensive approach of multi-modal neuroimaging, machine learning algorithms, and next-generation DNA sequencing, the central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: (1) Identify and validate SD phenotype- and genotype-specific neural markers; (2) Establish endophenotypic markers of SD development; and (3) Identify SD gene(s) and their association with neural markers of SD susceptibility. This research is innovative, because it uses a cross-disciplinary approach as a tool for discovery of the mediating neural mechanisms that bridge the gap between the DNA sequence and SD pathophysiology. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to advance and expand the understanding of the mechanistic aspects of brain alterations, identify neural markers and discover SD gene mutations. Ultimately, the results of these studies are expected to establish new knowledge, which will be critical for enhancement of SD clinical management and identification of novel approaches to new treatment options in these patients.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>SD patients with clinically documented adductor or abductor form with and without familial history of SD and/or other forms of isolated dystonia Unaffected relatives with a negative history of laryngeal, neurological, or psychiatric problems who are firstdegree relatives of patients with sporadic or familial SD Healthy controls with a negative history of laryngeal, neurological, or psychiatric problems and a negative family history of dystonia and any other movement disorders Age from 21 to 80 years. Native English speakers. Righthandedness. Subjects who are incapable of giving an informed consent. Pregnant or breastfeeding women until a time when the women are no longer pregnant or breastfeeding. All women of childbearing potential will have a pregnancy test performed, which must be negative for participation in the imaging studies. Subjects with past or present medical history of (a) neurological problems, such as stroke, movement disorders (other than SD in the patient groups), brain tumors, traumatic brain injury with loss of consciousness, ataxias, myopathies, myasthenia gravis, demyelinating diseases, alcoholism, drug dependence; (b) psychiatric problems, such as schizophrenia, bipolar depression, obsessivecompulsive disorder; (c) laryngeal problems, such as vocal fold paralysis, paresis, vocal fold nodules and polyps, carcinoma, chronic laryngitis. Patients who are not symptomatic at present due to treatment with botulinum toxin injections into the laryngeal muscles. The duration of positive effects of botulinum toxin vary from patient to patient but last on average for 34 months. Prior to entering the study, all patients will be evaluated to ensure that they are fully symptomatic and are at least 3 months post last injection. To avoid the possibility of confounding effects of drugs acting upon the central nervous system, all study participants will be questioned about any prescribed or overthecounter medications as part of their initial intake screening. Those patients who receive medication(s) affecting the central nervous system will be excluded from the study. The patients will be asked whether they have undergone any head and neck surgeries, particularly any brain surgery and laryngeal surgeries, such as thyroplasty, laryngeal denervation, and selective laryngeal adductor denervationrennervation. Because both brain and laryngeal surgery may potentially lead to the brain structure and function reorganization, patients with history of brain and/or laryngeal surgery might be excluded from the study. Subjects who have extensive tattoos on their head and neck, ferromagnetic objects in their bodies (e.g., implanted stimulators, surgical clips, prosthesis, artificial heart valve, etc.) that cannot be removed for the purpose of imaging study participation.</criteria>
