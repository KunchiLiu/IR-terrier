	<brief_title>A Study to Assess the Effects of Talazoparib on Cardiac Repolarization in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For further talazoparib treatment, patients must enroll and initiate continued talazoparib treatment in a separate open label extension study within 30 days after the last dose of study drug.</detailed_description>

Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤ 2. 4. Estimated life expectancy of ≥ 3 months. 5. Able to swallow the study drug, have no known intolerance to the study drug or excipients, and comply with study requirements. 6. Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test at screening and must agree to use a highly effective birth control method from the time of the first dose of study drug through 45 days after last dose of study drug. 7. Male patients must use a condom when having sex with a pregnant woman or with a woman of childbearing potential from the time of the first dose of study drug through 105 days after last dose of study drug. Contraception should be considered for a nonpregnant female partner of childbearing potential. 8. Male and female patients must agree not to donate sperm or eggs, respectively, from the first dose of study drug through 105 days and 45 days after the last dose of study drug, respectively. 9. Female patients may not be breastfeeding at screening and must not breastfeed during study participation through 45 days after the last dose of study drug. 1. Use of antineoplastic therapies within 21 days before day 1. 2. Use of any other investigational agent within 21 days before day 1. 3. Have not recovered (recovery is defined as National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE] grade ≤ 1) from the acute toxicities of previous therapy, except treatment related alopecia or laboratory abnormalities otherwise meeting eligibility requirements. 4. Electrolyte abnormality that has not responded to correction, including hypokalemia or hypocalcemia less than the lower limit of normal, or hyperkalemia or hypercalcemia greater than the upper limit of normal (ULN). 5. Major surgery within 14 days before day 1. 6. Diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or a hematologic malignancy. 7. Clinically significant cardiovascular disease. 8. Significant organ dysfunction. 9. Gastrointestinal disorder affecting absorption. 10. Current or anticipated use of a strong Pgp inhibitor, strong Pgp inducer, or strong inhibitor of BCRP. 11. Any condition (concurrent disease, infection, or comorbidity) that interferes with ability to participate in the study, causes undue risk, or complicates the interpretation of safety data, in the opinion of the investigator or medical monitor.</criteria>
