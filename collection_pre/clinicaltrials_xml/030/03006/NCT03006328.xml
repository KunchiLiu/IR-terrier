	<brief_summary>The GEM intervention leverages the patient-centered medical home model by using the GEM tool to provide individually tailored, patient-centered care at the time of the primary care visit, promote standardized weight management counseling by health coaches and primary team members, coordinate care between teams and other weight management service providers/programs (e.g., dietitians, health educators, DPP), and provide feedback to the provider and primary care team about patients' weight management-related goals, progress, and care.</brief_summary>
