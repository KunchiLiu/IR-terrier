	<brief_title>Comparison of a Prophylactic Intraligamentary Injection of Piroxicam Versus Mepecaine of Post-endodontic Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The pain after endodontic treatment is commonly severe in the first 24 hours after treatment, then it will reduce gradually until commonly disappearing after 7-10 days in most cases. Since piroxicam has a half-life of 50 hours in the plasma, it will be effective in controlling the most intense pain which occurs after endodontic treatment It appears that optimal clinical benefits can be achieved by administering drugs such as local anesthetics and NSAIDs before the onset of postoperative pain. Administering these drugs before a surgical or an endodontic procedure may be of benefit for longer procedures or for minimizing peripheral sensitization, which is a result of the cascade of inflammatory mediators that are released by tissue injury and fuel the subsequent inflammatory process</detailed_description>
