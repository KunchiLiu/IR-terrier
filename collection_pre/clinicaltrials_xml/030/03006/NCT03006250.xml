	<brief_title>The Effect of Desflurane vs Sevoflurane on Perioperative Respiratory Complications in Laryngeal Mask Airway Anesthesia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Laryngeal Mask Airway (LMA) anesthesia is generally performed for ambulatory surgery to avoid the use of neuromuscular blocking agents and to facilitate rapid emergence from anesthesia. Inhaled anesthetics are simply and popularly used during maintenance of anesthesia. The two most recent volatile anesthetic agents, desflurane and sevoflurane, are the two most commonly used in clinical practice for an ambulatory setting. Desflurane is the volatile agent with low blood: gas partition coefficient (0.42). Desflurane's uptake and elimination from the body of a patient are rapid, which results in a fast onset of anesthesia and a fast recovery from anesthesia. This property provides desflurane as an ideal agent for the ambulatory anesthesia. However, its pungent odor is concerned to irritate the upper airway and may cause significant respiratory complications. Sevoflurane has a blood: gas partition coefficient of 0.65, which is slightly greater than desflurane. The major advantage over desflurane is the better scent. It is considered to be less airway irritation in LMA anesthesia with smooth induction and recovery. The limitation of desflurane on its odor leads to a controversy if desflurane is similar to or worse than sevoflurane for LMA anesthesia. This is non-inferiority study designed to compare the occurrence of respiratory complications between desflurane and sevoflurane during LMA anesthesia.</detailed_description>
