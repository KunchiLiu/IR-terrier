	<brief_title>The Greek Version of the Chronic Pain Grade Questionnaire (CPGQ)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Chronic Pain Grade Questionnaire (CPGQ) is designed to evaluate overall severity of chronic pain based on two dimensions, pain intensity and pain-related disability. Currently, there is no reliable, valid and sensitive to change self-report instrument as brief and easy to understand and complete as the CPGQ available in Greek. A culturally adapted version of the CPGQ would facilitate the study of chronic pain and its implications in the Greek population and allow for cross-cultural comparisons. The aim of the present study is to examine the validity, reliability and responsiveness of a Greek version of the CPGQ in chronic hip pain sufferers.</detailed_description>
