	<detailed_description>The PREVENTER Trial aims to compare the use of perioperative pharmacologic prophylaxis (subcutaneous heparin) with intermittent pneumatic compression devices (IPCs) to the use of IPCs alone for the prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) after radical prostatectomy (RP). Currently, there is no standard practice for VTE prophylaxis after RP with the American Urological Association recommending "pharmacological or pneumatic mechanical prophylaxis" for high risk patients. Prior studies showed 30% of patients in the United States received no perioperative prophylaxis and less than 20% received pharmacologic agents, compared to 98% of patients receiving pharmacologic prophylaxis in the United Kingdom. Some urologists prescribe patients low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) after discharge for up to 30 days after surgery. Additionally, there are no established risks of pharmacologic prophylaxis for RP patients, but some urologists express concern about the potential impact of prophylaxis on the rate of postoperative lymphoceles or hematomas. At Johns Hopkins, patients do not routinely receive pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis in the perioperative setting for RP. Given the lack of standard practice and implications for patient safety, the investigators propose a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the impact of perioperative pharmacologic prophylaxis on VTE following RP hypothesizing that it will prevent VTE events without significantly impacting the rate of postoperative bleeding or lymphoceles.</detailed_description>
