	<brief_summary>Bleeding complications after cardiac catheterization have been reviewed previously, but there are very few studies on retroperitoneal hematoma and appropriate treatment of patients is not well defined. For this reason, the investigators aimed to analyze the clinical manifestations of retroperitoneal hematomas in a single center using a case-control study design, to analyze the treatment procedure determinants and consequently to provide an updated and usable treatment algorithm.</brief_summary>
