	<brief_summary>Prediabetes is defined as an intermediate metabolic state that leads to the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) and the prehypertension is a category assigned to identify patients who are at risk of developing hypertension (AH), in both pathologies the abnormalities in the variation of blood pressure (BP) has been related to organ damage, its evaluation is performed by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM). Dapagliflozin is a selective and reversible inhibitor of the sodium-glucose co-transporter type 2 (SGLT-2), which reduces renal reabsorption of glucose and promotes the excretion of glucose through the urine, in the way that glucose blood. Another reported effects is the decrease on BP, so it would be interesting to evaluate this effects in patients with prediabetes and prehypertension, as a potential therapy to treat disorders and to prevent progression to DM2 and HT, respectively. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of Dapagliflozin on variability of blood pressure in patients with prediabetes and prehypertension without pharmacological treatment. The investigators hypothesis is that the administration of dapagliflozin decreases variability of blood pressure in patients with prediabetes and prehypertension without pharmacological treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Dapagliflozin on Blood Pressure Variability in Prediabetes and Prehypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in 30 patients with a diagnosis of prediabetes and prehypertension without treatment. They will be assigned randomly two groups of 15 patients each to receive 10 mg of Dapagliflozin (Forxiga, Astra Zeneca) or placebo, one per day before breakfast during 12 weeks. There will be calculated body mass index (BMI); low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c); very-low density lipoprotein (VLDL), glomerular filtration rate and blood pressure variability. This protocol it's already approved by the local ethics committee and written informed consent it's going to be obtained from all volunteers. Statistical analysis will be presented through measures of central tendency and dispersion, average and deviation standard for quantitative variables; frequencies and percentages for variable qualitative. Qualitative variables will be analyzed by X2/ exact fisher test, will be used for differences inter-group Mann-Whitney U Test and coefficient of variation, Wilcoxon Test and index of variability for the within-groups differences. It will be considered statistical significance p ≤0.05.</detailed_description>
