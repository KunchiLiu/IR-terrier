	<brief_summary>Enrolled participants health status will be tracked by using a mobile health-monitoring device while undergoing chemotherapy for multiple myeloma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mobile Health Device Study for Myeloma Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Newly diagnosed multiple myeloma participants receiving induction chemotherapy will be continuously bio-monitored at baseline (1-7 days prior to treatment initiation) and during induction chemotherapy up to completion of 6 cycles using the Garmin Vivofit wearable device. For those patients continuing with ASCT, patients will be bio-monitored up to 90 days post ASCT. The study will include a total of 40 newly diagnosed multiple myeloma participants in two cohorts with 20 patients in each cohort (Cohort A and B). Cohort A will be comprised of patients &lt;65 years. Cohort B will be comprised of patients &gt;/= 65 years.</detailed_description>
