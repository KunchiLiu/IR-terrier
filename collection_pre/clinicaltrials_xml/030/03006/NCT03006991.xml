	<brief_title>Study of Methotrexate Given to Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis Patients Based on Pharmacogenomics and Pharmacometrics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In order to find out "The critical reasons for individual variances in MTX of JIA pediatric patients and quantize the influence of these factors", based on early research, this study will integrate Pharmacogenomics and Pharmacometrics, to explore an effective concentration of MTXPGn for JIA pediatric patients, and set up a Population Pharmacokinetics model to provide reference for individual administration on JIA pediatric patients.</detailed_description>
