	<brief_summary>Comparison of treatment efficacy and safety of pretreatment with ablative fractional laser versus microdermabrasion combined with large-area photodynamic therapy with methyl aminolevulinate for actinic keratoses</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Laser and Microdermabrasion Before Photodynamic Therapy for Actinic Keratoses in Field-cancerized Skin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For each study participant, two test areas (A and B) are demarcated in the same anatomical region, with each area containing no less than 5 actinic keratoses (AKs). Test areas are randomized to receive skin pretreatment of EITHER ablative fractional laser OR microdermabrasion prior to photodynamic therapy using methyl aminolevulinate. Efficacy, local skin reactions and safety of both test areas are evaluated over a 12-15 week follow up period.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients with two skin areas of at least 50 cm2 with a minimum of 5 actinic keratoses (AKs) grade IIII, chronically sun damaged "field" changes in one of the following anatomical regions: face, scalp, upper chest. Patients who have given written informed consent and are believed to be capable of following the study protocol. Fertile women must have a negative pregnancy test (urinehCG) at the time of inclusion and use anticontraception (oral contraceptives, intrauterine device, gestagen depot injection, subdermal implantation, vaginal ring, transdermal depot bandage or sterilisation) during the study. Patients that have within the last month received local treatment in the test areas. Pregnant or nursing patients. Patients with porphyria Patients with skin cancer, keratoacanthoma, or other infiltrating tumors within the test areas. Patients with a tendency to develop hypertrophic scars or keloids. Patients with a known allergy to Metvix cream Patients that are believe unlikely to follow the study protocol.</criteria>
