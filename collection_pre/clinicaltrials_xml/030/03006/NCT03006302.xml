	<brief_summary>This study will enroll patients who have metastatic pancreatic cancer and have progressed on prior chemotherapy. Half of participants will receive epacadostat/pembrolizumab/cyclophosphamide(CY)/GVAX pancreas vaccine followed by epacadostat/pembrolizumab/CRS-207 (Arm A), while the other half will receive epacadostat/pembrolizumab/CRS-207 (Arm B). The primary objectives of this study are to determine the recommended dose of epacadostat in this combination and assess survival of subjects in both treatment groups.</brief_summary>
