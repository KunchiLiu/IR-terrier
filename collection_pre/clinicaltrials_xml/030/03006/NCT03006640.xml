	<brief_summary>Clinicians are increasingly dealing with morbid obese patients. In morbid obese patients, difficult sampling and problems encountered with noninvasive blood pressure monitoring makes arterial cannulation an essential skill in many situations like surgeries or trans-radial procedures for coronary or carotid interventions. Radial artery has been preferred over other sites for arterial cannulation due to low incidence of bleeding, better hemostats, more comfort, and immediate ambulation. sm In this study, subcutaneous nitroglycerin will be used to facilitate radial artery cannulation aiming to decrease insertion time, increase success rate and decrease related complications</brief_summary>
