	<brief_summary>Little is known about the long-term neurological outcomes after in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA). It is also not known whether withdrawal of life-sustaining measures will influence rates of survivors with poor neurological status. Currently, withdrawal of care in comatose patients after cardiac arrest is strongly forbidden by law in Korea. However, a new legislation on allowing withdrawal of care will come into effect since early 2018 in Korea. The investigators aim to determine 1) long-term neurological outcomes in patients who developed IHCA, 2) whether early neurological status can predict late neurological status after IHCA, and 3) whether the proportion of IHCA survivors with good neurological outcomes will change since implementation of new legislation on withdrawal of care.</brief_summary>
