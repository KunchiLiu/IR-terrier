	<brief_summary>Background: Latent myofascial trigger points (MTrPs) of the levator scapulae are high prevalent and may influence the neck and shoulder conditions. The pressure release is one of the most recommended manual therapy techniques. Objective: To determine the time effect of the pressure release technique application in the latent MTrPs of the levator scapulae muscle. Design: A three-arm (1:1:1 ratio), double-blinded, parallel, randomized clinical trial. The manual technique than us apply, be sustained digital pressure with thumbs or with the 2nd-3rd fingers on the PGM below the pain threshold and gradually increases up to a ceiling of tissue resistance (barrier), as decreases, adds more pressure. different times of sustained pressure and the number of repetitions depending on time 30 (group 1, acts as a control), 60 (group 2) and 90 seconds (group 3) shall apply.</brief_summary>
