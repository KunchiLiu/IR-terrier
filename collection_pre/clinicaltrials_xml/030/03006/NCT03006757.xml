	<brief_title>Measurement of the Biting Force of Rabid Heat Cured Acrylic Resin Versus Modified Conventional Acrylic</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bite force is one indicator of the functional state of the masticatory system that results from the action of jaw elevator muscles modified by the craniomandibular biomechanics .Determination of individual bite force level has been widely used in dentistry, mainly to understand the mechanics of mastication for evaluation of the therapeutic effects of prosthetic devices and to provide reference values for studies on the biomechanics of prosthetic devices. In addition, bite force has been considered important in the diagnosis of the disturbances of the stomatognathic system . Twenty (20) single maxillary completely edentulous patients were selected from the out-patient clinic of the Removable Prosthodontics Department, Faculty of Oral and Dental Medicine, Cairo University. The primary outcome is to measure the biting force of single maxillary complete denture by I Load star sensor .</detailed_description>
