	<brief_summary>This is an open-label, multicenter, Phase I study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of GDC-0077 administered orally as a single agent in participants with locally advanced or metastatic Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-Bisphosphate 3-Kinase Catalytic Subunit Alpha (PIK3CA)-mutant solid tumors, including breast cancer, and in combination with standard-of-care endocrine and targeted therapies for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic PIK3CA-mutant hormone receptor-positive (HR+)/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative (HER2-) breast cancer. Participants will be enrolled in two stages: a dose-escalation stage (Stage I) and an expansion stage (Stage II). Participants will be assigned to one of four regimens: GDC-0077 as a single agent (Arm A), GDC-0077 in combination with palbociclib and letrozole (Arm B), GDC-0077 in combination with letrozole (Arm C), or GDC-0077 in combination with fulvestrant (Arm D).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Evaluable or measurable disease per RECIST, Version 1.1 Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1 Life expectancy of greater than or equal to (≥) 12 weeks Adequate hematologic and organ function, including blood counts, liver and kidney function Stage I Arm A (GDC0077): Locally advanced, recurrent, or metastatic, PIK3CA mutant, incurable solid tumor malignancy, including breast cancer Stages I and II, Arm B: Postmenopausal female participants with histologically documented locally advanced or metastatic PIK3CAmutant HR+/HER2 breast cancer Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1500 per microliter Stages I and II, Arm C or Stage II Arm D: Postmenopausal female participants with locally advanced or metastatic PIK3CAmutant HR+/HER2− breast cancer Stages I and II: All participants must provide tumor tissue from the primary or metastatic tumor site obtained from a prior or new biopsy or surgical procedure for detection of PIK3CA mutation by central laboratory test. Confirmation of adequate tissue is required prior to enrollment.
