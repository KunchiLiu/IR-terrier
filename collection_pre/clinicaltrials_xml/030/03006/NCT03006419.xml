	<brief_title>Basiliximab vs Low-dose Thymoglobulin Induction Therapy in Low Risk Kidney Transplant Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction: The TAILOR study in living donor kidney transplantation demonstrated a 98% one year patient and graft survival and 91% and 83% at 5 years with rejection-free patients in 93%. The cumulative dose of r ATG (thymoglobulin) was 5.29 mg / kg with 3% adverse effects and almost 50% steroid free at 12 months. Others have explored the benefit of low doses of r ATG (thymoglobulin) (3-5 mg / kg) against Basiliximab in low-risk population and demonstrated in living donor recipients with 8 year follow-up similar survival rates with a lower BPAR rate in rATG (thymoglobulin) (p &lt;0.05) and better serum creatinine in 3 and 5 years. The aim of the study was to demonstrate that low dose (3 mg/kg total ) rATG (thymoglobulin) has similar efficacy (delayed graft function, slow graft function, biopsy proven acute rejection episodes, infections, hospitalizations, adverse events, graft loss and death) than Basiliximab induction. Material and methods: Prospective randomized study of patients undergoing renal transplantation who wish to participate. 100 patients who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria at the time of transplantation will be randomized Experimental and reference therapy: Group A: Induction with Basiliximab 20 mg IV day 0 and day 4 Group B: rATG (Thymoglobulin) 1 mg / kg body weight per day for days 0, 1 and 2 up to a total dose of 3 mg / kg day. According to protocol administration, if there are conditions to delay administration (WBC&lt;2000 / mm3 and / or platelets &lt;75,000 / mm3) (17), administration may be postponed until day 7 posttransplant Posttransplant immunosuppression: Tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil and steroids Outcome measures (12 months) delayed graft function slow graft function biopsy proven acute rejection episodes infections hospitalizations adverse events graft loss death</detailed_description>
