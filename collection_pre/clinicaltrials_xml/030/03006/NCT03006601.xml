	<brief_title>Effect of Vision Therapy in Myopic Children With Poor Accommodative Response</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1. Specific aims of the proposed clinical trial: 1.1 To provide a definitive proof that vision therapy (VT) can improve the accommodative function of myopic children by comparing the results from treatment group to placebo group. 1.2 To minimize the influences of confounding variables by randomly assigning the intervention. 1.3 To observe the longitudinal effects of VT on accommodation system and its effect on axial length. 2. Hypothesis: VT can improve the accommodative functions of 8-12 years old Chinese myopic children with poor accommodative response.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Subjects enrolled in the trial must: be within the age range of 8 to 12 years old inclusive 0.75D to 4.50Dspherical equivalent by cycloplegic autorefraction in both eyes astigmatism≤1.5D in both eyes anisometropia≤1.0D monocular accommodation lag at near(33cm)in right eye by noncycloplegic autorefraction≧1D have vision correctable to at least 0.8 or better in each eye. Subjects enrolled in the trial must NOT have: current or prior use of PALs, bifocals, or contact lenses in either eye( prior or current use of SVLs allowed) history of any of the following functional defects: strabismus, amblyopia, nystagmus history of diabetes or seizures history of any ocular systemic, or neurodevelopmental condition that might influence refractive development use of ocular or systemic medications containing atropine, pirenzepine, and antiepileptic medications in recent 3 months history of any ocular surgery that might influence refractive development developmental disability, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder(ADHD), or learning disability diagnosis in children that in the investigator's discretion would interfere with officebased treatment relocation anticipated for 1 year birth weight lower than 1250 grams（2lbs,12oz） siblings in the study.</criteria>
