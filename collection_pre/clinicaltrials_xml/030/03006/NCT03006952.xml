	<brief_summary>This study was designed to assess the efficacy of adding pentoxifylline to losartan in comparison with increasing dose of losartan in type 2 diabetes patients with nephropathy. also the effect of pentoxifylline on N terminal brain natriuretic peptide (NT-pro BNP) and C-reactive protein</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Add-on Pentoxifylline to Losartan Versus Increasing Dose of Losartan on NT-PRO BNP in Type 2 Diabetics With Nephropathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Addition of pentoxifylline to losartan provides antiproteinuric effects in type 2 diabetes patients with nephropathy that might relate to its effect on N terminal brain natriuretic peptide (NT-pro BNP) and C-reactive protein. Pentoxifylline is a phosphodiestrase inhibitor with anti-inflammatory effects that was used in type 2 diabetes patients with nephropathy for treatment of diabetes complications. NT-Pro BNP, which is released from the heart due to wall stress and pressures, is known as a diagnostic and prognostic marker for heart failure and cardiovascular mortality in type 2 diabetes.</detailed_description>
