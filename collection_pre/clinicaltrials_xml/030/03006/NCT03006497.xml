	<brief_title>Exercise Program Based on Motor Learning and Forward Head Posture Correction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Epidemiological studies have shown that bad posture and poor body control occurs at puberty, with forward head posture (FHP) and rounded shoulders being the most common biomechanical deviations in sagittal plane. The FHP is defined as an anterior displacement of the head with hyperextension of the cervical spine and this is associated with a reduction in the length of the upper portion of the trapezius, posterior portion of the cervical extensor muscles, the sternocleidomastoid and the levator scapulae. FHP can be evaluated by measuring craniovertebral angle (CVA) which is defined as the angle between a horizontal line passing through C7 and a line extending from the tragus of the ear to C7. CVA, smaller than 50 degrees, constitute a criterion of abnormal posture of cervical spine, suggesting FHP. People with FHP present incomplete balance control, thereby affecting the position of the center of gravity and motor control of the body. The establishment of altered motor control strategies could lead to balance disorders, neck muscle imbalances, chronic neck pain and even respiratory dysfunction. Despite the efforts of researchers to create effective treatment programs based on strength training and stretching exercises, positive long-term results have been a problem in FHP correction. For this reason, re-education of posture and body alignment, through exercise programs based on motor learning, with cognitive elements (attention, motivation, feedback, reasoning), could be proved a more effective therapeutic strategy.</detailed_description>
