	<brief_summary>The aim of MATRIX-DPRS is to assess the clinical and organizational impacts of the use of the medication record, opened, filled and managed by pharmacists (from private office and hospital units) by hospital physicians in private and public healthcare establishments (volunteers), for three clinical contexts: anaesthesiology visit before surgery, medications abuse and emergency hospitalization, medications and elderly hospitalisations.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Medication Assessment Through Real Time Information eXchange - Distributed Pharmaceutical Record System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>As part of the national 2012 PREPS call for proposals, a multidisciplinary research team was set up to design and develop methods in order to evaluate the efficiency and the performance of health data information systems. This team is composed of physicians and researchers in medical informatics, hospital information systems, biostatistics, process analysis and management in healthcare, ergonomics and usability. This study was aimed to evaluate the clinical and organizational impacts of the use of a new source of information brought by the pharmaceutical record, promoted by the national committee of pharmacists. This record is opened and filled for each patient by the pharmacist. It contains all the medication sold (prescribed by physician and OTC) by the patient. This record is used by almost all the private pharmacists. The French Health Ministry was looking for an evaluation of this new source of information by hospital physicians in order to be applied by any healthcare institution or organization wishing to evaluate the added value of its investments or recommendations (example: ARS (French Regional Health Agency), DGOS (French Directorate General of Health Services), etc.) in the information system.</detailed_description>
