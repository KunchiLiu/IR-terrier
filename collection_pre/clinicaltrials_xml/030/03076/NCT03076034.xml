	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to determine whether a new minimally invasive method for in vivo measurement of cortical bone tissue properties can identify those who are at risk for fragility fractures of the hip and radius. Our hypothesis is that women with fragility fractures of the hip and radius have altered cortical bone tissue properties compared to non-fracture controls independent of standard clinical tests, such as bone mineral density (BMD) by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The objective of this study is to determine whether a new minimally invasive method for in vivo measurement of cortical bone tissue properties can identify those who are at risk for fragility fractures of the hip and radius. Our hypothesis is that women with fragility fractures of the hip and radius have altered cortical bone tissue properties compared to non-fracture controls independent of standard clinical tests, such as BMD. To test these hypotheses, we propose two aims: Aim 1: Compare cortical bone tissue properties as assessed in vivo by reference point indentation in women with hip fractures and non-fracture controls. We will compare cortical bone tissue material properties, as assessed by novel in vivo indentation at the mid-tibia in postmenopausal women with recent hip fractures (n) and age-similar controls without fractures (n=). In addition to in vivo indentation measurements, we will assess hip and spine BMD by DXA; as well as other factors that may influence risk of fractures (e.g, vit D status, medication use and physical activity). Hypotheses: Postmenopausal women with hip fractures will have worse bone tissue material properties compared to non-fracture controls even after adjustment for BMD and other potential confounders. Aim 2: Compare cortical bone tissue properties as assessed in vivo by reference point indentation in women with distal radius fractures to non-fracture controls. We will compare cortical bone tissue material properties, as assessed by novel in vivo indentation at the mid-tibia in postmenopausal women with recent distal radius fractures (n) and age-similar controls without fractures (n=). In addition to in vivo indentation measurements, we will assess hip and spine BMD by DXA; as well as other factors that may influence risk of fractures (e.g, vit D status, medication use and physical activity). Hypotheses: Postmenopausal women with distal radius fractures will have worse bone tissue material properties compared to non-fracture controls even after adjustment for BMD and other potential confounders. Successful completion of this project will address the need to better assess bone mechanical properties at the tissue level in order to accurately predict fracture risk. The study will provide novel information about possible clinical utility of minimally invasive, in vivo bone indentation measurements to measure bone strength and its relationship to fracture risk.</detailed_description>
