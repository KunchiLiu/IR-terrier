Each subject will be on study for approximately 6 weeks. Each subject will reside at the Clinical Research Unit (CRU) from Day -1 (the day before dosing) to Day 4 (72 hours post-dose). Blood samples for pharmacokinetic evaluation will be obtained up to and including 120 hours post dose. Safety and tolerability will also be assessed.
