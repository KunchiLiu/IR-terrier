	<brief_title>Relationship Education:Project Harmony</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although considerable research supports the positive effects of relationship education (RE) on relationship satisfaction and communication skills, the majority of existing research designs have favored pre/post or quasi-experimental designs. Furthermore, gaps in the empirical bases for RE remain regarding programmatic moderators that influence change. Consequently, there has been less emphasis on understanding which program elements contribute to positive change within couple relationships. To this end, Project Harmony seeks to conduct an impact local evaluation design utilizing a randomized control trial (RCT) to assess the effectiveness of relationship education between low income, ethnically diverse individuals and couples in the treatment group compared to the wait-list control group. Secondary research questions are focused on investigating mechanisms and moderators of change for the target population. Participants (individuals and couples) in Project Harmony will be randomly assigned to either the treatment or wait-list control group.</detailed_description>
