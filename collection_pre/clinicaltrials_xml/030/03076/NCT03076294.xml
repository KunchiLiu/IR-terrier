	<brief_summary>In this study, the investigators wondered whether the association between high frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (hf-rTMS) and manual therapy (peripheral and central approach) is more effective in reducing pain levels and modulation of cortical activity of chronic knee ostearthritis pain subjects than manual therapy alone (usual peripheral approach). For this purpose, patients included will be submitted to one session with active or sham hf-rTMS followed by a protocol of manual therapy. Besides that another active group will have the sequence of interventions exchanged (manual therapy followed by hf-rTMS) in order to investigate whether this may influence in the final outcomes.</brief_summary>
