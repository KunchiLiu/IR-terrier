	<brief_summary>GAPcare (Geriatric Acute &amp; Post-acute Care Coordination Program for Fall Prevention) is an early stage investigation that surveys older adults who present to the Emergency Department for any illness to determine the feasibility of an Emergency Department (ED)-based multidisciplinary intervention for preventing recurrent falls in older adults. In this observational study, older adults will be approached during routine clinical care in the ED and asked about prior falls, prior experiences having falls treated in the inpatient and outpatient setting, and the investigators will solicit feedback on potential improvement to care in the ED setting for falls.</brief_summary>
