	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is through a double blind randomized clinical trial, evaluate the effectiveness of different clinical protocols in the reduction of dentin hypersensitivity. The desensitization approach (single agent or associated agents) and the long-term effectiveness (baseline, 1 week, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 12 weeks and 24 weeks) will be evaluated. Data will be collected, tabulated and submitted to statistical analysis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of Desensitization Protocols in Reduction of Dentin Hypersensitivity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dentin hypersensitivity is characterized as an acute and short-term pain with multifactorial etiology. This condition is a clinical challenge due to the different treatment protocols available. Therefore, the aim of this study is through a double blind randomized clinical trial, evaluate the effectiveness of different clinical protocols in the reduction of dentin hypersensitivity. Thirty-two patients with dentin hypersensitivity in at least three teeth will be selected.The teeth will be randomly divided into two different groups according to the desensitization approach (single agent with neural action; single agent with obliterating action; associated technique (neural and obliterator agents). The dentin hypersensitivity level will be evaluated immediately after desensitization and after 1, 2, 4,12 and 24 weeks. Data will be collected, tabulated and submitted to statistical analysis.</detailed_description>
