	<brief_title>Effect of Single Oral Doses of Lasmiditan When Coadministered With Single Oral Doses of Sumatriptan in Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized, double-blind, three-period, cross-over study to investigate the effect of single doses of sumatriptan (Imitrex) 100 mg on the pharmacodynamics of single doses of lasmiditan 200 mg. The study will last approximately 6 weeks including up to 3 weeks for screening and 22 days on study. Screening will be conducted within approximately 21 days of the first dose of study medication. Each dosing period will last 3 days (Day 1, Day 1, and Day 2). A wash-out period of 6 days will take place between each dose. The End of Study Visit (EoS) will take place 5 (+/- 2) days after the third dosing period is completed.</detailed_description>
