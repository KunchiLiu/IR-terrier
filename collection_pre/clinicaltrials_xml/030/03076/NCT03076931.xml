	<brief_summary>Objective: The purpose of this proposal is to use High Speed Videoendoscopy (HSV) to develop and test an imaging biomarker to support diagnosis and predict vibratory outcome after airway reconstruction. Our protocol will involve eliciting and recording the following five behaviors: (1) hard throat clear; (2) cough; (3) laugh; (4) short multiple phonations; and (5) sustained phonation. These HSV recordings will be used to develop the biomarkers. Study Design: A prospective cohort study of 60 patients, 36 who will undergo airway reconstruction and 24 age matched controls. Setting: Center for Pediatric Voice Disorders, Department of Otolaryngology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center Methods: Subjects will undergo a full voice evaluation, including an HSV evaluation protocol, at the main study site prior to airway reconstruction, 6 months post and 1 year post surgery. Voice evaluation will include aerodynamic, acoustic, and perceptual voice assessments, a pediatric voice handicap index questionnaire, videostroboscopy, and HSV. The airway evaluation will include airway sizing and calibration.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Development of Imaging Biomarkers for Voice After Pediatric Airway Reconstruction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fifty percent of the children who undergo airway reconstruction for subglottic stenosis (narrowing of the airway below the vocal folds) develop a voice disorder. Voice disorders lead to psychosocial problems that affect many of these children over their lifetime, specifically their career choices and their long-term quality of life. Our current understanding of voice problems following surgical airway reconstruction is limited. There is a lack of research to understand the alterations of the phonatory mechanisms due to the underlying initial condition (stenosis) and the surgical airway reconstruction performed. The purpose of this proposal is to develop and test imaging biomarkers to support diagnosis and surgical decision-making leading to improved voice outcome. The overarching goal of this work is to establish a foundation upon which surgical practice could be enhanced to improve voice outcome while still achieving optimal airway results. Specifically, the project will use: a prospective pre- and post-surgery cohort design to develop an imaging biomarker of "vibratory potential" for predicting the vibratory outcome after airway reconstruction. Quantitative image processing methodology will be used for the development and validation of the new imaging biomarkers, based on high-speed videoendoscopy. This research project will address a substantial gap of knowledge in pediatric voice and airway surgery, and has the potential to significantly improve the quality of life of these patients who have some of the most severe and difficult to manage voice disorders. The results could be translated to adult patient populations and other voice disorders (e.g. development of disease-specific imaging biomarkers).</detailed_description>
