	<brief_summary>This study includes an inclusion visit, 2 visits to the Rennes University Hospital and the filling of two on-line questionnaires. The first visit to the University-Hospital of Rennes, during which a blood sample will be taken, morpho-anatomic measures (height, weight, hip and size), impedancemetry and resting energy expenditure by indirect calorimetry will be carried out in the Clinical Investigation Unit. During this visit, the volunteers will also have to bring a sample of urine and faeces previously collected at home. The two on-line questionnaires (hedonic and caloric evaluation of foods and beverages on photos) will have to be completed by the volunteers between the first and the second visit to the University-Hospital. Finally, the volunteers will go to the University-Hospital of Rennes for the second visit, on the Neurinfo platform, during which they will be subjected to a cognitive two-choice test based on food and drink pictures, during fMRI. Before and after the fMRI session, an assessment of the state of hunger, thirst, and general status of the volunteer will be carried out using a numerical scale ranging from 1 to 10.</brief_summary>
