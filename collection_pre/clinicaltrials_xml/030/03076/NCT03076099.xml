	<brief_summary>Aim of this trial is to study the effect of Dexmedetomidine on post-operative blood pressure in patients undergoing brain arteriovenous malformation embolization. The patients were randomized allocated to either Dexmedetomidine group or Control group. Patients in Dexmedetomidine group will receive intravenous Dexmedetomidine while the control group will receive normal saline. Post-operative anti-hypertensive drug, Visual analogue score,post-operative analgesics consumption, Quality of Recovery score, Ramsay score, and adverse events were recorded.</brief_summary>
