	<brief_summary>The uncertainty concerning the onset and the extent of cardiac remodeling in response to intensive training hinders medical evaluation by physician. A better knowledge of the physiology of cardiac adaptation to training will enable physicians to correctly determine whether observed patterns of cardiac remodeling are physiological or pathological. This prospective study proposes to assess in a trained-athlete population the cardiac remodeling in response to intensive exercise training. This study is observational, we do not interfere with athlete's training.</brief_summary>
