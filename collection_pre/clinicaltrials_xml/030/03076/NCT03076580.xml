	<brief_title>An Integrative-"Omics" Study of Cardiomyopathy Patients for Diagnosis and Prognosis in China</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Identification of novel biomarkers is needed to improve the diagnosis and prognosis of cardiomyopathy. Also,the marked variation of genes which is still unclear, may influence clinical outcomes is determined in part by genetic heterogeneity of the systemic response to pathological process. Specific aim: 1. Proteomics, microRNA-seq and metabolomics will be to determine the correlation of echocardiographic parameters of systolic and diastolic functional entry with circulating molecules 2. Genomics will be to determine the association of clinical outcome</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Subjects who was diagnosed as cardiomyopathy by medical history, clinical symptoms, laboratory tests including ECG, echocardiography. 2. Subject understands study requirements aand agrees to sign an informed consent form prior to any study procedures. 1. Endocrine disease known to cause heart muscle disease (including infants of diabetic mothers) 2. History of rheumatic fever 3. Toxic exposures known to cause heart muscle disease (anthracyclines, mediastinal radiation, iron overload or heavy metal exposure) 4. HIV infection or born to an HIV positive mother 5. Kawasaki disease 6. Immunologic disease 7. Uremia, active or chronic 8. Abnormal ventricular size or function that can be attributed to intense 9.physical training or chronic anemia 10.Chronic arrhythmia, unless there are studies documenting inclusion criteria prior to the onset of arrhythmia (except a patient with chronic arrhythmia, subsequently ablated, whose cardiomyopathy persists after two months is not to be excluded) 11.Malignancy 12.Pulmonary parenchymal or vascular disease (e.g., cystic fibrosis, cor pulmonale, or pulmonary hypertension) 13.Ischemic coronary vascular disease 14.Association with drugs (e.g., growth hormone, corticosteroids, cocaine) or other diseases known to cause hypertrophy</criteria>
