	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: Female Subjects aged 1870 years Subjects with typical stable angina but without coronary obstruction (defined as coronary occlusion less than (&lt;) 20%) by invasive coronary angiography or coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) in recent three months STsegment with horizontal or downward sloping down more than or equal to (&gt;=) 0.1 millivolt (mV) in electrocardiogram (ECG) during exercise stress test or when angina attacks; or positive results by adenosine stress myocardial perfusion tomographic imaging in recent three months All other long acting cardiovascular disease medicines, including but not limited to aspirin/clopidogrel, CCB, ACEI/ARB, betablockers, statins, ivabradine, trimetazidine, et al, should be stable taken for at least one month before screening period For Subjects who met these five criteria above, MFR will be tested by stress PET. Subjects whose MFR &lt;2.5 could be included in the study Exclusion criteria: Severe or uncontrolled hypertension (resting Systolic blood pressure [SBP] &gt;=160 millimeter of mercury (mmHg), or resting Diastolic blood pressure [DBP] &gt;=100mmHg at screening period) Subjects with shock (including cardiogenic shock), or hypovolemia Severe hypotension (resting SBP&lt;90mmHgï¼Œor resting DBP&lt;60mmHg) Significant valvular heart disease, congenital heart disease or cardiomyopathy Congestive heart failure(New York Heart Association [NYHA] IIIIV), echocardiographic ejection fraction&lt;45% Acute pulmonary edema; Hepatic or renal dysfunction, defined as: Serum Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) &gt; triple of the normal value upper limit; Serum Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) &gt; triple of the normal value upper limit Serum creatinine &gt; twice of the normal value upper limit Glaucoma Active peptic ulcer or active skin ulcer Taking glyburide, phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitor, soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator(s) Known to be hypersensitivity to nicorandil, nitrates, niacin, or any of the excipient With contraindication to complete stress PET test No legal ability and legal ability is limited Subjects unlikely to cooperate in the study or with inability or unwillingness to give informed consent Childbearing period women without effective contraceptive measures, pregnancy and lactation Participation in another clinical trial within the past 30 days Other significant disease that in the Investigator's opinion would exclude the subject from the trial</criteria>
