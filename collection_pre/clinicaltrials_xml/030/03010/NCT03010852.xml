	<brief_summary>Postoperative (PO) hypoventilation, atelectasis and hypoxemia after bariatric surgery are common and multifactorial, contributing to prolonged oxygen (O2) therapy after surgery and even at hospital discharge. Incentive spirometry (IS) is recommended postoperatively but its success in preventing postoperative atelectasis and hypoxemia (POH) heavily depends on patient compliance with IS effort and frequency. The investigators hypothesize that a focused education preoperatively on IS for POH and intensive monitoring of patient compliance with IS therapy in the early postoperative period shortens postoperative oxygen therapy, decreases POH episodes, and improves respiratory outcomes after bariatric surgery, compared to patients receiving standard of care.</brief_summary>
