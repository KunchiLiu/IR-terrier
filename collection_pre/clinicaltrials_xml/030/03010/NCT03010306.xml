	<brief_summary>Building on an intervention for early child development from the SPARK Center in Boston, Socios En Salud (SES) pilot tested "CASITA" a community-based package to screen and treat young children (ages 1-3 years of age) diagnosed with neurodevelopment risk and delay in Carabayllo, Lima, Peru. Ministry of Health CHWs identified children with developmental delays within the clinics and community and delivered a structured early intervention that included parent coaching and social support. In order to test the hypothesis that CASITA improves early child development, caregiver, and home environment, dyads received either nutrition supplements alone, nutrition + "CASITA" early child development sessions individually, or CASITA in a group of 10 dyads.</brief_summary>
