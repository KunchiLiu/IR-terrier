	<brief_summary>In this study, the investigators will vary the energy density of foods served during three 5-day periods. There will be a baseline condition, and then a condition where the energy density of food is lower and a condition where the energy density of food is higher. The primary aim is to determine the effect of varying the energy density of foods served over 5 days on energy intake in preschool children. It is hypothesized that mean daily energy intake will be greater when children are served higher energy dense foods over 5 days than when served lower energy dense foods over the same period. Additionally, it is hypothesized that daily energy intake in the conditions with higher and lower energy densities will begin to converge across the 5-day period.</brief_summary>
