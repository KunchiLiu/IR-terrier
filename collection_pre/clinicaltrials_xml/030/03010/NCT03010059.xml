	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the rate and extent of absorption of JNJ-64041575 by measuring ALS-008112 plasma concentrations following administration of a single oral dose of JNJ-64041575 given as 2 new concept formulations (oral suspension and tablet) compared to their respective current formulations under fasted conditions and to assess the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of the 2 new concept formulations under fed condition in healthy adult participants.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Participant must have a body mass index (BMI; weight in kg divided by the square of height in meters) between 18.0 and 30.0 kilogram per square meter kg/m^2, extremes included, and a body weight not less than 50.0 kg, extremes included Participant must have a normal 12lead electrocardiogram (ECG) consistent with normal cardiac conduction and function at screening, including: a) normal sinus rhythm (heart rate between 45 and 100 beats per minute [bpm], extremes included); b) QT corrected according to Fridericia's formula (QTcF) interval less than or equal to (&lt;=)430 milliseconds (ms) for male participants and &lt;=450 ms for female participants; c) QRS interval &lt;=110 ms; d) PR interval &lt;=200 ms; e) ECG morphology consistent with healthy cardiac conduction and function. Any evidence of heart block, or of left or right bundle branch block is exclusionary Participants must have normal values for alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (less than or equal (&lt;=)1.0Ã—upper limit of laboratory normal range [ULN]) Contraceptive use by female participants should be consistent with local regulations regarding the use of contraceptive methods for participants participating in clinical studies. Before randomization, a woman must be either: a) Not of childbearing potential defined as: 1) Postmenopausal: A postmenopausal state is defined as greater than (&gt;)45 years and no menses for 12 consecutive months without an alternative medical cause and a serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range (&gt;40 International units per liter [IU/L] or milliinternational units per milliliter [mIU/mL]), OR; 2) Permanently sterile: Permanent sterilization methods include hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, bilateral tubal occlusion/ligation procedures (without reversal operation), and bilateral oophorectomy b) Of childbearing potential and, if heterosexually active, 1) Practicing a highly effective method of contraception (failure rate of less than (&lt;)1percent (%) per year when used consistently and correctly) 2) Agrees to remain on a highly effective method throughout the study and for at least 44 days after the last dose of study drug A female participant, except if postmenopausal, must have a negative serum beta human chorionic gonadotropin (beta hCG) pregnancy test at screening, and a negative urine pregnancy test on Day 1 in each treatment period Participant must be able to taste and smell normally, to their own opinion. Participants who have an impaired sense of taste and/or smell due to any conditions such as allergic rhinitis, common cold, or sinusitis are not eligible to take part in the study Participant has a mouth pathology including, but not limited to, pain, ulcer, edema, mucosal erosion, gingivitis and/or (dental) abscesses, or receives treatment for oral pathologies (eg, antifungals or antibiotics) or oral treatment for any disease Participant with a history of clinically significant drug allergy such as, but not limited to, sulfonamides and penicillins, or drug allergy diagnosed in previous studies with experimental drugs Participant is hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive or hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody positive with HCV RNA positive, or has another clinically active liver disease at screening Participant has a history of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV1) or HIV 2 antibody positive, or tests positive for HIV1 or 2 at screening Participant has previously been dosed with JNJ64041575 in more than 3 singledose studies with JNJ64041575 or has previously been dosed with JNJ64041575 in a multipledose study with JNJ64041575 Participants with 1 or more of the following laboratory abnormalities at screening as defined by the Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) Adult Toxicity Table a) Serum creatinine grade 1 or greater (greater [&gt;]1.0* upper limit of laboratory normal range [ULN]) b) Hemoglobin grade 1 or greater (&lt;=10.5 gram per decilitre [g/dL]) c) Platelet count grade 1 or greater (&lt;=99.999/millimeter [mm]^3) d) Reticulocyte count (absolute) below the lower limit of laboratory normal range (LLN) e) Absolute neutrophil count grade 1 or greater (&lt;=1,500/mm^3) f) Total bilirubin grade 1 or greater (&gt;1.0*ULN) g) Any other toxicity grade 2 or above, except for grade 2 elevations of low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and/or cholesterol</criteria>
