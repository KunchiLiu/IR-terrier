	<brief_summary>The investigators therefore propose to conduct a biological study of prospectively collected patient tumour samples, ascites, blood and other residual samples (feces, urine, cervical smear) throughout the disease course where markers (at diagnosis and their change with treatment) will be correlated to outcome in order to investigate how genetic diversity in OC prior to treatment and adaptation following treatment contribute to chemotherapy resistance. In addition freshly collected ascitic samples (and tumour samples) will be subjected to ex vivo DNA repair functional assays and isolated in primary culture (and established as xenografts) for target validation experiments.</brief_summary>
