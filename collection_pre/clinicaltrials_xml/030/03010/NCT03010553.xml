	<brief_summary>Fifty patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx T1 or T2N0 will therefore have a 99mTc lymphoscintigraphy per operative. The identified sentinel node will be removed along with the other lymph nodes of the selective group II and III recess. Sentinel lymph node staging alone and complete dissection with routine anatomical pathology will be compared If this technique is reliable it will make a therapeutic de-escalation in the treatment of small tumors of the larynx by limiting the ganglionic gesture in the patients whose sentinel node is free from metastasis and also to better choose the treatment in case of lymph node involvement</brief_summary>
