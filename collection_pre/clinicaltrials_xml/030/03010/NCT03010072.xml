	<brief_title>The Effect of Phosphate Lowering Using Sucroferric Oxyhydroxide (PA21) on Calcification Propensity of Serum</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either receive low-dose (250mg/d) PA-21 followed by high-dose (2000mg/d) PA-21 (sequence A-B) or to receive high-dose PA21 followed by low-dose PA21 (sequence B-A) with washout-phases in between. An open label design with a sub-therapeutic dose of PA21 as control treatment was chosen because creating a convincing placebo for PA21 is not feasible. The study will start with two study visits on the 2nd and 3rd dialysis session of the week , where dialysis patients are still treated with standard of care to establish baseline values (duration: 0.5 weeks). Next will be an initial run-in wash-out phase, where all phosphate binders taken by the patient as standard of care treatment will be discontinued and no phosphate binders will be introduced. Consequently, there will be a PA21 treatment (high dose/low dose) phase, followed by a wash-out phase, followed by another PA21 treatment (high dose/low dose) phase, followed by a final wash-out phase. Each study phase, including wash-out phases as well as low-dose and high-dose treatment phases will be 14 days of duration. Patients will be followed up to 10.5 weeks after randomization until the last study visit of the final wash-out phase.</detailed_description>
