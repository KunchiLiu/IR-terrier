Time between the last dose of the latest therapy and the first dose of study drug: 1. Chemotherapy: cytotoxic at least 21 days 2. Chemotherapy: nitrosureas at least 6 weeks 3. Chemotherapy: noncytotoxic (e.g. small molecule inhibitor) at least 14 days 4. Monoclonal antibody (ies) at least 28 days 5. Immunotherapy (e.g. tumor vaccine) at least 28 days 6. Radiotherapy (RT) at least 14 days for local site RT, at least 21 days for stereotactic radiosurgery, at least 12 weeks for craniospinal, ≥50% radiation of pelvis, or total body irradiation 7. High dose therapy with autologous hematopoietic cell infusion at least 60 days 8. Hematopoietic growth factor at least 14 days 9. Has adequate hematologic (bone marrow [BM] and coagulation factors), renal and hepatic function as defined by criteria below: 1. Hemoglobin ≥9 g/dL 2. Platelet ≥75,000/mm3 (≥75 × 10^9/L) 3. ANC ≥750/mm3 (≥0.75 × 10^9/L) 4. PT&lt; 1.5 ULN 5. PTT&lt; 1.5 ULN 6. Creatinine &lt; 2.0 ULN 7. Conjugated bilirubin &lt; 1.5 × ULN 8. AST &lt;3 × ULN I. ALT &lt;3 × ULN NOTE: Laboratory results obtained during screening should be used to determine eligibility criteria. In situations where laboratory results are outside the permitted range, the investigator may retest the subject and the subsequent within range screening result may be used to determine the subject's eligibility 10. Subjects with a history of Hepatitis B or C are eligible on the condition that subjects have adequate liver function as defined the protocol and are hepatitis B surface antigen negative and/or have undectable HCV RNA. 11. Has a QT interval corrected by Fridericia's formula (QTcF) ≤480 msec 12. Subject must have regular bowel movements (minimum of 1 bowel movement every day or every other day; no more than 3 bowel movements per day) for the past 2 weeks without diarrhea (&gt;4 bowel movements per day) or constipation (fewer than 3 bowel movements in 1 week). No known medical history of a disease or syndrome that affects bowel function (e.g., irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative colitis, etc.), fecal incontinence, and no history of significant opioid induced constipation within the past 3 months 13. Subject must have the ability to regularly void urine with no current evidence of urinary incontinence, urinary retention, uncorrected congenital defects that interfere with normal urinary system function, chronic urinary tract infections, or other conditions that may interfere with normal urinary bladder emptying. In the past 3 months, no obstructive uropathy, surgery affecting urinary system (e.g., radical prostatectomy, TURP, etc.), urinary tract infection.

The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception. Female partners of male subjects who are of childbearing potential must also adhere to one of the following: Placement of an intrauterine device or intrauterine system. Established use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception. Progesterone only oral contraception, where inhibition of ovulation is not the primary mode of action.

Has known history of chronic infection with hepatitis B virus (hepatitis B surface antigen positive) or hepatitis C virus (detectable HCV RNA) 11. Has had a venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism within the 3 months prior to study enrollment. NOTE: Subjects with a history of a deep vein thrombosis &gt;3 months prior to study enrollment who are on anticoagulation therapy with low molecular weight heparin are eligible for this study. 12. Has known hypersensitivity to any of the components of study drug 13. Is unable to take oral medications, malabsorption syndrome or any other uncontrolled gastrointestinal condition (e.g., nausea, diarrhea or vomiting) that might impair the bioavailability of study drug 14. Has an uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, uncontrolled infection, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements 15.
