	<brief_summary>Incisional negative pressure therapy (INPWT) has previously been shown in certain patient populations to decrease wound healing complications, decrease the rate of hematomas and seromas, as well as have better scar quality. We have found a group of patients, those who have panniculectomies in preparation for renal transplant, with significantly higher rates of wound healing complications. We believe the best way to demonstrate benefits of incisional negative pressure wound therapy will be in this group of patients known to have significantly higher rates of wound complications.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>All patients undergoing panniculectomy in preparation for renal transplantation at the University of California Davis Medical Center. Patients who are entered into the trial and have 30 days of follow up, and those in the INPWT study arm who successfully complete 7 days of treatment, will be included. All patients who previously demonstrated a hypersensitivity reaction to adhesives and qualify for panniculectomy in preparation for renal transplantation, or all patients who are undergoing panniculectomy for reasons other than in preparation for renal transplantation (i.e. after massive weight loss or for cosmetic reasons). Patients who do not complete the duration of treatment of negative pressure wound therapy (7 days), or patients who do not follow up for a minimum of 30 days from the date of surgery will be excluded. Adults unable to consent, infants, children, teenagers, pregnant patients and prisoners will be excluded. It is also extremely unlikely, based on our study population, that we will encounter any of these patients.</criteria>
