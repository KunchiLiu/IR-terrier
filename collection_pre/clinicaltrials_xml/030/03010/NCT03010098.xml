	<brief_title>The Effect on the Older's Cognition of Dual-loop Target Controlled Infusion Guided by Narcotrend Index</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Two hundreds of patients scheduled for surgery under general anesthesia were randomly divided into two groups:closed-loop (group A,n=100) and open-loop group(group B,n=100).The procedure during induction of anesthesia was same in two groups.In group A,if Narcotrend index(NI) fall down to 46 and keep more than 30 seconds,propofol and remifentanil were intravenously infused as feedback automatically to achieve the target NI of 26-46.However,the NI in group B was controlled manually.Taking an exam of MMSE before and after the surgery which measures if the older's cognition changed. Furthermore.we will measure the levels of protein S100beta and NSE.</detailed_description>
