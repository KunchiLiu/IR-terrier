	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of oral administration of Bifidobacterium animalis A6 on the metabolism of uremic toxins, in the patients with End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD). One hundred and fifty hemodialysis patients are recruited, and a Double Blind Randomized Parallel Controlled Trial was performed.The microbiota-derived uremic toxin, such as indoxyl sulfate and p-cresol sulfate, are measured as Primary Outcome. The Fecal microbiome, fecal metabolites, blood metabolites, defecation, Gastrointestinal Symptoms The Kidney Disease Quality of Life and The Occurrence of Cardiovascular Event are also assessed.</brief_summary>
