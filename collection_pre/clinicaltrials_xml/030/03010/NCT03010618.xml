	<brief_summary>In recent years restoring carious of fractured primary teeth with stainless steel crowns (SSC) has became more popular than ever. On the other hand the traditional operative approach of complete removal of caries is steadily losing support due to successful results with materials of high microleakage resistance. Treatment time and pain control in asymptomatic teeth has always been a problem in children. Hall technique is a minimally invasive treatment protocol that doesn't require local anesthesia, use of rotating devices for caries removal to restore primary teeth with SSC. But this protocol also raised questions in the scientific community about its possible effects on the dentition and temporomandibular joint (TMJ) for causing primary occlusal contact and increasing vertical dimension. The aim of our research is to study the effects of Hall technique's premature occlusal contact on TMJ.</brief_summary>
