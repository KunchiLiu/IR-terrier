	<criteria>Case 1. Subject who was diagnosed as thoracic aortic aneurysm/dissection by CT angiography, interventional angiography or vascular ultrasound; 2. Age is less than 80 years old; 3. male and non pregnancy female; 4. Subject understands study requirements aand agrees to sign an informed consent form prior to any study procedures. Case Subject has one of the following: 1. Pseudoaneurysm; 2. Previous infection or trauma in the damaged part of aorta; 3. Pregnancy female; 4. Participate in other clinical trials in the last 1 months. Control 1. Age and gender are matched with cases; 2. No aortic disease was detected by outpatient ultrasound; 3. No family history of cardiovascular disease; 4. Normal biochemical indicators; Criteria for culling, shedding and suspension testing: 1. Culling: Unqualified cases and controls. Data of culled subjects can not be used for statistical analysis; 2. Shedding: Subject that self withdrawal, loss to followup, or quitted by doctors; Reasons for shedding should be indicated for each shed subject. 3. Suspension: a) The researchers found significant safety problems or wrong study design; b) Researchers cannot continue clinical research due to funding or management reasons; c) Director ends the study. When suspension happens, all the CRF table should be reserved for future reference.</criteria>
