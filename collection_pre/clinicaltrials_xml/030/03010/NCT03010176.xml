	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to identify a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or maximum administered dose (MAD) of MK-1454 alone or MK-1454 in combination with pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in participants with advanced/metastatic solid tumors or lymphomas. MK-1454 will be administered intratumorally (IT); pembrolizumab will be administered intravenously (IV).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of MK-1454 Alone or in Combination With Pembrolizumab in Participants With Advanced/Metastatic Solid Tumors or Lymphomas (MK-1454-001)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants will receive either MK-1454 monotherapy or MK-1454 in combination with pembrolizumab for up to 35 cycles (approximately 2 years). Participants will undergo a 24-hour observation period following the first dose administration on Cycle 1, Day 1.</detailed_description>
