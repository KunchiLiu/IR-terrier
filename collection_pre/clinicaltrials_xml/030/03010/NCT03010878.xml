Participants were assigned to either a wait-list control group (self-management only), or a yoga intervention (self-management and yoga). Self-management education session occurred monthly within the community. Group yoga intervention was delivered two times a week with a specifically designed program that was progressively more difficult. Assessments were then administered pre and post intervention, and a semi-structured interview was completed following the intervention. Quantitative and qualitative data were then compared between groups.</brief_summary>
