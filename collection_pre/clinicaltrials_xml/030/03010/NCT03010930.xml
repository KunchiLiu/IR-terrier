	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine how repeated dietary exposure to umami taste affects umami taste perception, hedonics, food preferences, and satiety. Healthy adult subjects will consume a low glutamate vegetable broth daily for one month, where the experimental group's broth is supplemented with the umami-rich stimuli of monosodium glutamate (MSG) and the control group's low glutamate broth is matched for sodium (NaCl). The investigators hypothesize that repeated dietary exposure to umami taste will: 1. diminish umami suprathreshold intensity perception and hinder the ability to discriminate varying MSG concentrations 2. decrease liking of umami-rich foods and shift preferences upwards towards more intense umami stimuli 3. decrease satiation and decrease the satiating effect of a test meal</brief_summary>
