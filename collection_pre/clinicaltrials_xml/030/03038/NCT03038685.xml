	<brief_summary>The Belgian Stroke Council initiated a project to improve risk factor control and medication adherence in ischemic stroke patients by developing an individualized in-hospital initiated and post- discharge, digital coaching program addition to standard practice (strokecoach.be).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Personalized, Digital Coaching Program After Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The overall aim of this project is to further improve subacute and chronic stroke care in the Belgian context with main focus on the patients' quality of life, stroke recurrence and secondary cardiovascular prevention. Main focuses are on patient-empowerment, shared-decision making and health literacy, as these items are linked with better therapeutic adherence and self-care for chronic diseases. In case of a positive result, implementation of this individualized chronic stroke care program executed by a personal stroke coach, initiated during hospitalization and using a web-based intervention program, can easily be unrolled in other Belgian stroke units. The program can be cost-effective if better clinical outcome, stroke recurrence rates, number of in-hospital consultations, number of rehospitalisations are reduced. This will be evaluated in a in-depth healt-economic analysis.</detailed_description>
