	<criteria>1. Male or female patients age 22 years and older 2. Diagnostic head CT scan within 6 hours of ICH symptom onset 3. ICH &gt;3mL and &lt;90mL, as measured by the ABC method 4. Signed written informed consent by study subject or, if subject is unable, by subject's next of kin or legal guardian 5. Willingness and ability to comply with schedule for study procedures 1. Female patients who are pregnant or lactating 2. Patients with any history of seizure or seizure at stroke onset 3. Presence or history of any other condition or finding that, in the investigator's opinion, makes the patient unsuitable as a candidate for the SENSE device monitoring or study participation or may confound the outcome of the study 4. Any intraventricular hemorrhage on the diagnostic (preenrollment) CT 5. Secondary cause of ICH suspected (e.g., arteriovenous malformation, cavernoma, aneurysm, hemorrhagic transformation ischemic stroke, venous sinus thrombosis, trauma) 6. Planned withdrawal of care within 24 hours of enrollment 7. Planned surgical evacuation within 24 hours of enrollment 8. Current participation in a medical or surgical clinical trial 9. Presence of subdural, epidural or subarachnoid hemorrhage on diagnostic scan 10. Planned continued use of medications for conditions such as active depression or dementia that, in the investigator's best clinical judgment, could lower the seizure threshold 11. Planned continued use of medications that, in the investigator's best clinical judgment, could increase the chances for subsequent uncontrolled hemorrhage 12. Planned or current use of continuous EEG monitoring</criteria>
