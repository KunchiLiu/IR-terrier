	<brief_title>Magnesium Sulfate for the Improvement of Cognition in Patients With Alzheimer Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recent findings suggest magnesium may be effective in ameliorating symptoms in an Alzheimer's disease-like pathological progression by reducing AÎ²-plaque, thus preventing synapse loss and memory decline in transgenic mice. Common forms include magnesium sulfate. As a nutritional adjunct in hyperalimentation, the precise mechanism of action for magnesium is uncertain. Predominant deficiency effects are neurological, e.g., muscle irritability, clonic twitching and tremors. Hypocalcemia and hypokalemia often follow low serum levels of magnesium. While there are large stores of magnesium present intracellularly and in the bones of adults, these stores often are not mobilized sufficiently to maintain plasma levels. Parenteral magnesium therapy repairs the plasma deficit and causes deficiency symptoms and signs to cease. To provide a comprehensive clinical evaluation of the effects of Magnesium sulfate in AD patients, this study is designed to assess the impact of magnesium sulfate on amyloid plaque to generate valuable data on clinical utility for the use of diagnostic algorithms and foundation for the development of possible treatment.</detailed_description>
