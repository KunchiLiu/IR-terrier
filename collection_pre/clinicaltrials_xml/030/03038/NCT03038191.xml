	<brief_summary>Epilepsy is a group of neurological disorders characterized by propensity for spontaneous epileptic seizures. Epileptic seizures are the result of excessive and abnormal nerve cell activity in the brain. About 0.7-1% of the world population suffers from seizures. The most common treatment is based on seizure medications that enables about 2/3 of the patients to control their seizures. However, about 20 million patients worldwide, suffer from unpredictable seizures without remedy, and are resistant to medication. In this study EEG and other physiologic signals are collected using wearable sensors, from Epilepsy patients who are at risk of experiencing seizures. The collected signals will be used for developing algorithms that may identify pre-seizure and seizure related periods.</brief_summary>
