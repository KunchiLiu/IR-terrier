	<brief_summary>The ICU mortality rate of patients with septic shock was still high upto 54.1%.In first 6 hours of resuscitation, the goals of resuscitation in sepsis shock after adequate fluid resuscitation is MAP â‰¥65 mmHg. In refractory septic shock patient, prolong shock correlate with poor outcome due to multiple organ failure. Alternative vasopressor in septic shock with catecholamine resistance has been studied such as terlipressin, methylene blue - Terlipressin (TP) mediate vasoconstriction via V1 receptors coupled to phospholipase C, and increases intracellular Ca2+ concentration - Methylene blue (MB) directly inhibits nitric oxide synthase (NOS) by inhibit the enzyme guanylate cyclase (GC)</brief_summary>
