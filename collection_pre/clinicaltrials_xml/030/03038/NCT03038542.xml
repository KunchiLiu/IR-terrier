	<brief_summary>This study evaluates a text messaging intervention through a smokers' quitline. Smokers will either receive 30 weeks of tailored, gain-framed text messages or 30 weeks of tailored, standard care text messages, both combined with standard quitline treatment. We hypothesize that the gain-framed text message intervention will increase cessation rates at 30 weeks as compared to standard care text messages.</brief_summary>
