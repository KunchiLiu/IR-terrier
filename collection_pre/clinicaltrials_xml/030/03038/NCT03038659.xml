	<brief_title>Role of Intima-media Thickness in Determining Arteriogenic Erectile Dysfunction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The intima media thickness is increasingly used as a surrogate end point of vascular outcomes in clinical trials aimed at determining the success of interventions that lower risk factors for atherosclerosis and associated diseases (stroke, myocardial infarction and peripheral artery diseases, like disease of cavernosal artery). The investigators hypothesized that the IMT of cavernosal artery would add to the predictive value of vasculogenic erectile dysfunction risk and outcomes. This study seeks to evaluate these hypotheses with our experience, investigating the predictive accuracy of Cavernosal Doppler ultrasound findings for discriminating patients with vasculogenic erectile dysfunction.</detailed_description>
