	<brief_summary>After an ankle injury like distorsions, fractures or arthrodeses, or congenital defects ankle support limit the range of motion in the joint, help pain relief, control loading of the injured tissues and promote recovery of a normal gait pattern. Gait analysis is applied in orthopedics, sport science and rehabilitation. Numerous measure systems and methods enable accurate analysis of human movement. The study is set to describe and compare the gait analysis of two modifiable stability boots (Ortho® Tri-Phase and the VACOped®) on the standard walking parameters during two conditions (level and ramp walking) in healthy adults and draw comparisons with a control indoor shoe.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The participants are joining one session in the gait lab. Here the are measured during walking with normal shoes and two modifiable stability boots. The duration of a session is typically 3 hours.</detailed_description>
