	<brief_summary>This study is a clinical study to investigate the efficacy of liraglutide compared to placebo in reducing visceral adiposity measured by MRI in overweight or obese subjects at high risk for cardiovascular disease after 40 weeks on-treatment.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Obesity has long been recognized as a risk factor for all-cause mortality and morbidity, including the development of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases such as coronary artery disease, hypertension, insulin resistance, diabetes, and dyslipidemia. Obesity has recently been formally defined as a chronic disease characterized by pathophysiological processes that result in increased adipose tissue mass and can result in increased morbidity and mortality. Although the health risks associated with obesity are clear, there is an emerging appreciation that obesity per se, as defined by simple anthropometric measures such as waist circumference or body mass index (BMI), is neither necessary nor sufficient to promote cardiometabolic disease and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk. As a result, BMI alone is an insufficient marker of risk and may not accurately identify individuals at elevated risk for ASCVD. There is a pressing need to more accurately phenotype obesity to identify individuals at elevated risk for ASCVD that may benefit from more intensive preventive and therapeutic strategies</detailed_description>
