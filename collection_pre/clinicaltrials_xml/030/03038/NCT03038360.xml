	<brief_title>Prospective Study With AMI Patients Undergoing PCI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CardioSAVE is a prospective 12-month controlled longitudinal study in 600 AMI patients, with a one year follow-up conducted by the Bad Krozingen Heart Center. The objectif is to validate a novel predictive model and a diagnostic tool, for the risk stratification of AMI patients undergoing PCI. The sample and data collected by eCRF will allow to set up a prototype personalized medicine device focusing on Heart Failure (HF) induced by AMI. The primary endpoint will be the proportion of patients with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt; 40% at 6 months. The main secondary endpoint is recovery of regional wall motion measured by cMRI at 6 months. Early time point samples, cMRI at day 3 and other clinical patient data will be used to estimate the risk associated with patients and the data obtained will be correlated with the one year outcome of patients.</detailed_description>
