	<brief_title>Variable Approaches of Intradiscal O3-O2 Injection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Low back pain (LBP) mostly is induced by disc herniation (DH), or degeneration and has a burden upon social and economic aspects of life. Medical and or surgical interventions have been used to resolve this problem, but one of the newly introduced is the minimally invasive low cost Intradiscal injection of ozone-oxygen mixture (O3-O2) which offers a rapid onset amelioration of symptoms, with a sustained duration pain relief. A lot of injection approaches are available, but which offers the best results, is the question.</detailed_description>
