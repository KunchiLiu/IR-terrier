	<brief_summary>We are comparing the patient experience between the standard 30 g needle to the smaller 33 g needle for intravitreal injections of ranabizumab or aflibercept for age related macular degeneration, diabetic macular edema, or retina vein occlusions.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>30g vs 33g Needle for Intravitreal Injections</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, randomized, interventional pilot study, which seeks to compare the patient experience using 30-gauge versus 33-gauge needle for bilateral same-day intravitreal injections of ranibizumab or aflibercept for the treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD), diabetic macular edema (DME), or macular edema associated with retinal vein occlusion (RVO). The null hypothesis is that there is no difference in patient discomfort or pain with the 30-gauge needle compared to the 33-gauge needle.</detailed_description>
