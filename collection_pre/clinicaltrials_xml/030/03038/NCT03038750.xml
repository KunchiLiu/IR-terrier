	<brief_summary>The risk of cardiovascular disease is determined by the complex interplay between an individual's genetic make-up, lifestyle, and the environment. We are investigating three potential genetic risk factors in this observational, cross-sectional, epidemiology pilot study to investigate if and how functional variants identified in large-scale genome wide association studies can explain a predisposition to cardiovascular disease. By determining the molecular mechanisms that are regulated at the EDNRA, PNPLA3 and PROCR CVD risk loci, we hope to translate findings from this study into the clinical setting for better diagnosis, prevention and treatment for patients suffering with cardiovascular disease. Volunteers will enter into one of the study's three arms based on their genotype: EDNRA locus (Arm 1), PNPLA3 locus (Arm 2), or PROCR locus (Arm 3). Members of the Cambridge Bioresource who match for the target alleles will be invited to participate and will enter into one of the three study arms. All study assessment visits will take place at Addenbrooke's Hospital in collaboration with the University of Cambridge. Volunteers will participate in the study for a maximum of 12 months and depending on study arm they are assigned to, they will complete procedures including a medical, demographic and lifestyle factors questionnaire; height, weight and body fat assessments; in addition to blood pressure/heart rate measurements. Minimally invasive procedures including forearm blood flow and venepuncture will be performed to assess the primary objectives of the study. The hypothesis for arm 1 is that the genetic variant we are investigating at the EDNRA gene locus alters the function of the endothelin receptor A leading to an increased risk of coronary artery disease and large artery stroke. For study arm 2, we hypothesize that the genetic variant we are investigating in PNPLA3 will increase the risk of Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease but reduce the risk of Coronary Heart Disease. For study arm 3, we hypothesize that the genetic variant we are investigating in the PROCR locus triggers molecular events that potentially increase the risk of Venous Thrombosis/Venous Thromboembolism nut reducing blood pressure. Furthermore we aim to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects to see if there is an effect on explaining reduced risk of CHD. This study has backing from the BHF Cambridge Center of Excellence and the Wellcome Trust Institutional Strategic Support Fund.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Volunteers are homozygous for: Arm 1: The Aallele of rs6841581, they are assigned to the 'case' group. If they are homozygous for the Gallele, they are assigned to the 'control' group Arm 2: The Gallele of rs738409, they are assigned to the 'case' group. If they are homozygous for the Callele, they are assigned to the 'control' group Arm 3: The Gallele of rs867186, they are assigned to the 'case' group. If they are homozygous for the Aallele, they are assigned to the 'control' group Genotype groups are matched for sex, i.e. 50% female Volunteers are aged between 3040 years old Volunteers have a BMI: Arm 1: Healthy BMI between 18.524.9 Arm 2: Slightly increased BMI, between 2532 Arm 3: Healthy BMI, between 18.524.9 Volunteers are willing not to consume products containing alcohol or caffeine 12 hours prior to procedures. Additionally, volunteers must agree to fast before procedures for: Arm 1: At least 4 hours Arm 2: At least 8 hours Arm 3: At least 4 hours Have given written informed consent to participate Volunteers with chronic diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, liver diseases, type 1 and type 2 diabetes autoimmune diseases and cancer Biological firstdegree relatives (parents, brothers or sisters) who are or have suffered from one of the conditions described above Current smokers.
