	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial studies how well nivolumab with or without varlilumab works in treating patients with aggressive B-cell lymphomas that have come back or do not respond to treatment. Monoclonal antibodies, such as varlilumab and nivolumab, may work by stimulating the immune system to attack cancer tumor cells.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nivolumab With or Without Varlilumab in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Aggressive B-cell Lymphomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the anti-malignant cell activity of combination therapy with varlilumab and nivolumab as compared to nivolumab alone in patients with advanced aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL) based on the revised Lugano classification response criteria. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the safety and tolerability profile of treatment with a combination of varlilumab and nivolumab in patients with advanced aggressive B-cell NHL. II. To evaluate the duration of response, progression-free survival and overall survival. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the effect of combination therapy with varlilumab and nivolumab on the immune system as assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC), mass cytometry (CyTOF) and changes in serum cytokine profile. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups. GROUP I: Patients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes every 2 weeks for 4 months and every 4 weeks for a total of up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients may cross over to Group II at the time of disease progression. GROUP II: Patients receive varlilumab IV over 90 minutes every 2 weeks for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive nivolumab IV over 60 minutes every 2 weeks for 4 months and every 4 weeks for a total of up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 100 days.</detailed_description>

females of childbearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation and for 23 weeks after the last dose of study drug; males who are the sexual partners of a female of childbearing potential must use any contraceptive method with a failure rate of less than 1% per year for the duration of study participation and for a period of 31 weeks after the last dose of study drug; these periods of required use of contraception have been calculated using the upper limit of the halflife for nivolumab (25 days) and are based on the protocol requirement that females of childbearing potential use contraception for 5 halflives plus 30 days and males who are the sexual partners of females of childbearing potential use contraception for 5 halflives plus 90 days;
