	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of 4 Cycles XELOX Pre- and post-a delayed TME compared with 8 Cycles XELOX post-a Regular Timing TME after Continuous Infusion Fluorouracil with Long-term Radiotherapy for patients with high-risk rectal cancer defined by MRI.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of 4 Cycles XELOX Pre- and post-a Delayed TME Compared With 8 Cycles XELOX post-a Regular Timing TME in Patients With High Risk Rectal Cancer (EXPLORE)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is the randomised, multi-centers, open-labeled, and phase III study. Delivering systemic chemotherapy between continuous infusion of Fluorouracil with long-term radiotherapy (CRT) and total mesorectal excision (TME) surgery would be more effectively improved local control rates and improved metastases-free survival rates. The investigators attempted to investigate the effect on disease free survival of delivering 4cycles XELOX between CRT and TME with lengthening the interval from radiation to surgery. In this study, the participants with high risk of deeper infiltration, or extramural vessel invasion, or circumferential resection margin involvement, or lymph nodes metastases and et al. were recruited. The participants will be randomized (1:1 ratio) to a control and intervention arm. The participants in the control arm will receive best current practice of TME at 6-8 weeks after continuous infusion Fluorouracil with long-term radiotherapy and then a 8cycles of XELOX as standard adjuvant chemotherapy. The participants in the intervention arm will receive 4cycles XELOX pre- and post- a delayed TME after continuous infusion Fluorouracil with long-term radiotherapy.</detailed_description>
