	<brief_title>Solifenacin, Levofloxacin or Lornoxicam, Which Is Ideal for Management of Intravesical Instillation BCG Side Effects?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For urothelial carcinoma (UC), which accounts for over 90% of bladder cancers, more than 70% of bladder cancer patients present with non‐muscle‐invasive disease. Approximately 40-80% of these tumors will recur within the first year, of which 10-25% will progress to muscle‐invasive disease. Intravesical treatments with cytotoxic chemotherapy and immunotherapy have become the mainstay following transurethral resection (TUR). Increasing knowledge of BCG use allows for effective management of these once debilitating side effects. The majority of patients will still experience cystitis‐like symptoms to some degree, including urinary frequency (71%), cystitis (67%), fever (25%), and hematuria (23%). Oxybutynin increases in fever, flu-like symptoms, dry mouth and constipation. However, in this study oxybutynin started the night before treatment causing an element of incomplete bladder emptying and allowing an increased BCG dwell time. We think that these effect can be reversed by use anticholinergic 6 hours post BCG instillation Anti-inflammatory drugs significantly reduced BCG-induced granulocyte activation and did not impair BCG-induced lymphocyte cytotoxicity against bladder tumor cells in mice. The committee of International Bladder Cancer Group (IBCG) recommend use of anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs) for treatment of non-bacterial or chemical cystitis and other systemic BCG side effect. Fluoroquinolone with tuberculostatic properties, has been shown to significantly prolong survival in mice with BCG systemic infection and did not affect the antitumor efficacy of BCG. ofloxacin significantly decreased by 18.5% the incidence of class II or higher moderate and severe adverse events of BCG. Because of sparse published studies on BCG side effect management, the 2016 European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines management options for side effects associated with intravesical BCG modify the IBCG committee clinical practice without any degree of recommendation. So, in this study the investigators will try to fill the gap in the literature.</detailed_description>
