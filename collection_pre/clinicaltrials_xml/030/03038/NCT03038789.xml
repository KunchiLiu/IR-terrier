	<brief_title>XIGDUO Extended Release (XR) (DAPAGLIFLOZIN/METFORMIN XR FDC) Regulatory Postmarketing Surveillance To Observe Safety and Effectiveness Of XigduoXR (Registered) In Korean Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Primary objective: Descriptive analysis of the proportion (%) of adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), unexpected adverse events∙adverse drug reactions and AEs of special interest (AESI) in patients who are treated with Xigduo XR for type 2 diabetes mellitus by physicians in the normal clinical practice setting over a period of 12 or 24 weeks. - Secondary objective: To follow the changes of values of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), 2-hr post-prandial glucose (PPG-2hr), blood pressure, abdominal circumference and body weight and self-reported data in this cohort of patients from baseline to completion of the study. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of Xigduo XR in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus based on conducted laboratory test (Laboratory tests are not mandatory because of the non-interventional nature of this study)</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients will be enrolled by a continuous registration method. Investigators should enroll adult patients who are diagnosed with T2DM and who initiate treatment with Xigduo XR for the first time. Patients (or a legally acceptable representative) who has been informed of all pertinent aspects of the study will sign the Informed Consent Form for use of data. Discontinuation of treatment will be determined by a patient's willingness to continue treatment and the investigator's discretion. The reason for discontinued treatment will be documented. 1. Patients aged 18 years and older 2. Patients with T2DM eligible for treatment with Xigduo XR at first according to the indication as indicated in the locally approved prescribing information 3. Patients with evidence of a personally signed and dated informed consent document indicating that the patient (or a legally acceptable representative) has been informed of all pertinent aspects of the study. 1. Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients 2. Patients with renal impairment (e.g., serum creatinine levels ≥ 1.5 mg/dL for men, ≥ 1.4 mg/dL for women, or creatinine clearance &lt; 60 milliliter(mL)/min or estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)&lt; 60mL/min/1.73 m2) which may also result from conditions such as cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, and septicemia. 3. Patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus or acute or chronic metabolic acidosis including diabetic ketoacidosis with or without a coma 4. Congestive heart failure that medicinal treatment is required 5. Patients with radiologic studies involving the use of intravascular iodinated contrast materials (for example, intravenous urogram, intravenous cholangiography, angiography, and computed tomography (CT) scans with intravascular contrast materials) 6. Patients with severe infection or severe traumatism 7. In terms of Surgical procedures (except minor procedures not associated with restricted intake of food and fluids) 8. Patients with nutrition poor condition, starvation condition, pituitary insufficiency, capsular insufficiency 9. Patients with impaired hepatic function (Since impaired hepatic function has been associated with some cases of lactic acidosis, this drug should generally be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease.), respiratory failure, acute myocardial infarction, acute or chronic disease causing histotoxic hypoxia like shock, an alcoholic, gastroenteric trouble (anhydremia, diarrhea, vomiting and etc.) 10. Pregnant women, women with potential of pregnancy, lactating women</criteria>
