	<brief_summary>This is a randomized, double-blinded pilot study to determine whether patients undergoing ambulatory total knee arthroplasty (TKA) using a subvastus approach benefit from the addition of a continuous adductor canal nerve block (cACB) catheter along with an existing multimodal approach to postoperative analgesia. Outcomes include the 15-item Quality of Recovery Scale (QoR-15) (Miles 2016), pain scores, opioid consumption, opioid-free days, functional outcome as measured by the Time Up and Go (TUG) test, patient satisfaction, patient's rating of catheter effectiveness, and complications.</brief_summary>
