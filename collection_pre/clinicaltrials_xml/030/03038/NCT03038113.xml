	<brief_summary>This randomized study will be conducted in two parts to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacokinetics of subcutaneous administration of RO7062931. Part 1 will include only healthy participants and Part 2 will include only participants with chronic hepatitis B (CHB). Part 1 is an adaptive, single-ascending dose study with an adaptive dose-escalating schedule to determine the best dose to be evaluated in participants with CHB. Part 2 is an adaptive, parallel multiple-dose study comprised of two sub-parts which will be used to further refine the dose and dosing regimen.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>FOR HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS ONLY PART 1 A Body Mass Index (BMI) between 18 to 30 kg/m2 inclusive and a body weight of at least 50 kg. Women should be of nonchildbearing potential. A woman is considered to be of childbearing potential if she is postmenarcheal but has not reached a postmenopausal state and has not undergone surgical sterilization (removal of ovaries and/or uterus). Men must agree to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use contraceptive measures during treatment and up to 105 days after the last dose, and agree to refrain from donating sperm. Nonsmoker (nor tobacco containing products) for at least 90 days prior to dosing on Day 1 and agree to remain as nonsmoker during the study. FOR CHB PARTICIPANTS ONLY PART 2: A BMI between 18 to 32 kg/m2 inclusive. Chronic hepatitis B (HBV) infection. Positive test for HBsAg for more than 6 months prior to randomization and HBsAg titer ≥ 10^3 IU/mL at screening. On entecavir, tenofovir, adefovir or telbivudine treatment for at least 6 months prior to randomization and will remain on stable treatment during the study. HBV deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) ≤ 90 IU/mL for at least the preceding 6 months. Screening laboratory values (hematology, chemistry, urinalysis) obtained up to 56 days prior to first study treatment within normal ranges. Liver biopsy, fibroscan® or equivalent test obtained within the past 6 months demonstrating liver disease consistent with chronic HBV infection without evidence of bridging fibrosis or cirrhosis Women should be of nonchildbearing potential. A woman is considered to be of childbearing potential if she is postmenarcheal but has not reached a postmenopausal state and has not undergone surgical sterilization (removal of ovaries and/or uterus). Men must agree to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use contraceptive measures during treatment and up to 105 days after the last dose, and agree to refrain from donating sperm. FOR HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS ONLY PART 1: History of drug or alcohol abuse or dependence in previous 6 months. Positive urine drug and alcohol screen at Day 1. Positive result on hepatitis B (HBV), hepatitis C (HCV), or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 1 and 2. Confirmed blood pressure or resting pulse rate outside of accepted ranges. Participation in an investigational drug or device study within 90 days prior to screening. Donation of blood over 500 mL within three months prior to screening. Any major illness within the one month, or any febrile illness within two weeks preceding the screening visit. Alcohol consumption of more than 2 standard drinks per day on average. FOR CHB PARTICIPANTS ONLY PART 2: History or other evidence of bleeding from esophageal varices. Decompensated liver disease. History of or suspicion of hepatocellular carcinoma or alpha fetoprotein (AFP) ≥ 13 ng/mL at Screening History or other evidence of a medical condition associated with chronic liver disease other than HBV infection. Documented history or other evidence of metabolic liver disease within one year of randomization or documented history of infection with hepatitis D virus. Positive test for hepatitis A (IgM antiHAV), hepatitis C, or HIV. Organ transplantation. Significant acute infection or any other clinically significant illness within 2 weeks of randomization. Abnormal renal function. Participation in an investigational drug or device study within 30 days prior to randomization. Donation or loss of blood over 500 mL within 3 months prior to starting study medication. Administration of any blood product within 3 months of randomization. History or evidence of alcohol abuse (consumption of more than 2 standard drinks per day on average).</criteria>
