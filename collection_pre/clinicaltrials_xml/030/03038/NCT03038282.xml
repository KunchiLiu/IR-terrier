	<brief_summary>The effect of Chromium to improve glucose levels in Alzheimer Disease (AD) is controversial. The hypothesis of the study is to evaluate the effect of supplementing the AD individuals with Chromium combined with exercise and assessing the effect of the supplementation on glucose metabolism.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Chromium on Insulin Resistance in Alzheimer Disease Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chromium is an essential nutrient required for optimal insulin activity and normal carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. Beyond its nutritional effects, dietary supplement of chromium causes beneficial outcomes against several diseases, in particular diabetes-associated complications such as Alzheimer Disease. Common forms include chromium chloride, chromium nicotinate, and chromium picolinate. The argument for chromium supplementation relies on evidence from case reports of resolution of diabetic symptoms refractory to insulin via chromium added to total parenteral nutrition, and experiments in which animals deficient in chromium exhibited impaired glucose metabolism. Chromium may influence glucose metabolism by increasing the number of insulin receptors or by binding insulin to receptors. The US Food and Drug Administration concludes that, based on recent studies, chromium picolinate may reduce the risk of insulin resistance and therefore may reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes. A number of systematic reviews and meta-analyses have been conducted to determine the effect of chromium on glycemic control, although large, quality trials are limited. The majority of studies have found no effect on measured outcomes, with a few studies contributing to the positive observed effects. Variations of preparations used in the trials and study conditions make generalization of the results difficult. In order to provide a comprehensive clinical evaluation of the effects of Chromium in AD patients, we will conduct a double-blinded and placebo-controlled trial in subjects with AD.</detailed_description>
