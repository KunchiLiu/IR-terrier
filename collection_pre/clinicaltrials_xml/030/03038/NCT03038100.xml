	<brief_summary>This is a Phase III, global, double-blind, two-arm, randomized study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of atezolizumab administered with paclitaxel + carboplatin + bevacizumab compared with placebo + paclitaxel + carboplatin + bevacizumab in participants with Stage III or Stage IV ovarian (OC), fallopian tube (FTC), or primary peritoneal cancer (PPC) who have macroscopic residual disease postoperatively (i.e., after primary tumor reductive surgery) or who will undergo neoadjuvant therapy followed by interval surgery.</brief_summary>
