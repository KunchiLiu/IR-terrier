	<brief_summary>Hepatopulmonary Syndrome is a respiratory complication of liver cirrhosis defined as a triad: hypoxemia (PaO2 &lt; 80 mmHg in room air), chronic liver disease and intrapulmonary vasodilatations. Its prevalence varies between 4 and 32%. Numerous treatments have been tried but the only efficient therapy to cure the syndrome is liver transplantation. Without transplantation it is associated with a higher mortality which is the reason why hepatopulmonary syndrome patients have a higher priority to transplantation. However it appears in some restricted studies that hepatopulmonary syndrome is associated with more postoperative complications (infections, vascular and biliary complications, prolonged length of mechanical ventilationâ€¦). The investigators hypothesised that hepatopulmonary syndrome patients have more postoperative complications after liver transplantation than non hepatopulmonary syndrome patients matched on age, MELD (Model for End-Stage Liver Disease) score, comorbidities, perioperative transfusion and noradrenaline doses.</brief_summary>
