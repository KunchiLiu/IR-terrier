	<brief_summary>Appropriate use of oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs) including dose-reduction is important for patient's safety in T2DM patients with renal impairment (RI). However, there are insufficient data on dose adjustment in accordance with the prescription pattern and the risk of RI of OADs, in particular DPP-4 inhibitors, in clinical practice in Japan. Therefore, we will investigate OADs usage conditions and dose selection in T2DM patients with RI in clinical practice in Japan</brief_summary>
