	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to select the optimal antigen content of the three Sabin poliovirus strains (types 1, 2, and 3) entering the composition of the stand-alone trivalent Sabin-based inactivated poliomyelitis vaccine (sIPV) to take forward into advanced stage studies. The selection will be carried out comparing the three sIPV study arms based on the safety and tolerability profile after each dose of primary immunization and the immune response to poliovirus types 1, 2, and 3 for both Sabin and Salk strains, after the final dose of a three dose primary immunization series (Day 85).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The drug being tested in this study is called sIPV. sIPV is used to prevent poliomyelitis. This study will look at the safety, tolerability of sIPV in healthy adults, toddlers and infants as well as immunogenicity in toddlers and infants. . The study will enroll approximately 340 participants including 40 adults, 60 toddlers and 240 infants. Adult participants will be randomly assigned to one of the two treatment groups—which will remain undisclosed to study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent medical need): - sIPV High Dose - Placebo (saline control - 0.9% sodium chloride) Toddler participants will be randomly assigned to one of the following treatment groups: - sIPV High Dose - Reference IPV Infant participants will be randomly assigned to one of following treatment groups: - sIPV Low Dose - sIPV Medium Dose - sIPV High Dose - Reference IPV Adults and toddlers will receive intramuscular injection on Day 1. Infants will receive intramuscular injection on Days 1, 29, 57 and 365. This is a single center trial. The overall time to participate in this study for adult is 8 days, for toddlers is 183 days and infants is 547 days.</detailed_description>

Toddlers in good health at the time of entry into the trial as determined by medical history, physical examination (including vital signs) and clinical judgment of the investigator. 2. Completed primary immunization against poliomyelitis, preferably with IPV, according to local recommendations. Infant Dose Ranging Cohort 1. Infants are in good health at the time of entry into the trial as determined by medical history, physical examination (including vital signs) and clinical judgment of the investigator. 3. Infants must have been born full term (3742 weeks of gestation). Adult Leadin Cohort 1. Has body mass index (BMI) greater than or equal to 35 kg/m^2 (= weight in kg [height in meters * height in meters]. Toddler Leadin Cohort 1. Last polio vaccination (either inactivated or oral) received within 5 months prior to first trial visit. 2. Household member/sibling who had received or is/are scheduled to receive Oral Poliomyelitis Vaccine (OPV) in the previous 3 months until 5 weeks post participant's inclusion in the study. 3. Prior vaccination with booster dose of diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (acellular or whole cell), polio (either inactivated or oral), or Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccines. Infant Dose Ranging Cohort 1. Infants with low birth weight according to local standards. 2. Prior vaccination with polio vaccines (either inactivated or oral). 3. Household member/sibling that had received or is/are scheduled to receive OPV in the previous 3 months until 5 weeks after the third dose of the primary immunization series. 4. Prior vaccination with any diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (acellular or whole cell), Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine or polio vaccine (OPV or IPV). Note, BCG at birth and prior vaccination with Hepatitis B vaccine given at least 4 weeks prior to first trial visit are not exclusion criteria. All Cohorts 1. Any significant chronic infection. 2. Any clinically significant active infection (as assessed by the investigator) or temperature ≥38.0°C (&gt;100.4°F), within 3 days of intended trial vaccination. 3.
