	<brief_summary>The study will enroll well-compensated cirrhotic as well as non-cirrhotic subjects treatment experienced with an NS5a Inhibitor + sofosbuvir and will include patients who did not complete the prescribed duration due to adverse event or any reason other than for non/poor compliance. Subjects will be randomized to 12 or 16 weeks of treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 3b, Multi-Center, Randomized, Open-Label Study of G/P +/- RBV for NS5A + SOF Previously Treated GT1 HCV Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of glecaprevir and pibrentasvir (G/P) for 12 weeks to G/P for 16 weeks in non-cirrhotic NS5A (non-structural protein 5a)-inhibitor plus sofosbuvir ± RBV (Ribavirin) treatment-experienced adults with HCV genotype 1 (GT1) infection, and to compare the efficacy and safety of G/P with RBV for 12 weeks to G/P without RBV for 16 weeks in NS5A-inhibitor plus sofosbuvir (SOF) ± RBV treatment-experienced adults with compensated cirrhosis and GT1 infection.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Male or female at least 18 years of age at time of screening. 2. A history of previous treatment with an NS5Ainhibitor plus sofosbuvir therapy ± RBV for chronic HCV genotype 1 infection. 3. Treatment must have been completed at least 1 month prior to Screening Visit. 4. Screening laboratory result indicating chronic HCV GT1 infection. Subjects must be able to understand and adhere to the study visit schedule and all other protocol requirements and must voluntarily sign and date an informed consent. 1. History of severe, lifethreatening or other significant sensitivity to any drug. 2. Female who is pregnant, planning to become pregnant during the study or breastfeeding; or male whose partner is pregnant or planning to become pregnant during the study. 3. Recent (within 6 months prior to study drug administration) history of drug or alcohol abuse that could preclude adherence to the protocol in the opinion of the investigator. 4. Positive test result at Screening for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or antihuman immunodeficiency virus antibody (HIV Ab) in patient without known history of HIV infection. 5. HCV genotype performed during screening indicating coinfection with more than one HCV genotype. 6. History or presence of liver decompensation.</criteria>
