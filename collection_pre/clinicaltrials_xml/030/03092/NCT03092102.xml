	<brief_title>The Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetic Study of HEC585 in Healthy Male and Female Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This will be a double-blind, placebo-controlled, single, and multiple oral dose study conducted in 2 parts. Part A will comprise a single-dose, sequential-group study incorporating a food effect evaluation. Up to 48 subjects will be studied in up to 6 groups (Groups A1 to A6), with each group consisting of 8 subjects. Each subject will participate in 1 treatment period only and reside at the clinical research unit (CRU) from Day -1 (the day before dosing) to Day 7 (144 hours postdose), except for Group A3, which will participate in a second treatment period for a food effect evaluation. Each subject in Group A3 will participate in 2 treatment periods separated by a minimum of 7 days. Dosing of subjects in the fed state in Group A3 can commence after review of the safety data from Group A4. Part B will comprise a multiple-dose, sequential-group study. Up to 36 subjects will be studied in up to 3 groups (Groups B1 to B3), with each group consisting of 12 subjects. Part B of the study may start after completion of Group A5, at a dose equal or less than given in Groups A1 to A3.</detailed_description>

In good health, determined by no clinically significant findings from medical history, physical examination, 12lead ECG, vital sign measurements, and clinical laboratory evaluations (congenital nonhemolytic hyperbilirubinemia [eg, Gilbert's syndrome] is not acceptable) at Screening and/or Checkin as assessed by the Investigator (or designee). 4. Females will be nonpregnant and nonlactating. Females of childbearing potential and male subjects will agree to use contraception. 5. Able to comprehend and willing to sign an informed consent form (ICF) and to abide by the study restrictions. 1.

History of significant hypersensitivity, intolerance, or allergy to any drug compound, food, or other substance, unless approved by the Investigator (or designee). 3. History of stomach or intestinal surgery or resection that would potentially alter absorption and/or excretion of orally administered drugs (uncomplicated appendectomy and hernia repair will be allowed). 4. History of alcoholism or drug/chemical abuse within 2 years prior to Checkin. 5. Alcohol consumption of &gt; 21 units per week for males and &gt; 14 units for females. One unit of alcohol equals 12 oz (360 mL) beer, 1Â½ oz (45 mL) liquor, or 5 oz (150 mL wine), or a positive alcohol breath test at Checkin. 6. Positive urine drugs of abuse screen including cotinine at Screening or Checkin. 7.

Absolute lymphocyte count below the lower limit of normal which can be confirmed by repeat. 9. Participation in a clinical study involving administration of an investigational drug (new chemical entity) in the past 30 days or 5 halflives (if known), whichever is longer, prior to Checkin. 10. Use or intend to use any medications/products known to alter drug absorption, metabolism, or elimination processes, including St. John's Wort, within 30 days prior to Checkin, unless deemed acceptable by the Investigator (or designee). Strong CYP3A inhibitors and inducers should be avoided. 11. Use or intend to use any prescription medications/products, within 14 days prior to Checkin, unless deemed acceptable by the Investigator (or designee). 12.
