	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether a medication, Clonidine can reduce the number of days a baby spends in the hospital and the number of days of medical treatment of withdrawal from Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS) as compared to Morphine Sulfate (used in routine care) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment of Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome With Clonidine Versus Morphine as Primary Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Finnegan scoring system will be initiated for the subjects that are at risk and are exhibiting withdrawal symptoms. The nursing staff will be using the Modified Finnegan Scoring system currently used in Cooper Hospital that all had been trained in. Nurses will be blinded to the specific medication being used for treatment of neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) during the study. The scoring will be initiated for the babies that are at risk for NAS and are having symptoms of withdrawal. This is determined by the maternal history of use/abuse of substances or prescription medications that can result in NAS (Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome) in the neonate and/or if there is a positive urine toxicology screen. Patients will be recruited if there is at risk for NAS and enrolled in the study if the patient exhibits withdrawal symptoms requiring pharmacologic treatment. The indication for initiating therapy is three consecutive Finnegan scores of 8 or greater. The subjects will be randomized to the control (standard of care) group or the intervention (study) group once the need for initiating pharmacologic therapy is established. A strict protocol will be followed. For each baby undergoing NAS scoring and if therapy needs to be initiated then physical therapy will be consulted. Blood pressure and heart rate will be checked once treatment is started: 1. Check every three or four hours (with hands on care) for the first 24 hours (day 1 of medication) of treatment. 2. Check every eight hours (or 6 hours with care) for the next 24 hours (day 2 of medication). 3. Check every twelve hours for day 3 of treatment and until discontinuation of therapy. 4. Check every twelve hours for 24 hours after the discontinuation of the medication. If the infant is started on medication at less than 7 days of age, the birth weight will be used for medication dose throughout the study, for weaning and for increasing the dose. If the infant is started on medication after 7 days of life, then the current weight will be used for initiation of medication dose and same weight will be used throughout the study and for increases and weaning of the medication dose. The mother/legal guardian will be approached for the consent. Randomization to the standard therapy group (Morphine sulfate group) versus intervention group (Clonidine group). 1. When the patient is determined to receive treatment by the treating physician, a member of the research team will be notified. 2. Randomization procedure will take place. 3. The nurses, the parents and the medical staff directly taking care of the patient will be blinded and be unaware of exact or the specific group the patient is randomized to. Medication 1. Standard Group: Start Morphine at 0.03 mg/kg/dose every 3 hours or 0.04 mg/kg/dose every 4 hours. 2. Intervention Group: Start Clonidine at 0.38 mcg/kg/dose every 3 hours or 0.5 mcg/kg/dose every 4 hours Continue scoring as per standard protocol using the Modified Finnegan Scoring Tool. Medication will not be weaned for the first 24 hours, even if the scores are low For three scores of 8 or greater or 2 scores of greater than or equal to 13: a. Increase the dose of the medication by 25%. 14. If very elevated score and/or significant distress may give one rescue dose of: a. Morphine 0.02 mg b. Clonidine 0.25 mg 15. If there are 3 consecutive scores higher than 8 and if: 1. Clonidine needs to be increased greater than 4 times, may add Phenobarbital at 5 mg/kg/day divided BID = 2.5 mg/kg, every 12 hours. No loading doses. 2. Morphine needs to be increased greater than 4 times, may add Phenobarbital at Do not weight adjust the5 mg/kg/day divided BID = 2.5 mg/kg, every 12 hours. No loading doses. 16. Phenobarbital dose will not be weight adjusted unless the patient is not stable or there is difficulty weaning Clonidine or Morphine. Clonidine and Morphine will not be weight adjusted. Clonidine/Morphine will be decreased by 10% of the highest dose using the original/birth weight (same amount each time) every 24 hours to 48 hours, provided the scores remain below 8. Example: If started at 0.04 mg/kg based on 2 kg, will wean by 0.004 mg/kg, using 2 kg. 19. Discontinue (notified by the pharmacist when reaching the discontinuation dose): 1. Clonidine once dose is at 0.2 mcg/kg/dose (1 mcg/kg/day). 2. Morphine once dose is at 0.02 mg/kg/dose (1 mcg/kg/day). 3. Pharmacy to notify the provider team when at 0.026 mg/kg/dose of Morphine or 0.26 mcg/kg/dose of Clonidine to initiate the discharge planning. Monitor for a minimum of 24 hours after the medication is discontinued. Infants may be discharged on Phenobarbital or Clonidine or both. The medical team, including the neonatologist, nurses, residents, and the advanced practitioner nurses will be blinded to the specific medication being used. The primary investigator (who is not taking care of the patient at that time) and the pharmacist will not be blinded regarding which group the patient belongs to, the control group or the intervention group. Medication will be ordered in Epic (EHR) as research drug one or two and dose adjusted by a percent of the dose. This way, specific dosing will not be known to the treatment team, as the doses of two medications are different.</detailed_description>
