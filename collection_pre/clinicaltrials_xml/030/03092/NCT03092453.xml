	<brief_title>Dendritic Cell Vaccination in Patients With Advanced Melamona</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After consent and screening, subjects will have apheresis performed at approximately day -7 followed by cyclophosphamide 300mg/m^2 intravenously or by mouth on day -4 to -3. On Day 1 the subject will receive parin vaccine dose (mature DC 7.5-15 million/peptide) followed by two booster doses (every 6 weeks) of mature DC 1-5 million/peptode. Re-staging will occur after the 3rd DC vaccine along with tumor biopsy and second apheresis. Anti PD-1 therapy (standard of care) will commence 7-8 weeks after the subjects' last DC vaccine.</detailed_description>
