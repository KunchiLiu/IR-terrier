	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of cryoablation therapy for the treatment of mild to moderate obesity and test the safety (good and bad effects) of this procedure. The vagus nerve transmits hunger signals from the stomach to the brain, and in response transmits stomach expansion signals from the brain to the stomach. Investigators believe that by interrupting this communication, participants could experience less hunger and in turn lose weight.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose of this single arm study is to assess the efficacy of cryoablation therapy for the treatment of mild to moderate obesity and test the safety (good and bad effects) of this procedure. The vagus nerve transmits hunger signals from the stomach to the brain, and in response transmits stomach expansion signals from the brain to the stomach.Investigators believe that by interrupting this communication, participants could experience less hunger and in turn lose weight. The rationale for using cryoablation to treat obesity is based on this investigator's experience safely targeting peripheral nerves via CT guidance and treated with thermal ablation in daily clinical practice. the primary objective of this research is to evaluate the feasibility and safety (over time) of percutaneous image guided cryoablation of the posterior vagus nerve in obese patients. The secondary objective consist of temporal evaluation of weight loss and appetite before and after the procedure. This will be analyzed through documentation of weight, and through the implementation of validated outcome instruments.</detailed_description>
