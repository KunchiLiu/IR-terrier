	<brief_title>Single Dose Study to Assess the Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics(PK) of PF-06865571</brief_title>
	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Healthy males and female of nonchildbearing potential; Age of 1855, inclusive; Body Mass Index 22.5 to 35.4 kg/m2, inclusive; Body weight &gt;50 kg; Not on any prescription or nonprescription drugs within 7 days or 5 halflives prior to first dose. Evidence of history of clinically significant hematological, renal, endocrine, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, psychiatric, neurologic, or allergic disease (including drug allergises, but excluding untreated, asymptomatic, seasonal allergies at time of dosing) Any condition possibly affecting drug absorption (eg, gastrectomy). A positive urine drug test. History of regular alcohol consumption exceeding 7 drinks/week for female subjects or 14 drinks/week for male subjects (1 drink = 5 ounces [150 mL] of wine or 12 ounces [360 mL] of beer or 1.5 ounces [45 mL] of hard liquor) within 6 months before screening. Treatment with an investigational drug within 30 days (or as determined by the local requirement) or 5 half lives preceding the first dose of investigational product (whichever is longer). Fertile male subjects who are unwilling or unable to use a highly effective method of contraception as outlined in this protocol for the duration of the study and for at least 28 days after the last dose of investigational product. Blood donation (excluding plasma donations) of approximately 1 pint (500 mL) or more within 60 days prior to dosing. History of sensitivity to heparin or heparin induced thrombocytopenia. History of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B, or hepatitis C; positive testing for HIV, hepatitis B surface antigen (HepBsAg), hepatitis B core antibody (HepBcAb), or hepatitis C antibody (HCVAb). Fertile male subjects who are unwilling or unable to use a highly effective method of contraception as outlined in this protocol for the duration of the study and for at least 28 days after the last dose of investigational product. Subjects with ANY of the following abnormalities in clinical laboratory tests at screening, as assessed by the study specific laboratory and confirmed by a single repeat test, if deemed necessary: (1)Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level, or total bilirubin &gt; upper limit of normal (ULN); (2) For optional Cohort 3 only, AST or ALT greater or equal to 1.5 × ULN, provided that data from Cohorts 1 and 2 support this limit; (3) • Subjects with a history of Gilbert's syndrome may have direct bilirubin measured and would be eligible for this study provided the direct bilirubin level is less than or equal to ULN plus ALT and AST are less than or equal to ULN plus alkaline phosphatase, hemoglobin, and reticulocyte count are all less than or equal to ULN. Unwilling or unable to comply with the criteria in the Lifestyle Requirements section of this protocol. Subjects who are investigator site staff members directly involved in the conduct of the study and their family members, site staff members otherwise supervised by the investigator, or subjects who are Pfizer employees, including their family members, directly involved in the conduct of the study. Other acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition including recent (within the past year) or active suicidal ideation or behavior or laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the subject inappropriate for entry into this study.</criteria>
