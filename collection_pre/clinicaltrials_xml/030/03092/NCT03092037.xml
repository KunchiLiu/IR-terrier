	<brief_summary>The proposed study will investigate the relationship between genetic variants and serum contraceptive hormone levels, specifically the progestin etonogestrel. This study will provide the foundation for future pharmacogenomic investigations of more commonly used contraceptive methods with higher failure rates.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pharmacogenomics of Contraception: Genetic Variants and Etonogestrel Pharmacokinetics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 350 reproductive age women (18-45) with an Etonogestrel (ENG) contraceptive implant in place for more than 1 year will be enrolled. Participants will undergo a blood draw for measurement of ENG concentration (serum) and genotyping (whole blood) and complete a questionnaire regarding their demographics and contraceptive, gynecological, and obstetrical history. The research investigators will also consent participants for use of their genetic samples and clinical data in future unspecified research. The serum samples will be de-identified for ENG analysis, which will be done using a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry method. Additional whole blood samples collected at the enrollment visit will undergo DNA extraction -- the research investigators have selected 120 genetic variants for 10 target genes involved in progestin metabolism, regulation, and function.</detailed_description>
