	<brief_title>Probiotic Treatment in Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) is the most frequent rheumatic disorder in children. Numerous studies suggest that alteration of the intestinal barrier may induce abnormal immune responses implicated in development or persistence of arthritis. This paves the way to new therapeutic options aiming to reestablish intestinal homeostasis to treat arthritis or to prevent disease flares. This study investigates the efficacy of probiotic VSL#3 as an add on standard care on the activity of the disease in patients with Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis.</detailed_description>
