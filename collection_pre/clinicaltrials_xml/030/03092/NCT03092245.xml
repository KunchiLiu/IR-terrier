	<brief_title>Vasculopathic Injury and Plasma as Endothelial Rescue in Septic Shock (SHOCK) Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a single center, randomized (1:1, active : standard of care), controlled, open-label, investigator-initiated pilot phase IIa trial in patients with septic shock investigating the efficacy and safety of administrating OctaplasLG® as compared to crystalloids, such as Ringer-Acetate (standard of care) in a total of 40 patients. 40 patients will be enrolled: - Patients in the active treatment group (n = 20 patients) will receive OctaplasLG® as volume support according to trial algorithm. - Patients in the standard of care group (n = 20 patients) will receive crystalloids, such as Ringer-Acetate, as volume support according to trial algorithm. All patients will be treated according to the standard ICU care.</detailed_description>
