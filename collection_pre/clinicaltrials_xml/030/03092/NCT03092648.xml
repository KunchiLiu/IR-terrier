	<brief_summary>Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a kind of chronic bronchitis or emphysema with characteristics of long-term poor airflow, resulting in chronic pulmonary heart disease, chronic respiratory failure or even death. Anatomically, the pulmonary bronchus structures in COPD patients are damaged and cannot be repaired by recent clinical treatment so far. This study intends to carry out an open, single-armed, phase I/II clinical trial to investigate whether bronchial basal cells can regenerate damaged lung tissue. During the treatment, bronchial basal cells will be isolated from patients' own bronchi and expanded in vitro. After careful characterization, cultured cells will be transplanted autologously into the lesion by fiberoptic bronchoscopy. The safety and efficacy of the treatment will be monitored by measuring the key clinical indicators.</brief_summary>
