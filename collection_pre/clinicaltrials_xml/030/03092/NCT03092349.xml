	<brief_summary>The primary aim of the present study is to investigate whether the optimisation of LVSV in addition to the optimisation of AV-D and VV-D when using the device-based sensor technology mentioned above results in an improved clinical outcome of CRT. Moreover, noninvasive measurements are intended to evaluate hemodynamic differences between the different stimulation configurations using the Finapres® method.</brief_summary>
