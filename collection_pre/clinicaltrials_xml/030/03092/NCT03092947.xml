	<brief_summary>Although acute kidney injury (AKI) frequently complicates cardiac surgery, methods to determine AKI risk are lacking. Renal functional reserve (RFR), the capacity of the intact nephron mass to increase glomerular filtration rate (GFR), represents maximal filtration capacity. We hypothesized that preoperative RFR would predict postoperative AKI.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a frequent complication in patients undergoing cardiac surgery with an estimated prevalence of 36%. However, clinicians have limited tools to preoperatively identify patients at risk for AKI and/or progression to chronic kidney disease, particularly in patients with normal resting glomerular filtration rate (rGFR). Renal functional reserve (RFR) describes the capacity of the intact nephron mass to increase GFR from baseline in response to stimuli (e.g., protein load). We hypothesized that the presence or absence of RFR could separate patients at risk for developing AKI from patients with better-preserved renal function and a more favorable short- and long-term prognosis despite identical rGFR. The aim of this study is to examine whether preoperative assessment of RFR is able to predict risk for AKI after cardiac surgery.</detailed_description>
