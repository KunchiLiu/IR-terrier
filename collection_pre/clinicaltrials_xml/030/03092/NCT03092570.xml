	<brief_summary>This study will assess the putative advantages of cerebellar stimulation on motor learning abilities of stroke patients. In order to have a control group to refer to, the effect of cerebellar stimulation on healthy young and old participants will also be assessed.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cerebrovascular accidents (CVA) are the first cause of acquired disability in France. Despite rehabilitation interventions, a great proportion of patients suffers from motor disability in the upper limb. Recently, several studies have shown that post CVA patients exhibit great neural plasticity as a direct consequence of their condition. Interestingly, the transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive electro stimulation technique that allows for a modulation of cerebral activity. It has been shown that when applied to the cerebellum, tDCS increases learning performances of healthy subjects. Yet, motor rehabilitation after a CVA highly relies on motor (re)learning. The cerebellar tDCS thus appear as a promising method to enhance the performance of post-CVA motor learning and consequently the benefits of post-CVA rehabilitation. The current study aims to promote the post CVA neural plasticity by using the tDCS in order to enhance motor learning of the upper limb.</detailed_description>
