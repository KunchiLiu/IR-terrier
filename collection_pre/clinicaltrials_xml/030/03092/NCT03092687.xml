	<brief_summary>Objective: The mission of Human Brain Collection Core (HBCC) is to gain insight into the causes and mechanisms of mental disorders. Study Population: To be able to conduct this research, we obtain brain and other tissues from deceased individuals with and without psychiatric disorders. Study Design: This protocol provides the ethical and scientific framework for tissue donations through referrals from Offices of the Chief Medical Examiners, hospitals or funeral homes. The next of kin are contacted to give permission for brain donation from the deceased. Once the tissue is obtained, it is frozen, catalogued and processed for distribution to other researchers and for in-house analysis. The HBCC dissects specific brain tissues based on request. All collaborations are subject to approval by an oversight committee. Currently, HBCC can leverage over 1,000 brains from a variety of psychiatric disorders and non-psychiatric subjects. Outcome measures: Outcomes vary with specific collaborations, but include characterization of DNA, RNA, protein and other brain constituents that provide unique information at the molecular level. The data thus obtained are expected to provide new insights into brain physiology and the molecular pathology of psychiatric disorders, possibly leading to the identification of new therapeutic targets.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA: Brain tissue is needed from individuals suffering from a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, anxiety disorders, suicide, bipolar disorder, depression, and substance use disorders (cocaine, alcohol, heroin or the like). In addition, brains from individuals without a history of neuropsychiatric disease will be needed as controls. EXCLUSION CRITERIA: An assessment is carried out on the information available from the referral source (generally a Medical Examiner s Office) prior to obtaining consent. This information is usually very succinct, indicating how the decedent was found and, if known, whether they had some psychiatric or obvious medical history. The following cases will be excluded from collection: Severe mental retardation. Well documented, long lasting seizure disorder. Infections known to affect the brain such as syphilis, tuberculosis, with the exception of HIV infection. The body is decomposed. We consider collecting the brain up to three days after death. There is obvious damage to the brain by closed head injury or other trauma (gunshot wound, fall, etc.). There are brain infarcts, hemorrhages, tumors, stroke, or other brain lesions that destroy the normal brain structure. The patient has been maintained on a respirator (ventilator) for more than 12 hours. Major sepsis. Serious renal or hepatic disease. Multiple sclerosis (MS), Alzheimer s disease and other dementias and degenerative diseases.</criteria>
