	<brief_title>The Impact of Genotype on Pharmacokinetics and Antiplatelet Effects of Ticagrelor in Healthy Chinese</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label, single-does, nonrandomized study of ticagrelor in healthy volunteers carried out at a single center. Written informed consent will be obtained from all volunteers before initiation of the study. The study is approved by the Research Ethic Committee of Guangdong General Hospital. Fifty-one healthy Chinese will be recruited. Venous blood will be collected at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24 and 48h after taking 180mg ticagrelor orally. Urine collection intervals are at predose and 0 to 2, 2 to 4, 4 to 6, 6 to 9, 9 to 12, 12 to 16 and 16 to 24h after dosing. The concentration of ticagrelor and its metabolites will be analyzed using a separately validated liquid chromatography technique with tandem mass spectrometric detection (LC-MS/MS). Besidesï¼Œthe basic principle of population pharmacodynamics(PPD) is applied to evaluate antiplatelet effects. Adenosine diphosphate(ADP)-stimulated platelet aggregation will be assessed at baseline, and 0.5h/1h, 2h, 4h/8h/24h, 48h/3d/5d and 7d after dosing. The effects of genetic variants on antiplatelet and pharmacokinetic response to ticagrelor are investigated through a genome-wide association study (GWAS).</detailed_description>
