	<brief_summary>Athletes, especially in endurance sports, are at increased risk of oxidative stress and inflammation-related diseases and injuries. The production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) and inflammatory markers increase during exercise and especially during altitude training. Antioxidant supplementation is commonly used among athletes in the belief that it prevents oxidative stress and oxidative damage. A transient increase of RONS is however necessary to activate signaling cascades initiating training adaptation. Antioxidant supplementation has been shown to inhibit the exercise effects in several independent studies, possibly by interfering/reducing the signal cascades initiated by RONS. However, it is unknown whether a high intake of antioxidant rich foods can affect the amount of RONS, inflammation markers and/or training adaptation. The investigators want to examine whether an increased intake of natural antioxidants in the form of antioxidant-rich foods fruits, vegetables and berries, in line with the official Norwegian dietary advice can affect antioxidant status, immune function and training adaptation associated with altitude training in Norwegian elite athletes.</brief_summary>
