	<brief_summary>The pathology of Parkinson's disease (PD) and the mechanism of Deep Brain Stimulation surgery (DBS) are not completely understood. The recording data that is used routinely as part of the procedure to map the target structures, however, may be analyzed in order to better understand the neural network dynamics in PD. The purpose of the study is to perform simultaneous neural recordings from sub-cortical structures (e.g. subthalamic nucleus [STN] or globus pallidus internus [GPi]) and the cerebral cortex. These simultaneous recordings may provide insight in the pathology of PD and the mechanism of DBS. The researchers will also study the effects of anesthesia level on neuron synchronization . Recordings with micro-ECoG grid electrodes in the cortex show improved spatial resolution and these will be used to gain better understanding of cortical network dynamics and the synchronization with subcortical structures.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Subjects will be identified exclusively from the researchers' clinical practice for evaluation of DBS surgical candidacy for Parkinson's disease. Once it is determined that a patient is an appropriate candidate for DBS placement (multidisciplinary team consensus) and has met inclusion criteria,the researchers will discuss the study with the subject and explain the rationale for the study as well as the implications the subject's participation has to their treatment. Informed consent will be obtained prior to study procedures being performed. Subjects will be in the study from the time of enrollment before surgery until all post-operative visits and tests are completed, usually by 6 months after surgery. Follow-up during this time will consist of the standard follow-up schedule that all patients who undergo DBS follow. This includes a clinic visit at 10-14 days, 12 weeks, and 6 months after DBS surgery. Subjects will also have a follow-up neurocognitive evaluation consisting of the same evaluative tests administered pre-operatively. These post-operative visits are standard for all patients undergoing DBS for Parkinson's.</detailed_description>
