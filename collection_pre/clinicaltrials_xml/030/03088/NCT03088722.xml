	<brief_summary>This proposed study, to be run by Marie Stopes International Organisation Nigeria (MSION) will investigate whether Community Health Extension Workers (CHEWs) in Nigeria can insert and remove contraceptive implants to the same level of safety and quality as a nurse or midwife, and whether this is acceptable to their clients and colleagues. The study will also document feasibility issues which would be relevant to any future national programmatic scale-up.</brief_summary>
