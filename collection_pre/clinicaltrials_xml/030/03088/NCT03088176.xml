	<brief_title>Combining Talimogene Laherparepvec With BRAF and MEK Inhibitors in BRAF Mutated Advanced Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>While targeted therapies can successfully block oncogenic signaling in BRAF mutant melanoma, activation of an immune response with agents such as talimogene laherparepvec can induce durable responses in a subset of patients. Combining BRAF inhibitors and immunotherapy may specifically target the BRAF driver mutation in the tumor cells and potentially sensitize the immune system to target tumors. The study will enroll up to 20 patients with advanced melanoma and activating mutations in the BRAF gene for the local administration of talimogene laherparepvec in conjunction with oral therapy with dabrafenib and trametinib, to describe the safety and tolerability of this combination. Talimogene laherparepvec will be administered by intralesional injection into injectable cutaneous, subcutaneous, or nodal lesions with or without image ultrasound guidance. Talimogene laherparepvec will not be administered into any visceral organ or mucosal membrane lesions. The initial dose of talimogene laherparepvec is up to 4.0 mL of 106 plaque forming units (PFU)/mL. Subsequent doses of talimogene laherparepvec are up to 4.0 mL of 108 PFU/mL. The second dose of talimogene laherparepvec (the first dose of the 108 PFU formulation), will be administered at least 21 days following the initial dose. Subsequent doses will be given approximately every 2 weeks. Dabrafenib at a dose of 150mg will be self-administered orally twice per day. Trametinib at a dose 2mg will be self-administered orally once per day. Subjects will be evaluated by physical exam at the beginning of Cycle 1 (Week 1), Cycle 2 (Week 4), Cycle 3 (Week 6), Cycle 4 (Week 8), and every two cycles thereafter. Subjects will be evaluated for dose-limiting toxicities (defined in protocol) at Cycle 2 (Week 4), Cycle 3 (Week 6), and Cycle 4 (Week 8). Efficacy evaluation will be performed by tumor measurements using clinical assessment, CT or PET/CT every 4 cycles with the first non-baseline measurement prior to Cycle 4. Tumor response will be evaluated using RECIST 1.1. Adverse events will be recorded and graded using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 4.0 (CTCAE v4.0). Other safety assessments will include clinical laboratory values and physical exam findings. Reporting of adverse events, serious adverse events, and documentation of concomitant medications will occur as needed and at every cycle. Biopsy of a melanoma lesion (preferably uninjected) should occur at least one day prior to Cycle 4 (Week 8). Blood for biomarker analysis will be obtained immediately prior to the on-treatment biopsy, or if the on-treatment biopsy cannot be performed, immediately prior to Cycle 4 (Week 8).</detailed_description>

Measurable disease defined as follows: At least one melanoma lesion that can be accurately and serially measured in one dimension and for which the longest diameter is ≥10 mm as measured by calipers, CT scan, or MRI. a. If all lesions are lymph nodes, at least one node must be able to be accurately and serially measured in two dimensions, and the shortaxis must be ≥15mm. 5. Injectable disease (defined as at least 1cm of disease in areas suitable for injection including cutaneous, subcutaneous, or nodal lesions) 1. Prior therapy with talimogene laherparepvec 2.

Primary immunodeficiency state such as Severe Combined Immunodeficiency Disease 2. Concurrent opportunistic infection 3. Receiving chronic systemic immunosuppressive therapy (&gt; 2 weeks), including oral steroid doses &gt; 10mg/day of prednisone or equivalent except for management of adverse events and CNS metastases during the course of the study. Subjects requiring intermittent use of bronchodilators or local steroid injections are not excluded. 4. Active herpes infection, herpes requiring chronic antiherpetic therapy, or complications of prior herpetic infection (such as keratitis or encephalitis) 5.
