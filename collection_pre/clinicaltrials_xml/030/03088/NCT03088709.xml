	<brief_summary>Historically, the best results of allogeneic SCT have been obtained when the stem cell donor is a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched sibling, however, this is only available for approximately 30 percent of patients in need for SCT. Alternative donor sources include matched unrelated donor utilizing the donor registry, cord blood transplant and mismatched donor transplant. A human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-haploidentical donor is one who shares, by common inheritance, exactly one HLA haplotype with the recipient, and includes the biologic parents, biologic children and full or half siblings. There is strong body of evidence supporting the use of haplo-SCT in patient who lack a matched sibling or unrelated donor with high rates of successful engraftment, effective Graft Versus Host Disease (GVHD) control and favorable outcomes comparative to those seen using other allograft sources, including HLA-matched sibling SCT. Furthermore, it provides a cost-efficient donor option in a timely manner especially for patients who need to proceed quickly to transplant due to concern of disease relapse/progression.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Haploidentical Stem Cell Transplantation Using Post-Transplant Cyclophosphamide</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An open label, single-arm, single-center study to evaluate the safety, efficacy and feasibility of haplo-SCT as an alternative donor source for patients who lack a matched sibling/unrelated donor options. The choice of the chemotherapy treatment for transplantation will be up to the investigator. Post-transplant cyclophosphamide will serve as the backbone of the immunosuppression treatment to prevent GVHD. GVHD Prevention Treatment: Cyclophosphamide will be administered IV on Day 3 and Day 7 post transplant. Tacrolimus will be administered IV until patient can take it by mouth starting on day of transplant and continue approximately 100 days post-transplant. Mycophenolate mofetil will be administered IV until patient can take it by mouth starting on Day 1 post transplant until 28 days.</detailed_description>
