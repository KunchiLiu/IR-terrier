	<brief_summary>The EVAL'ID study aims to demonstrate the value of a multidimensional assessment in accompanying schooling of children with Intellectual Disability. The study will be performed in the Rhône department (France) in children aged from 5 to 13 years with mild to moderate Intellectual Disability , and attending school either at ULIS (Unités Localisées pour l'Inclusion Scolaire, which enables disabled children to attend regular schools), or IME (Instituts Médico-Educatifs, which are special schools mandated to accommodate children and young people with Intellectual Disability at any level of disability). A multidimensional assessment encompasses the assessment of academic, cognitive, behavioral and adaptive skills of the children, with validated and reliable neuropsychological batteries, called ID Kit (Intellectual Deficiency assessment Kit), which includes the following scales : the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children 4th edition (WISC-IV), the Vineland Adaptive Behavioral Scale II, the GECEN rating form (Grille d'Evaluation Comportementale pour Enfants Nisonger, which is the French translation of the Nisonger Child Behavior Rating Form), and an academic skills rating form (GEVA-SCO). A comparison of the children neuropsychological profiles according to the type of school they attend, will be perform. The project consists of three phases: - Stage 1: Collection of information from each child records at MDPH (Departmental Administration for Disabled Persons), IME, ULIS schools, including the assessments that were performed, and from a survey of both caregivers and parents regarding their respective perception and knowledge of the child's disability - Stage 2: All the children who were not previously assessed with the ID kit will be further evaluated using these tests. The results of these assessments will be shared with parents and caregivers. - Stage 3: A survey regarding the perception and knowledge of the child's disability will be carried out again among caregivers and parents.</brief_summary>
