	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Infliximab versus Cyclophosphamide in Subjects with Idiopathic Refractory Scleritis. The term scleritis describes a chronic inflammation that involves the outermost cost and skeleton of the eye. Scleritis is classified anatomically as either anterior or posterior based on the principal location of the inflammation. Thirty to forty percent of scleritis cases are associated with systemic autoimmune conditions including rheumatoid arthritis and granulomatosis with polyangiitis. Infectious causes including herpes virus and varicella zoster account for 5 to 10% of patients. The remaining 50% of cases are classified as idiopathic. CIRIS, is the first prospective randomized, head to head study, comparing infliximab to cyclophosphamide in refractory idiopathic scleritis. There is no firm evidence or randomized controlled trials directly addressing the best biologic agent in severe and refractory idiopathic scleritis. If left untreated or insufficiently treated, scleritis can progress to peripheral ulcerative keratitis, uveitis and glaucoma. Visual loss occurs in approximately 10% of patients with anterior scleritis and in up to 75% of patients with posterior scleritis. The incidence of burden in ocular inflammation (uveitis and scleritis) has been dramatically reduced in the recent years with the use of biologics, raising the question of whether these compounds should be used earlier in the treatment of severe non infectious scleritis. Contrasting with other immunosuppressors, cyclophosphamide and infliximab act rapidly and are highly effective in steroid's sparing. Despite a strong rationale, these compounds are not yet approved in idiopathic refractory scleritis, which guarantees the innovative nature of this study that aims selecting or dropping any arm when evidence of efficacy already exists.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Provide written, informed consent prior to the performance of any study specific procedures 2. Male or female, age ≥ 18 at Screening 3. Weight 40 120 kg (88.2 264 lbs) at Screening 4. Diagnosis of idiopathic scleritis in at least one eye. Scleritis is classified anatomically as either anterior or posterior based on the principal location of the inflammation. Clinically anterior scleritis can be divided into diffuse, nodular or necrotizing types and posterior scleritis into diffuse or nodular types (Watson and hayreh, 1976)). 5. Active disease: Currently uncontrolled scleritis disease. Uncontrolled scleritis disease is defined as (at least) a 2 in scleral inflammation, according to the grading system defined Senesclera inflammation 0 to 4 gradations (Sen et al, 2011): these findings will be documented by drawings, photography or both for a central review. 6. Refractory disease: At screening, subjects must be receiving oral corticosteroids (&gt;10 mg/day prednisone equivalent and &lt;80mg/day) and at least one other immunosuppressive (azathioprine, methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetyl, cyclosporine, leflunomide) ; or being intolerant to such immunosuppressive therapies. 7. Topical corticosteroids and/or NSAIDs are permitted provided the dose regimen has been stable for 2 weeks prior to Screening and remain stable throughout the study. Topical treatment for cycloplegia is permitted. 8. Chest Xray results (posteroanterior and lateral) within 12 weeks prior to randomization visit with no evidence of active Tuberculosis, active infection, or malignancy 9. For female subjects of childbearing age, a negative serum pregnancy test 10. For subjects with reproductive potential, a willingness to use contraceptive measures adequate to prevent the subject or the subject's partner from becoming pregnant during the study. Adequate contraceptive measures include hormonal methods used for two or more cycles prior to Screening (e.g., oral contraceptive pills, contraceptive patch, or contraceptive vaginal ring), barrier methods (e.g., contraceptive sponge, diaphragm used in conjunction with contraceptive foam or jelly, or condom used in conjunction with contraceptive foam or jelly), intrauterine methods (IUD), sterilization (e.g., tubal ligation or a monogamous relationship with a vasectomized partner), and abstinence. 11. A negative QuantiFERON®Tuberculosis (TB) test result or in the event that their QuantiFERON®TB test result at screening is positive all subjects must agree to complete an INH treatment course of at least 6 months 12. Affiliated to National French social security system 1. Infectious scleritis, or scleritis related to systemic diseases (i.e granulomatosis with polyangiitis, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, relapsing chondritis….) 2. Monocular patient 3. Active tuberculosis or history of untreated tuberculosis 4. Known positive syphilis serology, HIV antibody, hepatitis B surface antigen or antinucleocapsid antibody of hepatitis B virus, and/or hepatitis C antibody. 5. History of malignancy within 5 years prior to Screening other than carcinoma in situ of the cervix or adequately treated, nonmetastatic squamous or basal cell carcinoma of the skin. 6. History of severe allergic or anaphylactic reactions to monoclonal antibodies 7. Infectious disease: 1. Fever or infection requiring treatment with antibiotics within 3 weeks prior to Screening or between Screening and Day 0 2. History of recurrent infection or predisposition to infection 8. Known immunodeficiency 9. History of multiple sclerosis and/or demyelinating disorder 10. Laboratory values assessed during Screening: 1. Hemoglobin &lt; 8.5 g/dL 2. WBC &lt; 3.0 x 103/mm3 3. Platelet count &lt; 100 x 103/mm3 4. Glomerular filtration rates (GFR) &lt;30ml/min. 5. AST/ALT &gt; 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) 6. Absolute Neutrophil Count &lt; 2.0 x 103/mm3 7. Absolute Lymphocyte Count &lt; 0.5 x 103/mm3 11. Use of the following systemic treatments during the specified periods: 1. Any other previous systemic biologic therapy, including antiTNF 2. Treatment with any systemic alkylating agents within 12 months prior to Screening or between Screening and Day 0 (e.g., cyclophosphamide, chlorambucil) 3. Any live (attenuated) vaccine within 3 months prior to Screening or between Screening and Day 0; recombinant or killed virus vaccines are permitted. Live seasonal flu and H1N1 vaccines are permitted ≥ 2 weeks prior to Screening. 12. Inability to understand information about the protocol 13. pregnant or lactating women 14. patient under guardianship</criteria>
