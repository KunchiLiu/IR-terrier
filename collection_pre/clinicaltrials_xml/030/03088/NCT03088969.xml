	<brief_summary>The back pain connected to the work stay a major problem in industrialized countries, in particular because of the repercussions of this affection on the work (sick leave, absenteeism, handicap and inaptitude). It is difficult to consider among all the patients with a Chronic Low Back Pain in the work: how much they are going to stop. However, Investigator can consider that approximately 20 % of the patients have a sick leave. Several studies showed well that more the sick leave work stoppage goes on more the risk of not resumption of work increases. Several risk factors were associated to the evolutionary forecast of the pathology and thus to the extension extra time of the sick leave: individual, environmental, psychosocial and organizational. The evaluation of the self-efficiency perceived of return in the work of the patients by a validated auto-questionnaire is thus an additional objective parameter determining the risk factors of unfavorable evolution of the patients with Low Back Pain. This parameter also allows highlight other levers of actions in the therapeutic education.</brief_summary>
