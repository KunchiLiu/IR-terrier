	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the early longitudinal metabolic effects including insulin sensitivity in HIV-exposed uninfected (HEU) children compared to HIV-unexposed uninfected (HUU) children; as well as to determine differences in the effects of neonatal zidovudine (AZT) vs. nevirapine (NVP) prophylaxis on early longitudinal changes in insulin sensitivity in the first 3 years of life.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of HIV-Infected and Uninfected Pregnant Woman/Child Dyads in Gabarone, Botawana</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will consist of a nested randomized component of HIV-infected (HIV+) and -uninfected (HIV-) pregnant woman/child dyads in Botswana which will take place in Gaborone, Botswana at Botswana-Harvard AIDS Institute Partnership's (BHPs) clinical research facilities. A total of 300 HIV+ pregnant woman/fetus dyads on cART and 150 HIV- pregnant woman/fetus dyads will be evaluated for insulin sensitivity and followed through the child's 3rd birthday. Amongst HEU infants, participants will be randomized at birth 1:1 with 150 to receive neonatal AZT prophylaxis and 150 to receive neonatal NVP prophylaxis. Targeted metabolomics will be used to assess the role intermediary metabolites in insulin resistance and directly assess mitochondrial function using Seahorse XF96e technology. At the time of study enrollment, all women must be willing to exclusively breastfeed for the infant's first 6 months of life. If in utero and neonatal HIV/ARV exposures are found to be associated with derangements in intermediary metabolism such that HEU infants are at increased risk for insulin resistance by 3 years of age, this would impact screening and prevention strategies for diabetes in this vulnerable population and argue for further research to identify prenatal and neonatal ARV regimens with superior PMTCT efficacy but minimal adverse metabolic consequences.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>HIVinfected and uninfected pregnant women between 1636 weeks GA are eligible for study enrollment. Women must be 18 years of older and able to provide informed consent for themselves and their infant to participate in the study Participants must be Botswana citizens Women must have evidence of HIVinfected status, either documentation of an HIVpositive test or documentation of HIV treatment, or being will to undergo a HIV testing counseling and rapid diagnostic test to confirm their HIV status at time of enrollment if no documentation of HIVpositive status can be provided. HIVuninfected women must be willing to undergo HIV pretest counseling, rapid HIV testing and posttest counseling, referred to as HIV Testing and Counseling (HTC) during pregnancy. Women must be willing to remain in study area with their infant and attend scheduled study visits as described above until the child's 3rd birthday For HIVinfected women, they must be on TDF/3TC or FTC/EFV or TDF/3TC or FTC/Dolutegravir at time of study enrollment or willing to initiate this treatment and continue throughout the period of breastfeeding, if not for their lifetime. All women must be willing to breastfeed exclusively for the first six months of life. All enrolled infants must be a product of a singleton birth. If mothers enrolled in the study antenatally deliver twins or triplets, the mother will be placed off study and will not count toward the accrual goal. Preexisting maternal diabetes mellitus HIV+ pregnant woman with &lt;4 weeks of cART prior to delivery or HIV RNA level &gt;400 copies/mL at delivery Infants cannot have any congenital anomalies or other life threatening illnesses at birth that would be likely to preclude their survival to 12 months of age.
