	<brief_summary>This is an open-label phase 3 comparative study to assess the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of irinotecan liposome injection compared to topotecan (IV) in patients with small cell lung cancer who have progressed on or after platinum-based first-line therapy. The study will be conducted in two parts: 1a. dose determination of irinotecan liposome injection 1b. preliminary safety and efficacy 2. a randomized, efficacy study of irinotecan liposome injection versus topotecan</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Irinotecan Liposome Injection (ONIVYDE®) in Patients With Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will be conducted in two parts: Part 1 (1a and 1b): Part 1a: Open-label dose finding study of irinotecan liposome injection . Approximately 12 patients will be enrolled Part 1a Objectives: - Describe the safety and tolerability of irinotecan liposome injection monotherapy administered every 2 weeks - Determine the irinotecan liposome injection monotherapy dose for Part 1b and Part 2 of this study Part 1b: Open-label parallel study of irinotecan liposome injection and IV topotecan. Approximately 50 patients will be enrolled Part 1b Objectives: Describe the following for the treatment arms (irinotecan liposome injection and IV topotecan): - Progression free survival rate at 12 weeks - Objective response rate (ORR) - Progression free survival (PFS) - Overall survival (OS) - Safety profile Part 2: A randomized, efficacy study of irinotecan liposome injection versus IV topotecan. Approximately 420 patients will be enrolled in part 2. Part 2 objectives: Detailed below in the Primary &amp; Secondary objective sections.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>General 1. At least 18 years of age. 2. Able to understand and provide an informed consent 3. Consented to participate in the translational research component of the trial (provide blood and archival tumor tissue (if available), as specified in section 9.6), unless prohibited by local regulations. 4. Completed the EORTCQLQC30, EORTCQLQLC13, and the EuroQoL five dimension, five level health status questionnaire (EQ5D5L). 5. ECOG performance status of 0 or 1. Disease Specific 6. Histopathologically or cytologically confirmed small cell lung cancer according to the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) histopathological classification. Mixed or combined subtypes according to the IASLC are not allowed. 7. Evaluable disease as defined by RECIST v1.1 guidelines (patients with nontarget lesions only are eligible). 8. Progression on or after firstline platinum based chemotherapy (carboplatin or cisplatin) or chemoradiation including platinumbased chemotherapy for treatment of limited or extensive stage SCLC. 9. Recovered from the effects of any prior chemotherapy, surgery, radiotherapy or other antineoplastic therapy (recovered to grade 1 or better, with the exception of alopecia).Hematologic, Biochemical and Organ Function Inclusion Criteria 10. Adequate bone marrow reserves as evidenced by: i. ANC &gt; 1,500 cells/μL (1.5 x 10⁹/L) without the use of hematopoietic growth factors; and ii. Platelet count &gt; 100,000 cells/μL (100 x 10⁹/L); and iii. Hemoglobin &gt; 9 g/dL; transfusions are allowed 11. Adequate hepatic function as evidenced by: i. Serum total bilirubin within normal range for the institution ii. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤ 2.5 x ULN (≤ 5 x ULN is acceptable if liver metastases are present) iii. Serum albumin ≥3.0 g/dL (≥30 g/L) 12. Adequate renal function as evidenced by a serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN and creatinine clearance ≥40 mL/min. Actual body weight should be used for calculating creatinine clearance using the CockcroftGault Equation (except for patients with body mass index (BMI)&gt;30 kg/m² when lean body weight should be used instead 13. ECG without any clinically significant findings Patients must meet all the inclusion criteria listed above and none of the following exclusion criteria: General 1. Any medical or social condition deemed by the Investigator to be likely to interfere with a patient's ability to sign informed consent, cooperate and participate in the study, or interfere with the interpretation of the results 2. Pregnant or breast feeding; females of childbearing potential must test negative for pregnancy at the time of enrollment based on a urine or serum pregnancy test. Both male and female patients of reproductive potential must agree to use a highly effective method of birth control, during the study and for 4 months following the last dose of study drug. Disease Specific 3. Prior treatment regimens with irinotecan, topotecan or any other topoisomerase I inhibitor including investigational topoisomerase I inhibitors. 4. Patients with large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma. 5. Patients who have had more than one regimen of prior cytotoxic chemotherapy 6. More than one line of immunotherapy (e.g. nivolumab, pembrolizumab, ipilimumab,atezolizumab, tremelimumab and/or durvalumab). One line of immunotherapy is defined as the following: monotherapy or combination of immunotherapy agents given as either (i) in combination with chemotherapy followed by immunotherapy maintenance in the first line setting, (ii) only as a maintenance following response to firstline chemotherapy or (iii) immunotherapy given as second line treatment following progression. 7. Patients with a history of immunotherapy induced colitis. 8. Any prior systemic treatment other than 1 line of platinumcontaining regimen or immunotherapy as described above. 9. Patients with the following CNS metastasis: i. Patients who have developed new or progressive brain metastasis following prophylactic and/or therapeutic cranial radiation (whole brain stereotactic radiation). ii. Patients with symptomatic CNS metastasis (a patient with brain metastasis who received cranial radiotherapy is eligible if asymptomatic for neurological symptoms for ≥2 weeks after cranial radiotherapy and is off corticosteroids for treatment of CNS metastasis. Patients with asymptomatic brain metastases are eligible to be enrolled directly to the study). iii. Patients with carcinomatous meningitis. 10. Unable to discontinue the use of strong CYP3A4 or UGTA1A1 inhibitors at least 1 week or strong CYP3A4 inducers at least 2 weeks prior to receiving the first dose of irinotecan liposome injection. 11. Presence of another active malignancy. 12. Investigational therapy administered within 4 weeks, or within a time interval less than at least 5 halflives of the investigational agent, whichever is less, prior to the first scheduled day of dosing in this study. Hematologic, Biochemical and Organ Function Exclusion Criteria 13. Severe arterial thromboembolic events (e.g. myocardial infarction, unstable angina pectoris, stroke) less than 6 months before inclusion. 14. NYHA Class III or IV congestive heart failure, ventricular arrhythmias, or uncontrolled blood pressure. 15. Active infection (e.g. acute bacterial infection, tuberculosis, active hepatitis B or active HIV) which in the investigator's opinion might compromise the patient's participation in the trial or affect the study outcome. 16. Known hypersensitivity to any of the components of irinotecan liposome injection, other liposomal products, or topotecan. 17.
