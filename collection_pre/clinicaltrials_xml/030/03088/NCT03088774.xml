	<brief_title>Comparing Satisfaction With a Participatory Driven Web-application and a Standard Website</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The point-prevalence of low back pain (LBP) has been estimated to 9.4 % and LBP is in many countries the most frequent reason to consult a general practitioner. However, general practitioners are under pressure with increasing workloads. The increasing number of patients and the typical 10-15 minutes of available time for each patient are challenging the provision of sufficient information and advice. According to international guidelines information and advice are recommended for every patient with LBP, therefore, new methods to support general practitioners (GPs) are very much needed. Online technologies give new opportunities to extend the treatment. Furthermore, involving patients with LBP in the development of online information material may produce more user friendly content and design and thereby increasing patients' acceptance and usage. Thus, optimizing clinical outcome. This project will study patients' satisfaction and clinical outcomes of a web-application for patients with LBP consulted in general practice compared to best existing technology (the Patient Handbook).</detailed_description>
