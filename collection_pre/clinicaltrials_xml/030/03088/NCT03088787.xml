	<brief_summary>The primary purpose of this study is electronic data collection of arterial pressure waveform signals in patients with Aortic Stenosis. The collected digital pressure waveform data will be used to assess the feasibility of using the arterial pressure signal as a decision support tool for early detection of aortic stenosis conditions. Furthermore we evaluate hemodynamic parameters before and after valve repair and its correlation with outcome.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>o Patients with severe senile degenerative aortic valve stenosis Clinical team agrees on eligibility including assessment that TAVR is appropriate for the subject Patients undergoing TAVR via the femoral approach Patients who normally require a guiding catheter for central aortic pressure monitoring during the TAVR procedure Patient must be 18 years old or older Patient, or legally authorized representative, has given consent to be in the study Patient height and weight are available prior to study Ability to perform a Nexfin measurement at the left hand side. o Patients with contraindications for placement of aortic catheter Patients with mixed aortic valve disease (aortic stenosis and aortic regurgitation with predominant aortic regurgitation &gt;3+). Aortic valve is a congenital unicuspid or congenital bicuspid valve, or is noncalcified Patients being treated with an intraaortic balloon pump Patients less than 40 kg in weight Female patients of childbearing potential with a known pregnancy Patient is currently participating in an investigational drug or another device study that clinically interferes with the study endpoints</criteria>
