	<brief_summary>This is Phase 1b/2 study to investigate the safety and effectiveness of the investigational drug, cirmtuzumab, when given in combination with ibrutinib in patients with B-cell lymphoid malignancies. Cirmtuzumab is a monoclonal antibody that attaches to a protein (called ROR 1) that is found on hematologic tumor cells. ROR1 has been shown to play a role in cell signaling that cause leukemia cells to grow and survive. ROR1 is rarely found on healthy cells.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of the Cirmtuzumab and Ibrutinib in Patients With B-Cell Lymphoid Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase 1b/2 study to investigate the safety and effectiveness of the investigational drug, cirmtuzumab, when given in combination with ibrutinib in patients with B-cell lymphoid malignancies. The Phase 1b will be conducted in two parts (Part 1 and Part 2). Part 1 is a dose-finding evaluation of the sequential administration of cirmtuzumab monotherapy followed by cirmtuzumab and ibrutinib combination therapy in previously treated chronic lymphocytic leukemia /small lymphocytic leukemia (CLL/SLL) or mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) subjects who have not received prior Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor therapy. Up to 48 subjects will be enrolled in Part 1 to determine the recommended dosing regimen (RDR). In Part 2, up to 18 subjects will be enrolled to further evaluate the safety and pharmacology of the cirmtuzumab and ibrutinib combination given at the RDR determined in Part 1 of the study. In the Phase 2 (Part 3) portion of the study, approximately 90 subjects with MCL will be randomized to either Arm 1 (cirmtuzumab and ibrutinib) at the RDR or Arm 2 (ibrutinib alone) to evaluate the clinical activity and safety of the two arms.</detailed_description>

Current medical need for therapy due to diseaserelated symptoms, lymphadenopathy, organomegaly, extranodal organ involvement, or progressive disease. Completion of all previous therapy (including surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or investigational therapy) for the treatment of cancer 1 week before the start of study therapy. All acute toxic effects of any prior antitumor therapy resolved to Grade 1 before the start of study therapy (with the exception of alopecia [Grade 1 or 2 permitted], or neurotoxicity [Grade 1 or 2 permitted], or selected laboratory parameters [Grade 1 or Grade 2 permitted with exceptions as noted below]). Adequate bone marrow function: a) Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1.0 × 109/L (Grade ≤2). b) Platelet count ≥50 × 109/L (Grade ≤2). b) Hemoglobin ≥8.0 g/dL (Grade ≤2) maintained for ≥1 week from any prior transfusion. Note: Grade ≥3 neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, or anemia is permitted if the abnormality is related to bone marrow involvement with hematological malignancy (as documented by bone marrow biopsy/aspirate obtained since the last prior therapy). Adequate hepatic profile: 1. Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤3 × upper limit of normal (ULN) (Grade ≤1). 2. Serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤3 × ULN (Grade ≤1). 3. Serum bilirubin ≤1.5 × ULN (Grade ≤ 1). Adequate renal function: a) Estimated creatinine clearance (eClCR) &gt;45 mL/minute (with eClCR to be calculated by the CockcroftGault formula), or b) Measured creatinine clearance &gt;45 mL/minute (as assessed with a 24hour urine collection). 2. Adequate coagulation profile: 1. Prothrombin time (PT) ≤1.5 × ULN (Grade ≤1). 2. Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) ≤1.5 × ULN (Grade ≤1). Negative viral serology: 1. Negative human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody. 2. Negative hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and negative hepatitis B core (HBc) antibody or undetectable hepatitis B (HBV) deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing. 3. Negative hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody or negative HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA) by quantitative PCR. For female subjects of childbearing potential, a negative urine or serum pregnancy test prior to the start of study therapy. For female subjects of childbearing potential, willingness to use a protocolrecommended method of contraception from the start of the screening period until ≥30 days after the final dose of study therapy. Note: A female subject is considered to be of childbearing potential unless she has had a hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral oophorectomy; has medically documented ovarian failure (with serum estradiol and folliclestimulating hormone [FSH] levels within the institutional laboratory postmenopausal range and a negative serum or urine beta human chorionic gonadotropin [βHCG]); or is menopausal (age ≥50 years with amenorrhea for ≥6 months). For male subjects who can father a child and are having intercourse with females of childbearing potential who are not using adequate contraception: willingness to use a protocolrecommended method of contraception from the start of study therapy until ≥30 days after the final dose of study therapy and to refrain from sperm donation from the start of study therapy until ≥90 days after administration of the final dose of study therapy. Note: A male subject is considered able to father a child unless he has had a bilateral vasectomy with documented aspermia or a bilateral orchiectomy. In the judgment of the investigator, participation in the protocol offers an acceptable benefittorisk ratio when considering current disease status, medical condition, and the potential benefits and risks of alternative treatments for the subject's cancer. Willingness and ability of the subject to comply with scheduled visits, drug administration plan, protocolspecified laboratory tests, other study procedures (including all bone marrow biopsy/aspirations and radiographic studies), and study restrictions.
