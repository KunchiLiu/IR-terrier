	<brief_summary>Objective: To coordinate active tracing of chronic hepatitis C patients lost to follow-up to inform them about there disease severity and treatment options. Study design: This is a prospective cohort study, which will start as a pilot study in the Radboudumc Population: lost to follow-up chronic hepatitis C patients in the region Nijmegen. This so-called lost population consists of all patients, that in the past have been identified at the Radboudumc but who are currently lost to or have been withdrawn from follow-up. The time-span of interest will be 2000-2015. We estimate that this project will retrace 100 lost patients through this search.</brief_summary>
