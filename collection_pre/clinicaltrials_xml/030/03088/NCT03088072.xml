	<brief_summary>This is a single arm, open label, single site study assessing the feasibility of post-procedural edoxaban therapy in atrial fibrillation (AF) patients after clinically indicated WATCHMAN left atrial appendage (LAA) closure.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Study of Edoxaban in Patients With Non-Valvular Atrial Fibrillation and Left Atrial Appendage Closure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a single site, PI initiated pilot study. This study will enroll up to 75 patients who are clinically indicated for a Left Atrial Appendage (LAA) closure with the commercially available WATCHMAN device. Subjects will be enrolled if they meet study inclusion/exclusion criteria and have a successful LAA closure. All patients enrolled in the study will receive 6 weeks of edoxaban therapy. At 6 weeks post LAA closure a Transesophageal Echocardiography (TEE) will be performed. If the result is acceptable, edoxaban will be discontinued and the patient will be treated with dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin and clopidogrel) until 6 month follow-up. After study completion, patients may be treated with aspirin monotherapy according to the FDA instructions for use for the WATCHMAN device, or according to operator discretion.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The patient has documented paroxysmal, persistent, or permanent nonvalvular AF (i.e., the patient has not been diagnosed with rheumatic mitral valve disease). LAA closure with the WATCHMAN device is planned The patient fulfills the FDA indication for WATCHMAN LAA closure The patient or legal representative is able to understand and willing to provide written informed consent to participate in the trial The patient is able and willing to return for required followup visits and examinations. The patient is 18 years of age or older Conditions other than atrial fibrillation that require anticoagulation (e.g., a prosthetic heart valve) Stroke within the previous 7 days Hypersensitivity to edoxaban Moderate or severe mitral stenosis A need for aspirin at a dose of &gt;81 mg a day A need for ongoing treatment with dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel A need for ongoing treatment with ticagrelor or prasugrel No LAA closure device implanted during procedure Procedural complication of LAA closure (e.g., stroke, systemic embolism, bleeding, vascular complication [e.g., groin hematoma &gt;10cm, AV fistula, or pseudoaneurysm), or serious pericardial effusion) Planned surgery or invasive procedure within 6Â±2 weeks of enrollment</criteria>
