	<brief_summary>Vitamin D has become important for periodontal disease due to play a role in autoimmunity, bone mineral metabolism and inflammation. Our aim was to investigate the relation between serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels, clinical periodontal parameters and blood serum biomarkers. The subjects were evaluated in 2 groups as chronic periodontitis (n= 30) and periodontally healthy subjects (n= 30). Periodontal parameters and fasting venous blood samples were taken from the subjects to assess each patient's periodontal status and for biochemical analyses (25-hydroxy vitamin D (25-OH vit D), osteoprotegerin (OPG), receptor activator of nuclear kappa B ligand (RANKL), C-telopeptide (CTx), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)).</brief_summary>
