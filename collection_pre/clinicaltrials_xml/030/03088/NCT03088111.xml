	<brief_summary>This field study is a post-marketing requirement from the FDA to evaluate the clinical benefit (course of illness and survival), safety and pharmacokinetics of obiltoxaximab administered to patients as part of their medical care for treatment or prophylaxis of inhalational anthrax infection following exposure to Bacillus anthracis (B. anthracis). The protocol can be implemented for any individual who receives obiltoxaximab for a suspected, probable, or confirmed case of inhalational anthrax due to B. anthracis in the United States, including sporadic cases, small incidents and/or a mass event. In case of a small anthrax incident, to the extent possible, the information will be collected prospectively at prespecified time points, except where it would interfere with management of the subject's illness. However, because of the logistical complexities that would likely accompany a mass anthrax event, most data in this study are anticipated to be collected retrospectively. Both retrospective and prospective data collection are allowed to maximize information collection. This study will collect data on the use of obiltoxaximab in anthrax infected or exposed subjects and the data collected will inform the understanding of the clinical benefit and safety of obiltoxaximab.</brief_summary>
