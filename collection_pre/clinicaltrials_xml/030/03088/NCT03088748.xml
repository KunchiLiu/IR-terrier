	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to acquire kinematic in vivo fluoroscopy data using the University of Tennessee's tracking fluoroscopy system (TFS) from subjects who were implanted with the Smith &amp; Nephew Journey II posterior cruciate retaining (PCR) total knee arthroplasty (TKA) or Journey II bi-cruciate retaining (BCR) TKA. CMR has previously collected data for the Smith &amp; Nephew BCS TKA and compared these kinematics data to those of normal knees.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The objective for this study is to analyze the in vivo kinematics for subjects implanted with either a Journey II PCR or BCR TKA and compare those patterns to subjects having a normal knee from our previous study and to those patterns from subjects having a Smith &amp; Nephew Journey II BCS TKA.</detailed_description>
