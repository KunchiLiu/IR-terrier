	<brief_summary>This project aims to study the impacts of self-thoracic spine and rib mobilization on sleep quality in patients who present to UTSW physicians with shoulder pain. The investigators plan to randomize participants into treatment and control groups, but the investigators will provide education on sleep hygiene for each group. The treatment group will also receive instruction to mobilize their thoracic spine and ribs each night before going to sleep.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effectiveness of Self-thoracic Spine Mobilization on Improving Sleep Quality in Patients Who Have Shoulder Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects with a chief complaint of musculoskeletal pain will be recruited from clinics in the Departments of Internal Medicine, Family Medicine, and Orthopedic Surgery. Subjects will be randomized into either the intervention or control group. The intervention group will receive education on sleep hygiene and instruction to use a foam roller to mobilize the thoracic spine and ribs just before the subject goes to sleep. The control group will receive education on sleep hygiene. Valid and reliable measures will be used to assess sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index), pain (Numeric Pain Rating Scale), and function (SF-36 and ASES), as well as a sleep diary. Measures will be taken at baseline as well as two weeks after the subject's enrollment in the study.</detailed_description>
