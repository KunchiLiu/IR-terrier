	<brief_summary>This study aims to assess the phenotype of the enteric nervous system (enteric neurons) in healthy subjects. The enteric nervous system (ENS) is composed by enteric neurons and enteric glial cells. There is a cross-talk between ENS and the intestinal epithelial barrier (IEB). ENS and IEB together constitute the neuronal-glial-epithelial unit. This unit has a key role in gut functions. The characteristics and the phenotype of the ENS also change according to age and environmental factors. Similar study is ongoing for patients with Spina Bifida. Anorectal data and phenotype of the neuronal-glial-epithelial unit in healthy subjects is required to assess abnormality of these items in patients with neurological disease including Spina Bifida.</brief_summary>
