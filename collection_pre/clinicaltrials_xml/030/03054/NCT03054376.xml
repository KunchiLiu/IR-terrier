	<brief_summary>The study includes healthy young habitually active subjects. All subjects are subjected to two weeks of immobilization of one leg followed by four weeks of training of both legs. The subjects are randomized to either one-leg training of the non-immobilized leg during the two-week immobilization period or to no training of the non-immobilized leg during the immobilization period. Measures include skeletal muscle morphology, markers of angiogenesis and apoptosis, muscle metabolic markers, vascular function, vascular proteins and performance.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>One leg of young healthy subjects will be immoblized for two weeks. Changes in angiogenic proteins and markers of apoptosis in muscle tissue and muscle extracellular fluid will be determined in both legs and in parallel the functional consequences of immobilization will be assessed. Vascular function and vascular proteins will also be determined. In order to understand how the oxidative capacity of the muscle is altered in parallel with changes in capillarization, markers of mitochondria will be measured .Half of the subjects will be randomized to single-leg training during the immobilization period to assess whether simultaneous training reduces the loss of capillaries, muscle function and vascular function in the immobilized leg. After the immobilization period the study participants will train the immobilized leg and the control leg for four weeks by moderate to intense interval cycle training and the same parameteres as during immobilization will be assessed in both legs. The study will also include measurements of circulating compounds and platelets in blood.</detailed_description>
