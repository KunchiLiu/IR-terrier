	<brief_summary>Because of the limiting data about an efficacy and safety of fractional radiofrequency for the treatment of hyperhidrosis, this study aim to compare clinical efficacy by Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Score (HDSS) between Fractional Microneedle Radiofrequency device and intradermal Botulinum toxin type A injection for the treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis. The secondary objectives to determine the improvement change of iodine starch test, total amount of sweat production by trans-epidermal water loss (TEWL), patient's satisfaction and their quality of life by Dermatology Life Quality Index and side effect between the groups.</brief_summary>
