	<criteria>All participants will have PAD. PAD will be defined as follows. First, an ankle brachial index (ABI) &lt;0.90 at the baseline study visit is an inclusion criterion for PAD. Second, potential participants who have an ABI &gt; 0.90 but â‰¤ 1.00 and experience a 20% or higher drop in ABI after heelrise exercise will be eligible. Third, potential participants with an ABI &gt; 0.90 who have vascular lab evidence of PAD or angiographic evidence of PAD who have ischemic symptoms during the sixminute walk and/or treadmill exercise stress test will be eligible. Fourth, potential participants with a history of lower extremity revascularization who do not meet the criterion above and have an ABI &gt; 0.90 with a 20% or higher drop in ABI after heelrise exercise will be eligible. 1. Above or belowknee amputation. 2. Critical limb ischemia. 3. Wheelchairbound or requiring a walker to ambulate. 4. Walking is limited by a symptom other than PAD. 5. Current foot ulcer on bottom of foot. 6. Diabetes mellitus defined as one or more of a) patient report of physician diagnosed diabetes mellitus, b) use of one or more diabetes medications, c) baseline hemoglobinA1C value of &gt;6.5, d) two fasting glucose values &gt;126 mg/dl. [NOTE: the second fasting glucose value will be at the discretion of the principal investigator. For example, if the first value is &gt;300, then investigators may decide not to repeat the value.] 7. Chronic kidney disease defined as GFR &lt;45. [NOTE: if GFR is 4044, investigator discretion will be used to determine if a repeat test may be performed. If the second GFR value is &gt;45, the participant may be included.] 8. Chronic liver disease defined as two or more hepatic function tests &gt;2.0 times the upper limit of normal. [NOTE: participants who meet this criterion may undergo a retest of hepatic function tests to determine whether initially elevated hepatic enzymes represented a transient or spurious phenomenon.] 9. Failure to successfully complete the 2week study runin, defined as unable to tolerate metformin and/or failing to take the medication daily for 10 or more days in the twoweek period. 10. Planned lower extremity revascularization, orthopedic surgery, or other major surgery during the next six months. 11. Lower extremity revascularization, orthopedic surgery, cardiovascular event, coronary revascularization, or other major surgery in the previous three months. 12. Major medical illness including renal disease requiring dialysis, lung disease requiring oxygen, Parkinson's disease, a lifethreatening illness with life expectancy less than six months, or cancer requiring treatment in the previous two years. [NOTE: potential participants may still qualify if they have had treatment for an early stage cancer in the past two years and the prognosis is excellent. Participants who only use oxygen at night may still qualify.] 13. MiniMental Status Examination (MMSE) score &lt;23 or dementia. 14. Participation in or completion of a clinical trial in the previous three months. [NOTE: after completing a stem cell or gene therapy intervention, participants will become eligible after the final study followup visit of the stem cell or gene therapy study so long as at least six months have passed since the final intervention administration. After completing a supplement or drug therapy (other than stem cell or gene therapy), participants will be eligible after the final study followup visit as long as at least three months have passed since the final intervention of the trial.] 15. Currently taking metformin or has taken metformin in past six months. 16. Increase in angina or angina at rest 17. NonEnglish speaking. 18. Visual impairment that limits walking ability. 19. In addition to the above criteria, investigator discretion will be used to determine if the trial is unsafe or not a good fit for the potential participant. Vulnerable populations (fetuses, pregnant women, children, prisoners, and institutionalized persons) and adults unable to consent will not be included in the study.</criteria>
