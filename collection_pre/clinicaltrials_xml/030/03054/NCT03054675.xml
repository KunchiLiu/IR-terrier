	<brief_summary>Aim of this study was to prospectively investigate the correlation between postoperative spirometry values and pulmonary complications after anatomic lung resections. In addition, the investigators compared postoperative pulmonary function changes between open and minimally invasive approaches.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>All patients undergoing an anatomical lung resection at the investigators' institution were evaluated for this study. Underage patients and those undergoing extended resections (including resection of the chest wall and/or diaphragm) and/or bronchoplastic procedures were excluded. In every eligible patient undergoing an anatomic lung resection, preoperative spirometry was performed using a handheld spirometer on the day before surgery and on every second day after surgery was performed until patient discharge. The absolute values of FEV1 were recorded by an independent study nurse and noted on a separate sheet not available to the treating doctors. At the end of the study period FEV1 values were evaluated especially with focus on their correlation with postoperative pulmonary complications (i.e. pneumonia, acute exacerbation of COPD, air leak and atelectasis). Furthermore lung function values of patients undergoing 'open' resections were compared with patients undergoing minimally invasive resections.</detailed_description>
