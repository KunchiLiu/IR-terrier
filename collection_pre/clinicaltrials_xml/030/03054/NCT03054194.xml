	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Nonsmoking, male or female, age ≥18 years and ≤55 years old at the time of informed consent (note: to be considered nonsmokers, participants must have discontinued smoking for at least 4 weeks before dosing) Body mass index (BMI) ≥18 and &lt;32 kilograms per meters squared (kg/m^2) at Screening Clinically significant illness that requires medical treatment within 8 weeks or a clinically significant infection that requires medical treatment within 4 weeks of dosing Females who are breastfeeding or pregnant at Screening or Baseline (documented by a negative beta human chorionic gonadotropin [βhCG] (or human chorionic gonadotropin [hCG]) test with a minimum sensitivity of 25 International Units per Liter [IU/L] or equivalent units of βhCG [or hCG]). A negative urine pregnancy test is required before the administration of the first dose per cohort. Females of childbearing potential who: Had unprotected sexual intercourse within 30 days before study entry and do not agree to use a highly effective method of contraception (eg, total abstinence, an intrauterine device, a double barrier method [such as condom plus diaphragm with spermicide] or have a vasectomized partner with confirmed azoospermia but hormonal contraceptives are not permitted) throughout the entire study period and for 28 days after study drug discontinuation Are currently abstinent, and do not agree to use a double barrier method (as described above) or refrain from sexual activity during the study period or for 28 days after study drug discontinuation NOTE: All females will be considered to be of childbearing potential unless they are postmenopausal (amenorrheic for at least 12 consecutive months, in the appropriate age group, and without other known or suspected cause) or have been sterilized surgically (ie, bilateral tubal ligation, total hysterectomy, or bilateral oophorectomy, all with surgery at least 1 month before dosing). Males who have not had a successful vasectomy (confirmed azoospermia) or they and their female partners do not meet the criteria above (ie, not of childbearing potential or practicing highly effective contraception throughout the study period or for 28 days after study drug discontinuation). No sperm donation is allowed during the study period or for 3 months after study drug discontinuation. Evidence of disease that may influence the outcome of the study within 4 weeks before dosing (eg, psychiatric disorders and disorders of the gastrointestinal tract, liver, kidney, respiratory system, endocrine system, hematological system, neurological system, or cardiovascular system, or participants who have a congenital abnormality in metabolism) Any history of seizures, including those experienced in childhood Any history of gastrointestinal surgery that may affect pharmacokinetic profiles of E2730 (eg, hepatectomy, nephrectomy, digestive organ resection) at Screening Any clinically abnormal symptom or organ impairment found by medical history, physical examinations, vital signs, electrocardiogram (ECG) finding, or laboratory test results that require medical treatment at Screening or Baseline A prolonged QT/QT corrected (QTc) interval (QC interval corrected using Fridericia's formula [QTcF] &gt;450 milliseconds) demonstrated on ECG at Screening or Baseline (based on average of triplicate ECGs). A history of risk factors for torsade de pointes (eg, heart failure, hypokalemia, family history of long QT Syndrome) or the use of concomitant medications that prolonged the QT/QTc interval Left bundle branch block at Screening or Baseline Persistent systolic blood pressure (BP) &gt;130 or &lt;100 millimeters of mercury (mmHg) or diastolic BP &gt;85 or &lt;50 mmHg at Screening or Baseline Persistent heart rate less than 50 beats/min or more than 100 beats/min at Screening or Baseline History of myocardial infarction, ischemic heart disease, or cardiac failure at Screening History of clinically significant arrhythmia or uncontrolled arrhythmia Known history of clinically significant drug allergy at Screening or Baseline Known history of food allergies or presently experiencing significant seasonal or perennial allergy at Screening or Baseline Known to be human immunodeficiency virus positive at Screening Active viral hepatitis (A, B, or C) as demonstrated by positive serology at Screening History of drug or alcohol dependency or abuse within the 2 years before Screening, or those who have a positive drug test (including cannabinoids) or alcohol test at Screening or Baseline Intake of caffeinated beverages or food within 72 hours before dosing Intake of nutritional supplements, juice, and herbal preparations or other foods or beverages that may affect the various drugmetabolizing enzymes and transporters (eg, alcohol, grapefruit, grapefruit juice, grapefruitcontaining beverages, apple or orange juice, vegetables from the mustard green family [eg, kale, broccoli, watercress, collard greens, kohlrabi, Brussel's sprouts, mustard], and charbroiled meats) within 1 week before dosing Intake of herbal preparations containing St. John's Wort within 4 weeks before dosing Use of prescription drugs within 4 weeks before dosing Intake of overthecounter (OTC) medications within 2 weeks before dosing Currently enrolled in another clinical study or used any investigational drug or device within 30 days or 5 halflives, whichever is longer, preceding informed consent Receipt of blood products within 4 weeks, or donation of blood within 8 weeks, or donation of plasma within 1 week of dosing Engagement in strenuous exercise within 2 weeks before checkin (eg, marathon runners, weight lifters)</criteria>
