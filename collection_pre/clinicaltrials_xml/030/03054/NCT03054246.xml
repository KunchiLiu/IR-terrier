	<brief_summary>The study is aimed to investigate if chewing side preference (CSP) can be used as another indicator of hemispheric laterality in healthy adults. Healthy volunteers with no oral/dental problems with Angle I occlusion relationship and without any missing teeth will be included in the study. The CSP will be determined with the visual analog scale (VAS), which is the highly reliable method. Laterality test will be used to determine the preferred side for hands, feet, ears and eyes.</brief_summary>
