	<brief_summary>This research study is evaluating the combination of a study drug, venetoclax, and a standard chemotherapy regimen, EPOCH-R, as a possible treatment for Richter's Syndrome. The drugs involved in this study are: - Venetoclax - EPOCH-R: - Etoposide - Prednisone - Vincristine Sulfate (Oncovin) - Cyclophosphamide - Doxorubicin Hydrochloride (Hydroxydaunomycin) - Rituximab</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase II Study of Venetoclax in Combination With Dose-adjusted EPOCH-R for Patients With Richter's Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a specific disease. "Investigational" means that the drug is being studied. Tumor cells from patients with Richter's Syndrome are often resistant to chemotherapy. One reason for this may be that a protein called BCL-2 can prevent cancer cells from dying after being exposed to chemotherapy. Venetoclax is an oral drug that specifically targets BCL-2. It has already been shown to be highly effective at killing tumor cells from CLL patients whose cells are resistant to chemotherapy, leading to its FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) approval for these patients. A small number of patients with Richter's Syndrome have been treated with venetoclax as a single drug, and some of these patients had improvement of their cancer with this treatment. In this research study, the investigators are looking to see whether adding venetoclax to a standard chemotherapy regimen, R-EPOCH, will help this chemotherapy work better to more effectively kill tumor cells in patients with Richter's Syndrome. Venetoclax is not approved for Richter's Syndrome or for use in combination with chemotherapy, which is why its use in this trial is considered to be investigational.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Must have a confirmed diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma as per IWCLL 2008 criteria (Hallek et al, 2008) with biopsy proven transformation to diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), consistent with Richter's Syndrome. Age greater than or equal to 18 years. Because CLL and Richter's Syndrome are extremely rare in persons &lt;18 years of age, children are excluded from this study. ECOG performance status &lt;2 (see Appendix A) Patients must meet the following hematologic criteria at screening, unless they have significant bone marrow involvement of their malignancy confirmed on biopsy: Absolute neutrophil count ≥1000 cells/mm3 (0.5 x 109/L). Growth factor allowed to achieve Platelet count ≥40,000 cells/mm3 (40 x 109/L) independent of transfusion within 7 days of screening Subject must have adequate coagulation, renal, and hepatic function, per laboratory reference range at Screening as follows: Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and prothrombin time (PT) not to exceed 1.5 × ULN; Creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN or creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min using 24hour urine collection for creatinine clearance Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤ 3.0 × ULN; Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × ULN; Subjects with Gilbert's Syndrome or resolving autoimmune hemolytic anemia may have a bilirubin up to 3.0 × ULN and are still eligible The effects of venetoclax on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason, women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately Patients who have undergone prior allogeneic transplantation are eligible provided they do not have significant active graft versus host disease and that their transplant day 0 is &gt; 6 months from their first dose of chemotherapy Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document Patients with the Hodgkin variant transformation of CLL will be excluded History of severe allergic or anaphylactic reactions to monoclonal antibody therapy or to the chemotherapy drugs used in this study (see Appendix D), unless the antibody can be given through a desensitization program in consultation with an allergist Subject has received any of the following within 14 days or 5 drug halflives (whichever is shortest) prior to the first dose of chemotherapy, or has not recovered to less than Grade 2 clinically significant adverse effect(s)/toxicity(s) of the previous therapy: Any anticancer therapy including chemotherapy, biologic agents for antineoplastic treatment (e.g. monoclonal antibodies) or radiotherapy, investigational therapy, including targeted small molecule agents. History of other malignancies, except: Malignancy treated with curative intent and with no known active disease present before the first dose of study drug and felt to be at low risk for recurrence by treating physician. Adequately treated nonmelanoma skin cancer or lentigo maligna without evidence of disease. Adequately treated carcinoma in situ without evidence of disease Lowrisk prostate cancer on active surveillance Concurrent systemic immunosuppressant therapy (eg, cyclosporine A, tacrolimus, etc.) within 28 days of the first dose of study drug. Corticosteroids are allowed, but must be dosed at prednisone 20 mg (or equivalent) or lower prior to the start of chemotherapy. Vaccinated with live, attenuated vaccines within 4 weeks of first dose of study drug. Known bleeding disorders (eg, von Willebrand's disease) or hemophilia. History of stroke or intracranial hemorrhage within 6 months prior to enrollment. History of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or active hepatitis C virus (HCV) or hepatitis B virus (HBV). Patients who are positive for hepatitis B core antibody or hepatitis B surface antigen must have a negative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) result before enrollment. Those who are PCR positive will be excluded. Any uncontrolled active systemic infection. Major surgery within 4 weeks of first dose of study drug. Any lifethreatening illness, medical condition, or organ system dysfunction that, in the investigator's opinion, could compromise the subject's safety or put the study outcomes at undue risk. Currently active, clinically significant cardiovascular disease, such as uncontrolled arrhythmia or Class 2 or higher congestive heart failure as defined by the New York Heart Association Functional Classification; or a history of myocardial infarction, unstable angina, or acute coronary syndrome within 6 months prior to randomization. Unable to swallow capsules or malabsorption syndrome, symptomatic inflammatory bowel disease or ulcerative colitis, or partial or complete bowel obstruction at time of screening.
