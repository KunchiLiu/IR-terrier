	<brief_title>Cerebral Oxygen Saturation and Cytochrome Oxidase REDOX State in Children With Epilepsy: A Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pediatric subjects with partial (focal) epilepsy seizure disorders who are being admitted to the epilepsy monitoring unit will be studied using near-infrared spectroscopy for cytochrome c oxidase (CCO) redox state and blood oxygen saturation. Along with routine EEG monitoring, a set of light sensors, called optodes, attached to a net that goes over the head will be put on. These optodes will send out very weak red light signals, which will pass through the scalp and bounce back to detectors on the netting. The changes in the light signals will be used to calculate the changes in the various forms of the enzyme CCO, as well as the amount of oxygen in the blood. We hope to use these measurements to study changes in blood flow and cellular energy usage in the brain during seizures, which might help us to understand epilepsy better in the future and design better treatments.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Study subjects will include pediatric patients from birth to 18 years of age with a known seizure disorder who are being admitted to the epilepsy monitoring unit (EMU) or the ICU for further workup or medication management of their epilepsy. Subject will be eligible for the study if: 1. they have a diagnosis of partial (focal) epilepsy 2. standard of care long term EEG monitoring is planned 3. during the past 3 days to 1 week prior to EMU admission, have had an average of at least one seizure per day at time of admission to EMU. 1. history of unrepaired or palliated congenital cyanotic heart disease 2. history of traumatic head injury to the extent that precludes safe and consistent placement of NIRSEEG probes. 3. diagnosis of Primary generalized epilepsy 4. Allergy or sensitivity to tape or adhesives 5. Guardian or patient do not give consent/assent to participate in the study 6. Clinical care provider or investigator determines the patient is not appropriate candidate for the study</criteria>
