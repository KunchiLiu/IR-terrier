	<brief_summary>This study will test the feasibility of using novel/existing imaging technologies focused on hypoxia measurements to determine "response to therapy" in pediatric soft tissue sarcomas as a pilot study. Specifically, the investigators will compare the sensitivity of Blood Oxygen Level Dependent [BOLD], Diffusion-Weighted [DW] MRI, Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) and 18F-FAZA PET-MRI with that of conventional MRI to detect measurement changes between the start and completion of neoadjuvant therapy ("response to therapy") in children and adolescents (7-18 years) with suspicion of sarcoma tumors. Clinicians and scientists may use results of the proposed hypoxia-imaging surrogate markers to adjust/modify therapeutic schemes to patients on a personalized basis.</brief_summary>
