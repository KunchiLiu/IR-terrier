	<detailed_description>The investigators performed a monocentric, prospective, randomized controlled trial including 120 pediatric patients (aged 6 months - 10 years old) with functional constipation and 30 healthy age-matched healthy children as control. The investigators shall evaluate the children according to the Rome III Diagnostic Criteria for functional constipation. The 120 enrolled patients are randomized in to two groups: Group A receiving magnesium oxide and probiotics (MIYAIRI-BM), Group B receiving only magnesium oxide. Each patient is assigned the evaluation constipation symptoms and detection of microflora (beneficial and harmful bacteria) in fecal samples at the enrollment, 4 weeks, and 12 weeks. Patients who take less than 80% of the appropriate dose of medications are withdrawn from the study. All patients included in the study will be given informed oral consent before entering the study. The data of the fecal microflora evaluated in 60 healthy children are used as control.</detailed_description>
