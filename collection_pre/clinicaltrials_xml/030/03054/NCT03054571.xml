	<brief_summary>This investigation seeks to build upon existing evidence that a relationship exists between body mass and timing and the number of erupted teeth.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Correlation Between Somatic Growth and Number of Erupted Deciduous Teeth</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Alteration in the order of teeth eruption denotes a disorder in normal development of the teeth, rather than delayed or accelerated growth. The more time deviation of teeth eruption from normal, the more possible the presence of a problem in development of teeth. For these reasons having a non-invasive tool such as body mass index to determine if development will be slower than average, could be helpful to the practitioner.</detailed_description>
