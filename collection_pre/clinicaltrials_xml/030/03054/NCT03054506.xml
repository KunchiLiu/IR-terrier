	<brief_summary>Constipation is a common gastrointestinal motility disorder that is often chronic, negatively affects patients' daily lives. Constipation occurs when bowel movements become difficult or less frequent.This study is being done to study the effectiveness of the hydrogel capsule, CSP01, compared to the active control (carboxymethylcellulose) and placebo (non-medicine sugar pill), to relieve constipation among subjects with chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC) or with irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C).</brief_summary>
