	<brief_summary>Building on the findings from the investigators previous study, COMIT I, the purpose of the COMIT II study is to supplement the DEXA measurement of body composition with a supplementary DEXA measurement of visceral adipose tissue and to specifically target the impact of oleic acid consumption on body composition as the primary objective. COMIT II also will include analysis of fatty acid ethanolamines (FAEs) and their precursors to elucidate the mechanisms by which canola oil may be modifying body composition, measurement of endothelial function, inflammatory, adiposity and insulin sensitivity biomarkers, and genetic analyses.</brief_summary>
