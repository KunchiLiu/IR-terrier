	<brief_title>Combination of Intravitreal Ranibizumab With or Without Macular Laser Photocoagulation for ME Secondary to BRVO</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To investigate the efficacy of ranibizumab intravitreal injections-driven by achieving vision acuity stabilization compared to combination with laser photocoagulation in Chinese patients with visual impairment in ME due to BRVO. The result of the trial will be used to support new therapy in the BRVO in China.</detailed_description>
