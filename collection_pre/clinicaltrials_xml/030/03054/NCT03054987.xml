	<detailed_description>Gallstones can cause pain, jaundice or pancreatitis by blocking the bile duct. Bile duct stones should be removed during an endoscopic procedure called endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) using basket or balloons. However, large stones (more than 15mm in size) or multiple stones can be difficult to remove during ERCP with routine techniques. In such cases, we have to break up the stone into small pieces before it can be removed safely. We call this mechanical lithotripsy. Mechanical lithotripsy can be done by the use of a basket and a sheath that can be wrapped around the stone, which are in turn attached to a handle that is turned to result in stone breakage. But, this technique is difficult to perform. Other easier standard-of-care techniques used to remove difficult bile duct stones during an ERCP are peroral cholangioscopy-directed laser lithotripsy (POC-LL) and endoscopic balloon sphincterotomy (EBS). The POC-LL technique helps us to directly see the bile duct stone. Using this technique a catheter is inserted into the endoscope and into the bile duct to reach the stone. Using this catheter, the energy from laser (laser lithotripsy) can be accurately focused onto the stone to cause stone break-up. After the stone is broken to small pieces it can be removed by usual methods such as use of a balloon or a basket. EBS is a technique in which an 8 to 20mm balloon is used to enlarge (dilation) the opening of the bile duct. Following dilation, the stone is removed using routine methods. It is at the discretion of the treating physician on which technique he will use to remove the bile duct stone. The purpose of this study is to compare the need to use mechanical lithotripsy between patients undergoing POC-LL and EBS for removal of difficult bile duct stones</detailed_description>
