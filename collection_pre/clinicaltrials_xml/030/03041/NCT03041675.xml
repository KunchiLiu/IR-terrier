The whole duration of treatment is 8 weeks. The control group patients receive pseudo laser acupuncture. In the end of 4th and 8th week, check X-ray(KUB), collect serum Gastrin, Motilin, and Pancreatic polypeptide, and record bowel sound per minute, observe the daily record and then calculate frequent of enema and average amount of stool per day. After the end of treatment, the investigators keep follow up for 4 weeks. The outcome parameters include: 1. KUB, 2. the average amount of stool every day, 3. frequency of bowel sound, 4. frequency of enema, (Indication of enema: the amount of stool less than 200g within 3 days), 5. the change of serum Gastrin, Motilin, and Pancreatic polypeptide.</detailed_description>
