	<brief_summary>The proposed study is evaluating a novel technology, Carotid Stenotic Scan (CSS), developed by the sponsor, CVR Global. Study Design. This is a prospective cohort study that will compare a new application of a technology, the CSS device, to reference standards for assessment of carotid disease.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of a Novel Technique to Investigate CAS Piezo Electric Sensors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The overall objectives of this study are to demonstrate that the Carotid Stenotic Scan (CSS) can accurately detect significant carotid artery stenosis. Secondary objective is to relate changes in CSS signal to different degrees of stenosis. We obtain a "proof of concept" if the device correlates strongly with the established classification of atherosclerotic carotid disease derived various imaging modalities including magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and computer tomographic angiography (CTA), conventional angiography, or carotid ultrasound.</detailed_description>
