	<brief_summary>This phase Ib trial studies the side effects and best dose of murine double minute chromosome 2 (MDM2) inhibitor AMG-232 when given together with decitabine in treating patients with acute myeloid leukemia that has come back, does not respond to treatment, or is newly diagnosed. MDM2 inhibitor AMG-232 may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as decitabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving MDM2 inhibitor AMG-232 together and decitabine together may work better in treating patients with acute myeloid leukemia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MDM2 Inhibitor AMG-232 and Decitabine in Treating Patients With Relapsed, Refractory, or Newly-Diagnosed Acute Myeloid Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the toxicities of MDM2 inhibitor AMG-232 (AMG-232) in combination with decitabine (20 mg/m^2 for 10 days), and to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of AMG-232 in combination with a standard dose of decitabine. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of AMG-232 and decitabine when used in combination. II. To evaluate tumor suppressor protein 53 (p53) signaling induced by AMG-232 and decitabine as measured by macrophage inhibitory cytokine-1 (MIC-1) induction. III. To correlate AMG-232 and decitabine exposure with pharmacodynamics endpoints (efficacy, toxicity, changes in p53 signaling). TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the response rate (RR) and progression free survival (PFS) of AMG-232 and decitabine in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). II. To evaluate potential predictive biomarkers of response to AMG-232 and decitabine in AML. III. To evaluate the pharmacodynamic (PD) effects of AMG-232 and decitabine in AML blasts. IV. To determine the variability of decitabine incorporation into genomic deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and correlate with systemic pharmacokinetics and exposure-response relationships. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of MDM2 inhibitor AMG-232. Patients receive decitabine intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days 1-10 and MDM2 inhibitor AMG-232 orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 4-10 and 18-24. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.</detailed_description>

secondary AML; organ dysfunction arising from significant comorbidities not directly linked to leukemia; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group [ECOG] = 2) or not willing to undergo intensive chemotherapy Patients must have measureable disease as defined the presence of &gt;= 5% blasts in bone marrow or extramedullary leukemia Eligible patient must show evidence of wildtype (WT) p53 as assessed by central DNA sequencing conducted at Dr. Jeffrey Sklar's laboratory at Yale University Cancer Center; note, that since patients with AML have a rapidly proliferating disease, patient can be enrolled and begin treatment prior to obtaining the results of this test; patients who are found to the TP53 mutated will be removed from study and can continue on single agent decitabine; however patients will continue to be followed for toxicity ECOG performance status =&lt; 2 (Karnofsky &gt;= 60%) Total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) (&lt; 2.0 x ULN for subjects with documented Gilbert's syndrome or &lt;
