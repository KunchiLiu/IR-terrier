	<brief_summary>The Investigators will measure if hepatic glucose metabolism is upregulated towards de novo lipogenesis (DNL) via multiple intrahepatic pathways in obese girls with PCOS and hepatic steatosis (HS), compared to PCOS without HS and obese controls without HS. HS will be correlated to relative post-prandial hyperglycemia. Post-prandial hyperglycemia will be worse or remain unchanged in youth treated with oral contraceptives and better with metformin.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This will be a cross-sectional study with 4 groups of youth. A 6 hour OGTT (Oral Glucose Tolerance Test) with an oral U-C13 glycerol tracer will be paired with NMR isotopomer analysis of serum samples to describe flux through the hepatic pentose phosphate pathway, TCA cycle and DNL pathways in girls with PCOS receiving lifestyle only, metformin or oral contraceptive treatment, and obese girls with regular menses receiving lifestyle therapy. Hepatic steatosis will be measured with MRI.</detailed_description>

For PCOS groups: (NIH definition) irregular menstrual cycles at least 1.5 years after menarche, and either clinical evidence of hyperandogenism, or elevated Testosterone (above the norms for age/tanner stage) at time of screening, or documented prior to initiation of therapy for OCP and metformin groups. 6. For PCOS groups: patients untreated or currently treated with either Metformin 15002000 mg a day, or oral contraception (3035 mcg ethynyl estradiol a day) for at least 6 months, with &gt; 80% adherence confirmed via refill frequency from pharmacy. 7. For nonPCOS groups: regular menstrual cycles at least 1.5 years after menarche, and no clinical evidence of hyperandrogenism. 1. Use of medications known to affect insulin sensitivity: oral glucocorticoids within 10 days, atypical antipsychotics, immunosuppressant agents, HIV medications. Nexplanon, DepoProvera or Mirena progesterone only contraceptives. Dermal patch or vaginal ring contraception methods. For controls only: metformin or oral contraception. 2.
