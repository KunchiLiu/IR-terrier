	<brief_title>Development of Horse-Riding Program Model for Children With Cerebral Palsy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Horseback riding activities in Korea's riding centers have mostly centered on physical rehabilitation for children with special needs, including those with cerebral palsy, mental disabilities, and autism, with the program conducted by certified equine-assisted therapy instructors. However, there is no definite way to assess the ability of children for horseback riding and no standard riding program. Therefore, developing a assessment and program algorithm for healing horseback riding is expected to contribute to providing more activities for children with special needs and also for general people. Children older than 4 years old or adolescent with cerebral palsy who voluntarily want to enroll this study would be enrolled. Participants have 2 times of 30-minute horse riding program for 8 weeks, total 16 times of riding program in a local horse riding center. Sample size assessment: Calculating for 20% of drop out, 16 patients were calculated to apply the assessment and applicable program. Drop out: missing more than 2 lessons of horse-riding Plan for missing data: not included Statistical analysis plan: paired t-test for the outcome measures</detailed_description>
