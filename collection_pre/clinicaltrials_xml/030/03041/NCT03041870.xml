	<brief_summary>Previous studies have already revealed the involvement of the serotoninergic system in the social behavior process. For example, more serotonin (5HT) was found in dominant male adult monkeys. Little is known about the serotoninergic implication in human's social behavior. The project aims to clarify the role of the serotoninergic system in social behavior in relation to the process of social hierarchical information. In order to determine how serotoninergic system is involved, the investigator will use a new technic TEP-fMRI. This technic allows us to measure the brain activity and the serotoninergic transporter occupancy (using the [C11]-DASB) at the same time. The current study aims to investigate whether serotonin transporter (5-HTT) activity correlates with the neural response (BOLD) during the detection of social dominance in facial expressions or other measures of social information processing. Blood sample, SLC6A4 (allele coding for the 5HT transporter) genotyping and neuropsychological questionnaires will give at the investigator more information and allow to investigate whether performance on social information processing is modulated by personality trait and genotype.</brief_summary>
