	<brief_summary>There is an increasing interest in the effects of various food derived polyphenols on vascular function. Arguably the most well-established vascular benefits are attributed to flavanols from cocoa beans and this has been supported by a successful health claim through the European Food Safely Authority in 2012. Berry fruits are another rich source of polyphenols that have vasoactive properties, and there is a growing body of research exploring these effects in various berries (blueberries, cranberries, strawberries) and other fruit products with similar polyphenol composition. A key (poly)phenol in berries and other fruits believed to provide much of the benefit is anthocyanins. When given as an isolated extract, 320 mg anthocyanins have been found to improve blood vessel function both acutely and in response to chronic consumption over 12 weeks. Aronia berries are a native North American berry with high naturally occurring anthocyanins among other polyphenols. Based on their polyphenol composition, there is growing interest in the potential for Aronia berries to elicit health promoting cardio-metabolic effects. Specifically, Aronia berry extracts, which provide a concentrated source of polyphenols, may improve blood vessel function. Thus, the primary focus of this project is to evaluate the effects of Aronia berry extracts of differing polyphenol dose on vascular endothelial function.</brief_summary>
