	<brief_title>Comparison Between Rectal Suppository Acetaminophen and Diclofenac Sodium as Analgesia for Postpartum Perineal Tear</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Studies has demonstrated that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) rectal suppositories are associated with less pain up to 24 hours after birth, and less additional analgesia is required. Therefore, In view of rectal route of analgesic administration is better in local action and systemic paracetamol also proven to be effective in controlling post-partum perineal pain with unknown effectiveness in its suppository form; the investigators would like to conduct this study to investigate the effectiveness of acetaminophen rectal suppository versus diclofenac rectal suppository in controlling postpartum perineal pain. This study will be conducted in 2 stages. Stage 1 is a 3 months prospective observational study which aims to determine the prevalence and severity of perineal pain following childbirth in Hospital Sultanah Aminah, Johor Bahru; while Stage 2 is a single blinded, open-labelled, randomized control trial study design which will determine if acetaminophen rectal suppository is as equivalence as diclofenac rectal suppository in reducing postpartum perineal pain secondary to perineal trauma.</detailed_description>
