	<detailed_description>The study was experimental with a sample composed by an Experimental Group (EG) with 11 PVHA, under antiretroviral therapy and a Control Group (CG) with 10 individuals without the infection; all which were under medical release and insufficiently active. The body composition was evaluated through the DXA, as well as the cardiorespiratory aptitude through the ergometer and the strength of the upper and lower limbs through dynamometry. Both groups conducted interventions with concurrent training for 15 weeks and the interruption of exercise was evaluated after a period of 5 weeks.</detailed_description>
