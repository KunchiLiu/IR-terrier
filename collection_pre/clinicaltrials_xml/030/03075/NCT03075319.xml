	<brief_summary>Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is recognized as a successful procedure for treating osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee. One important factor that make the successful surgery is the degree of knee flexion. Providing more range of motion after TKA impact on the convenience of daily of life such as climbing stairs, sitting on the floor particularly in Asian cultures which require a lot of ground activities. Data are limited on the added benefits of perioperative photograph as motivation for increasing range of motion after TKA. Half of participants received perioperative photograph as motivation, while the other half did not after total knee arthroplasty.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use of Perioperative Photograph as a Motivation for Increasing Range of Motion After Primary Total Knee Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All participants received spinal anesthesia, multimodal local anesthetic infiltration and patient controlled analgesia (PCA) for 24 hours post surgery. The surgical techniques, postoperative medications and rehabilitation protocols were identical in both groups. Perioperative knee range of motion (ROM) were measured with long arm goniometer immediately after close the wound. Perioperative knee photographs in full flexion and extension positions were taken and were given to experimental group in the day after surgery. Postoperative knee ROM were recorded at day 3, 6 week, 3 month and 6 month. The outcome assessors were blinded to treatment groups during the study period.</detailed_description>
