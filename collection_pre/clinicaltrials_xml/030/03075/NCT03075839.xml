	<brief_title>Impact of Switching to Non-Menthol Cigarettes Among Smokers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goals of this project include evaluating the feasibility of a cigarette switching paradigm to examine how switching adult smokers from menthol to non-menthol cigarettes impacts smoking behavior and satisfaction. Smoking behavior will be measured by self-reported total number of cigarettes and time to first cigarette in the morning, assessed during the period of menthol smoking (week 1) and again after switching to non-menthol cigarettes (weeks 2, 3). Smoking satisfaction will be measured by self-reported ratings of the cigarettes, assessed during the period of menthol smoking (week 1) and again after switching to non-menthol cigarettes (weeks 2, 3).</detailed_description>
