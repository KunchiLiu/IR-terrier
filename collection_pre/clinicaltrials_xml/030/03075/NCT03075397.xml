	<brief_summary>The objective of our project is to determine the infected seminal cell types and the molecular mechanisms involved in HIV cell-associated transmission in the colo-rectal mucosa, using conditions as close as possible to real life, i.e. seminal leukocytes and seminal plasma from HIV-infected donors and tissue explants</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>VIH-1 Colo-rectal Transmission by Infected Semen Cells and Effects of Seminal Plasma ex Vivo (CellspermVIH)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This project relies on: - our expertise of HIV in semen and male genital tract and our experience in organotypic cultures; - a network of infectious diseases and reproductive biology clinicians to collect, analyze and process seminal cells and seminal plasma from HIV+ donors; - the expertise in confocal microscopy and ex vivo colo-rectal model. State of the art culture of colo-rectal tissues, primary cell culture and infection, confocal microscopy, flow cytometry, Polymerase Chain Reaction and Luminex assays for cytokine measurements will be the methodologies primarily used in this project.</detailed_description>
