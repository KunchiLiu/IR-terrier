	<brief_summary>This investigation is designed to evaluate the performance (treatment and leak), comfort (subjective feedback), stability (subjective feedback, leak) as well as the participant's overall acceptance of the Saturn mask amongst OSA participants. An important factor in this investigation will be the testing of our two different seal sizes on the participants (small and medium size). A total number of 15 participants who currently use nasal or nasal pillow masks will be recruited for the trial. A subset of participants have been selected based on their anthropometric measurements collected in previous trials using nasal and nasal pillow masks at this site (CIA-103). Participants from previous NZ trials may be recruited into this trial with their consent. All the participants will be recruited by WellSleep, Wellington. Participants will use the trial mask in home for a period of 7 ± 3 days. Baseline data will be collected from the participant during the first visit, the prior 7 days of CPAP usage data will be downloaded and stored for our analysis. The participant will use the trial device on their usual CPAP/APAP setting and device for the duration of the trial. This study will be conducted in accordance with ICH/GCP guidelines. No deviation from the protocol will be implemented without prior review and approval of the sponsor except where it may be necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard to a research participant. In such case, the deviation will be reported to the sponsor as soon as possible.</brief_summary>
