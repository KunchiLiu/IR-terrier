	<brief_summary>Investigators will pilot test the impact of an enhanced implementation strategy on implementation and child health outcomes using continuous formative evaluation. Investigators will test the hypothesis that better fidelity to the implementation strategy (WISE) is positively related to child outcomes (e.g., child fruit and vegetable intake, BMI).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Investigators will determine whether the enhanced strategy is feasible, acceptable, and demonstrates improved implementation, fidelity, and sustainability using a Hybrid Type 3 implementation design. Investigators expect that the effectiveness of WISE on child outcomes will vary by the level of implementation fidelity, and a Hybrid 3 design allows for us to explore this hypothesis).</detailed_description>
