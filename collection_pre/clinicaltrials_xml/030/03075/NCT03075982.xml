	<brief_summary>Hemodialysis patients have altered pulmonary function and this is associated with impaired endothelial function and cardiovascular events. Respiratory muscle training (RMT) has the potential to improve cardiovascular outcomes in patients undergoing maintenance HD.This is a randomized controlled clinical trial including 41 patients undergoing thrice-weekly maintenance HD. Patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive or not RMT during HD sessions for 8 weeks. Main outcomes were change in levels of the biomarkers related to endothelium activation (vascular cell adhesion molecule 1, VCAM-1, and intercellular adhesion molecule 1, ICAM-1), glycocalyx derangement (syndecan-1), aberrant angiogenesis (angiopoietin-2) and oxidative stress (malondialdehyde) from baseline. Other outcomes included changes in functional capacity and in pulmonary function test</brief_summary>
