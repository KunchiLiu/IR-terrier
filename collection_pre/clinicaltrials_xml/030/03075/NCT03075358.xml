	<brief_summary>Endometrial aspiration biopsy has been accepted as a diagnostic procedure of choice for women with abnormal uterine bleeding to examine endometrial pathology. The procedure has high accuracy comparing to conventional fractional curettage. However, it is associated with significant pain during the procedure. In general, there is no specific recommendation regarding the proper anesthesia used during the procedure. The aim of this study is to examine the effect of lidocaine spray for reducing pain during the endometrial aspiration procedure by comparing it with placebo and no intervention.</brief_summary>
