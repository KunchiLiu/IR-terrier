Furthermore, obesity impacts on psychological wellbeing via lowered self-efficacy, self-esteem, body image and overall quality of life (QoL). A pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT) is proposed to investigate the additional benefit of a psychological intervention alongside treatment as usual (TAU) in a weight management service.

	<detailed_description>Overweight and obesity is reported as an 'epidemic' problem within the UK as well as the world. Individuals living with this may be at higher risk of developing co-morbidities, such as cancers, heart problems or diabetes, and higher mortality rates are reported in this group. Furthermore, overweight and obesity can also impact on a person's psychological wellbeing, such as their self-efficacy, self-esteem and body image as well as have a negative effect on their overall quality of life (QoL). Therefore, a pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT) is proposed to investigate the additional benefit of a psychological intervention alongside treatment as usual (TAU) in a weight management service. Patients routinely attending an outpatient clinic will be randomised into TAU with or without additional Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) group based-input.</detailed_description>
