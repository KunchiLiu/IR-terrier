	<brief_summary>Fluzoparib is an oral potent, selective poly-ADP ribose polymerase-1 (PARP-1) and PARP-2 inhibitor; Apatinib is an oral selective vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) inhibitor. This open-label, dose finding phase I trial studies the tolerability and the best dose of fluzoparib in combination with apatinib and to see how well these two drugs work together in the treatment of patients with recurrent ovarian cancer or triple negative breast cancer. The safety and efficacy of fluzoparib in combination with apatinib will be explored. Both dose escalation and dose expansion parts are included in this study.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 1. Life expectancy of more than 12 weeks. Histologically or cytologically confirmed highgrade papillaryserous epithelial ovarian cancer，primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancers; subjects with a known deleterious breast cancer gene (BRCA) mutation and any other highgrade histology are also eligible. Subjects should have platinumsensitive disease, where platinumsensitive disease is defined as having had a &gt; 6 month interval since last receiving platinum therapy prior to disease recurrence. Additionally, subjects with histologically or cytologically confirmed triple negative breast cancer (TNBC）, that is locally advanced or metastatic, are also eligible. Prior therapy：subjects with ovarian cancer，primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancers have received only 2 lines of platinumbased chemotherapies, and TNBC patients have received only 1 line of standard chemotherapy. Each prior chemotherapy must be given for at least 2 cycles. At least one measurable lesion that can be accurately assessed by imaging (CT/MRI) at baseline Subjects who have overall good overall general condition. Signed informed consent. Subjects who received any previous treatment with any PARP inhibitors. Subjects who received any previous treatment with any VEGFR inhibitors. Less than 4 weeks from the last clinical trial. Less than 4 weeks from the last radiotherapy, chemotherapy, surgery, hormone treatment and target therapy. Unstable or uncontrolled hypertension. Subjects that are unable to swallow, or dysfunction of gastrointestinal absorption. Subjects with brain metastases. Subjects with uncontrolled hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia before study entry. Subjects with a known hypersensitivity to fluzoparib, apatinib or any of the excipients of the products. Ongoing infection (determined by investigator). History of immunodeficiency, including HIVpositive, suffering from other acquired, congenital immunodeficiency disease, or history of organ transplantation.
