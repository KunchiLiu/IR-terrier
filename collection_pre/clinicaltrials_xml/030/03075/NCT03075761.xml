	<detailed_description>The feasibility of an innovative intervention of a validated fitness tracker, the Fitbit, to improve adherence to a 12-week activity regimen in a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) will be tested in 44 subjects with first, acute, proximal lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The primary outcomes will consist of a) feasibility indicators determined a priori (eligibility, consent, adherence, retention) and b) estimates of effect size associated with the prescribed activity regimen, by describing within-subject change in QoL and potential biomarkers of postthrombotic syndrome (PTS) pre and post intervention in each group.</detailed_description>
