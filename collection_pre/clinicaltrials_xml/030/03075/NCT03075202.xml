	<brief_summary>It is well established in the scientific literature that people with schizophrenia smoke tobacco cigarettes at rates up to three times that of the general population, relapse more frequently, and die an average of 25 years earlier from cigarette smoking and other life-style attributable illnesses. Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) are becoming increasingly popular with smokers worldwide and new research suggests that e-cigarettes are appealing to smokers with schizophrenia. There is a paucity of research focused on the experience of smokers with schizophrenia who decide to try an e-cigarette. A well-designed prospective-observational study is needed to learn more about the influence of e-cigarette use on cigarette smoking behavior and mental and physical health among smokers with schizophrenia. In response, the investigators have designed a study titled, Role of an electronic cigarette on smoking displacement in smokers with schizophrenia: A prospective 3-month pilot study (SchizEcig).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Role of an E-cigarette on Smoking Displacement in Smokers With Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective 3 month pilot study to observe cigarette use behavior among people with a schizophrenia spectrum disorder diagnosis who smoke conventional tobacco cigarettes, do not intend to reduce or quit smoking, and are invited to use an e-cigarette. The investigators are interested to know if e-cigarette use is associated with cigarette smoking displacement. Displacement is defined as switching from conventional tobacco cigarettes to e-cigarettes. The investigators will also monitor for physical and mental health, including blood pressure, weight, and scores from the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS) and the Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms (SAPS) as well as any reported adverse events participants' feel are attributed to e-cigarette use and participants' perceptions of the sensory experience associated with e-cigarette use.</detailed_description>
