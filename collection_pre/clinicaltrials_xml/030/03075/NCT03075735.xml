	<brief_summary>PROREPAIR is a prospective multicenter observational cohort study of unselected patients with metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC) with unknown germline mutational status at study entry and who are candidates to start 1st line treatment with any approved survival-prolonging agent. The study aims to evaluate the impact of aberrations in DNA-repair genes,(BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM and PALB2 and other genes) on cause-specific survival from the diagnosis of the metastatic castration resistant status and other outcomes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prospective Multicentre Cohort Study PROREPAIR-B (mCRPC)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a non-interventional study in which eligible patients are prospectively followed-up until death or the end-of-study, whichever happens first. Patients are enrolled after mCRPC diagnosis and before or within the 6 first months of starting a first-line treatment with any approved survival-prolonging agent for mCRPC. First and subsequent treatment lines will be chosen according to the patients and their treating physicians preferences and will not be dictated by this study. A whole blood sample for germline DNA extraction as well as any available archival prostate cancer tissue samples will be collected at baseline. Optional plasma, serum and whole blood samples will be collected at baseline and at different time points along the evolution of the disease. A sample will be collected within the last 6 months of life. Survival and treatment outcomes including biochemical, radiological and clinical progression with standard approved agents abiraterone, enzalutamide, docetaxel, cabazitaxel and radium-223 will be prospectively collected. Primary aim is to evaluate the prevalence and impact of DNA repair germline mutations in the BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM and PALB2 genes on cause-specific survival from mCRPC. Secondary aims will include the correlation of additional germline alterations in DNA-repair with survival and treatment outcomes; the analyses of the survival and treatment outcomes impact of somatic alterations in these genes and the role of germline and somatic defects in the clonal evolution of prostate cancer.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Provision of signed informed consent. 2. Patients must be ≥18 years old. 3. Histologically confirmed prostate cancer 4. presence of metastatic disease according to Bone, CT and/or MRIscan. 5. Confirmed castration resistant prostate cancer defined as disease progression despite castrate levels of testosterone (&lt;0.5ng/mL) and either a continuous rise in the serum prostatespecific antigen (PSA) levels, the progression of preexisting disease and /or the appearance of new metastases. Patients must be maintained on aLHRH or have underwent bilateral orchiectomy. 6. Eligible patients are due to start or have started firstline treatment with any approved survivalprolonging therapy for mCRPC within a period of 6 months from study entry. 7. ECOG performance status ≤21. 8. Unknown mutation carrier status at the study entry. 1. Previous cancer diagnosis, except those patients who had a localized malignant tumour and who are five years cancerfree or those diagnosed with skin cancers (of nonmelanoma type) or excised in situ carcinomas. 2. Any prior medical history that according to the judgement of the investigator might interfere with the subject´s granting of informed consent or the safe execution of the procedures required in the study.</criteria>
