	<brief_summary>Vulvovaginal candidiasis (CVV) is an infectious process of the female genitourinary tract, an important health issue due to the high incidence and difficulties encountered in the treatment. Therefore, new therapeutic modalities are sought with the capacity to minimize drug side-effects and to reduce recurrent cases. The objective of this stufy is to evaluate the clinical and microbiological response of the 405 nm blue light emitting diode in the treatment of women with vulvovaginal candidiasis and in women with healthy gentourine treatment. A clinical trial was conducted involving 40 women, divided into two groups, the first group consisting of women with a confirmed CVV diagnosis and a second group formed by women with a healthy genitourinary tract, without symptoms and symptoms of the disease. Both groups underwent clinical evaluation and examination with endocervice collection with gynecologist before and after a session of application of the Blue Light Emitting Diode of 405 nm, lasting 4.5 minutes. There will also be an evaluation of the effects of the diary through the questionnaire answered before and after the participants' treatment. It is expected that the 405 nm blue LED will destroy the CVV fungus demonstrated by laboratory examination and also improve the signs and results analyzed by the gynecologist and participants.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use of 405nm Blue Light Emitting Diode in the Treatment of Women With Vulvovaginal Candidiasis: a Clinical Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A current treatmente proposal is the use of blue LED of 405 nm wich is a light that has antimicrobial effect when exposed to endogenous porphyrin of the pathogens. This exposition produces reactive oxigen and it causes cells death with no possibilities of resistance by the fungus.</detailed_description>
