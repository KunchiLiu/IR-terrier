	<brief_summary>Allergic rhinitis is a common condition that affects adults as well as children and adolescents, often with impaired quality of life. Patients often report a poor level of satisfaction with the effectiveness of their treatment and are always looking for more drug combinations to improve their symptom. Several tools exist for assessing control of allergic rhinitis, but none has been validated in teenagers or in children. A study conducted in 2008, resulted in the validation of a self-administered control test of allergic rhinitis (ARCT) in patients from 12 years of age. We propose to adapt ARCT adult to pediatric population from 5 to 11 years old.</brief_summary>
