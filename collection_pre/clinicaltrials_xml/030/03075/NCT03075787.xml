	<brief_summary>Obstructive sleep apnea is often associated with microarousals and a stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system. The knowledge of this autonomic activation may help understanding the increase of cardiac risk observed in elderly. The aim of the study is to evaluate the relationship between obstructive sleep apnea severity, age, gender and heart rate response associated with obstructive sleep apnea. Drug-free patients diagnosed with obstructive sleep apneas were included. Clinical data and 24-h polysomnography recordings were analyzed.</brief_summary>
