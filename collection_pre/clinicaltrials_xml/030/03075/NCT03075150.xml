	<brief_summary>This is a prospective, randomized, sequential data collection study to evaluate the ability of pleth variability index (PVI) to predict fluid responsiveness in comparison with other dynamic parameters including pulse pressure variation (PPV) and stroke volume variation (SVV).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PVI as a Parameter to Predict Fluid Responsiveness</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients will be randomized to a tidal volume of either 6 or 8 ml.kg-1 of ideal body weight, with positive end-expiratory pressure set between 3 and 5 cmH20. The finger sensor will be applied to patients in the OR, and hemodynamic measurements will be collected from standard OR monitors.</detailed_description>
