	<brief_summary>This is a retrospective external validation study of a novel in-vitro diagnostic (IVD) assay that will include review of medical charts of 4500 pediatric patients to whom ImmunoXpert™ test was taken as part of routine workup for acute febrile illness. The investigated assay requires the measurement of three host-related, blood-based, protein bio-markers that will be integrated using a formula into a single score. Based on this score, each patient is classified into one of three categories: (i) bacterial (ii) viral (iii) marginal equivocal immune response (inconclusive or non-infectious). statistical analysis will be performed to compare ImmunoXpert™ accuracy to current practice lab testing (e.g. WBC, CRP, and PCT) and clinical suspicion at time of requisition. Enrolled patients will be managed according to the current standard of care and per standard institutional procedures.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients aged 3 month to 18 years that were admitted due to acute febrile illness, and ImmunoDx test was taken as part of their workup. The febrile illness should also fulfill the following criteria: The patient had a peak temperature ≥38°C (AND) Symptoms initiated ≤ 7 days before sampling (AND) A retrospective diagnosis of bacterial or viral or mixed infection was anonymously determined by a panel of three independent senior pediatricians. The noninfectious disease control group will include: A retrospective diagnosis of a noninfectious disease was anonymously determined by a panel of three independent senior pediatricians physicians. Patients with a noninfectious disease ( and ImmunoDx test was wrongly taken) Samples from patients who had one or more of the following criteria will be excluded from the study: Another infection episode during the last 3 weeks before sampling Congenital immune deficiency (CID) A proven or suspected HIV1, HBV, HCV infection Active hematological malignancy Current treatment with immunesuppressive or immunemodulating therapies including without limitations: Use of high dose steroids &gt;1 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent in the last two weeks Monoclonal antibody administration Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) Other illnesses that affect life expectancy and/or quality of life</criteria>
