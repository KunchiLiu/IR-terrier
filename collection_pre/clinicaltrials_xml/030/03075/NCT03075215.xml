	<brief_summary>To learn in a general Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy Defibrillators (CRT-D) population, which optimization techniques are used and how effective they are. It will compare 12-month response rates among different optimization methods and characterize which selected subject subgroups achieve better response than others. A subset of SMART Registry subjects will contribute to the NG4 Post Market Clinical Follow Up (PMCF) Cohort whose objective is collecting data on the NG4 CRT-D features and device usage in a real world setting and monitor long term safety associated with these devices to support CE Mark.</brief_summary>
