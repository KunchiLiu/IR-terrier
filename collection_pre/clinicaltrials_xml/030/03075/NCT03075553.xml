	<brief_summary>This phase II trial studies how well nivolumab works in treating patients with peripheral T-cell lymphoma that has come back after a period of improvement or that does not respond to treatment. Monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may block cancer growth in different ways by targeting certain cells.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nivolumab in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Peripheral T-cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the clinical benefit of nivolumab in T-cell lymphomas, as measured by objective response rate (ORR) within 12 cycles according to the Lugano Classification Response Criteria (2014). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess safety and tolerability of the regimen in this patient population. II. To assess progression-free survival (PFS). III. To assess duration of response (DOR). IV. To assess overall survival (OS). TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate T-cell/cytokine profile in the peripheral blood - peripheral blood specimens will be used to assess T-cell activation and cytokine up regulation as measures of treatment effect. II. To evaluate intratumoral biomarkers- intratumoral cell populations and distribution, genetic variability, mutational burden and T-cell activation will be evaluated to identify potential biomarkers that correlate with response to therapy. III. To assess the potential association between PD-L1/PD-1/PD-L2 expression on tumor and T-cells and/or PD-L1 soluble levels in plasma with clinical efficacy of PD-1 blockade. OUTLINE: Patients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 14 days for up to 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving stable disease, complete response, or partial response receive nivolumab IV over 60 minutes on day 1 of course 9. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 24 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 35 days, 100-120 days, 230-250 days, and 330-390 days.</detailed_description>
