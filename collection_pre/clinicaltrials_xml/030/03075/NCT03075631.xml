	<brief_title>Acute Pancreatitis Patient Registry To Examine Novel Therapies In Clinical Experiences 2</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is an ancillary of APPRENTICE. This will be the international based study. The initial study design with discussions about the different variables to be included into our prospective database started during 2014 PancreasFest held in Pittsburgh, PA in late July 2014 under the sponsorship of Collaborative Alliance for Pancreatic Education and Research (CAPER). Following this, a datasheet with variables was created, distributed through the initial participants, and further suggestions and edits were made. We now plan to move ahead with a web based seminar. All previous participants, as well as new investigators/centers that have shown interest in participating throughout the world will be invited.University of Pittsburgh will be responsible for collecting all required regulatory documents from other sites. Developing templates for questionnaires and other data collection forms. Will train approved sites on procedures. The coordinating center will be the recipient of de-identified data and will not be involved in the collection of data. Note that copies of training records, licenses, certificates should be maintained in the study regulatory binder and are subject to audit by the Research Conduct and Compliance Office (RCCO).</detailed_description>
