	<brief_summary>This study plans to directly address the problem of post-ERCP pancreatitis to gauge the various factors involved in its development and genetic variability in the immune response to an isolated pancreatic insult. In addition, the investigators hope to study markers of the early immune response to this injury and to develop a risk-assessment model.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Post-ERCP Pancreatitis Severity Indication (PEPSI) Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreaticography (ERCP) is an important diagnostic and therapeutic tool in the management of pancreatic and biliary diseases. However, it carries up to 10% risk of developing acute pancreatitis, 10% of which will be severe. Current models to predict the severity of acute pancreatitis are incomplete and unable to prognosticate early in the course of the disease because they are based on biomarkers of late immune response. Recent findings suggest that polymorphisms in the gene coding for MCP-1 (Monocyte Chemotactic Protein-1) play an important role in the early immune response leading to either mild versus severe acute pancreatitis of various etiologies. This study plans to directly address the problem of post-ERCP pancreatitis to gauge the various factors involved in its development and genetic variability in the immune response to an isolated pancreatic insult. In addition, we hope to study markers of the early immune response to this injury and to develop a risk-assessment model.</detailed_description>
