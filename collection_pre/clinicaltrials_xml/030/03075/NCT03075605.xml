	<brief_title>PROOF: Pancreatitis-associated Risk Of Organ Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective case control study that compares the initial immune response with severity and outcome in patients with acute pancreatitis. Therefore, the investigators aim to determine whether etiology of acute pancreatitis, segregates with candidate genetic polymorphisms and their m-RNA expression, as well as whether functional polymorphisms in inflammation regulating genes predict a more severe outcome in acute pancreatits. The investigators anticipate that based on our results that we will provide a more accurate predictor of the clinical course of acute pancreatits and help direct more aggressive or cytokine specific treatment of patients at greater risk of a more severe form of the disease.</detailed_description>
