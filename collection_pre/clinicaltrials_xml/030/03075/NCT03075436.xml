	<brief_title>The Impact of Enhanced, Demand-side Sanitation and Hygiene Promotion on Sustained Behavior Change and Health in Ethiopia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study utilizes a cluster randomized, controlled trial design to examine the impacts of an enhanced, demand-side sanitation and hygiene intervention on behavior change and health in Amhara, Ethiopia. The study will test hypotheses set out in the investigation team's theory of change through the measurement and evaluation of process indicators, intermediate and shorter-term behavioral outcomes, and longer-term behavioral and health impacts, including mental well-being. The study aims to: (1) identify ways in which WASH-related behavior change components preventive for neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) can be mainstreamed into the government-led Health Extension Program; (2) document the effectiveness of an enhanced demand-side sanitation and hygiene intervention; (3) investigate whether changes in personal hygiene, sanitation, and water behaviors are sustained; (4) document the cost-effectiveness of integrated WASH-related NTD-preventive behavior change promotion; and (5) assess whether collective efficacy and water security modify intervention effectiveness.</detailed_description>
