	<brief_summary>This is a Phase I, multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK) of a novel T-Cell bispecific (TCB), RO7082859, administered by intravenous (IV) infusion, following the pretreatment administration of a one-time, fixed dose of obinutuzumab. The study is divided in 3 parts: dose escalation (Parts I and II) and dose expansion (Part III). Single-participant dose-escalation cohorts will be used in Part I, followed by conversion to multiple participant dose-escalation cohorts (Part II), in order to define a tentative maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or optimal biological dose (OBD). The expansion cohorts (Part III) will be initiated when the tentative MTD/OBD is defined, to further evaluate the safety, PK and therapeutic activity of RO7082859.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Depending upon study part, a history or status of: 1) a histologicallyconfirmed hematological malignancy that is expected to express cluster of differentiation (CD)20; 2) relapse after or failure to respond to at least one prior treatment regimen; and 3) no available treatment options that are expected to prolong survival (e.g., standard chemotherapy or autologous stem cell transplant [SCT]) Participant must have at least one measureable target lesion (&gt;/=1.5 centimeters [cm]) in its largest dimension by computerized tomography [CT] scan) Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1 Life expectancy of &gt;/=12 weeks AEs from prior anticancer therapy must have resolved to Grade less than or equal to (&lt;/=) 1 Participants must have peripheral Bcell counts at or below 500 cells per microliter (cells/mcL) at screening Adequate liver, hematological and renal function Negative serologic or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test results for acute or chronic Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection Negative test results for Hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) Participants with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) Participants with acute bacterial, viral, or fungal infection at baseline, confirmed by a positive blood culture within 72 hours prior to obinutuzumab infusion Prior treatment with systemic immunotherapeutic agents, including, but not limited to, radioimmunoconjugates, antibodydrug conjugates, immune/cytokines and monoclonal antibodies (e.g., anticytotoxic Tlymphocyteassociated protein 4 [antiCTLA4], antiprogrammed death 1 [antiPD1] and antiprogrammed death ligand 1 [antiPDL1]) within 4 weeks or five halflives of the drug, whichever is shorter, before obinutuzumab infusion on Cycle 1 Day 7 Documented refractoriness to an obinutuzumabcontaining regimen Treatment with standard radiotherapy, any chemotherapeutic agent, or treatment with any other investigational anticancer agent within 4 weeks prior to obinutuzumab infusion Prior solid organ transplantation Prior allogeneic SCT Autologous SCT within 100 days prior to obinutuzumab infusion Participant with history of confirmed progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) Current or past history of central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma Evidence of significant, uncontrolled concomitant diseases that could affect compliance with the protocol or interpretation of results, including diabetes mellitus, history of relevant pulmonary disorders and known autoimmune diseases Participants with another invasive malignancy in the last 2 years (with the exception of basal cell carcinoma and tumors deemed by the Investigator to be of low likelihood for recurrence) Administration of a live, attenuated vaccine within 4 weeks before obinutuzumab infusion or anticipation that such a live attenuated vaccine will be required during the study Received systemic immunosuppressive medications (including but not limited to cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, methotrexate, thalidomide, and antitumor necrosis factor agents) with the exception of corticosteroid treatment &lt;/=10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent within 2 weeks prior to obinutuzumab infusion Any other diseases, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding, or clinical laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition that would contraindicate the use of an investigational drug</criteria>
