	<brief_title>Effect of Acupuncture Intervention on Improving Neurological Function and Antiinflammation in Patients With Acute Ischemic Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acupuncture Treatment in Stroke is a widely practiced in Taiwan, mainland China, and around the world. The using in stroke group is countless. Numerous clinical trials have been conducted in the medical community to assess efficacy, and the results mostly suggest that acupuncture may be an effective, low side effects adjuvant therapy. Ischemic stroke is also associated with chronic inflammation-related diseases. In recent years, the anti-inflammatory effect of acupuncture was gradually found. So, whether in the basic or in clinical, the investigators can deduce that acupuncture may be helpful for stroke as an adjuvant therapy. This study evaluates the neurological function of patients with acute stroke by using the widely used National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) and Barthel Index. Also, the investigators assess the degree of inflammation by biomarkers. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to explore the effect of acupuncture intervention on acute ischemic patients and its relationship in anti-inflammatory actions.</detailed_description>
