	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to comprehensively investigate and objectively demonstrate the effectiveness of hyperdiltue Botox® Cosmetic in improving overall skin quality, more specifically evenness of skin tone, reduction of pore size and improvement in the appearance of preexisting skin scars. The ability of hyperdilute Botox® Cosmetic to improve overall skin quality is likely optimized when it is injected uniformly in hyper-diluted small aliquots in order to "saturate" the dermis. We propose to prepare Botox® Cosmetic in a manner that is approximately 4 times more dilute compared to the typical Botox® Cosmetic preparation. A 4x4 centimeter area located in the mid-cheek adjacent to the nose will be injected with hyperdilute Botox® Cosmetic. Botox® Cosmetic is not FDA-approved for this use. A maximum of 15 subjects will participate in this study, all of whom will receive injections of Botox® Cosmetic during the course of this study. This study is a randomized, placebo-controlled, and double-masked study. This means neither the study doctor nor participant know the experimental agent (e.g., 0.9% saline solution and hyperdiluted Botox® Cosmetic) injected on each side of the patients' faces. The study will last for a total of 75 days. Evaluation of the study is based on the analysis of photographic images obtained during the study.</detailed_description>
