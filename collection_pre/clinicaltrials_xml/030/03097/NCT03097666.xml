	<brief_title>Evaluation of Safety and Dose Response Using C2 CryoBalloon™ Swipe Ablation System for Barrett's Esophagus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The procedure will be performed on an outpatient basis according to the site standard of care for anesthesia and sedation during esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) procedures. The CryoBalloon Swipe will be used for all ablations, following the instructions for use provided with the product. Patients who meet the eligibility criteria will be assigned to one of the treatment groups and doses, depending on the order of their enrollment: Phase I The first two patients (subject 1-2) will be treated with Dose 1 (lowest). As many applications as needed to ablate 50% of the esophageal circumference will be done. If there is no Dose-related SAE within seven (7) days post-treatment, another four (4) patients (subject 3-6) will be treated in the same fashion, for a total of 6 patients treated with Dose 1. All patients will have to undergo 8 week (±1 week) follow-up EGD to evaluate efficacy of the dose before the study continues. If the follow-up endoscopies show that Dose 1 eradicates ≥80% of the treated BE (median percentage in all 6 patients based on the EGD-Adjudication Committee evaluation), and no SAE's are reported, this dose is defined as the therapeutic dose and enrollment will proceed to phase II. If Dose 1 eradicates &lt;80% of the treated BE (median percentage in treated patients as assessed by EGD-Adjudication Committee), enrollment in Phase I will continue with a 0.1mm/sec increase in dose (0.7mm/sec; Second Dose). Treatment doses will be escalated in this manner until the earlier of a dose-related Serious Adverse Event (SAE) or determination of the therapeutic dose based on endoscopic exam and biopsy. When the therapeutic dose is determined, the study will proceed to Phase II to generate additional safety and efficacy data. Phase II Phase II will confirm the safety and efficacy of the therapeutic dose found in Phase I. Twelve (12) subjects will be ienrolled. As many applications as needed to ablate 50% of the circumference of the 3cm length of the BE will be done using the efficacious dose determined in Phase I. The subject will return for an endoscopic exam at eight (8) weeks post-index procedure (±1 week), at which time the untreated (contralateral) portion of the target segment will be ablated. --------------------------------------------------------------- Dose-related SAEs include pain in the treatment area greater than 6 (on VAS) on 24 hours and seven (7) days post-treatment; symptomatic stricture requiring an additional EGD with endoscopic dilation before the first follow-up EGD; symptomatic stricture at follow-up EGD; or any stricture (symptomatic or asymptomatic) preventing passage of the diagnostic endoscope at follow-up EGD. Any other serious adverse events within 30 days after treatment will also be evaluated by the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) for relationship to the dose and severity. When a Dose-related serious adverse event occurs, the Holding Rule will be invoked and enrollment at that dose will be held until the DSMB has evaluated the event.</detailed_description>
