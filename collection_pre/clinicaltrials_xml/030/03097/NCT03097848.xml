	<brief_summary>Radiofrequency ablation is a popular treatment for recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC),but still has a higher recurrence. Sorafenib as neo-adjuvant therapy in combination of RFA was not reported yet. There's a theoretical advantage of this combination. Hence in this study the efficacy and safety of pre-administrative Sorafenib and Latter radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in Recurrent HCC will be tested in a multicenter prospective cohort study.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Radiofrequency ablation is a popular treatment for recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC),but still has a higher recurrence. Sorafenib as neo-adjuvant therapy in combination of RFA was not reported yet. There's a theoretical advantage of this combination. Hence in this study the efficacy and safety of pre-administrative Sorafenib and Latter radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in Recurrent HCC will be tested in a multicenter prospective cohort study. Eligible cases will be assigned into the experimental group and the control group. For experiment group, sorafenib tablet will be given for two weeks, and then perform radiofrequency ablation. For the control group, RFA will be performed immediately.</detailed_description>
