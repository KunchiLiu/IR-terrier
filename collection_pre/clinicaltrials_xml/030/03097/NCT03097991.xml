	<brief_summary>This R01 tests through RCT methodology efficacy of a new intervention designed specifically to aid development of positive coparenting alliances between at-risk (unmarried, uncoupled, low income) African American mothers and fathers having a first baby together.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomized Controlled Trial of Prenatal Coparenting Intervention (CoparentRCT)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Seventy-five randomly-assigned control group families will receive county services as-usual for pregnant parents and assistance of the partnering health and human service agencies with referrals to desired services, while 75 experimental group families will receive the same services and aid, plus a 6-session prenatal intervention with a post-natal booster session. The intervention addresses the importance of safe, healthy families for early infant development, the impact a cooperative and sustained coparenting alliance can have in promoting positive infant development, challenges unmarried parents face cultivating a coparenting alliance together when their commitment to one another as romantic or married partners is in doubt, and ways to surmount these obstacles, maintain rapport, and sustain a strong alliance. All 150 participating families, both at intake (prior to the intervention) and then again at 3 and 12 months post-partum, will report beliefs about fatherhood; extent of depressive symptomatology; and quality of the mother-father partnership. State-of-the-field coparenting observations will be conducted at each follow-up, along with measures of parental stress, domestic violence, perceived coparenting support, father engagement, and infant socioemotional adjustment. Analyses will examine impact of the intervention on promoting more supportive, coordinated post-partum coparenting alliances and more positive adult and infant outcomes. Exploratory analyses will examine questions relevant to father associations with child adjustment and whether this coparent intervention can reduce domestic violence.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Eligible applicants are those for whom the pregnancy is the mother's first with the baby's father; the mother and/or father are African American and unmarried at the time of referral; and of low socioeconomic status (income at or below the county and state poverty line). If participants report a prior history of IPV, they may still be eligible to participate depending upon assessment performed by trained project staff using the Danger Assessment Tool (DAT; Campbell, 2003). Families will be excluded if they: demonstrate evidence of psychotic symptoms or suicidal ideation on the Brief Symptom Inventory; or are deemed in need of more intensive intervention as indicated by DAS scores of 9 or higher, or reporting any of the following: 1) she has required medical care owing to injuries caused by his violence, 2) she fears he could significantly harm/injure her, 3) he has made threats with a weapon; 4) he has made threats to kill her; 5) he owns a gun; 6) violence has escalated recently; 7) he is stalking or spying; 8) he controls her friends or family; 9) she feels more threatened or in danger when he is under the influence or 10) she feels participating in the intervention may put her at risk for violence.</criteria>
