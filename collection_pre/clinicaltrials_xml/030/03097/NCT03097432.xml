	<brief_summary>This prospective open multi-centre non-interventional study initiated to document the up-dosing period of children and adults with allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and/or allergic asthma treated with a SLIT containing purified, aqueous extracts of birch, alder, and hazel pollen. The following up-dosing schemes are freely selectable: scheme A consists of an up-dosing period of 12 days at the patient´s home using the standardized pollen extract in three different solution strengths to reach the maximum dose; scheme B is performed only with the highest solution strength at the physician's office within 2 hours; and the new scheme C which is a regimen for initiation at the physician`s office and continuation at the patient`s home also exclusively using the highest solution strength and takes 4 days. Data are documented by physicians and in patients´ diaries.</brief_summary>
