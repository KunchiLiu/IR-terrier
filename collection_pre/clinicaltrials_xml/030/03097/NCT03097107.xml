	<detailed_description>SARO.15.001.04 is a multicenter, prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel arm, 12-week study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Saroglitazar Magnesium 1, 2 and 4 mg in patients with fasting triglyceride ≥500 mg/dL and ≤1500 mg/dL. A total 124 subjects will be enrolled in a ratio of 1:1:1:1 to receive either Saroglitazar Magnesium 1 mg, Saroglitazar Magnesium 2 mg, Saroglitazar Magnesium 4 mg, or placebo.</detailed_description>
