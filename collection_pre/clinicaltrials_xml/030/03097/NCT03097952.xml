Patients with chronic HBV infection are at an increased risk for developing hepatic cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma and even death. Although some predictive factors of the outcome of chronic HBV infection were identified, more precisely determine the factors which are associated with the outcome in non-selected patients with chronic HBV infection are still needed. The investigators purpose is to constitute a observational cohort of non-selected Chinese patients to create a database of epidemiological, clinical, biological, virological, immunologic and therapeutic parameters, in order to determine factors associated with the outcome of chronic HBV infection.</brief_summary>
