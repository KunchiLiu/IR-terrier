	<brief_title>Does Ischemic Preconditioning Affects Neutrophil-Lymphocyte Ratio in Patients Undergoing Open Heart Surgery ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Preliminary evidence has suggested the role of inflammation in development and prognosis of cardiovascular diseases and cancers. Most of the prognostic studies failed to account for the effects of co-morbid conditions as these might have raised the systemic inflammation. We used neutrophil lymphocyte ratio (NLR) as a measure of systemic inflammation and investigated its association with cardiac preconditioning in open heart surgery .</detailed_description>
