	<brief_title>Study of TAK-228 In Patients With Previously Treated Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works in treating a specific disease. "Investigational" means that the intervention is being studied. The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved TAK-228 as a treatment for any disease but it is being investigated as a treatment for advanced solid tumors, blood disorders, and inflammatory diseases. TAK-228 works to inhibit or interfere with cellular functions involved in cell growth and survival. TAK-228 specifically targets a type of protein that can make chemicals that trigger cell growth, including cancer cell growth. This protein may also cause cells to produce proteins that trigger the development of new blood vessels. Cancers need new blood vessels in order to grow. In some types of cancer, this type of protein (mTOR) is switched on, and it makes the cancer cells grow and produce new blood vessels. mTOR blockers (inhibitors) are a newer type of cancer growth blocker that can stop the growth of some types of cancer. Researchers hope to learn how participants with previously treated mRCC will respond to treatment with TAK-228. Other goals of this study include assessing the types of side effects associated TAK-228 and whether there is a relationship between certain genetic mutations (changes to your DNA) and participant responses to the drug.</detailed_description>

Fineneedle aspiration, brushings, cell pellet from pleural effusion, bone marrow aspirate/biopsy are not acceptable. Distant metastases specimens are preferred but if not available primary nephrectomy specimens are acceptable.

For women: Postmenopausal for at least 1 year before the screening visit, OR Surgically sterile, OR Agree to practice 1 effective method of contraception and 1 additional effective (barrier) method at the same time, from the time of signing the informed consent through 90 days (or longer, as mandated by local labeling [eg. USPI, SmPC, etc.] after the last dose of study drug, OR Agree to practice true abstinence, when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject (Periodic abstinence [e.g, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods] and withdrawal, spermicides only, and lactational amenorrhea are not acceptable methods of contraception. Female and male condoms should not be used together.) For men: Even if surgically sterilized (ie, status postvasectomy), they must agree to practice highly effective barrier contraception during the entire study treatment period and through 120 days after the last dose of study drug, OR Agree to practice true abstinence, when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject (Periodic abstinence [e.g, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods for the female partner] and withdrawal, spermicides only, and lactational amenorrhea are not acceptable methods of contraception.
