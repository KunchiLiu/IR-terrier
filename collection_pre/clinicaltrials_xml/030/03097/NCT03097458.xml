	<brief_summary>A parental cancer diagnosis challenges the family's stability and the parent-child relationship. It may impact the children's well-being, so that about one third of them develop clinically relevant levels of psychological distress. Psycho-oncological family-based counselling programs have been shown to elevate children's and parents' well-being. However, there is still a dearth of familial health services in Switzerland, which has also been recognized by the Swiss National Cancer Program (2011-2017). This study aims to implement and evaluate a short-term family counselling intervention at the Cancer Center of the University Hospital Basel. The primary objective of the study is the enhancement of adjustment to the parental cancer diagnosis. The study seeks secondary to determine the feasibility of the short-term counselling Intervention.</brief_summary>
