	<brief_summary>This is a clinical trial to evaluate the intravenous administration of indocyanine green (ICG) as a method of intra-thoracic lesion localization. The primary purpose is to determine if intravenous ICG allows us to identify intra-thoracic lesions.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intravenous Indocyanine Green for Localization of Intra-thoracic Lesions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- This study is designed to determine the safety and feasibility of intra-operative localization of thoracic lesions following intravenous injection of indocyanine green (ICG), determine if intravenous ICG leads to the intra-operative detection of intra-thoracic lesions or metastatic lymph nodes not readily identifiable on conventional diagnostic imaging modalities, and determine if intravenous ICG improves surgical resection. - At the time of surgery, the indocyanine dye will be injected intravenously. The investigators will use a dose of 0.5 mg/kg administered prior to VATS. - The "filtered" near-infrared light causes the indocyanine green dye to fluoresce so that the surgeon can identify the lesions most likely to contain tumor cells.The surgeon will also look at lymph nodes to see if metastatic disease can be found in this location using this technique. The lymph nodes are processed to look for metastasis.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients with intrathoracic lesions that require resection for therapeutic or diagnostic purposes as recommended by their thoracic surgeon. 18 years of age or older Documented, signed, dated informed consent obtained prior to any study specific procedures being performed Subjects who do not wish to have subsequent surgical resection A medical condition such as uncontrolled infection or cardiac disease that, in the opinion of the treating surgeon, makes resection unreasonably hazardous for the patient Preoperative spirometry that suggests the patient is at high risk or cannot undergo resection of the primary tumor.
