	<brief_summary>After discharge from hospital, the current healthcare system in Germany allows considerable flexibility (therefore complexity) of patient access and mobility between multiple care providers in the community setting. The investigators believe this aftercare could be better coordinated by a specialized coordinated stroke aftercare service. Comprehensive coordinated multidisciplinary care is a proven concept with proven benefits in both acute and rehabilitation care provided in stroke units and neurorehabilitation centres. In this study, the investigators postulate that a similar coordinated approach to care can be extended to the phase after in-patient rehabilitation has ended (i.e. "long-term management" as opposed to "early supported discharge") for disabled patients with stroke living in the community.</brief_summary>
