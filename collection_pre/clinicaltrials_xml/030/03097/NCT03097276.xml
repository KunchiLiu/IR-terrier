	<brief_summary>Anastomotic fistula is the most feared complication after surgical resection of colorectal cancer (CCR). It occurs in 6 to 15% of patients. Beyond the risk of death in the immediate postoperative period, the pain that it induces, the resources required for its management, the need for stomata with a negative impact on patients' quality of life and the prolongation of hospitalization, it also has a now-recognized adverse effect on long-term survival. The early detection of this complication may limit its impact. C-reactive protein (CRP) has proved to be an early, reliable marker of the onset of infectious complications of colorectal surgery. However, the diagnostic procedure to implement in these patients is not at all codified, since this population concerned by systematic CRP assay in the postoperative period is very recent. The procedures to implement in these patients so that they can obtain the maximal benefit of an early diagnosis have not yet been established. An algorithm for the proactive clinical management must be drawn up to be able to confirm or rule out the presence of a fistula as soon as a high level of CRP is detected, and to propose a quick treatment to ensure that patients benefit from this early diagnosis.</brief_summary>
