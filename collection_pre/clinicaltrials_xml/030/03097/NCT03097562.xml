	<brief_title>Wound Architecture and Functional Outcome After Cataract Surgery With Manual vs.Femtosecond Laser Assisted Procedures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Femtosecond laser cataract surgery offers several major advantages for wound construction, including high precision, repeatability and a large variety of corneal wound profiles. The aim of this study is the long term analysis of two types of FSL 3-plane corneal wound profiles, namely CT1 and CT2, CT2 being constructed with a reversed front corneal incision segment to ensure tigher wound closure and better corneal wound reapposition. The traditional manual wound performed with a standard keratome will be used as a reference. As FSL cataract surgery may be associated with a greater incidence of wound leaks at the end of surgery as compared to manual wound construction with keratomes, this study will also aim at determining wich clinical and OCT wound parameters are associated with a higher likelihood of wound leaks.</detailed_description>
