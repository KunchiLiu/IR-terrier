	<brief_summary>To analyze the effect of femtolaser-assisted keratotomy on corneal astigmatism (anterior, posterior and Total corneal refractive power) measured by Scheimpflug tomography after laser lens surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tomographic Analysis of Anterior, Posterior, Total Corneal Refractive Power Changes After Laser-assisted Keratotomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study investigated patients' eyes with low to moderate total corneal refractive power determined with Scheimpflug tomography (Pentacam HR) after penetrating femtosecond laser-assisted keratotomy (pFLAK) and laser lens surgery. The anterior corneal astigmatism, posterior corneal astigmatism and total corneal refractive power were determined before, 1 month and 3 months after lens surgery. Vector analysis according to the Alpins' method was used to calculate surgically induced astigmatism (SIA).</detailed_description>
