	<brief_summary>The presentation of IBD in early childhood is uncommon and the monogenetic defects, especially IL-10 signaling pathway play a key role in very early onset inflammatory bowel disease (VEO-IBD). IL-10 or IL-10R deficiency associated VEO-IBD is considered a rare disorder. To date, there were about 60 cases were reported all over the word. But in our Chinese VEO-IBD Collaboration Group, 42 patients with biallelic mutations affecting IL10R genes were identified from 93 VEO-IBD patients, and the mutation sites are highly concentrated, including 83.9% (26/31) with p.R101W and 55% p.T179T (17/31) mutation, and the proportion of patients from Henan( A province of China) is higher. So we speculate that IL-10RA mutation may not be very rare, and the frequency of heterozygote subjects might be higher than suspected.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Epidemiological Screening of IL10RA Mutation Rate in China</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1. The mutation rates of p.R101W and p.T179T IL10RA in Henan newborn. 2. Is there any clinical symptoms in children with IL-10RA-deficient? and the onset of the symptoms. 3. Whether the intestinal permeability is normal in heterozygote subjects.</detailed_description>
