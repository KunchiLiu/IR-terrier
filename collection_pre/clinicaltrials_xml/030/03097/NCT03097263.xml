	<brief_summary>Despite the prevalence of chronic low back pain, functional symptomatology of this disease remains poor and treatment decisions are based mainly on subjective data (importance and pain tolerance). However, there are some experimental elements that involve objective assessment of locomotor capabilities - at forefront objectives which the walking velocity in the evaluation of this pathology in terms of severity of functional impairment. Recent evidence suggest the effectiveness of physical rehabilitation program for improving patients functional capacities and their reintegration in socio-professional life. This retrospective study aims to quantify the evolution of the parameters collected during standardized walking tests performed before and after rehabilitation program. These patients have systematically carry out a comfortable walk test (400m walk test) and a brisk walk test (200m) at the beginning and end of their program. Furthermore, a maximal stress test on a treadmill was performed before the program in order to detect any cardiovascular events and to allow the personalization of the effort level required (target heart rate) during rehabilitation. In this study the evolution of the comfortable and fast speed will be collected and compared with the stress test data, and other measured parameters (functional score of Quebec, muscle Tests Shirado and Sorensen).</brief_summary>
