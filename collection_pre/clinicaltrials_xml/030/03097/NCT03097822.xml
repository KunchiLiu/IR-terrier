	<brief_title>Response Prediction After GKS in Patients With Vestibular Schwannoma Using DCE MR Imaging</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the response of Gamma Knife Surgery to Ktrans, Ve, and Vp, which are indicators of permeability map obtained from dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) MRI in patients with vestibular schwannoma .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients with vestibular schwannoma, who underwent gamma knife surgery and preop dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) MRI Patients with vestibular schwannoma, who received consent In addition to the vestibular schwannoma, if the brain has other underlying or systemic disease During the observation period, other treatments were performed other than gamma knife surgery If patients have a contraindication to MRI (eg, pacemaker, cochlear implants, hemodynamically unstable) Concomitant use of gadolinium MRI contrast agents (eg, renal insufficiency [glomerular filtration rate &lt;30 ML / min]), or if there was a side effect when using a contrast medium. Adults with impaired ability to cope If the images and medical records required for this study are not available or are not appropriate</criteria>
