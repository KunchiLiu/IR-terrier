	<brief_summary>The overall aim of this study is to investigate whether a diet rich in rye fiber from wholegrain rye, compared to refined wheat, as part of a hypocaloric diet leads to larger weight loss and lower body fat content after 12 weeks of intervention. Furthermore the study will investigate the effect on appetite as a potential underlying mechanism for differences in weight loss and body fat reduction.</brief_summary>
