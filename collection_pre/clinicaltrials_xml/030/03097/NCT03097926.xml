	<brief_summary>The aim of this study was to determine if Biliopancreatic Diversion with Duodenal Switch (BPD-DS) with a longer strict alimentary limb at the expense of a shorter biliopancreatic limb will offer significant weight lost, but with lesser gastrointestinal complaints, protein deficiency, vitamin and trace element deficit compared to standard BPD-DS.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Duodenal Switch With a Standard Versus Long Alimentary Limb</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This two-group, randomized, single-blind pilot study is conducted in a university-affiliated tertiary care center. The study protocol was approved by our ethic committee. Enrollment and randomization of the patients occurred between May 20163 and June 2015. Patients are undergoing follow-up evaluation. Patients were initially referred to our center for a bariatric surgery evaluation. Eligible patients were 18 years of age or older and met the criteria for a laparoscopic biliopancreatic diversion. Patients were excluded if they had a BMI ≥ 50 mg/m², a pacemaker, cirrhosis or if they were planing pregnancy in the next 2 years. Each patient was required to provide written informed consent. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to undergo a standard biliopancreatic diversion (control group) or a modified biliopancreatic diversion with a longer strict alimentary limb (study group). A sealed envelope with the assignation was given to the surgeon in the operation room just before the procedure. Patients are followed every 6 months after surgery, up to 24-months for clinical evaluation, resolution of comorbidities, evaluation of side-effects, quality of life, bioimpedance testing and bloodwork.</detailed_description>
