	<brief_summary>This phase II trial studies the baseline safety and efficacy of NEPA (Netupitant/Palonosetron) for prevention of chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting in patients receiving BEAM (carmustine, etoposide, cytarabine, and melphalan) conditioning regimen prior to Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT). Both netupitant and palonosetron hydrochloride are anti-nausea and anti-emetic agents. NEPA is a recently approved combination antiemetic, containing fixed doses of netupitant (an neurokinin 1 (NK1) receptor antagonist) and palonosetron (a 5-hydroxytryptamine 3 (5HT3) receptor antagonist). Having pharmacologically distinct mechanisms, combined NEPA offers synergistic reduction and potential elimination of CINV</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Study of Netupitant/Palonosetron (NEPA) for Prevention of Chemotherapy Induced Nausea and Vomiting Before HSCT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the efficacy of NEPA to prevent nausea and vomiting both during and after a highly emetogenic (BEAM) conditioning regimen for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). The efficacy is measured by Complete Response (CR) defined as no emesis and no rescue therapy for hours 0-240 (6 days of chemotherapy and 4 days post chemotherapy). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: II. To differentiate response to NEPA over different phases of chemotherapy-induced nausea. Specifically, CR is assessed for hours 0-144 (Acute phase) and hours 145-240 (delayed phase), and Complete Protection (CP) defined as CR plus no nausea is assessed for hours 0-144, 145-240, and the whole period. OUTLINE: This regimen is a 6-day therapy course with high dose (and highly emetogenic) chemotherapy on day 1 and 6 with lower risk chemotherapy for acute emesis on days 2 through 5. Our plan is to dose NEPA on days 1, 3, and 6 to cover the complete course of therapy and continue to monitor for 4 days after to assess for control of delayed CINV as well as acute. Treatment will be administered on an inpatient basis. Patients will receive NEPA 300 mg/0.5 mg PO will be administered 60 minutes prior to chemotherapy on Day 1, Day 3. and Day 6. Dexamethasone 12 mg PO will be given 1 hour prior to chemotherapy on Day 1 and 8 mg PO will be given on each additional day of conditioning chemotherapy (Days 2 through 6). Dexamethasone will only be given on days that chemotherapy is received. BEAM HSCT chemotherapy conditioning regimen: Carmustine 300 mg/m2 IV on Day 1, Etoposide 200 mg/m2/day IV days 2 through 5, Cytarabine 400 mg.m2/day IV on days 2 through 5 and Melphalan 140 mg/m2 IV on day 6 MAINTENANCE: Patients will be monitored for 4 days after completion of therapy to assess for control of delayed CINV as well as acute. Patients will be followed 14 days after receiving their last dose of NEPA for potential adverse events.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects must be undergoing autologous or allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplant (HSCT) with the BEAM conditioning regimen prior to HSCT Age &gt;= 18 years. Both men and women and members of all races and ethnic groups will be included Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status =&lt; 2 Able to swallow oral medications Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document. be followed 14 days after receiving their last dose of NEPA for potential adverse events Subjects with known hypersensitivity or other allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar biologic composition to netupitant, palonosetron, dexamethasone, or other agents used in the study Subjects who are receiving any other investigational agents or have received another investigational drug in the last 30 days Subjects who have had emesis or required antiemetics in the 48 hours prior to starting the BEAM conditioning regimen. Also patients required to take antipsychotics, appetite stimulants, or other medications with antiemetic effects will be excluded if those medications cannot be replaced by therapeutic equivalents Female subjects who are pregnant, have a positive serum Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG), or are lactating and intend to breast feed a child. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because hematopoietic stem cell transplant conditioning regimens including the BEAM regimen have the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. NEPA itself is Pregnancy Class C. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with NEPA, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with NEPA. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study HIVpositive subjects on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with NEPA. In addition, these subjects are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrowsuppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in subjects receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated Subjects who have taken a neurokinin antagonist within 14 days prior to beginning the BEAM regimen Subjects who have a serum creatinine &gt; 2 x upper limit of normal (ULN) Subjects with severe renal failure or End stage renal disease (estimated GFR (glomerular filtration rate) of &lt; 30 mL/Min) as estimated by the CockcroftGault formula Subjects with severe hepatic insufficiency (Child Pugh score &gt;9) Subjects who have been drinking &gt; 5 alcoholic drinks daily for the last year Subjects who have concurrent illness requiring systemic corticosteroid use other than the planned dexamethasone during conditioning therapy. Subjects with gastrointestinal conditions which might result in malabsorption of the study drug Subjects with a history of anxietyinduced ("anticipatory") nausea and vomiting Subjects on strong Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP 3A4) inducers or inhibitors who are unable to have those agents replaced with clinical alternatives prior to beginning the study. Length of washout period will be 7 days. Notably, in the case of allogeneic transplant recipients requiring cyclosporine or tacrolimus, no empiric dose adjustments will be required due to close level monitoring and adjustments, which are standard in Oregon Health &amp; Science University (OHSU) protocols Subjects unable to discontinue benzodiazepines will not be allowed as hypnotics. Additional antiemetics will be allowed for rescue but not for prophylaxis Subjects with personal or family history of QT prolongation, uncorrected electrolyte abnormalities, congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmia, conduction disturbances and those taking antiarrhythmic medicinal products or other medicinal products that lead to QT prolongation or electrolyte abnormalities. Relevant information will be collected during medical history taking</criteria>
