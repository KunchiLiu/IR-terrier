	<brief_summary>In this open-label, randomized, prospective clinical trial, nucleophosmin-1(NPM1) mutated acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients who have reached CR are randomized into two groups.The control group receive high-dose cytarabine(HDAC) regimen while the experimental group receive high dose of cytarabine plus tretinoin(ATRA) and arsenic trioxide(ATO) treatment.The safety and efficacy of ATRA and ATO is evaluated.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of ATO Plus ATRA in Nucleophosmin-1 Mutated Acute Myeloid Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this open-label, randomized, prospective clinical trial, NPM1- mutated AML patients who have reached CR are randomized into two groups. In experimental group, patients receive cytarabine at a dose of 3g/㎡/d on the first, third and fifth day, ATRA at a dose of 30mg/㎡/d on day 1-14 and ATO at a dose of 0.15mg/kg/d (maximum, 10mg/d) on day 1-14. Patients in control group only receive high dose of cytarabine. The safety and efficacy of ATRA plus ATO regimen is evaluated.The primary outcome is relapse-free survival rate after treatment.</detailed_description>
