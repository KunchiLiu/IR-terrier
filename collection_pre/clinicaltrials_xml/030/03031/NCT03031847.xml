	<brief_summary>This pilot will enroll 50 HF patients (age ≥ 80 years) undergoing CRT device implantation at the hospitals of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Duke University, Ohio State University, and the VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System. Patients will be randomized to CRT-P versus CRT-D and followed until study end. Rates of patient screening, enrollment, randomization, and retention as well as cost of care will be examined. The results of this pilot study will inform the design of a large pivotal non-inferiority trial and will be necessary for its success. Patients who refuse participation in the randomized pilot trial will be asked to enroll in a prospective observational cohort. Characteristics of patients who choose CRT-P vs. CRT-D will be compared and patients' level of satisfaction with their device decision will be measured.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cardiac Resynchronization in the Elderly</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal of this study is to pilot test a randomized, controlled, non-inferiority trial comparing the survival and quality of life (QOL) of older patients receiving cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) pacemaker (CRT-P) versus defibrillator (CRT-D) therapy. This pilot will enroll 50 HF patients (age ≥ 80 years) undergoing CRT device implantation at the hospitals of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Duke University, Ohio State University, and the VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System. Patients will be randomized to CRT-P versus CRT-D and followed until study end. Rates of patient screening, enrollment, randomization, and retention as well as cost of care will be examined. The results of this pilot study will inform the design of a large pivotal non-inferiority trial and will be necessary for its success. Patients who refuse participation in the randomized pilot trial will be enrolled and followed as part of a prospective observational cohort. Characteristics of patients who choose CRT-P vs. CRT-D will be compared and patients' level of satisfaction with their device decision will be measured.</detailed_description>
