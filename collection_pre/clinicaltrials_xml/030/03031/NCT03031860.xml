	<brief_title>Semi-quantitative Cough Strength Score (SCSS)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients were evaluated for readiness to be weaned off mechanical ventilation. If they had completed an Spontaneous Breathing Trial (SBT) before extubation. To measure Semiquantitative Cough Strength Score (SCSS), the investigator will put the patients at 30° to 45°, measure SCSS, first. The investigator enhance the patient to cough with as much effort as, when the investigator disconnect the ventilator. The cough strength was scored from 0 to 5 as follows: 0 = no cough on command, 1 = audible movement of air through the endotracheal tube but no audible cough, 2 = weakly (barely) audible cough, 3 = clearly audible cough, 4 = stronger cough and 5 = multiple sequential strong coughs.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Patients who are ready to be weaned off mechanical ventilation after a successful spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) Age : 1865 yrs Mechanical ventilation more than 24hrs Glasgow Coma Scale:1215 excluded those patients who were less than 18 years old patients had experienced less than 24hrs of mechanical ventilation. Patients who had undergone tracheotomy before extubation Chronically ill patients (Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients, lung cancer )</criteria>
