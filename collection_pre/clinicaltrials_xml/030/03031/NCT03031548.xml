	<brief_summary>Chest X-ray and/or fluoroscopy is not routinely used in the OR to confirm endotracheal tube (ETT) placement by anesthesiologists. Multiple studies have shown that ~19% of all intubations result in inappropriate ETT placement. An adult study has shown that ultrasound point-of-care is superior to auscultation in determining the location of ETT. This study aims to determine if point-of-care is useful in determining ETT position in children.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients scheduled to have a procedure in the cardiovascular laboratory where fluoroscopy is routinely used will also undergo a point-of-care ultrasound exam to determine endotracheal tube position. An anesthesiologist will perform the ultrasound exam.</detailed_description>
