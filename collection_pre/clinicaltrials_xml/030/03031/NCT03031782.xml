	<brief_summary>This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, event-driven randomized withdrawal study to investigate the efficacy and safety of secukinumab treatment in the Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) categories of Juvenile Psoriatic Arthritis (JPsA) and Enthesitis-related Arthritis (ERA). The study is divided into 3 parts (plus a post-treatment follow-up period) consisting of open-label, single-arm active treatment in Treatment Periods 1 and 3 and a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, event-driven withdrawal design in Treatment Period 2.</brief_summary>
