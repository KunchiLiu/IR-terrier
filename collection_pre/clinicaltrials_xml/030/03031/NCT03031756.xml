	<brief_summary>The aim of this clinical study was to evaluate the clinical efficacy of using perio flow adjunctively with mechanical instrumentation on periodontal parameters and halitosis. Sixty patients who presented with 4-6-mm probing pocket depth (PPD) were recruited for the study. Patients were randomly assigned to glycine powder air-polishing (GPAP) or control groups. For both groups PPDscores were recorded at the baseline and 1 month. Volatile sulphur compound (VSC) values were measured by a halimeter at the baseline, immediately after treatment, and at 7 days, 14 days and 1 month.</brief_summary>
