	<brief_summary>Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is the most common peripheral entrapment neuropathy with involving compression of the median nerve in the carpal tunnel. Rather than other progressive disease, CTS is characterized by remission and recurrence. The hydrodissection could decrease the entrapment of nerve to restore blood supply. Despite the hydrodissection was pervasively used in clinical practice, current researches contain small participant without control group or randomized leading to foreseeable selection bias. The investigators design a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial to assess the effect of different method of ultrasound-guided hydrodissection in patients with CTS.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>After obtaining written informed consent, patients with bilateral CTS will been randomized into intervention and control group. Participants in short-axis group received one-dose ultrasound-guided hydrodissection with short-axis approach and long-axis group received one-dose ultrasound-guided injection with long-axis approach. No additional treatment after injection through the study period. The primary outcome is visual analog scale (VAS) and secondary outcomes include Boston Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Questionnaire (BCTQ), cross-sectional area (CSA) of the median nerve, sensory nerve conduction velocity of the median nerve, and finger pinch strength. The evaluation was performed pretreatment as well as on the 2nd week, 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 6th month after the treatment.</detailed_description>
