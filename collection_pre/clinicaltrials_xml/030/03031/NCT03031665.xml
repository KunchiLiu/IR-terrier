	<brief_summary>Using an innovative multi-modal imaging approach, this study investigates the role of the neurochemical gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), brain activity, as well as hormones in understanding sex differences in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). Further, the investigators will link these markers to symptoms of depression.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sex, Hormones and Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid (GABA) in Stress Induced Anhedonia in Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goals of this research are to investigate: (1) functional and neurochemical features associated with depression irrespective of clinical state; (2) moderating effects of hormones on stress circuitry in MDD; and (3) sex differences in symptoms. To this end, the study is enrolling adults with current depression and remitted depression, along with a control group of psychiatrically health adults. Participants will have an magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) exam involving multiple imaging techniques (functional, structural, spectroscopic) while performing computer-based tests. Additional questionnaires and tests will be done outside the scanner to assess current symptoms and hormone levels. The integration of laboratory-based measures of reward and stress sensitivity, with state-of-the-art imaging techniques and hormonal assessments promises to provide novel insights in the sex-dependent manifestation and pathophysiology of MDD.</detailed_description>
