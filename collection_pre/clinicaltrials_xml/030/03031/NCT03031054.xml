	<brief_summary>Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is the most common peripheral entrapment neuropathy with involving compression of the median nerve in the carpal tunnel. Rather than other progressive disease, CTS is characterized by remission and recurrence. The hydrodissection could decrease the entrapment of nerve to restore blood supply. In addition, the hyaluronic acid was proved to decrease adhension of soft tissue and nerve during operation. The investigators design a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial to assess the effect after ultrasound-guided hydrodissection with hyaluronic acid in patients with CTS.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect of Hyaluronic Acid for Carpal Tunnel Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After obtaining written informed consent, patients with bilateral CTS will been randomized into intervention and control group. Participants in intervention group received one-dose ultrasound-guided hydrodissection with hyaluronic acid and control side received one-dose ultrasound-guided injection with normal saline. No additional treatment after injection through the study period. The primary outcome is visual analog scale (VAS) and secondary outcomes include Boston Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Questionnaire (BCTQ), cross-sectional area (CSA) of the median nerve, sensory nerve conduction velocity of the median nerve, and finger pinch strength. The evaluation was performed pretreatment as well as on the 2nd week, 1st, 3rd, 6th month and one year after the treatment.</detailed_description>
