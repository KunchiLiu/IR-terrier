	<detailed_description>In this open-label, randomized, prospective clinical trial, CBF AML(including AML1-ETO or CBF-MYH11 mutated patients) patients who have reached CR are randomised into two groups and receive HDAC or high dose of cytarabine plus chidamide. In experimental group, patients receive cytarabine at a dose of 3g/㎡/d on the first, third and fifth day and chidamide at a dose of 20mg/d twice a week for 3 months.Patients in control group only receive cytarabine at the same dose. The safety and efficacy of chidamide is evaluated. The primary outcome is relapse-free survival rate after treatment.</detailed_description>
