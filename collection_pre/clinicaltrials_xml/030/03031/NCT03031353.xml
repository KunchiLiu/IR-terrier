	<brief_summary>Neonatal respiratory distress may occur in either term or preterm newborns with a higher relative risk in preterm, and whether born vaginally or through caesarean section, but in a higher percentage after elective caesarean section whose rate is rising. Prostaglandins may be given about one hour before an elective caesarean section after excluding the presence of contraindication to their use to decrease the neonatal respiratory diseases and thus, the number of children who suffered from bronchopulmonary dysplasia that occurs frequently in children who had previously TTN will diminish.</brief_summary>
