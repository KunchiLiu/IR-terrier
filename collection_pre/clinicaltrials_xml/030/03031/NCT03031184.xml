	<brief_summary>This clinical trial evaluates whether Mirtazapine or Carbamazepine are more effective than placebo in treating agitation in people with dementia. The trial will assess the safety, clinical and cost effectiveness of each treatment. Participants will be randomised to receive one of the treatments for 12 weeks and will be followed up for up to one year, in this blinded trial.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Mirtazapine or Carbamazepine for Agitation in Dementia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patient-centred care, without the use of medicines is offered as a first course of treatment for agitation in dementia. However, there is a need for second line treatments when these fail, at the moment antipsychotics are commonly prescribed, as very little research has been done in to safer alternative treatments. There are medicines available to treat agitation and/or aggression in dementia, but it is not clear which treatments work best. This research study has been designed to help answer this, by comparing 2 medicines with a placebo (a tablet designed to look like a medicine but that has no active medicine in it) to see if either are suitable for treating agitation in dementia. The medicines that will be tested are Mirtazapine and Carbamazepine. If participants and their family/carers agree to take part in this study, participants will be prescribed treatment for 12 weeks. Participants will then be followed up for 1 year after, with assessment sessions at 26 and 52 weeks. Participants taking part in this study will be randomly allocated to a treatment group (selected to their treatment group by chance). The study is blinded, so this means the participant's doctor and the research team will not know which treatment the participant has been taking until after the study has ended. This is necessary so that the trial is a fair test of which treatment works best, however it is possible to find out which medicine they are taking in the event of a medical emergency. The study is entirely voluntary and all participants wishing to join the study must complete an informed consent form (or if they lack capacity the participant's representative may do so on their behalf). Each participant must also have a nominated carer who consents to being questioned on aspects of the participant's dementia/care and their own experiences in caring for the participant. The investigators are aiming to recruit 471 patients to the study in total from 8 different regions across the UK.</detailed_description>
