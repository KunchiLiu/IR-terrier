	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to investigate the drug octreotide acetate in a new intranasal formulation and compare it to the FDA-approved subcutaneous (SC) injection formulation. The two octreotide acetate formulations will be evaluated following separate administrations for safety and tolerability including any side effects, the speed at which the drug is absorbed and eliminated in the body, and the ability of the drug to lower the levels of growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Intranasal Octreotide (DP1038) in Healthy Adult Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Octreotide is a synthetic octapeptide analog of naturally occurring somatostatin, with similar pharmacological effects but a longer duration of action. It inhibits the pathological secretion of GH from pituitary adenomas, and of serotonin and other hormones by tumors of the gastroenteropancreatic endocrine system. Currently, only injectable octreotide and somatostatin analogs have been approved, for the indications of acromegaly, carcinoid tumors, and vasoactive intestinal peptide tumors. DP1038, an intranasal formulation of octreotide, is being developed for the treatment of acromegaly, a rare chronic disorder arising from the overproduction of GH, predominantly by pituitary adenomas. Excess GH and associated IGF-1 levels are responsible for multiple symptoms (e.g., headache, tissue swelling, perspiration, joint pain) and significant comorbidities (e.g., diabetes, sleep apnea, cardiovascular abnormalities such as hypertension). In most patients with acromegaly, octreotide consistently normalizes GH and IGF-1 serum concentrations, thereby markedly reducing clinical symptoms.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Key eligibility criteria: Body mass index (BMI) 18 and &lt;28 kg/m2 (to minimize variability in SC absorption). Be in good general health. Use of any tobacco product within 30 days prior to first dose of study drug. Use of any prescription or nonprescription drugs or dietary supplements within 7 days, insulin or hypoglycemic drugs within 3 months, estrogencontaining medication within 3 months, or drugs that may affect GH and IGF1 levels (e.g., alphaadrenergic, betaadrenergic, and cholinergic drugs) within 1 month prior to dosing. Subjects will also be excluded if they have a history of gallbladder disease, hypothyroidism, or unexplained hypoglycemia.</criteria>
