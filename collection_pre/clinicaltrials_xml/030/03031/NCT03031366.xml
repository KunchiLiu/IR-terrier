	<brief_summary>TIPS creation has been widely used to treat the complications associated with portal hypertension. In association with increased operator experience and the ongoing development of imaging modalities, the rate of major complications associated with TIPS has decreased significantly in the past decades. However, the passage of a curved needle from the hepatic vein into the portal vein still remains a challenging and time-consuming part of the procedure and is associated with puncture-related complications that are potentially fatal.Three-dimensional roadmap guidance has been widely applied in various interventions. The aim of the present study is to prospectively assess the feasibility and efficacy of real-time 3D roadmap guidance during TIPS creation.</brief_summary>
