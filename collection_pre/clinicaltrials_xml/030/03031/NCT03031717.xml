	<brief_summary>Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) is defined as an obstruction of the portal vein. The prevalence of PVT is 10-25% and incidence is about 16% in cirrhotic patients. PVT leads to increased intrahepatic resistance, decreased portal velocities, splanchnic vasodilatation, and stagnant flow. Portal vein recanalization (PVR) with transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) is aimed at restoring main portal vein (PV) flow in chronic PVT. In this study, we will review the safety and outcomes of this approach.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Follow-up and Survival of Cirrhotic and Non Cirrhotic Patients With Portal Vein Thrombosis Treated With Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) is a fairly common complication of liver cirrhosis. Importantly, occlusive PVT might influence the prognosis of patients with cirrhosis. Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) has been reported to be an effective treatment of PVT in cirrhosis, with the advantage of avoiding the risk of bleeding linked to anticoagulation. In this study, we will evaluate the outcome of TIPS for PVT in patients with and without cirrhosis and determinate survival.</detailed_description>
