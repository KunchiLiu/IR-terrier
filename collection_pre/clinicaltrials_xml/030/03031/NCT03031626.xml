	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to determine if treatment with Medical Air (21% oxygen in room air) compared to supplemental oxygen (100% oxygen) will lead to similar improvements in the central apnea-hypopnea index (CAHI) for infants with Prader-Willi Syndrome. Despite the vast amount of research investigating the cause of central sleep apnea, there remain gaps in knowledge, lending to further research efforts. The decision to compare oxygen to medical air is based on several theorized mechanisms. The first of which is the supposition that provision of medical air may act as an arousal stimulus for the hypothalamus, thereby preventing sleep disordered breathing. Secondly, the hypercapnic challenge performed by Livingston et al demonstrated a delayed hypercapneic arousal response in PWS subjects despite simultaneous hyperoxia, leading us to question if therapeutic oxygen really plays a significant role in treating CSA. Lastly, the delivery of medical air via nasal prongs may provide sufficient arousal to terminate the cycle of events leading to central apnea, as described by Urquhart et al. A deeper understanding of central sleep apnea is essential to ameliorating its adverse sequelae, which include symptoms of ADHD, impaired attention, behavioral problems, and academic difficulties.</brief_summary>
