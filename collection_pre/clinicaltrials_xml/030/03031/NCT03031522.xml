	<brief_summary>The investigators developed 18F-IRS as a targeted molecular imaging agent for noninvasive and repeatable detecting EGFR-activating mutational status.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>EGFR Molecular Classification In Vivo</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal of investigators were to evaluate the use of 18F-IRS as a novel PET/CT radiotracer to monitor EGFR-activating mutational status and identify EGFR-TKIs benefit NSCLC patients. the investigators want to evaluated the use of 18F-IRS in lung cancer imaging in adult NSCLC patients with different EGFR mutational status of primary and metastatic cancers.</detailed_description>
