	<brief_summary>A 2 week randomized (1:1:1), controlled, double-masked, parallel group, pre-market study. Patients with ocular discomfort following refractive surgery procedure (within 6 months from enrollment into the investigation) will be evaluated at baseline (Day 1), at Week 2 (day 15±2 days) and at Week 3 follow-up visit (day 22±2, or early exit).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A 2 Weeks Study to Evaluate Tolerability, Safety, Permanence on the Ocular Surface and Efficacy of Two Concentrations of Lubricin Eye Drops Versus Sodium Hyaluronate 0.18% Eye Drops in Patients With Ocular Discomfort Following Refractive Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Thirty (30) patients (10 per arm) randomized 1:1:1 to Lubricin 20 µg/ml eye drops solution or Lubricin 50 µg/ml eye drops solution or sodium hyaluronate (HA) 0.18% eye drops solution will be enrolled. As the primary objective of this study is to evaluate the tolerability and safety of Lubricin (20 and 50 μg/mL) eye drops solution administered over 2 weeks in patients with ocular discomfort following ocular refractive surgery, sample size was calculated based on clinical feasibility and no formal sample size calculation has been performed.</detailed_description>
