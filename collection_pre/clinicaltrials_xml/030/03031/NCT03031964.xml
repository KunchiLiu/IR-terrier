	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate patients receiving a multihole revision acetabular implant for total hip arthroplasty (THA) and will be followed for 10 years to collect data on survivorship of the implanted prosthesis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Survivorship, Radiographic, and Functional Outcomes of the Multihole Revision Acetabular Cup</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Data will be collected preoperatively, and at the standard of care (SOC) office visits at 4 weeks, 1 year, 2 years, 5 years and 10 years postoperatively. The research coordinator at each site will identify, recruit, and prospectively follow the 60 patients at his/her site. Patient demographics (e.g., age, gender, body mass index (BMI)), comorbidities, reason for revision, Paprosky classification, native femoral head measurement (mm) etc. will be collected preoperatively. The study coordinator will contact patients prior to each visit to ensure patient compliance. At each visit, A-P and cross-lateral radiographic evaluation (i.e., use of Engh classification to quantify osteolysis/loosening) will occur. In addition, patients will be assessed for any complications (e.g., dislocation, emergency department visits, infection, reoperation, etc.). Patients will complete the Hip disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (HOOS) and Veterans Rand 12 (VR-12) forms (including a specific question regarding groin pain) and a pain assessment. In the event that a patient has relocated and/or refuses to return to the office for the 5-year visit, a script will be sent to the patient to have x-rays done and sent to the PI, and questionnaires will be mailed. All data will be entered and maintained in RedCap.</detailed_description>
