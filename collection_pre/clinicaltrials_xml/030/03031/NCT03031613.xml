	<brief_title>Effects of PEEP on Intracranial and Intraocular Pressure in Robot-assisted Laparoscopic Radical Prostatectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Application of PEEPmay reduce pulmonary complication following RALRP. Meanwhile, it may increase ICP and IOP, which has been debated for decades. Moreover, Trendelenburg position and pneumoperitoneum, which are mandatory for RALRP, may augment elevation of ICP and IOP. This study aims to investigate the effects of PEEP on the ICP and IOP in patients undergoing RALRP.</detailed_description>
