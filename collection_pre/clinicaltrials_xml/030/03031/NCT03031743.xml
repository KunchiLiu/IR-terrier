	<brief_summary>This is a nested case-control study within an ongoing rotavirus vaccine immunogenicity trial in Karachi, Pakistan. The primary study aim is to compare the fecal microbiota composition and diversity of infants who do (control) and do not (case) demonstrate immune seroconversion to rotavirus vaccination. The infants will be matched for vaccination dose, age and breast-feeding practices.</brief_summary>
