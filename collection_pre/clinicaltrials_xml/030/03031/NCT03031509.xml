	<brief_title>Treatment of Nonunion of Limb Fracture With Human Amniotic Epithelial Cells（hAECs）</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this study, patients of nonunion after limb fracture will be treated with human amniotic epithelial cells. Clinical and radiological assessment is performed. hAECs developing from the epiblast as early as 8 days after fertilization, recent data reported indicate that hAECs possess proper osteogenic differentiation potential and a localized modulatory influence on the early tissue remodeling process, making these cells a promising stem cell source for bone regeneration after fractures.</detailed_description>
