	<detailed_description>This will be a prospective study of cirrhotics and healthy controls comparing their oral microbiota, endotoxemia and systemic inflammation at baseline and at 10 and 30 days after clinically indicated systematic oral cleansing and interventions as well as 3-month and 6 month hospitalizations post-cleaning. The investigators will recruit cirrhotic subjects and age- matched healthy controls from the hepatology clinics. Subjects will be informed regarding the study and will give the investigators a written informed consent. After informed consent and evaluation of eligibility, subjects will be asked to complete an oral health questionnaire and sample collection during the recruitment visit. Patients will then be scheduled for a dental exam during a separate screening visit up to 7 days after this recruitment visit at the Dental Clinics. At this time patients will undergo cognitive testing consisting of a validated cognitive battery of PHES (psychometric hepatic encephalopathy score) and EncephalApp stroop. During dental exam which will be done during screening visit, the subject will undergo comprehensive oral evaluation which will include dental xrays (as needed) which are part of the study, periodontal examination (determination of pocket depth, clinical attachment levels, bleeding on probing, plaque index) and recording of caries and oral soft tissue lesions. Dental cleaning is part of the study protocol and not intended to fully treat the patient's periodontal and dental diseases. Therefore no follow-up dental visits will be scheduled in the dental clinics after completion of dental cleanings. The patients who do not qualify for the study will be informed of the findings by the dental professionals and subsequently the patients need to make arrangements for their dental treatment needs. Based on their oral health status, the subjects will then be assigned into two groups as healthy (healthy or mild gingivitis) or periodontally diseased (mild to moderate chronic periodontitis). The study will include four groups of subjects (Group 1: controls without periodontitis; Group 2: controls with periodontitis, Group 3: cirrhotics without periodontitis; Group 4: cirrhosis and periodontitis) Subjects will then be scheduled for dental cleaning which could occur over 1 or 2 visits as determined during the screening exam. Before the initiation of oral therapy, plaque and gingival crevicular samples will be collected for microbiota. The subjects in periodontitis group will receive deep dental cleanings (scaling and root planing) and oral hygiene instructions as per clinical indication. The periodontally healthy subjects will receive mild dental cleaning (prophylaxis) and oral hygiene instructions as clinically indicated. Subjects will then be followed at day 10 and day 30 at which point stool, saliva and blood samples for the similar analyses as before will be collected. There will be no more dental examinations after the initial assessment and treatment. We will repeat the cognitive testing at day 30 using alternate forms of the same cognitive tests. The investigators will also follow them for up to 6 months post-cleaning for hospitalizations using active chart review and follow-up</detailed_description>
