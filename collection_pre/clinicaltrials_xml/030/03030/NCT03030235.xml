	<brief_summary>The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of dapagliflozin, as compared with placebo, on heart failure, disease specific biomarkers, symptoms, health status and quality of life in patients with type 2 diabetes or prediabetes and chronic heart failure with preserved systolic function.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dapagliflozin in Type 2 Diabetes or Pre-diabetes, and PRESERVED Ejection Fraction Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A 12-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the effects of once-daily dapagliflozin 10 mg on heart failure disease-specific biomarkers (NTproBNP and BNP), symptoms, health status, and quality of life in patients with type 2 diabetes or prediabetes and chronic heart failure with preserved systolic function. An imaging substudy will also be conducted to explore the effects of dapagliflozin vs. placebo on various echocardiographic parameters.</detailed_description>

Hemoglobin A1c &lt;5.7 or &gt;11% at the screening visit 5. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &lt; 30 at the screening visit 6. Admission for an acute coronary syndrome (STelevation MI, nonSTelevation MI, or unstable angina), percutaneous coronary intervention, or cardiac surgery within 60 days prior to the screening visit. 7. Admission for cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) within 90 days prior to the screening visit 8. Planned cardiovascular revascularization (percutaneous intervention or surgical) or major cardiac surgery (coronary artery bypass grafting, valve replacement, ventricular assist device, cardiac transplantation, or any other surgery requiring thoracotomy, or transcatheter aortic valve replacement) or CRT within the 90 days after the screening visit. 9. Participation in any interventional clinical trial (with an investigational drug or device) that is not an observational registry within 30 days of the screening visit. 10. History of hypersensitivity to dapagliflozin 11. For women of childbearing potential: Current or planned pregnancy or currently lactating. 12. Life expectancy &lt;1 year at the screening visit 13. Patients who are volume depleted based upon physical examination at the time of the screening or randomization visit 14. BNP &lt;100 pg/mL and NTproBNP&lt;300 pg/mL at the screening visit. For patients with permanent atrial fibrillation exclusion thresholds will be BNP&lt;125 pg/mL and NTproBNP&lt;500pg/mL. 15. Patients currently being treated with any SGLT2 inhibitor (dapagliflozin, canagliflozin, empagliflozin) or having received treatment with any SGLT2 inhibitor within the 12 weeks prior to the screening visit. 16. Average supine systolic BP &lt;100 mmHg at the screening or randomization visit 17. Past or current history of bladder cancer 18. Active Hematuria 19.
