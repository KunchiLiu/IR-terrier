	<criteria>1. Age ≥18 years 2. NYHA (New York Heart Association) class III or IV 3. Ongoing management of heart failure according to ESC (European Society of Cardiology) guidelines during previous ≥6 months 4. Symptomatic heart failure resulting in at least one hospitalization in the past 12 months 5. Absence of significant (more than moderate) valvular disease (AS(Aortic stenosis), MS (Mitral valve stenosis), MR) 6. Control of arrhythmia with heart rate &lt;90bpm 7. Life expectancy of at least 1 year 8. The patient or his/her legal representative should have the ability to fluently speak and understand the language in which the study is being conducted 9. Written, informed consent by the patient for participation in the study and agreement to comply with the followup schedule 10. Patient has had a successful Balloon Atrial Septostomy (BAS) procedure and is in a stable hemodynamic state, as assessed by the investigator Echo data: 11. LVEF (Left ventricular ejection fraction) ≤ 55% 12. Elevated left ventricular filling pressure documented by Either Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) or left ventricular enddiastolic pressure at rest ≥15 mmHg and greater than central venous pressure (CVP) Or: Endexpiratory PCWP ≥25 mmHg at exercise and CVP &lt;20 mm Hg 13. Transseptal catheterization and femoral vein access is determined to be feasible 14. Local or generalized sepsis or other acute infection(s) 15. Any coagulation disorder, if clinically relevant in the opinion of the operator. 16. Known Allergy to nickel and/or titanium and/or nickel/titaniumbased materials, if not medically manageable. 17. Allergy to antiplatelet, coagulant, or thrombotic therapy, if not medically manageable 18. Intolerance to contrast agents, if not medically manageable 19. Participation in another medical trial testing a therapy less than 30 days before the intended AFR implantation procedure 20. Transoesophageal echocardiography and / or use of general anaesthetic is contraindicated 21. Breast feeding women 22. Pregnancy (assessed in patients with child bearing potential by urine dip stick) 23. Occluded inferior vena cava access 24. History of ASD (Atrial septal defect) and/or atrial septal repair or closure device in place 25. Intracardiac thrombus 26. Patients who has unstable and intractable angina pectoris 27. Evidence of right heart failure defined as (by ECHO) Severe Right Ventricular Dysfunction (Tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) &lt; 14 mm) Severe Right Ventricular Dilatation ( Right ventrical (RV) volume ≥ left ventrical (LV) volume) Severe pulmonary hypertension (pulmonary arterial systolic pressure (PASP) &gt; 70 mm Hg) 28. Active malignancy 29. Severe valve disease, or implanted mechanical valve prosthesis 30. Congenital heart defect 31. Large Patent Foramen Ovale (PFO) with significant atrial septal aneurysm 32. Resting heart rate &gt;110 bpm 33. Inability to perform 6minutes walking test 34. Clinically relevant thrombocytopenia, thrombocytosis, leukopenia, or anemia 35. Symptomatic carotid artery disease 36. Mitral valve stenosis 37. Has any condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, might interfere with the implantation, might affect the patients wellbeing thereafter or might interfere with the conduct of the study 38. Systolic blood pressure of &gt;170 mmHg on 24 hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM), despite medical therapy 39. Severe lung disease.</criteria>
