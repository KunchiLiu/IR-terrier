	<brief_title>Alleviating Headache and Pain in GWI With Neuronavigation Guided rTMS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Headaches (HA) and wide spread pain are some of the most common debilitating symptoms in Gulf War Veterans (GWV) with Gulf War Illness (GWI). Migraine like HA and diffuse body pain were detected in 64% of GWV with GWI. This high prevalence of chronic HA and diffuse body pain conditions are often associated with neuropsychological dysfunction in mood, attention, memory and other systemic symptoms, which cast a profound negative impact on patients' quality of life. Unfortunately, conventional pharmacological treatments for GWI related headaches and pain (GWI-HAP) has not been shown to be effective and drugs such as narcotics contain many long term untoward psychosomatic and abusive side effects. Therefore, developing and validating non-invasive and low risk innovative treatment for this patient population is warranted. Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) is currently a US FDA approved treatment for major depression and migraine HA.</detailed_description>
