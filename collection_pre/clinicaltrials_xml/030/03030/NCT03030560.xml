	<brief_title>Postoperative Analgesia, Intravenous Lidocaine Infusion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, double blind and randomized study. Patients will be randomly allocated into two groups of equal size to receive either lidocaine infusion (lidocaine group/G1) or 0.9% saline infusion (control group/G2). Randomization will be performed using G1 and G2 registers, which will be placed in sealed envelopes prior to study initiation and opened prior to anesthesia by a physician who will prepare the intravenous solution and will identify it with the patient number, according to the envelope drawn. The solution was handed to another physician, blind to the prepared solutions' content, who will be responsible for the anesthesia. The solution volume was equal. The responsible investigator will remain blind to the chosen group until the end of the study. Lidocaine group patients (n = 20) will receive a loading dose of lidocaine 2 mg ̸ kg slowly IV just before induction of anesthesia, then the lidocaine infusion started at a rate of 3 mg ̸ kg/h, and control group patients (n = 20) will receive an equal volume of 0.9% saline (both the loading and the infusion), the infusion will be initiated at the time of induction of anesthesia and continued until the end of the operation.</detailed_description>
