	<brief_summary>The purpose of this Phase I/II study is to investigate the safety and tolerability (Phase I) and the efficacy/clinical benefits (Phase II, proof-of-concept) of ARGX-110 in combination with standard doses of azacytidine (AZA) in subjects with previously untreated acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or high risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) who are eligible for AZA treatment.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Signed ICF indicating an understanding of the purposes, risks, and procedures required for the study and willingness and ability to participate in the study 2. AML or high risk MDS (refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation; RAEB T) (according to 2008 World Health Organization (WHO) classification definition of ≥ 20% blasts) Note: Subjects can be rescreened if excluded based on the blast count previously 3. Age ≥ 18 years 4. Expected life expectancy ≥ 3 months, at the discretion of the investigator 5. ECOG performance status of 0, 1, or 2 1. Prior or concurrent malignancy, except for the following: adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, or any other cancer from which the subject has been diseasefree for more than 2 years 2. Any previous cancer chemo or radiotherapy (with the exception of hydroxyurea/Litalir® for leukocyte control which should be discontinued by the first day of AZA, local radiation therapy, therapy for basal cell carcinoma of the skin) 3. Treatment with any investigational product within 4 weeks before the first administration of ARGX110 4. Abnormal organ function defined as follows (any single parameter to fulfill condition): aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &gt; 3 x upper limit of normal (ULN); or in case of liver infiltration by AML, AST and/or ALT &gt; 5 x ULN Alkaline phosphatase (AP) &gt; 2.5 x ULN, or in case of liver infiltration by AML, AP &gt; 5 x ULN Serum (total) bilirubin &gt; 1.5 x ULN; or in case of liver infiltration by AML, serum (total) bilirubin &gt; 5 x ULN Serum creatinine &gt; 2.5 x ULN or GFR (MDRD) of &lt; 40 mL/min for subjects with creatinine levels above the normal limit. 5. Use of immunesuppressive agents for the past 4 weeks before the first administration of ARGX110 on Day 14. For regular use of systemic corticosteroids, subjects may only be included after stepwise discontinuation to be free of steroids for a minimum of 5 days before the first administration of ARGX110 6.
