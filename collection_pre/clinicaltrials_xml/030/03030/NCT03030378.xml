	<brief_summary>This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of pembrolizumab and recombinant interleukin-12 in treating patients with solid tumors. Monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Recombinant interleukin-12 may kill tumor cells by blocking blood flow to the tumor and by stimulating white blood cells to kill tumor cells. Giving pembrolizumab and recombinant interleukin-12 may work better in treating patients with solid tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pembrolizumab and Recombinant Interleukin-12 in Treating Patients With Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of recombinant human interleukin (rhIL)-12 in combination with pembrolizumab. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To observe and record anti-tumor activity. II. Evaluate the safety of the regimen by continuously monitoring adverse events that will be documented utilizing Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version (v).4. III. Evaluate the overall response rate (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] v.1.1) and the progression free survival of patients enrolled on the study. IV. Measure CD8+ T cell infiltration by immunohistochemistry in tumor biopsies obtained at baseline, after one week of rIL12 and after 2 cycles of pembrolizumab-IL12. V. Conduct exploratory translational laboratory correlative studies utilizing banked biospecimens (tumor and blood) obtained at baseline and during therapy. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of recombinant interleukin-12. Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Beginning 1 week before the start of course 1, patients receive recombinant interleukin-12 subcutaneously (SC) on days 2 and 5. Patients then receive recombinant interleukin-12 SC on days 2 and 5 of weeks 1 and 2. Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 3 years.</detailed_description>

in addition, for onstudy biopsies (after one week and after 7 weeks of initiating study therapy) and for baseline tumor biopsy if an archival tissue sample is not available: willingness to undergo mandatory biopsies; patients should have tumors deemed easily accessible for biopsies with low likelihood of complication Patients must have measurable disease based on RECIST 1.1 Women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation Female patients of childbearing potential should have a negative urine or serum pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study medication; if the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required Female patients of childbearing potential should be willing to use 2 methods of birth control or be surgically sterile, or abstain from heterosexual activity for the course of the study through 120 days after the last dose of study medication; patients of childbearing potential are those who have not been surgically sterilized or have not been free from menses for &gt; 1 year Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study participation, and 4 months after completion of pembrolizumab and/or rhIL12 administration Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document Patients who have had chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy, or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier Note: patients with =&lt;
