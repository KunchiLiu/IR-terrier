	<brief_summary>The objective of the ADDIA clinical Proof-of-Performance study is to validate the performance of ADDIA' blood biomarkers for diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. ADDIA clinical study is a multi-centre, non-interventional, prospective, proof-of-performance study with only one visit. About 800 well-characterized subjects will be recruited into 3 groups in 2:1:1 ratio, namely patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), patients with non-AD neurodegenerative disease (NAD) and 200 control subjects (healthy as compared to their age). - 400 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), - 200 patients with non-Alzheimer's neurodegenerative diseases (NAD), - 200 controls (healthy as compared to their age).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>For all groups: Male and female subjects, aged between 50 and 85 years. Signed and dated written informed consent obtained from the subject or the subject's legally acceptable representative (if applicable) in accordance with local regulations. AD, NAD patients and control subjects will be agematched and mean age similar in the three groups. Able to comply with all study procedures. For AD group: Diagnosis of AD Specific clinical phenotype of AD: Presence of an early and significant episodic memory impairment. Gradual and progressive change in memory function reported by patient or informant over more than 6 months. Objective evidence of an amnesic syndrome of hippocampal type, based on significantly impaired performance on an episodic memory test (Dubois et al, 2014). MMSE score of 25 21 in subjects with mild AD and &lt; 21 for patients with moderate to severe AD. FCSRT and MoCA tests compatible with AD diagnosis. Neuroimaging compatible with a diagnosis of AD: structural 3D MRI (volumes of hippocampus and cortical areas), other neuroimaging data (e.g. PET Amyloid scan and FDG PET) if practiced by clinical centres shall be compatible with AD diagnosis. Cerebrospinal fluid biomarker data showing positive levels of at least 2 out of 3 biomarkers, Aβ142, phosphorylatedTau and totalTau. For NAD group: Frontotemporal dementia: Diagnosis with behavioral variant FTD (bvFTD) according to Rascovsky et al., 2011. The following findings must be present: Criteria for possible bvFTD. Functional decline (Clinical Dementia Rating Scale or Functional Activities Questionnaire scores). Imaging results consistent with bvFTD [one of the following must be present]: Frontal and/or anterior temporal atrophy on MRI. Frontal and/or anterior temporal hypoperfusion or hypometabolism on PET or SPECT (if retrospective data available). Note: in case of familial form of bvFTD, the subject must be a member of family with a known mutation in one of the FRD related genes, MAPT, PGRN. Note: If taking acetylcholinesterase inhibitor and/or memantine treatments, the subject must have been taking such medication(s) for ≥3 months. MMSE &gt;21.MoCA and FCSRT tests performed. Neuroimaging: volumetric structural MRI finding compatible with bvFTD as above CSF biomarker data must show negative levels for all three or at least two out of three CSF biomarkers Aβ142, phosphorylatedTau and totalTau. Neuroimaging: volumetric structural MRI finding compatible with bvFTD as above. Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD): Subjects with Parkinson's Disease Dementia (PDD) with dementia after and not before developing Parkinson's disease (PD). PD is diagnosed by the 3 typical PD symptomatic findings: tremor, rigidity and slowed movement (bradykinesia). Note: Subjects with dementia and with LRRK2 gene mutation or with mutation in one of the following genes: PARK2 or SNCA, VPS35, PINK1, DJ1, ATP13A2, FBX07, SLC6A3, TAF1 are also included. LDOPA responsive. Cognitive scores: MMSE score 2125 for mild PDD; MMSE score &lt;21 for moderate to severe PDD. MoCA and FCSRT tests performed. Structural MRI: Evidence of relevant structural abnormality (i.e. basal ganglia for Parkinsonism and potentially mediotemporal or cortical findings that may be related to dementia). Retrospective Fluorodopa PET or SPECT data if available shall document the presence of dopaminergic dysfunction. CSF biomarkers showing negative levels of all three or at least two out of three CSF biomarkers: βamyloid 142, PhosphorylatedTau and TotalTau. Lewy body Dementia (DLB): DLB should be diagnosed when dementia occurs before or concurrently with Parkinsonism. Patients diagnosed with probable DLB according to two out of the following criteria: o Fluctuating cognition with pronounced variations in attention and alertness, o Recurrent visual hallucinations that are typically well formed and detailed, Spontaneous features of Parkinsonism, OR Patients diagnosed with probable DLB according to one out of the above criteria and one of the following criteria: REM sleep behaviour disorder, Severe neuroleptic sensitivity, Low dopamine transporter uptake in basal ganglia (SPECT or PET imaging). Note: familial forms caused by mutation in genes SNCA, SNCB of DLB can be included. MMSE score: 1025, MoCA and FCSRT tests performed. MRI: Relative preservation of medial temporal lobe structures. CSF biomarkers: negative levels of all three or at least two out of three CSF biomarkers: βamyloid 142, PhosphorylatedTau, TotalTau. Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP): Diagnosis of probable or possible PSP as defined by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke and Society for Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (NINDSSPSP) diagnostic criteria o Gradually progressive disorder, Onset at age 40 or later, Vertical (upward or downward gaze) supranuclear palsy and prominent postural instability with tendency to fall in the first year of disease onset, No evidence of other diseases that could explain the foregoing features, as indicated by mandatory exclusion criteria.
