	<brief_title>Reconstruction of the Bile Duct With the Round Ligament</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Classically, the bile duct defect after bile duct injury or resection is achieved by bilioenteric reconstruction. However bilioenteric anastomosis is associated with long term complications including intrahepatic bile ducts infection, specific complications related to the Roux en Y jejunal loop and eliminate the endoscopic access to intrahepatic bile ducts. The investigators had recently developed a new surgical technique to reconstruct the veins with the parietal peritoneum with excellent results. Accordingly the investigators decided to develop a new surgical technique in order to reconstruct the bile duct defects with the vascularized round ligament.</detailed_description>
