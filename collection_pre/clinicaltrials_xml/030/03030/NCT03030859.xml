	<brief_summary>This randomized pilot clinical trial studies how well the self-care program works in head and neck cancer survivors with lymphedema and fibrosis. A self-care program may promote self-care activities for managing chronic swelling and tough/tight tissues in the head and neck region.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Self-Care for Head and Neck Cancer Survivors With Lymphedema and Fibrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To complete development of a self-care program focusing on lymphedema and fibrosis (LEF) in head and neck cancer (HNC) survivors (LEF-self-care program [SCP]) with the goal of improving LEF associated outcomes when compared to usual care alone. (Stage I) II. To determine the feasibility of a program of LEF-SCP with or without follow-up to usual care for HNC survivors with LEF, specifically to: 1) obtain recruitment estimates and determine barriers to recruitment; 2) identify barriers to implementation; 3) assess safety; and 4) evaluate patient satisfaction. (Stage II) III. To determine if the LEF-SCP with or without follow-up enhances self-efficacy and adherence compared to usual care in HNC survivors with LEF. (Stage II) IV. To determine the preliminary efficacy of the LEF-SCP with or without follow-up as compared to usual care for the following outcomes: 1) LEF progression; 2) symptom burden; and 3) functional status. (Stage II) OUTLINE: STAGE I: Patients undergo a training session with the study lymphedema therapist and review the educational manual and videos for the development of all three components of the LEF self-care program. STAGE II: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 groups. GROUP I: Patients receive monthly automated system telephone call for 12 month. GROUP II: Patients undergo LEF-SCP training comprising of motivational interview (MI) session over 1 hour and LEF self-care training session over 1 hour weekly for 3 weeks. Patients receive monthly automated system telephone call for 12 months. Patients also review LEF self-care educational manual and watch self-care videos monthly or more frequently as needed. GROUP III: Patients undergo LEF-SCP training comprising of MI session over 1 hour and LEF self-care training session over 1 hour weekly for 3 weeks. Patients receive monthly automated system telephone call for 12 months. Patients review LEF self-care educational manual and watch self-care videos monthly or more frequently as needed. Patients also meet with the study lymphedema therapist over 1 hour at 3, 6, and 9 months. After completion of study, patients are followed up at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months.</detailed_description>
