	<brief_title>A Randomised Controlled Trial of Self-help Mindfulness-based Cognitive Therapy for Health Workers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a randomised controlled trial (RCT) examining the efficacy of a mindfulness-based cognitive therapy self-help book ('Mindfulness: A practice guide to finding peace in a frantic world') relative to a wait-list control, in healthcare staff. It builds on a previous pilot RCT (http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN16486066). A battery of measures will be administered at baseline (week 0), post-intervention (week 9) and follow-up (week 21). This trial is designed to test the following hypotheses. Primary Hypothesis -Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy self-help (MBCT-SH) participants, in comparison to waitlist control participants, will show a reduction in symptoms of stress by the end of MBCT-SH (week 9). Secondary Hypotheses - The improvement detailed in the primary hypothesis will be maintained at a follow-up 12 weeks after the end of the MBCT-SH (week 21). - MBCT-SH participants, in comparison to waitlist control participants, will show improvements in mindfulness, other-compassion, self-compassion, anxiety, depression, burnout and mental well-being by the end of MBCT-SH (week 9), and these improvements will be maintained at a follow-up 12 weeks after the end of the MBCT-SH (week 21). - MBCT-SH participants, in comparison to waitlist control participants, will show a reduction in the number of sickness absence days from the three months preceding the intervention to the three months following the intervention. - Increases in self-compassion and mindfulness from week 0 to week 9, will mediate the effects of MBCT-SH (relative to waitlist control) on levels of stress, depression, anxiety, wellbeing and burnout.</detailed_description>
