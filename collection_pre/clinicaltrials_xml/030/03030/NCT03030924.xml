	<detailed_description>This study is prospectively enrolling a cohort of adolescent patients who present to the Emergency Department with acute suicidality. The plan is to monitor basic physiologic parameters to assess for trends associated with suicidality noninvasively in an objective manner beyond subjective questionnaires currently available. Patients will be enrolled if presenting to the pediatric emergency department with acute suicidal thoughts or attempt. Upon discharge they will be sent home with a noninvasive monitor to track physiologic parameters.</detailed_description>
