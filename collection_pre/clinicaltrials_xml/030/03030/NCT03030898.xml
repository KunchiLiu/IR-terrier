	<brief_summary>The idea of this work came during a carotid surgery, when we noticed a respiratory variation of the right internal jugular vein. Also, because of the interest of evaluating the preload dependence during an intervention or reanimation where it is difficult to access the other monitoring methods . The aim of the study was to test the hypothesis that respiratory changes in right internal jugular vein diameter are similar to respiratory changes in superior and inferior vena cava in mechanically ventilated patients and therefore help to predict fluid responsiveness.</brief_summary>
