	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to test the efficacy and safety of an experimental drug, OMP-305B83, when given in combination with paclitaxel. OMP-305B83 is a humanized monoclonal antibody and was developed to target cancer stem cells. Based on preclinical studies, it is believed that OMP-305B83 may block the growth of cancer stem cells and may also impair the productive growth of new blood vessels, which tumors need to grow and spread.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase 1b Study of OMP-305B83 Plus Paclitaxel in Subjects With Ovarian, Peritoneal or Fallopian Tube Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label, Phase 1b dose escalation and expansion study of OMP-305B83 plus paclitaxel designed to evaluate the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of OMP-305B83 in combination with paclitaxel in patients with platinum resistant ovarian, primary peritoneal or fallopian tube cancer. This study consists of a screening period, a treatment period and a post-treatment follow up period in which patients will be followed for survival for approximately 12 months. Patients will be enrolled in two stages: a dose-escalation stage and an expansion phase. Approximately 30 patients will be enrolled in this study at approximately 5 study centers in the United States (U.S)..</detailed_description>
