	<brief_summary>Background: The new drug LMP744 damages DNA. This causes cell death. Researchers want to see if it can treat certain kinds of cancer. They want to understand how the drug works and how it affects the body. Objective: To test the safety of LMP744 and find out the dose of the drug that can be safely given to humans. Eligibility: Adults at least 18 years old who have metastatic solid tumors or lymphoma, which have progressed after other treatment. Design: Participants will be screened with: - Vital signs taken - Blood and urine tests - Heart tests - Scans or ultrasound Some participants will have a tumor sample taken 2 times. A small piece of tumor is removed by a small needle. A scan or ultrasound will guide the process. The study will be done in 28-day cycles. Each cycle, participants will get the study drug in a vein for 60 minutes once a day for 5 days. For day 1 of cycle 1, participants will be admitted to the clinic and have blood and urine taken several times. At the beginning of each cycle, participants will have a clinic visit and repeat some screening tests. They will also do this twice in the middle of cycle 1 and once in the middle of cycle 2. After participants stop taking the study drug, they will be followed for 30 days. They may give blood samples. They will be contacted by phone to see how they are doing.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Indenoisoquinoline LMP744 in Adults With Relapsed Solid Tumors and Lymphomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: - Indenoisoquinolines are non-camptothecin inhibitors of topoisomerase 1 (top1) withimproved characteristics over their predecessors. Indenoisoquinolines have better chemical stability, producing stable DNA-top1 cleavage complexes, and exhibit a preference for unique DNA cleavage sites, compared with their camptothecin counterparts. - They have demonstrated activity against camptothecin-resistant cell lines and produce DNA-protein crosslinks, which are resistant to reversal. They also show less or no resistance to cells overexpressing the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, ABCG2, and multidrug resistance (MDR-1). Primary Objectives: -To establish the safety, tolerability and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of LMP744 (NSC 706744) administered intravenously (IV) daily for 5 days (QD x 5) schedule in patients with refractory solid tumors and lymphomas. Secondary Objectives: - Characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of LMP744. - Evaluate the effect of LMP744 on markers of DNA damage ( &gt;=H2AX, pNbs1, pATR, ERCC1, RAD51) and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and pre- and post- treatment tumor biopsies in patients at the expansion cohort. - Assess preliminary antitumor activity of LMP744. Eligibility: -Adult patients must have histologically documented, relapsed solid tumors that are metastatic or unresectable, or lymphoma which had progressed after all FDA-approved therapy, therapy associated with overall survival benefit, or for which no standard of care therapy exists. Study Design: - Cycle 1 and subsequent cycles: Patients will receive LMP744 administered IV QD over 1 hour on days 1 5 followed by 23 days without drug (28-day cycle). - PK and PD samples will be collected. Tumor biopsies will be optional during the escalation phase and mandatory during the expansion phase and mandatory during the expansion phase.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: 1. Patients must have histologically documented metastatic solid tumors which have progressed after one line of therapy, or lymphoma which has progressed after all FDAapproved therapy. 2. Patients must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded for nonnodal lesions and short axis for nodal lesions) as greater than or equal to 20 mm (greater than or equal to 2 cm) with conventional techniques or as greater than or equal to 10 mm (greater than or equal to 1 cm) with spiral CT scan, MRI, or calipers by clinical exam. 3. Age greater than or equal to 18 years. 4. ECOG performance status less than or equal to 2 5. Life expectancy of greater than 3 months. 6. Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below: leukocytes greater than or equal to 3,000/mcL absolute neutrophil count greater than or equal to 1,500/mcL platelets greater than or equal to 100,000/mcL total bilirubin within normal institutional limits AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) less than or equal to 2.5 (SqrRoot) institutional upper limit of normal creatinine within normal institutional limits OR creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for patients with creatinine levels above institutional normal. 7. Anticoagulation with lowmolecularweight heparin (LMWH) will be permitted. Patients receiving treatment with warfarin or any of the NOACs (rivaroxaban, apixaban, dabigatran, or edoxaban) will be given the option to switch to LMWH. 8. Patients must have recovered to grade 1 or baseline from adverse events (AEs) and/or toxicity of prior chemotherapy or biologic therapy. They must not have had chemotherapy, biologic therapy, or definitive radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas and mitomycin C) or 5 halflives, whichever is shorter, prior to entering the study. Palliativeintent radiotherapy (30 Gy or less) must be completed at least 2 weeks prior to start of treatment, and may not be to a lesion that is included as measurable disease. Patients must be greater than or equal to 2 weeks since any investigational agent administered as part of a Phase 0 study (where a subtherapeutic dose of drug is administered) at the PI s discretion, and should have recovered to grade 1 or baseline from any toxicities. 9. Patients receiving bisphosphonates for any cancer or undergoing androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer are eligible for this therapy. 10. Prior therapy with topoisomerase I inhibitors is allowed. 11. HIVpositive patients are eligible provided the following criteria are met: CD4 count &gt;350/mm3, an undetectable viral load, and not receiving prophylaxis antibiotics. 12. The effects of LMP744 on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason, women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Women and men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study participation, and 4 months after completion of LMP744 administration. 13. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document. 14. Willingness to provide blood and new tumor biopsy samples for research purposes if on the expansion phase of the study. EXCLUSION CRITERIA: 1. Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents. 2. Patients with clinically significant illnesses which would compromise participation in the study, including, but not limited to active or uncontrolled infection, immune deficiencies, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, uncontrolled diabetes, uncontrolled hypertension, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, myocardial infarction within the past 6 months, uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements. 3. Patients with known brain metastases or carcinomatous meningitis are excluded from this clinical trial, with the exception of patients whose brain metastatic disease status has remained stable for greater than or equal to 1 month after treatment of the brain metastases. Patients on antiseizure medications or steroid therapy may be enrolled at the discretion of the Principal Investigator. 4. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because LMP744 is an agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with LMP744, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated. INCLUSION OF WOMEN AND MINORITIES: Both men and women of all races and ethnic groups are eligible for this trial.</criteria>
