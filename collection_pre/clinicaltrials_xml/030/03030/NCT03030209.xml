	<brief_title>Risk Factors for the Development of Diabetes Mellitus After Distal Pancreatectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The development of sophisticated surgical procedures, improved postoperative care, and the capacity for early diagnosis of disease, have prolonged life expectancy after pancreatic resection. For these patients, the endocrine function of the pancreas is a critical factor that influences quality of life. In this study, the investigators recruit patients who underwent distal pancreatectomy in Peking Union Medical College Hospital within the last 10 years. Demographic characteristics, operative parameters and short-term postoperative outcomes were collected in a prospective database maintained by the Pancreatic Surgical Centre, Peking Union Medical College Hospital. These patients are followed up regularly by outpatient visiting or telephone for long-term outcomes. The primary outcome of this study is new-onset diabetes mellitus; second outcomes include impaired fasting glucose, impaired glucose tolerance, exocrine insufficiency and disease recurrence. This study aim to determine the cumulative rates of endocrine insufficiency, and identify risk factors for DM development in a large cohort of patients undergoing distal pancreatectomy.</detailed_description>
