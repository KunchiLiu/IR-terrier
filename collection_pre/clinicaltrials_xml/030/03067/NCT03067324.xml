	<detailed_description>Islet quality control after pancreatic islets isolation process is insufficient. The Islet Chip study proposes to develop a bio-sensor that will allow a multi-parametric analysis of islet graft based on measurement of islet membrane electric potential. The project aims to : - develop the bio-sensor necessary to measure islet membrane electric potential - develop interface between bio-sensor and user - correlate analysis data collected by bio-sensor with metabolic results of islet graft</detailed_description>
