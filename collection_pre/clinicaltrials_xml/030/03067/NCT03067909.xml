	<brief_summary>Hundreds of thousands patients undergo implantation or replacement of cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) annually in Europe, and up to 50% of these subjects receive antiplatelet agents or oral anticoagulants. Antithrombotic therapy increases the risk of developing pocket hematoma which in turn is associated with an increased risk of potentially fatal device-related infections when clinically significant. Aim of the registry is to retrospectively (pilot local registry in Tuscany) and prospectively (multicenter national registry in Italy) investigate the different strategies for the management of antithrombotic therapy and the related complication rates (1-month and 12-months) in patients undergoing CIED surgery in a real-world setting. The registry will also provide data on the economic impact of different management strategies and complications.</brief_summary>
