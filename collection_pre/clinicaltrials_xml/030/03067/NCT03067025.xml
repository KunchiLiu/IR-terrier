	<brief_summary>Most youth with MS experience symptoms such as depression and fatigue. In addition, cognitive issues, especially with attention and memory occur frequently. However, little is known about interventions that might work to improve these symptoms. In other work. the investigators have shown that higher levels of physical activity are associated with lower levels of depression and fatigue. Importantly, sleep problems are frequently encountered in youth with MS, and were seen in 60% of surveyed youth with MS in the investigators preliminary work. Whether sleep plays an important role in symptoms in youth with MS, and the relationship between sleep and physical activity in youth with MS is unknown.</brief_summary>
