	<brief_title>A Prospective, Contralateral, Eye to Eye Comparison of SMILE Surgery to LASIK Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects will have a comprehensive eye examination once they express an interest in the study. This includes a slit lamp examination of the front of the eye and a dilated fundoscopic examination of the back of the eye. If there is any pathology noted that would exclude the subject from the study, then we will inform the patient and make an appropriate referral. if the subject is deemed appropriate for the study after a comprehensive examination included computerized videokeratography, then they can be enrolled. Subjects will undergo bilateral simultaneous eye surgery. Which eye is treated with the WFG-LASIK and which eye is treated with SMILE will be randomized so there is a 50% chance for either eye to receive one treatment. Subjects will be seen on the day of surgery, post op day one, one week, one month, three months, six months and one year. Subjects will receive topical antibiotics in each eye for one week following the procedure. Subjects will receive topical steroid ophthalmic drops for one week after treatment. Subjects will also receive topical antibiotic ophthalmic drops for four days after treatment. All of this is within the usual and customary standard of care for the treatment of subjects undergoing LASIK and SMILE surgery.</detailed_description>
