	<brief_summary>A few, small randomized controlled trials have investigated the effects of exercise on blood glucose levels in women with gestational diabetes (GDM), with inconsistent results. To assess the effects of supervised exercise in women with GDM, 48 women with gestational diabetes, diagnosed between the 18th and 28th week of gestation, will be recruited, after exclusion of subjects with contraindications to exercise. These subjects will be randomly assigned to two groups: structured exercise intervention or standard care. Women in the intervention group will perform low intensity aerobic exercise three times per week at 30% HRR (heart rate reserve), under continuous heart rate monitoring. Duration of each session will progress from 26 minutes the first week to 40 minutes (increasing 2 min/week). Women in the control group will receive standard diet and physical exercise recommendations. In all women, clinical, metabolic and anthropometric features will be assessed before, during and at the end of the study. Newborn data will also be collected.</brief_summary>
