	<brief_title>Cognitive and Mood Assessment Data in Major Depressive Disorder Using Digital Wearable Technology</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The novel method being tested in this study for assessing mood and cognition in participants with MDD is wearable technology. This study will look at the correlation of mood and cognition outcomes on wearable technology with traditional objective neuropsychological cognitive function tests and self-reported mood outcomes. The study will enroll approximately 30 patients. Participants will be provided with a watch on which brief cognitive and mood tests will be evaluated daily up to 6 weeks. All participants will be prompted to complete cognitive and mood assessments on 3 occasions across the day. Two occasions (morning and afternoon) will comprise assessment of cognition, and the final assessment in the evening will constitute a review of the day focusing on self-reported depressed mood. This single-center trial will be conducted in United Kingdom. The overall time to participate in this study is 6 weeks. Participants will take part in up to 5 study visits (1 in-person on-site visit, 3 web-based and 1 at home visit) assessing performance on traditional objective neuropsychological cognitive function tests and self-reported measures of depression symptom severity and social function.</detailed_description>
