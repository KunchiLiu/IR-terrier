	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of Qurevo Plus Ribavirin Based Therapy for Hepatitis C With or Without Cirrhosis in Haemodialysis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of this study is; To evaluate the efficacy and safety of ombitasvir, paritaprevir, and ritonavir based therapy for chronic hepatitis C with or without compensated cirrhosis in HCV treatment naïve patients receiving long-term haemodialysis through assessment of: 1. The proportion of patients with a sustained virological response (HCV RNA &lt;25 IU/mL) 12 weeks after the last dose of study drug (SVR12). 2. To determine withdrawal rate related to side effects and /or adverse effects for patients receiving at least 1 dose of the study medication.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Under regular HD for at least 6 months 2. Clinically stable condition as outpatients. 3. Treatment naïve patients with serum positive for HCV GT4 with HCV RNA &gt; 1000 IU/ml by PCR. 4. White blood cell count &gt; 2500/mm^3. 5. Platelet count &gt; 7500/mm^3. 6. Patients categorised as having compensated cirrhosis had a diagnosis of cirrhosis based on a previous screening liver FibroTest score of 0·72 or lower (eg, Metavir Fibrosis Score &gt;3 [including 3/4 or 34] ). 1. Confirmed pregnancy. 2. HCVHIV co infection. 3. HBVHCV co infection. 4. Uncontrolled hyper or hypothyroidism. 5. For patients without cirrhosis, Patients will be excluded if alanine or aspartate aminotransferase more than five times the upper limit of normal, for patients with cirrhosis they will be excluded if alanine or aspartate aminotransferase are higher than seven times the upper limit of normal 6. Patients on peritoneal dialysis.</criteria>
