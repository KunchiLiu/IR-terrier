	<brief_summary>To determine whether 3-month versus 6-month professional CGM utilization improves time spent in target range of 70-140mg/dl in patients with poorly controlled T2DM not treated with insulin.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of 3 Versus 6-Month Use of CGMS in Non-Insulin Using T2DM Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients not receiving any insulin treatment with an HbA1c â‰¥ 7.5% before their scheduled primary care appointment will be invited to participate in the study and wear professional CGM for at least 3 days at either 3 intervals (baseline, 3-month and 6-month) or 2 intervals (baseline and 6-month). After removal, the downloaded report will provide quantitative data to determine the percent of time spent in the target range. The 6-month data will be analyzed to determine if frequency of professional CGM wear positively affects time spent in target range.</detailed_description>
