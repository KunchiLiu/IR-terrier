	<brief_summary>To overcome the obstacles of endoscopic surgery, the da vinci surgical robot system was applied to the various surgery area . And the complete understanding and practice of the robotic system is very important condition for successful robotic surgery. Investigator developed a home made robotic surgery simulator for novice robotic surgeons. And investigator want to study about the ability of home made robotic surgery simulator versus existing robotic simulation system.</brief_summary>
