	<brief_summary>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is an emerging health problem as it can lead to end stage liver failure and cardiovascular complications. Diet play an important role in the development of NAFLD. Many studies have addressed the effects of added fructose on NAFLD. To date, little attention has been paid to the effects of a diet devoid of fructose. Therefore, the investigators aim to study the effects of fructose restriction on hepatic fat accumulation and vascular function using a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled design.</brief_summary>
