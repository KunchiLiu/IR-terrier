	<brief_summary>This research is a feasibility pilot of an intervention to respond to positive screening tests for mental health(MH) and substance use (SU) captured through the Patient Reported Outcomes questionnaires (PROs). The PROs are currently performed in the clinic, however, the results are neither reviewed with patients nor transmitted to providers. This pilot assesses the feasibility of moving the PROs into the clinical realm by having patients review the PRO results, identifying an issue to discuss at the patient's next HIV primary care visit, and determining whether this process increases discussion of MH and SU disorders in the subsequent clinical visit and/or increases referrals to MH and/or SU treatment.</brief_summary>
