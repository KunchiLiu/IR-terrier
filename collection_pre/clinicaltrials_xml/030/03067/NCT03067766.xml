	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial studies how well comic art creation works as supportive care in cancer patients and caregivers. Participating in a comic art creation workshop may help patients and their family members or friends share their medical experience through storytelling and drawings in a way that can, but does not have to, reflect the real world. It may also help improve emotional wellbeing and communication in cancer patients and caregivers.</brief_summary>

Patients and participants receive a range of assignments that focus on creative art and experimentation with materials and storytelling in order to make a series of small handmade books that relate directly or indirectly to their experience with cancer. Midway through the workshop, patients undergo a qualitative interview for approximately 45 minutes and complete validated questionnaires within 10 days after the end of the interview. After completion of the study, patients are followed up at 1 and 6 weeks.</detailed_description>
