	<brief_summary>Pneumonia is the leading infectious cause of death among children under 5 years of age globally. Many pneumonia deaths result from late care seeking and inappropriate treatment due to misdiagnosis of symptoms. The United Nations Children's Fund's (UNICEF's) Acute Respiratory Infection Diagnostic Aids (ARIDA) project aims to introduce automated respiratory rate (RR) counting aids for use by frontline health workers in resource limited community settings and health facilities. These RR counting aids aim to offer improved accuracy, effectiveness and acceptability compared to current practices for counting and classifying RR to detect fast breathing pneumonia. The general aim of the controlled accuracy study is to understand whether the ARIDA test device accurately measures RR in children under 5 years of age with cough and/or difficult breathing. It is a cross-sectional, prospective study in a controlled setting comprising three types of device evaluations: 1. The accuracy of the ARIDA test device in measuring RR in young infants 0 to &lt;2months, children 2 to &lt;12 months and 12 to 59 months when compared to a video panel reference standard will be established through the first evaluation. 2. The consistency of the ARIDA test device will be established by determining the level of agreement between the measures of RR for two ARIDA test devices when used on the same child at the same time in those aged 2 to &lt;12 months and 12 to 59 months through the second evaluation. 3. A third evaluation on a different group of normal-breathing children aged 2 to 59 months will assess RR fluctuation over time due to ARIDA test device attachment. Evaluations 1 and 2 for accuracy and consistency will also be undertaken with expert clinicians (EC) conducting a manual RR count to further the evidence base around the performance of current standard practice in a controlled setting. Accuracy and consistency evaluations for both the ARIDA test device and the EC will use a simultaneous video panel reference standard for comparison and Bland-Altman techniques will be used to assess agreement between RR measures. The RR fluctuation evaluation will compare EC manual RR counts before and 1, 3 and 5 minutes after ARIDA test device attachment. The study is a cross-sectional, prospective study and will be conducted in paediatric in and outpatient departments Saint Paul's Hospital and Millennium Medical Collage in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. A total 290 RR assessments will be done on 290 children.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Acute Respiratory Infection Diagnostic Aids (ARIDA) Controlled Accuracy Evaluation Protocol</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>General aim: To understand whether the ARIDA test device accurately measures respiratory rate (RR) in children under 5 years of age with cough and/or difficult breathing. Primary objective: To determine the performance of the ARIDA test device, as defined by accuracy and consistency in children under 5 years with cough or difficulty breathing in a controlled setting. Secondary objectives: To determine the performance of expert clinicians (ECs) counting RR, as defined by accuracy and consistency, in children under 5 years with cough or difficulty breathing in a controlled setting. To measure RR fluctuation over time after ARIDA test device attachment, in normal breathing children aged 2 to 59 months, in a controlled setting. Sample size: A total 290 respiratory rate assessments will be done. The accuracy evaluation will enroll 156 children (52 per age group: 0 to &lt;2 months, 2 to &lt;12 months and 12 to 59 months). The consistency evaluation will enroll 104 children (52 per age group: 2 to &lt;12 months and 12 to 59 months). The accuracy and consistency evaluations will aim to enroll children in a ratio of 3:1 fast:normal breathers in each age group. The RR fluctuation evaluation will enroll 30 normal breathing children age 2 to 59 months. Data collection: Overview of evaluation stages: 1. Training of the research team: 3 days 2. Pre-testing of procedural activities and debrief: 5 days 3. Screening procedure will take place to ascertain study eligibility. Written parent or guardian informed consent will be obtained. 4. Children will be enrolled prospectively based on eligibility determined by the screening procedure. 5. Child will participate in the assigned evaluation: accuracy, consistency, RR fluctuation Steps for device evaluation: Study blinding for ECs: All ECs conducting manual RR counts in the accuracy, consistency and RR fluctuation evaluations will be blinded to the RR result from the pre-screen assessment and the ARIDA test device readings during the evaluation: - RR reading during the pre-screening will be recorded by the research assistant (RA) on a data collection form that will not be seen by the EC manual counter(s). - ARIDA test device RR readings will be covered and obtained by an RA. ARIDA test device RR readings will be recorded by the RA. - Data collection forms will be entered on secure tablets, which will be kept confidentially in a clinic office (in a locked desk drawer or cabinet) in the health facility before transfer back to the Malaria Consortium country office. At no point will un-blinding of the ECs be required. This is because any child/young infant who develops a medical complication or adverse event (AE) attributable to the device will have their treatment instituted by an un-blinded research nurse/clinical officer and no treatment will be based on the outcome of these studies. Accuracy evaluation: There will be 3 attempts to obtain an ARIDA test device and EC manual RR reading with standard practice. The research assistant (RA) will attach the ARIDA test device to child according to device instructions. When the child is calm, the videographer starts video recording and the ARIDA test device and manual EC RR count will start simultaneously, marked by an audible 'clap'. The manual RR evaluation will last for 60 seconds. After 60 seconds, if EC has not obtained an RR reading, record as unsuccessful attempt and repeat attempt for both EC and ARIDA test device. If third attempt, record as failure. For attempts 1 and 2, the ARIDA test device evaluation period will last up to 90 seconds. For attempt 3, the evaluation period for the ARIDA test device will last up to 120 seconds. Consistency evaluation: The consistency evaluation will follow the same procedure as the accuracy evaluation. To obtain a measure of consistency between two ARIDA test devices, two test devices will be attached to a single belt, in line with each nipple and will measure RR in the same evaluation period. To obtain a measure of consistency between two ECs, two ECs will obtain a manual RR count with standard practice and will measure RR in the same evaluation period. The research team will debrief the Parent or Guardian at completion of the assessments and ensure the medical management for the child is completed by the relevant hospital staff. Reference standard: The reference standard will be a video panel review by two independent experts. Video annotation software will be used by the panel of experts in order to mark on inhalations and exhalations. If the panel agree (≤±2bpm), a median reading will be used. If panel disagree (&gt;±2bpm), a third expert will be invited to review the video. If two out of the three readings agree (≤±2bpm), the median of these RR readings will be used. If all three panel members are in disagreement (&gt;±2bpm), the result will be excluded (methodology based on Pneumonia Diagnostics project, Malaria Consortium, 2016, unpublished). RR fluctuation evaluation: This evaluation is time bound and no repeat RR readings will be taken. If a reading cannot be obtained within evaluation period, record as unsuccessful attempt and continue with evaluation. When the child is calm, a baseline EC manual RR count for 60 seconds will be obtained. Following this, when the child is calm the ARIDA test device will be attached to the child and the EC will do a further three manual RR counts for 60 seconds in the following time periods: 1. 0-1 minute 2. 2-3 minutes 3. 4-5 minutes Data storage: All data will be collected using electronic forms uploaded on tablets and backed up to a protected cloud account. Patient identifiers will not be utilised on data forms; a UIC and associated barcode will be used to anonymise patient data and track patient data. The UIC to be used for the study will have four numerical characters. ECs will each have a numerical unique identifier, assigned at the beginning of the study. Data quality assurance: As part of the quality assurance procedures, standard clinical protocols, standard operating procedures (SOPs) and job aids will be prepared. The tablet based data collection forms will also have pre-programmed checks and restrictions to ensure the quality of the data inputted, and the data will be reviewed centrally on a regular basis. Regular site visits will be conducted by Malaria Consortium study investigators to provide oversight and quality assure that the protocols, SOPs and job aids are adhered to by the research team. Research reports will be submitted to relevant Ministry of Health (MOH) departments and Institutional Review Board (IRB). Subject safety procedures: The ARIDA test device has CE medical device approval. RAs and ECs will be trained on how to use the device safely, according to instructions provided by the manufacturers. This study will not evaluate device efficacy or safety as a study endpoint and treatment will not be based on the outcomes of the study. It is important to note that the device, as part of the dossier to the stringent regulatory bodies has conducted their own efficacy studies and internal approvals. The child/young infant will be evaluated in a health facility; a research nurse or clinical officer, trained in management of children and in Integrated Management of Newborn Childhood Illnesses (IMNCI), will perform a medical history and physical examination prior to evaluation to ensure no children with danger signs or 'pink' IMNCI referral signs are included in the study. Children who are deemed very ill will be excluded. ECs and RAs performing the evaluations will also be trained in the management of children and in IMNCI. In case a child has a medical complication before, during or after the evaluation, the research nurse or clinical officer or other medical professionals will manage this immediately in the health facility. Subject safety, anticipated risks: The ARIDA test device to be used on the children will not be invasive. The ARIDA test device will not elicit pain or other noxious stimuli when near or in contact with the child/young infant's body. It is therefore anticipated it will not cause any bodily harm or injury to the child and no adverse events (AEs) associated with the device are anticipated. In the event of an AE following an evaluation with the ARIDA test device, the research nurse/clinical officer will determine whether the AE is attributable to the device. The project manager and or clinical director will report the AE to the in-country research ethics committee and the study principal investigator as per applicable guidelines. Subject safety, adverse event recording and reporting: The parent or guardians of the children will be requested to report any suspected AE occurring during and/or immediately after the evaluation using the devices. The ECs/RAs while evaluating the child/young infant will be requested to alert the research team and clinical director and/or another medical professional of any untoward occurrence. Any observed and/or reported AE (serious or non-serious), or suspected causal relationship to the investigational device, will be recorded on a severe AE form For all AEs, sufficient information will be pursued and/or obtained so as to permit: 1) an adequate determination of the outcome of the effect (i.e., whether the effect should be classified as a serious AE); and 2) an assessment of the casual relationship between the AE and the investigational device. AEs felt to be associated with the investigational device will be followed until the effect (or its sequelae) resolves or stabilises at a level acceptable to the local project manager in discussion with the clinical director. The research team will promptly review documented AEs. If the research team's final determination of causality is "unknown and of questionable relationship to the investigational device(s)", the AE will be classified as "associated with the use of the investigational device" for reporting purposes. If the research team's final determination of causality is "unknown but not related to the investigational device(s)", this determination and the rationale for the determination will be documented in the respective subject's case history. A copy of the completed form will be provided to the research team in country and to the study principal investigator. The completed AE form will be submitted to the regulatory authorities as per the country-specific reporting requirements. Subsequent to the initial submission of a completed form, the research team will submit additional information concerning the reported AE as requested by the regulatory authorities. If an investigational device elicits pain or other noxious stimuli when near or in contact with the child/young infant's body, or leads to any other untoward medical occurrence, the use of the device on the child/young infant will be stopped immediately, the child/young infant will be withdrawn from the study and steps will be taken to assess and record the AE. The child/young infant will be managed by the EC or other medical professionals, and if the AE(s) is felt to be associated with the investigational device(s), the child/young infant will be followed until the event (or its sequelae) resolves or stabilises at a level acceptable to the research team. A child/young infant will also be withdrawn from the study if the parent or guardian withdraws consent at any point in the study or if the study is discontinued for any reason. Ethical approval: This clinical protocol as part of the ARIDA project has been submitted to the Ethiopian IRB at national level. The ARIDA test device will be registered with the Food, Medicine and Health Care Administration and Control Authority of Ethiopia.</detailed_description>
