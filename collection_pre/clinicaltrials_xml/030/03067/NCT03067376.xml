	<brief_title>A Study Designed to See How [14C]-CORT125134 is Taken up, Broken Down and Removed From the Body</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study was conducted to determine the recovery of [14C]-CORT125134 after the administration of a single oral dose of [14C]-CORT125134, to determine the routes and rate of elimination of [14C]-CORT125134 and associated radioactivity from the body, and to measure concentrations of radioactivity in the blood. Additional objectives of the study were to determine the chemical structure of each significant metabolite in plasma, urine and feces. Safety and tolerability were assessed.</detailed_description>
