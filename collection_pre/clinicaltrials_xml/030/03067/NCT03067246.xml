	<brief_title>A Comparison of the VBM Intubating Laryngeal Tube and the I-Gel</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a study comparing the use of a newer generation laryngeal mask to the 2nd generation widely used at present. The company responsible for the manufacture of this product is VBM Medizintechnik GmBH, Germany. The recent difficult airway society guidelines recommend the use of these newer generation devices and this has been the incentive to conduct this project. These newer generation supraglottic devices have an additional feature which is an extension of the mask with a balloon that sits in the oesophagus. The trial is investigating ease of placement of these devices, ventilatory pressures, leak pressure and ease of intubation through the VBM device compared to I-Gel. The position of the supraglottic device on insertion and the position of the endotracheal tube will be confirmed with a fibrescope. A follow up will take place on the same day and after 24 hours for symptoms of a sore throat postoperatively.</detailed_description>
