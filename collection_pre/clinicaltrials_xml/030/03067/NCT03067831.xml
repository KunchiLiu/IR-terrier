	<brief_title>Bone Marrow-Derived Autologous Stem Cells for the Treatment of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a genetically determined X-linked disease. The manifestation of muscle weakness typically starts around the age of 4-5 in males and deteriorates fast. Typically muscle loss occurs first in the upper legs and pelvis followed by muscles of the upper arms. It is caused by a mutation in the gene for the protein dystrophin. Dystrophin is crucial to maintain the muscle fiber cell membrane. Currently, there is no cure for muscular dystrophy. Corrective surgery, braces, and physical therapy may help with some of the symptoms. Assisted ventilation might be required in patients with weakness of breathing muscles. Medications prescribed include steroids to slow muscle degeneration, anti-convulsants to control seizures and muscle activity, and immunosuppressants to delay damage to muscle cells. For decades, research has been conducted to find an effective therapy for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Stem cell based therapy is considered to be one of the most promising methods for treating muscular dystrophies. Stem cell based therapies for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) can proceed via two strategies. The first is autologous stem cell transfer involving cells from a patient with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) that are genetically altered in vitro to restore dystrophin expression and are subsequently re-implanted. The second is allogenic stem cell transfer, containing cells from an individual with functional dystrophin, which are transplanted into a dystrophic patient. Herein, the investigators describe a method for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) using autologous bone marrow derived specific populations of stem cells and mesenchymal stem cells transplanted in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD).</detailed_description>
