	<brief_summary>The study was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of a novel kinematic biofeedback system - SWORD Phoenix- in the rehabilitation after total knee replacement . SWORD Phoenix allows the patients to perform independent rehabilitation sessions at home, under remote monitoring from the clinical team. The investigators hypothesize that the clinical outcomes of a home-based rehabilitation program will be at least similar to the outcomes of a traditional home-based rehabilitation with face-to-face sessions. This is a randomized controlled trial with active comparator. Patients will be enrolled and randomized pre-operatively into 2 groups: intervention group and control group. Both groups will perform 8 weeks of rehabilitation starting on day 7 after surgery. The intervention group will perform daily rehabilitation sessions at home using SWORD Phoenix, under remote monitoring from a physical therapist. The control group will perform 1h rehabilitation sessions 3 times a week, at home, given by a physical therapist. Outcomes will be measured at weeks 4 and 8. The primary outcome is the performance in the Timed-up-and-Go (TUG) test between in each patient in comparison with the pre-operative score. Secondary outcomes will be measured in term of: a) range of motion of the knee joint (flexion/extension); b) Knee Osteoarthritis Outcome Score); c) quality of life, as measured by the SF-36 scale.</brief_summary>
