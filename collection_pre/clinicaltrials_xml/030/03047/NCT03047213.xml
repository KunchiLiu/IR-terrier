	<brief_summary>This pilot phase II trial studies how well sapanisertib works in treating patients with bladder cancer that has spread from where it started to nearby tissue or lymph nodes (locally advanced) or other places in the body (metastatic) with tuberous sclerosis (TSC)1 and/or TSC2 mutations (changes in deoxyribonucleic acid [DNA]). Sapanisertib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sapanisertib in Treating Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Bladder Cancer With TSC1 and/or TSC2 Mutations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the overall response rate (ORR) defined as complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) in patients with locally advanced or metastatic transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) harboring a TSC1 mutation. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of sapanisertib (MLN0128) (TAK-228) in patients with locally advanced or metastatic TCC harboring a TSC1 or TSC2 mutation. II. To evaluate progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the ORR in patients with locally advanced or metastatic TCC harboring a TSC2 mutation. II. To evaluate toxicity, PFS, and OS in TSC2 mutation patients. OUTLINE: Patients receive sapanisertib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks and every 6 months thereafter.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must have measurable disease as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 Eligible patients should have a histologically confirmed locally advance or metastatic TCC who progressed after standard therapy Patient must have TCCs tumors harboring a TSC1 or TSC2 mutation identified by a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) certified laboratory Patients must have TCC tumor tissue available for submission in a form of at least 10 unstained slides or formalinfixed paraffinembedded (FFPE) block (FFPE block highly recommended and preferred); if the tissue were previously sent to Yale Tumor Profiling Laboratory (TPL) for prescreening, additional tissue submission may not be required if sufficient remaining tissue is available; but, must first consult with the principle investigator Patient must have developed disease progression during or following treatment with at least one platinum containing regimen (e.g., gemcitabine/cisplatin [GC], methotrexatevinblastinedoxorubicincisplatin [MVAC], carboplatin, gemcitabine [CarboGem]) for inoperable locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma or disease recurrence, or must be unfit or ineligible for cisplatinbased chemotherapy; there is no restriction on the number of prior lines of chemotherapeutics agents received Patients who progressed within 12 months of treatment with a platinumcontaining neoadjuvant or adjuvant regimen are considered secondline patients; therefore, these patients may be also eligible Patients who are unfit or ineligible for cisplatinbased chemotherapy as defined by any one of the following criteria are eligible for this trial: Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance score of 2 Creatinine clearance &lt; 60 mL/min A hearing loss (measured by audiometry) of 25 dB at two contiguous frequencies Grade &gt;= 2 peripheral neuropathy ECOG performance status =&lt; 2 (Karnofsky &gt;= 60 %) Life expectancy of greater than 12 weeks Hemoglobin &gt;= 9 g/dL Fasting serum glucose =&lt;

2.5 Ã— institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) and =&lt; 5 ULN if liver metastases are present Creatinine within normal institutional limits OR creatinine clearance &gt;= 50 mL/min based either on CockroftGault estimate or based on urine collection (12 or 24 hour) Patients with controlled diabetes are allowed on study; controlled diabetes is defined as fasting blood sugar (FBS) &lt; 130 mg/dL, and patients whose FBS can be brought in this range with medical therapy are eligible for trial inclusion Women of childbearing age should avoid becoming pregnant while taking any mTOR inhibitor including MLN0128 (TAK228) Female patients must: Be postmenopausal for at least 1 year before the screening visit, OR Be surgically sterile, OR If they are of childbearing potential, agree to practice 1 highly effective method of contraception and 1 additional effective (barrier) method, at the same time, from the time of signing the informed consent through 90 days (or longer, as mandated by local labeling [e.g., USPI, SmPC, etc.;]) after the last dose of study drug, OR Agree to practice true abstinence, when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient; NOTE: periodic abstinence [e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods], withdrawal, spermicides only, and lactational amenorrhea are not acceptable methods of contraception; female and male condoms should not be used together Male patients, even if surgically sterilized (i.e., status postvasectomy), must: Agree to practice highly effective barrier contraception during the entire study treatment period and through 120 days after the last dose of study drug, OR Agree to practice true abstinence, when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient (NOTE: periodic abstinence [e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods for the female partner], withdrawal, spermicides only, and lactational amenorrhea are not acceptable methods of contraception; female and male condoms should not be used together) AND agree not to donate sperm during the course of this study or within 120 days after receiving their last dose of study drug Ability to swallow oral medications Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents Patients with known untreated brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to MLN0128 (TAK228) Subjects who are on systemic corticosteroids (intravenous (IV) or oral steroids, excluding inhaled, topical or ophthalmic corticosteroids), or antiepileptic drugs for treated brain metastasis Subjects taking strong inhibitors and/or inducers of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4, CYP2C19 or CYP2C9 within 1 week preceding the first dose of MLN0128 (TAK228);
