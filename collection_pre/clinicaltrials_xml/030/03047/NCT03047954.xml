	<brief_title>Broncho-Vaxom (OM 85 BV) in Children Suffering From Atopic Dermatitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Children outpatients of both sexes, aged 6 months to 7 years, with AD confirmed by Haniffin-Rajka or Williams et al, and an AD score (SCORAD) between 25 and 70 were included and followed for 9 months. Patients were randomized to receive either Broncho-Vaxom 1 capsule (3.5 mg) per day or the corresponding placebo over 9 months. Children under general corticotherapy within one month of study start, patients with immunodeficiency, patient's affected body surface area less than 15% or greater than 70% or with known allergy to desonide were excluded. Outcome measures were a comparisons between the two groups in the number of AD flares during the study after the first month of treatment. Secondary outcome measures were comparisons between the two groups based on SCORAD evolution, area of eczema, amount of corticoids used and parents/investigator assessments.</detailed_description>
