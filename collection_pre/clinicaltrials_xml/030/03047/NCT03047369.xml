	<brief_summary>This is an observational designed to: - Aim 1: Define novel homogeneous groups of patients with unclassified leukodystrophy and work toward finding the cause of these disorders; - Aim 2: Assess the validity and utility of next-generation sequencing in the diagnosis of leukodystrophies; - Aim 3: Establish disease mechanisms in selected known leukodystrophies; - Aim 4: Track current care and natural history of these patients to define the longitudinal course and determinants of outcomes in these disorders. These objectives will be achieved by collecting, and subsequently analyzing, data and samples in a longitudinal fashion across leukodystrophies.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Genetic white matter disorders (leukodystrophies) are estimated to have an incidence of approximately 1:7000 live births. In the past, patients with white matter disease of unknown cause evaluated by the investigator achieved a diagnosis in fewer than 46% of cases after extensive conventional clinical testing. Even when a diagnosis is achieved, the diagnosis takes an average of eight years and this "odyssey" results in testing charges to patients and insurers in excess of $8,000 on average per patient, including the patients who never achieve a diagnosis at all. With next generation approaches such as whole exome sequencing, the diagnostic efficacy is closer to 70%, but approximately a third of individuals do not achieve a specific etiologic diagnosis. This remaining group of patients (unclassified leukodystrophy) offers the opportunity to describe novel disorders and provide improved diagnostic tools. These diagnostic challenges represent an urgent and unresolved gap in knowledge and disease characterization, as obtaining a definitive diagnosis is of paramount importance for leukodystrophy patients. Moreover, the mechanisms of disease in many leukodystrophies of known cause are very poorly understood: many are systemic abnormalities that manifest only testing white matter. Finally, little is known about the best symptomatic management of the many leukodystrophies without an etiologic cure and thus limited standards of care are available for the management of these patients. The purpose of this study is to: (Aim 1) define novel homogeneous groups of patients with unclassified leukodystrophy and work toward finding the cause of these disorders; (Aim 2) assess the validity and utility of next-generation sequencing in the diagnosis of leukodystrophies; (Aim 3) establish disease mechanisms in selected known leukodystrophies; and (Aim 4) track current care and natural history of these patients to define the longitudinal course and determinants of outcomes in these disorders. It is hoped that the present study will help clarify the nosology of the leukodystrophies and significantly advance our understanding of the pathogenesis of these diseases, the best diagnostic testing tools, and the best symptomatic management of these conditions. Due to the breadth of this approach, and the rarity of these conditions, these approaches will be carried out at multiple clinical centers with specialized expertise in the leukodystrophies.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Suspected or confirmed diagnosis of leukodystrophy based primarily on the finding of central nervous system neuroimaging consistent with this diagnosis or on an existing diagnosis of a leukodystrophy or genetic leukoencephalopathy as defined in existing classification systems; Males or females of any age; Parental/guardian permission (informed consent) and if appropriate, child assent or patient consent; Willingness to provide clinical data, participate in standardized assessment and provide biologic samples. Identification of a diagnosis not consistent with a genetic disorder of the white matter such as an acquired demyelinating condition (e.g. Multiple Sclerosis) or an infectious etiology prior to enrollment, with the exception of sequelae of congenital infections such as cytomegalovirus (CMV); Inability to provide consent; Weight below safe range for biological sample collection (typically &lt;3kg).</criteria>
