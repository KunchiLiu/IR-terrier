	<brief_summary>Despite public campaigns to prevent cigarette smoking, it's about 20% of women who keep on smoking during pregnancy, exposing their fetus to prenatal tobacco adverse effects. Although environnemental tobacco smoke exposure effects are well known, consequences of prenatal tobacco smoke exposure (PTSE) need better caracterization. Previous animal study from our group have shown, in prenatal nicotine exposed mouse pups, alterations in tracheal epithelial structure similar to those observed in KO α7-nAChR mouse pups. These findings support the hypothesis that α7-nAChR are involved in the process of deleterious effects of tobacco smoking on respiratory epithelium development. The purpose of the present clinical study is to compare PTSE neonates with controls according to lung function and respiratory epithelial functionality. At the age of 3 days, small respiratory epithelium fragments will be obtained from gentle nasal brushing performed under antalgic premedication according to the method we previously published. Epithelium samples will be used for in vitro studies of α7-nAChR and CFTR functionality. Between the ages of 2 and 6 weeks, lung function testing will be performed, by means of baby-body plethysmography.</brief_summary>
