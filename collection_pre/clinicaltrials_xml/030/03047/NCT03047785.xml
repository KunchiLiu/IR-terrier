	<brief_summary>Currently when defining the upper limit of normal (ULN) or 99th percentile of a troponin assay manufacturer's use a healthy population traditionally aged 18-40. The 99th percentile value is the recommended value to use when diagnosing patients with an acute myocardial infarction. With the advent of the new highly sensitive troponin assays it has become clear that many patients have a troponin level above the 99th percentile when they have not suffered a myocardial infarction. We believe part of the problem with interpreting the the troponin values for patients is that the 99th percentile value which determines the ULN has been derived from population that is very different to the hospital population of patients. This study aims to demonstrate what the 99th percentile is for the population of people who use the hospital services who are traditionally older and have more comorbidities when compared to the population traditionally used to define the 99th percentile of a troponin assay.</brief_summary>
