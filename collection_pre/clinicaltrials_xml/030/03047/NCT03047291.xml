	<brief_title>Effect of Probiotic Lactobacillus Reuteri in the Treatment of Mucositis and Periimplantitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A total of 44 patients, 22 with mucositis and 22 with periimplantitis, were randomly assigned to either the control or the test group, so that 11 patients received placebo and 11 probiotic treatment. After the baseline clinical, radiological and microbiological examination, and once the study group was randomly assigned (probiotic or placebo), supragingival prophylaxis was performed in the mucositis group and subgingival mechanical therapy in the periimplantitis group. Then they get a container with 30 probiotic or placebo tablets and instructions on how and when to take them. At 30 and 90 days after beginning the treatment, a clinical, radiological and microbiological examination was performed.</detailed_description>
