	<brief_summary>Basic treatment of type 2 diabetes should focus on diet, physical activity and lifestyle. Nevertheless, in early and late stage of T2DM, lifestyle intervention is mostly substituted by pharmacological intervention, although lifestyle modification and dietary treatment would be favourable. The researchers therefore investigate dietary strategies such as low-carb and very-low calory diets regarding their potential to improve metabolism and body weight in (mostly) long-term T2DM patients. This core comparison is dealt with in the DiNA-D study (published elsewhere). POLYPHEM targets specific dietary approach to preserve the achieved metabolic improvements from DiNA-D phase 1. Nutritional factors will be PUFAs and BCAAs.</brief_summary>

Nutritional factors for the maintenance period within DiNA-D (11 months) will be PUFAs and BCAAs, provided by walnuts and custom-made muffins containing walnuts, sunflower oil and isomaltulose.</detailed_description>
