	<brief_summary>Early post-anesthesia status of patients emerging from surgery encompasses vital respiratory and hemodynamic parameters as well as subjective signs of well-being such as absence of nausea, vomiting and a low pain level. This investigation intends to compare the rate of postoperative complications in the 2 groups from pair matched patient records after regional anesthesia with otherwise similar patients after general anesthesia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Immediate Post-operative Recovery After Regional vs. General Anesthesia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It is still unclear whether the immediate post-operative condition of patients after surgery and anesthesia is dependent on the basic anesthesia technique (General vs. regional anesthesia). The patients' post-anesthesia presentation encompasses vital respiratory and hemodynamic parameters as well as subjective signs of well-being such as absence of nausea, vomiting and a low pain level. By pair matching of patient records after regional anesthesia with otherwise similar patients after general anesthesia (control group), the rate of postoperative complications in the 2 groups will be compared. The results of this investigation will help to answer what is the difference in complication rates and wellbeing of patients depending on their previous anesthesia. The results of this study will Show which basic anesthesia technique has more or less early complications.</detailed_description>
