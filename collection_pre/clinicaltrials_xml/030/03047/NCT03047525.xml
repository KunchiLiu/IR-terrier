	<brief_summary>Background: Combinations of Dendritic and Cytokine-induced Killer Cells (DC-CIK) and Cytokine-induced Killer Cells (CIK) treatment may enhance the immune response and stop cancer cells from growing. The investigators suppose that DC-CIK combined with CIK treatment will improve the prognosis of advanced solid tumors. Objective: Phase II clinical trial to investigate the efficacy of concurrent chemotherapy with DC-CIK and CIK treatment in patients with treatment-refractory solid tumors. Study treatment: Patients in group A will receive 4 cycles of CIK treatments and 4 cycles of DC-CIK treatments within 8 months. Patients in group B will have no immunotherapy . chemotherapy are available in both groups.</brief_summary>
