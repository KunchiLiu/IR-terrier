	<brief_title>Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy in Patients With Locoregionally Advanced Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nasopharyngeal carcinoma is one of the most common malignancies in South China. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma is sensitive to radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Concurrent chemoradiation has become a standard treatment for locally advanced stage III-IVb nasopharyngeal carcinoma. However, The recommended single-agent DDP concurrent chemotherapy regimen for high-risk patients (IVa-IVb period) to improve the efficacy was not significant. Paclitaxel combined with platinum in the same period of chemotherapy regimen has been widely used in head and neck cancer, cervical cancer, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and lung cancer and other tumors, a number of studies have shown that it has good tolerance and efficacy. And a number of previous studies have shown that paclitaxel combined with platinum chemotherapy in the same period of head and neck cancer or nasopharyngeal cancer in multiple phase II clinical trials to achieve encouraging results. Based on the above background and basis, for the high risk (IVa-IVb) nasopharyngeal carcinoma treatment, the applicant intends to carry out the first IMRT + paclitaxel + DDP concurrent chemotherapy compared with DDP single drug concurrent chemotherapy regimen Pharyngeal cancer in a prospective randomized controlled phase Ⅱ clinical trial for paclitaxel + DDP dual-chemotherapy regimen for the treatment of high-risk nasopharyngeal carcinoma to provide evidence-based basis. (IVa-IVb) nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), and to provide a high-level evidence-based evidence-based approach to the treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma at high risk (stage IVa-IVb). The results of this study will be used in international guidelines to optimize high- Treatment of cancer patients.</detailed_description>

With normal liver function test (ALT、AST ≤ 2.5×ULN, TBIL≤ 2.0×ULN) 8. With normal renal function test (Creatinine ≤ 1.5×ULN) 9. Written informed consent. 1. Patients have evidence of relapse or distant metastasis Histologically confirmed keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma (WHO I) 2. Receiving radiotherapy or chemotherapy previously 3. The presence of uncontrolled lifethreatening illness 4. Women of childbearing potential who are pregnant or breastfeeding because of the potentially dangerous effects of the preparative chemotherapy on the fetus or infant. 5. Active systemic infections, coagulation disorders or other major medical illnesses of the cardiovascular, respiratory or immune system, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrhythmias, obstructive or restrictive pulmonary disease. Any form of primary immunodeficiency (such as Severe Combined Immunodeficiency Disease). 6. Concurrent opportunistic infections (The experimental treatment being evaluated in this protocol depends on an intact immune system. Patients who have decreased immune competence may be less responsive to the experimental treatment and more susceptible to its toxicities). 7. Concurrent systemic steroid therapy 8. HIV positive 9.
