	<brief_title>Ileus After Radical Cystectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Radical cystectomy remains the gold standard for treatment of patients with muscle invasive bladder cancer, or recurrent high grade non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. The high rates of morbidity and mortality reflect the fact that the majority of patients undergoing this procedure are elderly patients with multiple comorbidities. Postoperative ileus is the most frequent reason for prolonged hospital stay following cystectomy. To reduce the risk of ileus, prokinetics such as metoclopramide should be used postoperatively. Local anesthetics exert their actions as local anesthesia and antiarrhythmic through Na channels blocking but still have many other important actions through other receptors (e.g., m1 muscarinic receptors) that occur at very low plasma levels compared to levels needed for Na channels blocking, one of these actions is the antiâ€‘inflammatory effect against surgical stress response. Several randomized studies found that i.v. lidocaine shortens duration of postoperative ileus and some of it reported decreased postoperative pain with i.v. lidocaine, so they recommended i.v. lidocaine as a safe, simple, and less invasive method for management of postoperative ileus and equal to postoperative epidural analgesia.</detailed_description>
