	<brief_summary>2.1Purpose: The purpose of this study is to describe the chronology of postoperative pain in patients undergoing shoulder, knee, ankle arthroscopy. Further, within this population the predictive validity of the Defense and Veterans Pain Rating Scale will be assessed for persistent post surgical pain. 2.2 Research Design: This is a prospective descriptive correlational design looking to characterize postoperative pain variables across various procedures that historically have significant levels of persistent post-surgical pain. Further, bivariate correlations at different time points will be examined to see how DVPRS along with Pain Assessment Screening Tool and Outcomes Registry (PASTOR) correlates with other measures. 2.3 Methodology/Technical Approach A total goal of 250 participants will be queried regarding their postoperative pain experience following shoulder arthroscopy and knee arthroscopy. Descriptive multidimensional tools (the DVPRS and the electronic Pain Assessment Screening Tool and Outcomes Registry (PASTOR)) will be used preoperative either during their preoperative surgical visit or the day of surgery and extending to 6 months postoperatively. As these tools have been utilized in previous studies for the prediction of persistent post surgical pain, the DVPRS will additionally be evaluated for its predictive validity as it is a short, easy-to-administer, bedside tool.</brief_summary>
