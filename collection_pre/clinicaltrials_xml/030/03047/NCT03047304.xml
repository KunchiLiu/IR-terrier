	<brief_summary>Magnesium is a known treatment for neuroprotection in preterm labor before 32 week of gestation. High concentration of Magnesium in the blood stream known as cause of conduction abnormalities and ECG changes such us prolonged QT, QRS and PR in about. The goal of our work is to evaluate the PR intervals in embryos after maternal treatment with magnesium during preterm labor.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Magnesium Effect on Embryonal PR Interval</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We will recruit 25 woman with threaten preterm labor, magnesium blood level and PR interval will be evaluated before magnesium loading dose (4gr) and 20 minutes after the loading dose. PR interval will be evaluated by Mitral-Aorta Doppler.</detailed_description>
