	<brief_summary>This is a Phase 1/2a study to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of an orally-administered medication to relieve symptoms of constipation associated with Parkinson's Disease. Ten patients will be enrolled in Phase 1, and will be studied over an 8-12 week period. Forty patients will be enrolled in Phase 2, and will be studied over an 8-10 week period. All subjects will receive the study drug during one of the observational periods of the study.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of Safety and Tolerability of ENT-01 for the Treatment of Parkinson's Disease Related Constipation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Phase 1 will enroll 10 patients to assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of single escalating doses over a 30-60 day period. The dose-escalation period will be preceded by a 2-week run in period and followed by a 2-week wash-out period. Phase 2 follow the safe completion of Phase 1. It will enroll 40 patients and is composed of 4 periods of study: 1) a 2-week run-in period, 2) a 3-5 week escalating dose period to identify a prokinetic dose in the initial set of 10 patients, 3) a 1-week period of randomized dosing (placebo versus the previously identified pro-kinetic dose), and 4) a 2-week wash-out period. Pharmacodynamics will be assessed along with safety and tolerability. Relative outcomes will be compared within each patient and across groups for the randomized dosing period. Frequency of bowel movements and other non-motor symptoms of Parkinson's Disease will be collected over the course of both phases.</detailed_description>

If unable to have children: Must have this documented in the case report form (i.e., ubal ligation, hysterectomy, or postmenopausal [defined as a minimum of one year since last menstrual period]). Postmenopausal status will be confirmed by follicle stimulating hormone in women less than 60 years of age. 1. Unable or unwilling to provide informed consent or to comply with study procedures 2. Diagnosis of secondary constipation beyond that of PD 3. Structural or metabolic diseases that affect the GI system 4. Functional GI disorder 5. Unable or unwilling to withdraw from taking the following medications 2 weeks prior to the doseescalation period and throughout the study: Laxatives, opiates, sedatives, hypnotics, antihistamines, protein pump inhibitors or any medications which may cause constipation 6. History of recent major surgery (within 60 days of screening) 7. Any clinically significant abnormalities on screening laboratories or physical examination as determined by the Investigator 8. Neurological disorder other than PD 9. On treatment with intrajejunal dopamine 10. Treatment with COMT inhibitors for fewer than 4 weeks (entacapone, tolcapone, Stalevo) 11. Unable to maintain a stable diet regimen 12. Patients with a cognitive impairment that preclude them from understanding the informed consent 13. Patients placed under legal guardianship 14. Acute GI illness within 48 hours of the baseline period 15.
