	<brief_summary>Major depression is a highly prevalent and severe mental disease that negatively alters the lives of people, their families, and their social environment. Organizations that promote mental health policies have recognized the potential of new information technologies for the prevention and treatment of mental disorders. In this direction, information and communication technologies (ICTs) generate opportunities for increasing patient well-being through the use of on-line software. Such programs often include interactivity, self-monitoring, information materials (sometimes in multimedia format), and exercises on problem solving, recognition and challenging of dysfunctional thoughts, scheduling of activities, behavioral experiments, and other psycho-educational activities. In Colombia, there are few preventive mental health interventions scientifically oriented and seeking to demonstrate efficacy in context. The purpose of this study is to determine whether an internet-based program is effective to prevent and to intervene early the depression in adolescents between 11 and 20 years of age in 2 schools in the Antioquia Region, Colombia.</brief_summary>
