	<brief_summary>This is a single arm pilot study using TCR alpha/beta+ T cell-depleted peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) from closely matched unrelated donors or partially matched/haploidentical related donors for hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) in patients with acquired and inherited bone marrow failure (BMF) syndromes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Unrelated And Partially Matched Related Donor PSCT w/ TCR αβ Depletion for Patients With BMF</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a single arm pilot study using TCR alpha/beta+ T cell-depleted peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) from closely matched unrelated donors or partially matched/haploidentical related donors for hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) in patients with acquired and inherited bone marrow failure (BMF) syndromes. Previously established, disease-specific transplant preparative regimens will be administered based on the specific underlying BMF condition. Mobilized PBSC will be processed using the CliniMACS system for TCR alpha/beta+ T cell depletion plus CD19+ B cell depletion. The study will determine efficacy of this strategy in terms of engraftment, rates of acute and chronic Graft versus Host Disease (GvHD), and one year overall and event-free survival.</detailed_description>

Cardiac: shortening fraction &gt;27% Pulmonary: Diffusing Capacity (DLCO) &gt;50% predicted in patients old enough to comply with pulmonary function testing (PFTs) or no baseline oxygen requirement for younger patients. Lansky or Karnofsky performance &gt;60 Infectious disease criteria No active, untreated infections Patients with likely bacterial infections must be receiving appropriate antibacterial therapy and demonstrating therapy response Patients with likely fungal infections must have had at least 2 weeks of appropriate antifungal antibiotics and be asymptomatic. Patients with symptoms consistent with active viral infection will be deferred until viral symptoms resolve. Patients with evidence of cytomegalovirus (CMV), EpsteinBarr virus (EBV) or other known viremia must receive appropriate therapy to clear viremia prior to initiating study therapy. Signed consent by parent/guardian or able to give consent if &gt;18 years Patients who do not meet disease, organ or infectious criteria. Patients with a clinical diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) defined by combination of bone marrow dysplasia and classic cytogenetic lesion (Monosomy 7, Trisomy 8 eg.), with or without excess blasts. Patients with no suitable closely Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)matched unrelated or related haploidentical matched donor available. Patients with suitable fully matched related donor are also not eligible. Pregnant females. All females of childbearing potential must have negative pregnancy test. Donor selection and eligibility: • Donor selection will comply with 21 CFR 1271* of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's Code of Federal Regulations Donor testing: Unrelated donor meets National Marrow Donor Program criteria for donation For partially matched related donors, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) bone marrow transplant (BMT) standard procedures apply for determining donor eligibility, including donor screening and testing for relevant communicable disease agents and diseases. The donor collection program accredited. For partially matched related donors, if subject has genetically confirmed iBMF syndrome, related donor must be evaluated for this disorder and testing must be negative Infectious disease testing of donor will be per current Blood and Marrow Transplant Program Standards of Practice as per 21 CFR Part 1271. Donor medical records and history are reviewed to confirm that the donor is free of infectious risk factors and meets donor eligibility criteria as defined by 21 CFR 127.</criteria>
