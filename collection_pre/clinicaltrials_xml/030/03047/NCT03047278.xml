	<brief_summary>This study aims to investigate the influence of the glycemic control of type 2 diabetes (DM2) and of cetirizine (OCT2 inhibitor) on gabapentin kinetics disposition and pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics (PK-PD) in patients with neuropathic pain. Thus, non-diabetic patients (Control Group, n=10), patients with controlled diabetes (n=10) and patients with uncontrolled diabetes (n=10), all with neuropathic pain of intensity ≥ 4 in pain visual analog scale (0-10) are being investigated.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Influence of OCT2 Inhibitor Cetirizine and Type 2 Diabetes on Gabapentin Kinetics Disposition in Patients With Neuropathic Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Organic cation transporter 2 (OCT2), expressed in the basolateral membrane of the kidney proximal tubules, promotes the elimination of endogenous compounds and clinically used drugs. Gabapentin (GBP) an anticonvulsant used for neuropathic pain treatment, is eliminated primarily by renal excretion, dependent of OCT2 activity. Studies in rats with diabetes suggest that hyperglycemia reduces OCT2 activity in approximately 50%. The aim of this study is to investigate the influence of the glycemic control of type 2 diabetes (DM2) and of cetirizine (OCT2 inhibitor) on gabapentin kinetics disposition and pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics (PK-PD) in patients with neuropathic pain. Non-diabetic patients (Control Group, n=10), patients with controlled diabetes (n=10) and patients with uncontrolled diabetes (n=10), all with neuropathic pain of intensity ≥ 4 in pain visual analog scale (0-10) are being recruited and included in the research protocol. Patients are being treated with oral single dose of GBP 300 mg (Phase I) or cetirizine (20 mg/day) for 5 days and single dose of GBP on the last day (Phase II). Only the patients of Control Group will participate of Phase II. Serial blood samples are being collected and until 36 hours after GBP administration, and urine is being collected in 0-8 hours, 8-16 hours, 16-24 hours and 24-36 hours intervals. The intensity of pain is being evaluated at the same time of blood sampling, using the visual analog scale. GBP concentration in plasma is being validated by LC-MS, and GBP concentration in urine will be validated by Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometer (LC-MS). Patients will be genotyped for the polimorphism 808 G&gt;T of Solute Carrier 22A2 (SLC22A2) gene. Pharmacokinetics parameters area under the curve (AUC), total clearance, renal clearance, volume of distribution and elimination half-life will be estimated by non-compartmental analysis. Based on the results, it will be possible to evaluate the relevance of OCT2 activity on GBP pharmacokinetics, and the necessity of dose adjustment of GBP in patients with DM2.</detailed_description>
