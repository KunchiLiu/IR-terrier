	<brief_summary>The aim of this multicenter, randomized controlled trial is to evaluate the weaning time from mechanical ventilation comparing non-variable PSV, variable PSV, and Smart CareTM. This study is a multicenter randomized controlled open trial comparing variable, non-variable pressure support ventilation and Smart CareTM in patients receiving mechanical ventilation for more than 24 hours who are able to be weaned. The aim of the study is to determine the duration of weaning from mechanical ventilation for each one of the above mentioned weaning methods</brief_summary>
