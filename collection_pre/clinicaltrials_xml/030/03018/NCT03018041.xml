	<brief_summary>This is a long-term intervention study on the effects of marine n-3 PUFAs in renal transplantation. Our hypothesis is that patients treated with marine n-3 PUFA supplementation will have less decline in kidney transplant function compared to patients treated with placebo.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Long-term Effect of Marine Omega-3 Fatty Acid Supplementation in Renal Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study is designed as a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, multi-center trial of 174 renal transplant recipients. Patients will be randomized to oral supplementation of marine n-3 PUFA 2.5 g / day or control in a 1:1 fashion. The primary endpoint is change in estimated glomerular filtration rate after 156 weeks in the treatment group compared with the control group. Secondary endpoints include the following variables: proteinuria, plasma inflammatory and fibrotic biomarkers, blood pressure, resting heart rate, fasting serum glucose / HbA1c, lipid and lipoprotein concentrations, number of graft rejections and graft losses, and number of cardiovascular events and deaths. Patients from Akershus University Hospital will also participate in a sub-study, where renal graft biopsies will be performed to assess the degree of fibrosis and chronic allograft damage index (CADI) and markers of fibrosis.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Renal transplant recipients over 18 years of age. Stable renal graft function, defined as eGFR &gt;30 ml/min at the last 2 visits. 660 months posttransplantation at randomization. Signed informed consent. Patients who participate in a clinical trial with other investigational drugs. Patients with a history of an allergic reaction or significant sensitivity to fish, seafood and the study drug Omacor or drugs or dietary supplements similar to the study drug. Any reason why, in the opinion of the Principal Investigator, the patient should not participate E.g. history of repeated nonadherence to prescribed treatment, repeated nonattendance to clinic visits, cognitive impairment that prevents understanding the nature of this study, etc.</criteria>
