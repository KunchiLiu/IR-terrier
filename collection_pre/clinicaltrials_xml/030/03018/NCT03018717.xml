The investigators are going to carry out a multi-center, randomized, parallel groups, phase III clinical trial in adult patient with heart and/or lung advanced diseases,aiming to analyze the efficacy and cost-efficacy of tele-monitorization of bio-parameters added to optimal standard of clinical care (shared clinical care plan) compared to the shared clinical care plan exclusively.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Integral Clinical Plan Shared With or Without Telemonitoring of Constants in Patient With Chronic Diseases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>a total number of 510 patients will be divided in 3 centers: Hospital University Virgen del Rocío; Hospital University Virgen Macarena and Public Hospital Comarcal of Serranía de Ronda.
