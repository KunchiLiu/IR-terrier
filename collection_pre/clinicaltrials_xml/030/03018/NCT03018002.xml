	<brief_title>Intervention for Sustained Testing and Retention Among HIV-infected Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Using a two-arm cluster randomized design, our proposed study will evaluate the comparative effectiveness of iSTAR, a community-based social network intervention that combines trained church-based Health Advisors and clinic-based staff and uses motivational interview skills and clinic- quality improvement approaches (Intervention Group; IG) versus a clinic-based approach (Control group; CG) on linkage, engagement, retention and viral suppression among HIV-infected women and children. Eighteen health facilities in identified local government areas in Benue state, north-central Nigeria will be randomly assigned to either the IG (N=9 health facilities) or the CG (N=9 health facilities). A total of 10,000 pregnant women will be screened and 400 HIV-infected participants will be enrolled over a 24-month period. The primary outcome will be the difference in the rate of linkage and engagement between the groups. The secondary outcome will be the difference in rate of retention and viral suppression among participants. Additionally, we will conduct network, mediation/moderation analysis to examine the roles of intermediate variables such as health team cohesion, turnovers, attitudes, leadership and dynamic adaptation on iSTAR implementation and sustainment.</detailed_description>
