	<detailed_description>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) causes significant morbidity and mortality, accompanied by high related costs. Recent hypotheses concerning the pathophysiology of TBI invoke Strain Shear Theory and Cavitation Theory. We propose to test the importance of the latter by directing blast waves into containers that are either partially or completely filled with blood and measuring markers of lysis. These experiments are designed to better understand the demonstrated effectiveness of mild jugular compression according to the principle of the Queckenstedt Maneuver to reduce the likelihood of TBI by filling up the compliance of the cranial space. A device (C-Collar) is being developed by Q30 Labs, LLC (Q30), to accomplish this effect.</detailed_description>
