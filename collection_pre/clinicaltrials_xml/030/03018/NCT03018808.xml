	<brief_summary>Early diagnosis and appropriate treatment for COPD patients are both critical to minimize the progression of COPD and improve outcomes. Also, evidence suggests that high eosinophil (specific type of white blood cell that protects body against certain kinds of germs) level is associated with increased risk of both moderate and severe exacerbations in COPD patients. To date, there is insufficient amount of data that describes the prevalence of COPD in Brazilian primary care units. Thus, this multicenter, cross-sectional study conducted in five centers located in five different Brazilian cities will provide estimation about the prevalence of COPD in primary care and will also determine the levels of eosinophils in subjects with confirmed COPD diagnosis. Approximately 2,500 eligible subjects are expected to be enrolled in the study.</brief_summary>
