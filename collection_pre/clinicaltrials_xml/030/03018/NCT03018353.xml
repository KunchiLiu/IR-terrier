	<detailed_description>Curing HCV in Incarcerated Patients (CHIP) is a 1-year demonstration project that will be conducted in the San Francisco County Jails. Jail settings can provide an optimal opportunity to screen for HCV, initiate curative treatment, and link patients to community HCV providers to complete their treatment. This demonstration project will be funded by the Gilead's Investigator Sponsored Research. The purpose is to assess the feasibility of treating inmates with the FDA approved combination oral treatment, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir, Eplcusa®. The San Francisco Department of Public Health's Jail Health Services will treat 100 patients. Intensive patient navigators will be an essential component for treatment to ensure medication adherence and achieve SVR for those who are discharged from jail prior to HCV treatment completion. Navigators will provide short-term case management services by linking patients to medical and social support services. This demonstration project will be facilitated by the Jail Health Services' HIV &amp; Integrated Services (formerly Forensic AIDS Project).</detailed_description>
