	<brief_summary>The primary objective of the present study is to evaluate the effect of HMG-CoA reductase inhibition during 14 days on the postprandial plasma GLP-1 response in healthy individuals. Secondary objectives include the evaluation of HMG-CoA reductase inhibition on postprandial glucose tolerance, gallbladder emptying, gastric emptying, plasma responses of lipids, bile acids and pancreatic and enteric hormones known to influence glucose metabolism and appetite, and faecal content of bile acids and gut microbiota composition.</brief_summary>
