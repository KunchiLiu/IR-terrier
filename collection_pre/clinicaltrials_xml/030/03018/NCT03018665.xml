	<brief_title>A Study of the Effect of Glucagon-like Peptide 1(GLP-1) Receptor Agonist in Combination With Metformin Therapy on Diabetes Remission in Subjects With Newly Diagnosed Type 2 Diabetes Who Are Overweight or Obese</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Most of type 2 diabetes are characterized by being overweight or obese mainly caused by insulin resistance. GLP-1 receptor agonist has been proved to help to lose weight and improve insulin resistance. In this study, we suppose that GLP-1 receptor agonist has the effect of inducing diabetes remission in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes who are overweight or obese and has its advantages</detailed_description>
