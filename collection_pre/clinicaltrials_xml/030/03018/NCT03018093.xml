	<brief_summary>The trial is a single arm, single-center, non-randomized phase I clinical trial which is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of C-CAR011 in treatment of adult subjects with relapsed/refractory CD19+ B cells acute lymphoblastic leukemia(r/r CD19+B-ALL)</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase I Study Evaluating Safety and Efficacy of C-CAR011 Treatment in Adult Subjects With r/r CD19+B-ALL</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a single-center, Open Label phase I clinical trial, 20 subjects planned to be enrolled. The trial have two stages (Phase I dose-escalation clinical trial and phase I dose expansion trial).Subjects will be divided into low-dose group, medium-dose group and high-dose group.Additional patients will be enrolled to confirm the optimal dose Dose CAR+ cells/kg Low 0.5×106 Medium 1.5×106 High 3.0×106</detailed_description>
