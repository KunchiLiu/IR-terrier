	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial studies how well medroxyprogesterone acetate with or without entinostat before surgery works in treating patients with endometrioid endometrial cancer. Medroxyprogesterone acetate is a progesterone, a hormone produced by body normally. Entinostat may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Given medroxyprogesterone acetate with or without entinostat may work better in treating patients with endometrioid endometrial cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Medroxyprogesterone Acetate With or Without Entinostat Before Surgery in Treating Patients With Endometrioid Endometrial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine whether the addition of the histone deacetylase inhibitor, entinostat, in combination with medroxyprogesterone acetate (Depo-Provera) in the pre-operative setting results in up-regulation of activated progesterone receptors (PR) compared to Depo-Provera alone. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the response rate (as measured by cellular morphology and proliferation) and change in activated receptor levels with the addition of entinostat at the time of hysterectomy. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized into 1 of 2 arms. ARM I: Patients receive medroxyprogesterone acetate intramuscularly (IM) on day 1 and undergo hysterectomy between days 21-24. ARM II: Patients receive medroxyprogesterone acetate IM on day 1 and entinostat orally (PO) on days 1, 8, and 15. Patients undergo hysterectomy between days 21-24.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must have a histologically proven diagnosis of endometrioid endometrial adenocarcinoma by endometrial curettage or biopsy within 8 weeks prior to registration; central pathology review will be required as part of the study but not for registration purposes Appropriate stage for study entry based on the following diagnostic workup: History/physical examination within 42 +/ 5 days of planned surgical procedure (1821 days from day 1); Further protocolspecific assessments The trial is open only to women with primary endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the uterine corpus (all histologic grades and stages) who are planned and appropriate for primary surgical treatment Patients must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0, 1, 2, or 3 within 28 days prior to registration A formalinfixed, paraffinembedded tumor block (or 16 unstained sections [charged, 4 um]) of the biopsy or curettage must be submitted along with the corresponding pathology report; patients without such material, but willing to undergo repeat biopsy or curettage, are eligible; repeat biopsy must occur after consent but prior to randomization Platelets &gt;= 100,000/ul Granulocytes (ANC) &gt;= 1,500/mcl Creatinine =&lt; 1.6 mg/dl Serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT) (alanine aminotransferase [ALT]) =&lt; 3 x upper limits of normal Bilirubin within institutional normal limits The patient or a legally authorized representative must provide studyspecific informed consent and authorization permitting release of personal health information prior to study entry Any patients of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test Patients with predominant (&gt; 30%) nonendometrioid histology (such as serous, clear cell, or carcinosarcoma) Patients who have received prior progestin or antiestrogen therapy during the 3 months before the diagnosis of endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the uterine corpus is established; estrogen therapy alone is allowed Patients with ECOG performance grade of 3 or 4 Patients with history of thrombophlebitis within the past 2 years or ongoing thromboembolic disorders Patients who have previously received systemic, radiation or other treatment for uterine cancer Patients for whom a formalinfixed, paraffinembedded tumor block (or 16 unstained sections [charged, 4 um]) of the biopsy or curettage are unavailable and patient is unwilling to undergo repeat biopsy or curettage Patients must not have previously received a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor in a clinical trial setting (entinostat, romidepsin, belinostat, panobinostat, vorinostat) Patients must not be currently taking or have ever taken vorinostat (Zolinza, Merck), panobinostat (Farydak, Novartis) or romidepsin (Istodax, Gloucester Pharmaceuticals)</criteria>
