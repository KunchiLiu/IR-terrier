	<brief_title>Syndrome Differentiation in the Management of Chronic Stable Coronary Artery Disease (SCAD) to Improve Quality</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic stable coronary artery disease (SCAD) is a general term for all kinds of coronary artery disease (CAD) which includes patients with chronic stable angina, oldmyocardial infarctions and also stable condition after revascularization (i.e percutaneous coronary intervention （PCI）, coronary artery bypass graft （CABG）). According to 2012 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) guide, the objective of the treatment for SCAD is to maintain or recover patients' exercise tolerance, quality of life and avoid complication like heart failure，so as to decrease mortality, eliminate symptoms and avoid adverse reactions. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has two thousand years of history in managing CAD and has its advantages in improving quality of life. Using scientific method to evaluate, demonstrate and conclude the clinical curative effect of TCM is an extremely important task for both TCM and Chinese and western integrative medicine win the treatment of CAD. Recent researches mainly focus on certain types or some certain pathological and physiological stages of CAD, worse still, different areas experts have their own experiences and opinions with the treatment. There is a lack of unified syndrome differentiation and prescriptions plan for the chronic stable CAD and not enough attention has been paid to TCM despite it having many advantages in improving quality of life in these patients. Considering all the above, this research studied past syndromes research results and real clinical effective chronic SCAD cases. Cases were analysed and explored, effective cases were filtered, syndrome differentiation of the prescriptions was refined, thus build a TCM diagnosis and treatment information database.</detailed_description>
