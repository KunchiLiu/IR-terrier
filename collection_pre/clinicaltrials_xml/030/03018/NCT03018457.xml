	<brief_summary>Dental implants are a prosthetic rehabilitation device whose success depends of the bone morphology and quality, in more the surgical procedure. This study aims to assess whether the parameters of the trabecular microarchitecture of alveolar bone taken from the site of the placement of the dental implant, calculated by micro-CT are correlated with ISQ (implant stability quotient) using the Osstell according the principle of the resonance frequency analysis at the 10th postoperative week during the osseointegration of dental implants (secondary stability). The cortical alveolar bone is a recognized factor in the phase of primary stability of osseointegration. The role of trabecular bone in the secondary stability is not clearly determined.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of Trabecular Microarchitecture of the Alveolar Bone by Micro-computed Tomography and of Osseointegration of Dental Implants by Resonance Frequency Analysis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of this study is to check whether the trabecular bone with its microarchitecture plays a predictive role in osseointegration of dental implants precisely in its biological stability phase or its secondary stability phase. If this correlation is established, a larger study must be conducted to identify a profile of patients at risk for failure of osseointegration of the dental implant.</detailed_description>
