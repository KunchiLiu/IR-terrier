	<detailed_description>The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is useful to diagnose soft tissue morphology, especially to detect cancer and disk displacement with temporomandibular disorders. The prevalence of tongue cancer may increase with ageing population. A clear MR image is indispensable for clinical diagnosis. However, tongue motion associated with the habitual or swallowing tongue movement may cause artifacts on MRI. This occurrence of motion artifact is speculated to be prominent with the patients without the occlusal support. The objective of this pilot study was to compare level of artifact while tongue at rest and in motion of dentulous subjects.</detailed_description>
