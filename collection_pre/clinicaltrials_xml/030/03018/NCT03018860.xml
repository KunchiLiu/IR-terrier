	<brief_summary>Active phase of the second stage of labor corresponds to period of maternal expulsive efforts (i.e. pushing). An intensive management of this phase is usual in France. This study aims to evaluate the impact of an alternative "moderate" management during this pushing phase on neonatal and maternal issues and mode of delivery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Alternative to Intensive Management of the Active Phase of the Second Stage of Labor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Management of the active phase of the second stage of labor is not an evidence-based practice. Management of this phase differs between countries. In France, national guidelines recommend to limit maternal expulsive efforts to 30 minutes (grade C). Thus, physicians (midwives and obstetricians) encourage usually women to push 3 times per contractions and to push on every contraction in order to deliver into a 30 minutes timing. This study aims to evaluate the impact of an alternative "moderate" management during this pushing phase on neonatal and maternal issues and mode of delivery. In the intervention group, i.e. "moderate" pushing, women are encouraged to push only 2 times per contractions, to respect contractions without pushing and there is no limit of pushing duration. The hypothesis is that "moderate" management of the active phase of the second stage allows decreasing frequency of neonatal morbidity at birth, decreasing frequency of operative delivery and increasing maternal satisfaction.</detailed_description>
