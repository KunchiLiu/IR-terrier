	<brief_title>S100B Protein and Postoperative Cognitive Dysfunction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The neurocognitive assessment protocol will design to evaluate general cognitive function and identify patients with cognitive dysfunction. Neuropsychological tests of all patients will conduct on the one day prior to surgery, the first day after surgery, and the 30 th day after surgery, respectively. According to a consensus statement, cognitive function will assess using a battery of seven neuropsychological tests: Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (delayed recall), Trail Making Test (Parts A and B), Digit Span Test (forward and backward), and Grooved Pegboard Test (dominant and non-dominant hands). Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) was defined as a decline of &gt;20% from preoperative test scores in at least two of seven tests. Serum levels of S100B protein will obtain from venous blood samples collected before surgery, after the anesthesia induction, immediately after surgery and 24 h postoperatively.</detailed_description>
