	<brief_summary>Background: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a skin disease also called eczema. It is common in children and sometimes gets better on its own. However, chronic AD may cause asthma, food allergies, eye infections, and sleep problems. The cause of AD might be related to bacteria that live on the skin. Researchers want to see if introducing bacteria, R mucosa, from healthy skin onto the skin of someone with AD helps treat the disease. Objective: To test the safety and activity of R mucosa for treating AD. Eligibility: Part 1: People ages 18 and older with AD Part 2: Children ages 7 17 with AD Design: Participants will be screened with: Medical history Physical exam Examination of their AD Blood and urine tests At the baseline visit, participants will have blood tests and photos taken of their skin. They will get a supply of R mucosa and a memory aid to track their doses and record how they are feeling. Part 2 participants guardians will complete questionnaires about their child s AD. Part 1 participants will spray R mucosa on their arm twice per week for 6 weeks. Part 2 guardians will spray it on their child s arm twice per week for 16 weeks. Participants will have follow-up visits to repeat some baseline tests and review their memory aid: Part 1: Six weeks after the baseline visit Part 2: Four times over 16 weeks; then 2 or 3 times for 1 year Participants will be called or emailed to discuss how they are feeling: Part 1: About 30 days after their last visit Part 2: About every 10 days between visits</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Beginning Assessment of Cutaneous Treatment Efficacy of Roseomonas in Atopic Dermatitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The underlying pathology of atopic dermatitis (AD) consists of defective skin barrier function, susceptibility to Staphylococcus aureus skin infection, and immune imbalance. There is currently no cure for AD. Preclinical data in a mouse model of AD suggest that commensal Gram-negative bacteria (CGN), such as Roseomonas mucosa, from a healthy source can relieve symptoms of AD and have antimicrobial effects. In this study, we will first evaluate the safety of R mucosa-based biotherapy in young adults and adults with AD (age 16+ years), and then evaluate the safety and efficacy of R mucosa-based biotherapy in children (ages 7-16 years) with AD. Participants will receive twice-weekly doses of CGN biotherapy for 6 weeks (part 1, dose escalations at 2 and 4 weeks) or 4 months (part 2, possible dose escalations at 4 and 8 weeks). Participants in part 1 will be contacted 30 plus-minus 10 days after end of treatment for assessment of safety. Participants in part 2 will also be followed for 1 year after the end of treatment for evaluation of long-term efficacy and safety. This will be the first study to test cutaneous live biotherapeutic products for AD. We hypothesize that altering the strains of CGN on the skin of people with AD will improve the patient s clinical outcome. We do not expect serious toxicities because R mucosa is rarely pathogenic; reported cases of bacteremia have typically been associated with percutaneous catheters in immunocompromised patients, who are excluded from this study.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA: Inclusion Criteria for Young Adults and Adults with AD (Part 1) 1. Age 16+ years 2. SCORAD of at least 10 3. Have a clinical diagnosis of AD with active involvement of the antecubital fossa 4. Willing to allow storage of blood for future research 5. No history of other skin disease 6. Initiated or attempted standard of care therapy at least 6 months prior to enrollment 7. Must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control or abstinence) when engaging in sexual activities that can result in pregnancy. The effects of CGN live biotherapy on the developing human fetus are unknown. Adequate contraception must be used consistently, beginning before the first dose and lasting for the duration of study participation. Participants of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test result before they receive CGN live biotherapy. During the course of the study, if a participant becomes pregnant or suspects they are pregnant, then they should inform the study staff and their primary care physician immediately. Inclusion Criteria for Children with AD (Part 2) 1. Age 716 years 2. SCORAD of at least 10 3. Have a clinical diagnosis of AD with active involvement of the antecubital fossa 4. Willing to allow storage of blood and bacterial swabs for future research 5. Total serum IgE level &gt; 150 UI/mL 6. Initiated or attempted standard of care therapy at least 6 months prior to enrollment 7. Participants who have begun menstruating must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control or abstinence) when engaging in sexual activities that can result in pregnancy. EXCLUSION CRITERIA: 1. Presence of an indwelling venous or arterial catheter 2. Individuals living with anyone with a diagnosed immunodeficiency, cardiac valvular disease, and/of indwelling catheter 3. Precence of allergies to aimkacin, cirofloxicin, gentamicin, levofloxacin, and tobramycin (which would preclude treatment of any unexpected infection) 4. History of cardiac valvular disease 5. Any history of grade 2 or higher neutropenia or leukopenia 6. Clinical suspicion of immunodeficiency, liver disorder, kidney disorder, and/or HIV 7. Pregnant or breastfeeding 8. Any history of antiTNF treatment 9. Inability to demonstrate proper bacteria administration procedure despite coaching and training 10. Use of fluoroquinolone or aminoglycoside antibiotics within 2 weeks of enrollment 11. Any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, contraindicates participation in this Study Coenrollment guidelines: Coenrollment in other trials is restricted, other than enrollment on observational studies or those evaluating the use of a licensed medication. Study staff should be notified of coenrollment as it may require the approval of the investigator.</criteria>
