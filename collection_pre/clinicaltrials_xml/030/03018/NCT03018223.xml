	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to find out if a combination of drugs (these are called: cyclophosphamide, sirolimus, and mycophenolate mofetil) will protect participants better against graft vs. host disease (GVHD) after receiving a hematopoietic cell transplant from a related partially matched (haploidentical) donor. As part of the treatment for their blood cancer, participants need a hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) to improve their chances of cure. In any HCT, after the stem cell infusion is given, a combination of drugs is needed to prevent GVHD and facilitate acceptance of the graft.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patient Participants: Age: Up to 65 years for full intensity (myeloablative), no age limit for reduced intensity. Karnofsky performance status: Full intensity conditioning, 80100%; reduced intensity conditioning, 60100%. Vital organ function: a) Cardiac: Left ventricular ejection fraction must be &gt; 45% assessed by multigated acquisition (MUGA) scan or echocardiogram. No myocardial infarction within 6 months of transplant evaluation. b) Pulmonary: forced expiratory volume at one second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), and adjusted diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO) must be ≥ 50% of predicted values. c) Liver: Transaminases (AST, ALT) less than 2 times upper limit of normal values. d) Kidney: Estimated creatinine clearance ≥ 50 cc/min. Signed informed consent. Included disease conditions and remission status: a) Acute leukemia in First Complete Remission (CR1) or second/subsequent CR. b) Chronic myeloid leukemia, primary myelofibrosis, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. c) Int2 or high risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). d) Hodgkin lymphoma beyond CR1 with chemosensitive disease, Stable Disease (SD) may be included if no mass &gt;3 cm. e) NonHodgkin lymphoma in high risk CR1 or subsequent CR (by clinical, cytogenetic or molecular criteria), primary induction failure (PIF) or relapsed with chemosensitive disease. SD may be included if no mass &gt;3 cm. f) Multiple myeloma in CR/Very Good Partial Response (VGPR). Donor Participants: Per Moffitt Cancer Center (MCC) Blood and Marrow Transplant (BMT) program practices, an allele level matched (8/8 HLA A, B, C and DR) sibling or unrelated donor is preferred. If a matched donor is not found, mismatched unrelated or haploidentical donors may be considered. If a haploidentical donor is considered, parents, children and full siblings will have high resolution typing at the MCC HLA laboratory. Patient and potential haploidentical donors are selected among those who share at least one human leukocyte antigenA (HLAA), B, C, DRB1 and DQB1 haplotype. A donor may be 5, 6 or 7 out of 10 HLA identical with the recipient. Patient will be screened for antibodies targeting mismatched HLA antigens in potential haploidentical donors (donor specific antibodies, DSA). Antibody screen and confirmatory testing using Luminex single antigenbead test will be done. Among several potential donors, will choose in order of priority: a) Matched cytomegalovirus (CMV) immunoglobulin G (IgG) serologic status between donor and recipient. b) ABO blood group systemmatched donor preferred, then minor ABO mismatch, then major ABO mismatch. c) Younger donor preferred: child, then sibling, and then parent. d) For male recipient, male donor will be preferred. Avoid mother as a donor unless no other choices. Patient Participants: Active bacterial, viral, fungal infection not controlled with appropriate antimicrobial therapy. History of HIV infection. HCT comorbidity index with total score &gt; 3.28 Adjusted DLCO will not be included in assessment of pulmonary risk, excepting those with DLCO less than 50% which will be excluded. Prior allogeneic HCT. Unwilling to comply with study requirements. Active, progressive or advanced disease based on diagnosis.</criteria>
