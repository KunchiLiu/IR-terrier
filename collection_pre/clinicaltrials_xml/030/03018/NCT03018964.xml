	<brief_title>Solo Single Incision Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a multicenter randomized controlled study. The primary outcome based on non-inferior study design(α=0.05, power (1-β)=0.90); comparing a complications rate between Solo-SILC group and conventional cholecystectomy group (Ca-SILC). Total of 272 patients who were undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy for gallbladder disorders will randomly assign to two groups according to a computer-generated table of random numbers Solo-SILC group using a laparoscopic camera holder (n=136) or Ca-SILC group in which a camera operator joins (n=136). . Demographics (i.e., age, gender, body mass index (BMI), American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) score, indication for operation, need for conversion to open surgery or additional port will be recorded. Outcome including pain, hernia, complication rates, post-cholecystectomy diarrhea, operator's workload will be investigated</detailed_description>
