	<brief_summary>ICUs have always perceived by the public has a very technical unit with a restricted and/or forbidden access. Physical alteration of the patient, seeing the patient sedated, the large numbers of devices, the alarms and an uncertain prognosis. All this factors can be perceived by people close to the patient as a source of stress. In the literature, numerous studies have shown that families develop anxiety and depression symptoms while their loved one is hospitalized in the ICU. French intensive care societies thought of ways to prevent or diminish these symptoms. The 6th consensus conference on " Live better in the ICU " recommends: effective and adapted information, large visiting hours to reach an unrestricted access and family participation in care. The unit has taken this path to improve patient and family centered care by: creating a welcome leaflet, a room dedicated to meetings with families and an ICU open 24/7bto families, with the possibility for children to visit their parents. Hence, spontaneously, relatives have expressed the wish to participate to certain care and when participating, expressed their satisfaction. This observation and testimonies from family members and patients led us to think about the impact of participation of care. Two major French studies have shown contradictory outcomes: 16% of families would have been willing to participate in the first study against 97% in the second one. These studies were survey done after the ICU discharge. No study today has assessed the actual impact of family participation in care. The aim of this clinical trial is to diminish anxiety and depression symptoms. By participating in care, relatives can develop or strengthen a relationship of trust with caregivers. It could contribute also to a better understanding of the plan of care and an easier context to announce negative outcomes.</brief_summary>
