	<brief_summary>The main purpose of this study is to assess whether exercise training reduces ambulatory blood pressure in patients with resistant hypertension. To accomplish these goals 60 patients with resistant hypertension will be recruited and randomized into exercise training or control groups and followed up for 6 months. The patients in the exercise group will participate in a 3-month outpatient program. The control group will receive usual medical care. At baseline, after the intervention and 3 months after the end of the intervention both groups will undergo several evaluations, including casual and ambulatory blood pressure, body composition, cardiorespiratory fitness, quality of life, arterial stiffness, autonomic function, and endothelial and inflammatory biomarkers.</brief_summary>
