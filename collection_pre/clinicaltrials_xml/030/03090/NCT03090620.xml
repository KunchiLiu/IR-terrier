	<brief_summary>Overdose of xenobiotics (antihistamines, antipsychotics, or Jimson Weed) with resulting antimuscarinic toxidrome is a common scenario in medical toxicology. The result of antagonism of muscarinic receptors is a constellation of signs and symptoms (toxidrome): mydriasis, decreased sweat, decreased bowel sounds, agitation, delirium, hallucinations, urinary retention, tachycardia, flushed skin and seizures. Two treatment options are physostigmine or benzodiazepines. Although the antimuscarinic toxidrome occurs commonly, physostigmine has been used sparingly despite evidence of safety and efficacy. To demonstrate the utility and safety of physostigmine, the investigators propose a randomized clinical trial of physostigmine compared to benzodiazepine for antimuscarinic toxicity.</brief_summary>
