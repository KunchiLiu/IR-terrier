	<brief_summary>In health,adipose tissue stores fat from the diet. If the fat tissue stops storing dietary fat then this increases the chance of it being stored in the liver, which is related to increased risk of heart disease and type 2 diabetes. It has been suggested that having a diet high in sugars or certain fats, may cause the fat tissue and liver to change how they function; we would like to investigate this in detail.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Dietary Nutrients on Liver and Adipose Tissue Metabolism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research aims to investigate how the overconsumption of specific macronutrients may effect adipose tissue and liver metabolism and function. Liver and heart fat content and adipose tissue and liver metabolism fasting and postprandial lipid metabolism will be assessed before and after the specific dietary intervention.</detailed_description>
