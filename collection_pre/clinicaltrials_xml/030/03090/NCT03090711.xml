	<brief_summary>Brain functions are supported by multiple cell types, including neuronal and non-neuronal cells that are connected into complex networks. When the connectivity between those cells is altered or disrupted, the functioning of the brain is impaired. In stroke, the interruption of blood supply to the neural circuits results in connectivity damage and permanent disabilities. Experimental evidence suggests that some types of brain state, including sleep, can protect brain tissue from stroke and "repair" the damaged circuits. This project will investigate the neuronal mechanism underlying the protective effect of sleep on brain connectivity and network activity. To this end, the investigators will use a collection of state-of-the-art technologies including high-density electroencephalography (hd-EEG), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS). Perspectives include a better understanding of the causes and consequences of the perturbed electrical activity of the brain during sleep in stroke patients.</brief_summary>
