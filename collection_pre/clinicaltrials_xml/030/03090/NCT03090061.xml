	<brief_title>Reliability of Light Induced Fluorescence Intraoral Camera Versus Visual-Tactile Method in Assessment of Marginal Integrity of Resin Composite Restorations: Diagnostic Invivo Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Each patient should have at least one resin composite restoration. The restoration will be evaluated by two diagnostic methods. Each examiner will record the dental findings using both the visual- tactile assessment method and the fluorescent-aided identification method. The visual-tactile assessment method includes the use of mirror, FDI probe under good illumination condition, while the fluorescent-aided identification method will be performed by light induced fluorescence intraoral camera then the reliability of each diagnostic tool will be assessed.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Patients should be over 18 years of age. Patients should have an acceptable oral hygiene level. Patients must have at least one posterior resin composite restoration. Patients with a compromised medical history. Severe or active periodontal disease. Heavy bruxism or a traumatic occlusion.</criteria>
