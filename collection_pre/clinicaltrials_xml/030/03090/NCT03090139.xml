	<brief_title>Sub-optimal Response to Anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor's in Inflammatory Bowel Disease in Emerging Markets</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants with historical diagnosis of CD and UC who were na√Øve to anti-TNF therapy were observed in this retrospective study. The study will look to identify the local barriers in prescribing anti-TNF therapy, treatment patterns and indicators of sub-optimal response to anti-TNF therapy in UC and CD participants in real-world clinical practice in the EM countries, along with the associated incidence of sub-optimal response and impact on health care resource utilization (HCRU). The will enroll approximately 2000 participants. The study consists of two periods, eligibility period followed by a data abstraction period. During the eligibility period participants who had initiated first anti-TNF therapy during 01 March 2010 up to 01 March 2015 will be recruited and observed. Participants will be followed up for a period of minimum 2 years (other than death) and a maximum of 5 years from the date of first treatment of anti-TNF therapy for CD and UC (Index date). During the data abstraction period participants who have eligible medical charts will be identified and all retrospective data will be collected. This multi-center trial will be conducted in Argentina, China, Colombia, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan and Turkey. The overall time to abstract data during the data extraction period from the web-based electronic data capture (EDC) system will be approximately 1 year from March 2017 to February 2018.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Who are 18 years or older at Index Date and diagnosed with UC or CD. 2. Who were naive to antiTNF therapy and received their first dose of any antiTNF therapy (index date) for UC or CD within the Eligibility Period from 01 March 2010 through 01 March 2015. 1. Diagnosed with indeterminate/unspecified type of IBD. 2. Were part of an IBDrelated clinical trial during the observational period should be excluded (that is, index date up to the date of chart abstraction). 3. Who received an antiTNF therapy for any nonUC or nonCD conditions (example, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriasis, or cancer). 4. Who received an antiTNF/biologic therapy at any point that was administered outside of the labelled dosing regimen (example, episodic use of antiTNF therapy). 5. With UC who had a total colectomy prior to their first antiTNF therapy. 6. Charts not available.</criteria>
