	<brief_summary>Total hip arthroplasty can be associated with significant postoperative pain. Side effects of pain management may impair participation in physical therapy and slow readiness for discharge from the hospital. In a previous study done by the investigators' group, epidural patient controlled analgesia (EPCA) with a hydromorphone containing solution appeared to have a more favorable pain profile with ambulation, but greater side effects compared to injection of a peri-articular cocktail. The use of opioid was greater in the peri-articular injection group (PAI). There was no difference in length of stay. In view of the controversy over opioid use, the investigators would like to develop an optimal opioid sparing pain management approach by comparing 3 different protocols 1) Plain local anesthetic EPCA; 2) PAI; 3) EPCA + PAI; all in conjunction with a multimodal opioid sparing pain regimen. The goal would be to maximize pain control while minimizing opioid use and side-effects.</brief_summary>
