	<brief_title>Soft Tissue Volume Gain and Stability Comparing Palate and Tuberosity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Understanding the importance of the soft tissue around implants have lead clinicians to develop surgical approaches to augment it. The majority of them, are described as bilaminar techniques obtaining a subephitelial connective tissue graft (SCTG) from the palate (P). However, recent studies have demonstrated that tuberosity (T) tissue is a very dense and coarse tissue that seems to contain more collagen and less fat and glandular tissue than that from the P, and therefore may have better tissue qualities for soft tissue augmentation, but there is limited scientific evidence comparing these areas. The main goal of this study is to compare the soft tissue volume gain and stability around implants in cases where a SCTG of the same dimensions from the P or T is used randomly. To calculate volume changes and stability an intraoral optical scan is used and three-dimensional images superimposed. The secondary goal is to compare histologically both tissues and changes in clinical parameters. Histomorphometry and immunohistochemistry evaluating levels of Type I-III collagen, long lysyl hydroxylase, matrix metalloproteinase 1-2, and monoclonal antibody against cytokeratin 4-10-13 is performed.</detailed_description>
