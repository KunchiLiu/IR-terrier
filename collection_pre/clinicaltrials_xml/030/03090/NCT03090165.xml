	<brief_title>Ribociclib and Bicalutamide in AR+ TNBC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OUTLINE: This is a multi-center study. INVESTIGATIONAL TREATMENT: - bicalutamide - 150mg po daily D1 - D28 (Cycle = 28 days) - ribociclib po daily D1 - D21 of 28 day cycle PHASE I SAFETY RUN-IN COHORT: The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of bicalutamide in combination with ribociclib will be determined using a standard "3+3" design. The first cohort of 3 subjects will receive ribociclib 400mg po daily D1 - D21 of a 28 day cycle (Dose Level 1). If no DLTs are experienced then the next cohort of 3 subjects will receive ribociclib 400mg po daily D1 - D28 of a 28 day cycle (Dose Level 2). If no DLTs are experienced then the next cohort of 3 subjects will receive ribociclib 600mg po daily D1 - D21 of a 28 day cycle (Dose Level 3). If no DLTs are experienced on Dose Level 3, then 3 additional subjects should be treated at this level before declaring MTD. DLTs will be assessed within the first cycle (28 days). PHASE II INVESTIGATIONAL TREATMENT: - co-therapy bicalutamide 150mg po daily D1 - D28 - ribociclib po at the RP2D as determined in the Phase I Safety Run-In Cohort Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 0 or 1 within 28 days prior to registration Life expectancy of &gt; 12 weeks as determined by the treating physician. Hematological: - White blood cell (WBC) ≥4 × 10^9/L - Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) ≥1.5 × 10^9/L - Hemoglobin (Hb) ≥9 g/dL - Platelets (Plt) ≥100 × 10^9/L Renal: - Creatinine ≤1.5 mg/dL OR - Calculated creatinine clearance ≥50 ml/min using the Cockcroft-Gault formula Hepatic: - Bilirubin ≤upper limit of normal (ULN)* - Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤2.5 × ULN or ≤5 × ULN if liver mets. - Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤2.5 × ULN or ≤5 × ULN if liver mets. * For subjects with Gilbert's syndrome, this will apply to direct bilirubin only.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Metastatic or unresectable AR+ triplenegative breast cancer (TNBC); AR positivity assessed centrally and defined as immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of &gt;0% of tumor nuclei. Written informed consent and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) authorization for release of personal health information. NOTE: HIPAA authorization may be included in the informed consent or obtained separately. One prior line of therapy is allowed. Age ≥ 18 years at the time of consent. Measurable disease according to RECIST 1.1 within 28 days prior to registration. No active central nervous system (CNS) metastatic disease. NOTE: Subjects with CNS involvement must meet ALL of the following to be eligible: At least 28 days from prior definitive treatment of their CNS disease by surgical resection, stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) or whole brain radiation treatment (WBRT) at the time of registration AND asymptomatic and off systemic corticosteroids and/or enzymeinducing antiepileptic medications for brain metastases for &gt;14 days prior to registration. Prior cancer treatment must be completed at least 14 days prior to registration and the subject must have recovered from all reversible acute toxic effects of the regimen (other than alopecia) to ≤grade 1 or to baseline prior to initiation of that therapy. Screening ratecorrected QT interval (QTc) must be &lt;450msec and a resting heart rate of at least 5090 bpm via a standard 12lead ECG within 28 days prior to registration. Females of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 7 days prior to registration. NOTE: Females are considered of child bearing potential unless they are surgically sterile (have undergone a hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral oophorectomy), or they are naturally postmenopausal for at least 12 consecutive months, or her male partner has had a vasectomy at least 6 months prior to screening (The sterilized male partner must be her only sexual partner.). Females of childbearing potential and males must be willing to abstain from heterosexual activity or must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method) for the duration of study participation and for 3 weeks after discontinuation of study treatment.
