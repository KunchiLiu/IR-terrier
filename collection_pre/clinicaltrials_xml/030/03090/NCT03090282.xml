	<brief_summary>The investigators planed to observe the microbiome of an aggressive periodontitis patient, during mechanical treatment, surgery(if indicated) and implant placement. The investigators designed to observe the changes after mechanical treatment.Then, the investigators will compare the sub-mucosa microbiome of implant and the subgingival community. The investigators expected a different community after treatment, and there could be similarity between implant and nature teeth.</brief_summary>
