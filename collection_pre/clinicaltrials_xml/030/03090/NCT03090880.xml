	<detailed_description>Adult patients aged ≥ 18 years with stage IV lung cancer and elevated D-dimer will be randomized to the experimental or control group.Patients in the control group will receive usual care, patients in the experimental group will receive subcutaneous tinzaparin once daily for six months. Follow-up visit will take place in outpatient clinic at day 90, day 180 and day 360. Blood sampling for biomarkers will be performed at inclusion visit and day 90.</detailed_description>
