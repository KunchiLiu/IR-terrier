	<brief_summary>The study included 20 adult patients presented by multiple fractured ribs (flail segment) with thoracic trauma severity score (TTSS) between 5 and 15. All patients received mid-thoracic epidural analgesia with 0.125% Bupivacaine and 1 μg/ml fentanyl. The patients were ventilated using non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV). Follow up arterial blood gases, chest X-ray and CT scan were obtained. Parameters to be recorded: Patient's characteristics and clinical data including pulmonary contusion, number of fractured ribs, pleural involvement, PaO2/FiO2 ratio on admission, weaning outcome, duration of NIPPV, length of stay in ICU (LOS ICU), complications and mortality rate.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>20 Patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria were submitted to strapping and packing in the form of dressing and fixing with elastoplast. All patients were ventilated using NIPPV (Engstrom Carestation), which was delivered to the patient through full-face mask and was started with pressure support of 8-12 cmH2O and PEEP of 3-5 cmH2O and gradually increased in 2 cmH2O steps. When patients tolerate FiO2 ≤ 0.5 with pressure support ≤ 8 cmH2O and PEEP ≤ 5 cmH2O for &gt; 6 consecutive hours, withdrawal from NIPPV was attempted daily in 30 minutes spontaneous breathing trials. Therapy was considered successful if endotracheal intubation was avoided and the patient could be discharged from the ICU. During this period follow up arterial blood gases, chest X-rays and CT scans were obtained.</detailed_description>
