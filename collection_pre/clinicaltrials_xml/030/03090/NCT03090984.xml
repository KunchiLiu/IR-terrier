	<brief_summary>Every patient included in the study will undergo 3 standardised hemodialysis treatments, each using a different dialysis membrane (PMMA, PS, AN69ST). The order of the membranes used will be randomized. During each conventional and standardised hemodialysis treatment, 6 blood samples will be taken at different time points (T0, T5, T15, T30, T90, T240) to evaluate coagulation activation (TAT, PF1+2, d-dimers, TF) and, more specifically, activation of the contact phase pathway of coagulation (kallikrein, fXIa, fXIIa).</brief_summary>
