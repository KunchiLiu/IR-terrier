	<brief_summary>This phase II pilot study aims at evaluating the benefits and the risks of methylphenidate (ConcertaÂ®) for the treatment of cocaine/crack dependence in terms of cocaine/crack use reduction and adverse events.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Methylphenidate for Cocaine Dependence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients will receive pharmacotherapy based on methylphenidate (18 mg per tablet) with a 3-week titration phase to a maximum dose of 108 mg per day, with a weekly follow-up during 3 months. Socio-demographic and behavioral data will be collected through phone interviews every month. During medical visits, self-administered and clinical questionnaires will collect clinical and behavioral data. Urine drug toxicologies and blood sampling will be performed to gather biological, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data. This study should identify an effective response-dose of methylphenidate for people with a cocaine use disorder. The methylphenidate should be effective to reduce cocaine use in cocaine-dependent individuals with a good tolerability. The results of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analyses will give us the effective dose of methylphenidate and some information on toxicity to adapt the surveillance in a future clinical trial.</detailed_description>
