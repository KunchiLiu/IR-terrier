	<brief_summary>The study evaluate paraspinal aerobic metabolism of chronic low back pain patients and healthy people during an original and standardized isokinetic protocol. The aim of this study is to determine a potential alteration of muscular aerobic metabolism in low back pain patients, in order to establish the underlying cause of pain and muscular fatigability characterizing low back pain patients. Then, the aim is to determine if functional rehabilitation program can improve it. the unit of care have access to metabolic adaptations in measuring the muscular oxygenation and the pulmonary oxygen consumption, using near infrared spectroscopy and gas analyser.</brief_summary>
