	<brief_summary>A Phase 2b, 8-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study to evaluate the effect of 3 different dose levels of IX-01 on IELT and patient-reported outcome in men with lifelong PE. Men with self-reported lifelong PE (International Society for Sexual Medicine (ISSM) definition) and in stable heterosexual relationship will undergo a 4-week run-in period during which they will be asked to attempt intercourse at least 4 times. Men with IELT ≤ 1 minute on at least 75% of attempts at intercourse during the no-treatment run-in period will be randomized for the double-blind phase of the study. In the double-blind phase of the study, men will be asked to take study drug 1 to 6 hours prior to sexual activity. Men and partners will be asked to attempt intercourse a minimum of 8 times during the 8 week double-blind study treatment. The patient or partner will record the IELT on each occasion by use of a stopwatch.</brief_summary>
