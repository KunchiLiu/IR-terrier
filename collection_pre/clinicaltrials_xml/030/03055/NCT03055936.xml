As an exception, paracetamol for occasional pain is allowed. Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory value or ECG (such as prolonged QTcF &gt;450 ms or QRS &gt;120 ms) that in the opinion of the investigator could interfere with the interpretation of study results or cause a health risk for the subject if he takes part in the study.

History of vasovagal collapses or vagal reactions with unexplained reason within the previous 2 years or a tendency for vasovagal reactions during blood sampling. HR &lt; 50 bpm or &gt; 90 bpm in the supine position after 5 min rest at the screening visit. At the screening visit: systolic BP &lt; 100 mmHg or &gt; 140 mmHg in the supine position after 5 min rest diastolic BP &lt; 50 mmHg or &gt; 90 mmHg in the supine position after 5 min rest. Creatinine &gt; 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) and alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase &gt;1.25 x ULN at screening. History of anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions. Strong tendency to motion sickness. Recent or current (suspected) drug abuse. Recent or current alcohol abuse; regular drinking of more than 21 units per week (1 unit = 4 cl spirits or equivalent). Current use of nicotinecontaining products more than 5 cigarettes (or equivalent)/day and/or inability to refrain from the use of nicotinecontaining products for 48 h before the first dose in each period until collection of the 24 h PK sample in the morning of day 8. Use of caffeinecontaining beverages more than 600 mg of caffeine/day and/or inability to refrain from using caffeinecontaining beverages 24 h before the first levodopa administration on the PK day (day 7) until collection of the 24 h PK sample in the morning of day 8. Blood donation or loss of a significant amount of blood (&gt; 500 ml) within 90 days before the first study treatment administration. Participation in another investigational drug study or administration of another investigational drug within 60 days before the first study treatment administration. Veins unsuitable for repeated venipuncture or cannulation. Predictable poor compliance or inability to communicate well with the study centre personnel.
