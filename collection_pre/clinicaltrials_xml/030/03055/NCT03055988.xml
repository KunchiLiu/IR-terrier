	<brief_summary>The objectives of the study are to explore the effect of treatment with tiotropium + olodaterol fixed dose combination (FDC) compared to fluticasone propionate + salmeterol FDC on: - reversal of left ventricular diastolic dysfunction assessed with cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging, - measures of arterial stiffness assessed by CMR and pulse wave analysis (PWA), - reduction of hyperinflation assessed with body plethysmography and - post dose spirometry.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: All patients must sign an informed consent consistent with International Council on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice (ICHGCP) guidelines prior to participation in the trial, which includes medication washout and restrictions. All patients must have a diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease for which they are treated with one or more longacting inhaled bronchodilators prior to enrolment and must meet the following spirometric criteria: Patients must have stable airway obstruction with a postbronchodilator FEV1 &lt; 70% of predicted normal calculated with European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) formulas, and a postbronchodilator FEV1/FVC &lt; 70% at Visit 1 Patients with hyperinflation at rest defined as Functional Residual capacity (FRC) &gt; 120 % predicted, with postbronchodilator reversibility greater than and equal to 7,5 % predicted at Visit 1. Male or female patients between 40 and 75 years of age (inclusive) on day of signing informed consent. Patients with a smoking history of more than 10 pack years. Patients with Modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) Dyspnoea score &gt; 1 at Visit 1. Patients must be able to perform technically acceptable pulmonary function tests (spirometry and body plethysmography), Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR), brachial blood pressure measurements with Pulse Wave Analysis (PWA) and other tests during the study period as required in the protocol. Patients must be able to inhale medication in a competent manner from the Respimat and Accuhaler inhalers and from a metered dose inhaler (MDI). Exclusion criteria: Patients with a significant disease other than Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). Patients with a clinically relevant abnormal baseline haematology, blood chemistry, or creatinine. Patients with a diagnosis of asthma. Patients with a COPD exacerbation in the 6 weeks prior to screening (Visit 1) and patients who experience COPD exacerbation or respiratory tract infection during the washout phase prior to randomisation. A history of myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular event or coronary artery intervention other than Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) within 1 year of screening. Abnormal and clinically significant 12lead Electrocardiogram (ECG). Hospitalized for heart failure within the past year. Current severe heart failure (New York Heart Association (NYHA) class IV. Ejection fraction &lt;= 40% from Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) baseline assessment. Patients with systolic blood pressure &gt; 140mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure &gt; 90mmHg at Visit 1. A diagnosis of thyrotoxicosis. Known active tuberculosis, cardiac sarcoidosis. Any malignancy unless free of disease for at least five years. A history of cystic fibrosis. Clinically evident bronchiectasis. Patients with severe emphysema requiring endobronchial interventions within 6 months prior to screening. A history of significant alcohol or drug abuse. Patients who have undergone thoracotomy with pulmonary resection. Patients being treated with any oral ßadrenergics. Patients being treated with oral corticosteroid medication at unstable doses (i.e., less than four weeks on a stable dose) or at doses in excess of the equivalent of 10 mg of prednisone per day or 20 mg every other day. Patients being prescribed longterm home oxygen treatment. Patients who have completed a pulmonary rehabilitation program in the six weeks prior to the screening visit or patients who are currently in a pulmonary rehabilitation program. Patients who have taken an investigational drug within one month or six half lives (whichever is greater) prior to screening visit. Patients with known hypersensitivity to ßadrenergics drugs, anticholinergic drugs, fluticasone propionate or to any of the excipiens, Benzalkonium chloride (BAC), Disodium edentate (EDTA) or Lactose monohydrate (which contains milk proteins) or any other component of the Respimat® or Accuhaler® delivery systems. Women who are pregnant, nursing, or who plan to become pregnant while in the trial. Women of childbearing potential not using highly effective methods of birth control. Patients who have previously been enrolled in this study or are currently enrolled in another study. Patient who are unable to comply with pulmonary medication restrictions prior to randomisation Patients with pacemakers and metal implants (i.e. vascular clips and stents, metal silver in patient's eye) and patients with claustrophobia, due to contraindications for CMR.</criteria>
