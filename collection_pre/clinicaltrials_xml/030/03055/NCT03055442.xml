	<brief_summary>Considering the importance assumed by follicular microenvironment for a proper oocyte development, this study is a prospective observational clinical trial which aims to evaluate whether the embryo blastocyst quality may be affected by different Myo-inositol (MI) and D-chiro-inositol (DCI) levels in the follicular fluid (FF) of the aspired oocytes. The study includes egg donors and egg receiving couples participating in the oocyte donation program. MI/DCI is calculated in FF and related with blastocyst grade.</brief_summary>
