	<brief_summary>This study evaluates the effects of infant formula with higher protein level and improved fat blend on growth and feeding tolerance in preterm infants. Half of the subjects will receive a standard infant formula, while the other half will receive a infant formula with a higher protein level and improved fat blend.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Effects of a Formula With Modified Protein Levels and Fat Blend in Preterm Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>When an infant is born prematurely, the supply of nutrients supporting normal growth and development is interrupted. There is less time to accrue adequate nutrient stores and foetal tissue. The nutritional goal for the preterm infant is to have satisfactory functional development and catch up on growth to match the rate of a full term infant. To achieve this, it is recommended for the infant to have adequate protein intake and suitable fat blend.</detailed_description>
