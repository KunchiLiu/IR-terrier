	<brief_title>Combination of Ibuprofen, G-CSF and Plerixafor as Stem Cells Mobilization Regimen in Patients Affected by X-CGD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We designed a mobilization trial with the aim of collecting a sufficient number of HSPC in X-CGD patients; it is well known that this procedure is challenging for these patients, potentially due to functional defects induced by their chronic inflammatory state. The combination of G-CSF and Plerixafor is considered state of the art for HSPC harvest in gene therapy trials; we considered to add a non-steroidal inflammatory drug to increase HSPC mobilization and reduce inflammation that could have a role in altering HSPC content. If this trial confirms the synergistic effect of the three drugs under investigation, such a regimen will be considered for a HSPC mobilization in future gene therapy trial for X-CGD patients.</detailed_description>
