	<brief_summary>The goal of the COMprehensive EXercise (COMEX) pilot study is to test feasibility, tolerability and adherence of this novel video-based intra-dialytic chair exercise program for hemodialysis patients over 3 months.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>COMEX Study for Dialysis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators incorporated patient-provider preferences of the key stakeholders, and used a multi-disciplinary team with experts in physical therapy, psychology and nephrology to develop a comprehensive exercise program for HD patients. Aim of this pilot study is to assess the feasibility, tolerability and adherence to COMEX over 3 months and inform design of future randomized controlled trial. A secondary goal is to explore molecular mechanisms in muscle and blood of exercise adaptation in HD patients</detailed_description>
