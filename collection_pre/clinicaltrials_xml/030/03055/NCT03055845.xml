	<brief_summary>A phase I, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, single ascending dose study to investigate the safety, local tolerability and transformation of nucleus pulposus following intradiscal injection of STA363 or placebo in patients with discogenic low back pain. 15 patients will participate in either of 3 dose groups, each comprising 5 patients: - Group 1: STA363 dose 1 (3 patients) or placebo (2 patients) - Group 2: STA363 dose 2 (3 patients) or placebo (2 patients) - Group 3: STA363 dose 3 (3 patients) or placebo (2 patients)</brief_summary>
