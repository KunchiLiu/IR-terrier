	<brief_summary>The particpant will complete baseline testing by measuring subjects' quadriceps muscle thickness (cm) via ultrasound technology, as well as have them complete a one repetition maximum (1RM) test on the leg press machine and an isometric knee extension using a dynamometer - strength measures will be calculated for both right and left legs. After baseline testing, subjects will complete 6 weeks of the testing protocol that will consist of leg press exercises at 30% of their 1RM. Subjects will be randomized to either wear a cuff that partially restricts blood flow to the limb (Study Group), or to wear a cuff that does not restrict blood flow (Control Group). Exercises will be completed 2x/week and will take approximately 10 total minutes (5 for warm up, 5 for testing protocol) per session. After 6 weeks, muscle thickness, leg press 1RM, and quadriceps extension strength will be re-tested and compared to the initial measurements.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Low Intensity Blood Flow Restriction Training Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Session 1 - baseline testing - 5-minute warm-up; 1RM calculation for both right and left legs using a supine leg press machine; isometric quadriceps strength measurement using a dynamometer; muscle thickness measurements of both right and left quadriceps muscle using ultrasound technology. - After day 1 testing; randomly allocate subjects to either control group or experimental group Sessions 2-13 - 6 weeks of exercise protocol, 2x/per week Both the experimental and control groups will complete the same protocol for the entirety of the study: - 5- minute warm up - Using a single-leg press exercise machine: Subjects complete the testing protocol with either partial blood flow restriction (cuff inflated to 100-250 mmhg depending on size of person) or no blood flow restriction (placebo inflation) on right limb. - Protocol: 30 repetitions - 15 repetitions - 15 repetitions - 15 repetitions with each set separated by ~30-90 seconds. - Right and left legs will be alternating, but only one leg will have the occlusion cuff Session 14 - Re-test - Re-check 1RM, isometric quad strength, as well as muscle thickness of quadriceps with ultrasound</detailed_description>
