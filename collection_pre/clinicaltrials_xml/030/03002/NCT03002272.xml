	<brief_title>Transcatheter Aortic Prosthesis Function: A Long-term Follow-up Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There is limited available information on long term TAVR valve function. In this observational study, we will enroll subjects who underwent TAVR or SAVR more than 3 years ago. Clinical and procedural data from the implant/surgery will be collected, alongside clinical and echocardiographic data from subsequent follow-up visits. Up-to-date echocardiography will be performed and analyzed in a Core Lab to assess valve function yearly.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Inclusion criteria for TAVR subjects a) TAVR performed more than 3 years ago Exclusion criteria 1. Subjects unable to consent to participate, unless the subject has a legally authorized representative 2. Subjects unwilling to participate 3. Subject has undergone reintervention to prosthetic aortic valve since TAVR procedure (e.g. balloon valvuloplasty, SAVR, redo TAVR, paravalvular leak closure) 4. Echocardiographic evidence of prosthetic valve dysfunction within first 3 years postTAVR (mean aortic gradient ≥20mmHg AND/OR moderatesevere transvalvular aortic regurgitation) Inclusion criteria for SAVR subjects 1. SAVR performed more than 3 years ago 2. Propensity matched to an enrolled TAVR subject Exclusion criteria for SAVR subjects e) Subjects unable to consent to participate, unless the subject has a legally authorized representative f) Subjects unwilling to participate g) Subject has undergone reintervention to prosthetic aortic valve since TAVR procedure (e.g. balloon valvuloplasty, SAVR, redo TAVR, paravalvular leak closure) h) Echocardiographic evidence of prosthetic valve dysfunction within first 3 years postSAVR (mean aortic gradient ≥20mmHg AND/OR moderatesevere transvalvular aortic regurgitation)</criteria>
