	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to determine the routes of excretion for JNJ-53718678 and its metabolites, to explore the metabolic pathways of JNJ-53718678, and to determine the chemical structure of predominant metabolites in healthy adult male participants after a single oral dose of 500 milligram (mg) 14C-JNJ-53718678.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Characterize the Absorption, Metabolism, and Excretion of 14C-JNJ-53718678 After a Single Oral Dose in Healthy Male Participants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>A male participant: a) Must be sexually abstinent (defined as refraining from sexual intercourse from Day 1 (day of dosing) until 90 days after study drug administration), OR b) Who is sexually active (either heterosexual, including with a pregnant woman, or homosexual) must agree to use a barrier method of contraception (eg, condom) from Day 1 (day of dosing) until 90 days after study drug administration, AND c) Who is sexually active with a woman of childbearing potential must agree to use a barrier method of contraception (eg, condom) from Day 1 (day of dosing) until 90 days after study drug administration, in conjunction with this female partner using a highly effective contraceptive (such as implantable progestogenonly hormone contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation; intrauterine device; intrauterine hormonereleasing system, combined [estrogen and progestogen containing] hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation: oral, intravaginal, or transdermal; progestogenonly hormone contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation: oral or injectable) d) Must agree not to donate sperm from Day 1 (day of dosing) until 90 days after study drug administration Participant must have a body mass index (BMI; weight in kg divided by the square of height in meters) of 18.0 to 30.0 kilogram per square meter (kg/m^2) Participant must have a blood pressure (after the participant is supine for 5 minutes) between 90 and 140 millimeter of mercury (mmHg) systolic, inclusive, and no higher than 90 mmHg diastolic Participant must have a normal 12lead electrocardiogram (ECG) (based on the mean value of triplicate ECG parameters), consistent with normal cardiac conduction and function at screening, including: a) normal sinus rhythm (heart rate between 45 and 90 beats per minute (bpm), extremes included); b)mean QT interval corrected for heart rate according to Fridericia formula (QTcF) interval lesser than or equal to (&lt;=)450 millisecond (ms); c) mean QRS interval of &lt;110 ms; d) mean PR interval &lt;200 ms; e) morphology consistent with healthy cardiac conduction and function Participants must be healthy on the basis of a medical evaluation that reveals the absence of any clinically relevant abnormality and includes a physical examination (including height and body weight measurement and skin examination), medical history, vital signs (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate, orthostatic blood pressure changes, respiratory rate, and body temperature), creatinine clearance (below 60 milliliter per minute (mL/min) at screening using CockroftGault equation), and the results of blood biochemistry, blood coagulation, and hematology tests, and a urinalysis performed at screening, on Day 1, or predose on Day 1, whichever is applicable. If there are abnormalities, with the exception of those described in the in and exclusion criteria, the participant may be included only if the investigator judges the abnormalities or deviations from normal to be not clinically significant. This determination must be recorded in the participant's source documents and initialed by the investigator Participants with a removed gallbladder, or with a history of upper gastrointestinal (stomach, duodenum) surgery, or with a recent (less than 3 months prior to screening) episode of gallbladder stones Participants with a history of heart arrhythmias (extrasystoles, tachycardia at rest) or history of risk factors for Torsade de Pointes syndrome (example, hypokalemia, family history of long QT syndrome) Participant has intolerance to xylocaine, lactose, or midazolam Participant has a history of hepatitis A antibody immunoglobulin M (IgM), hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg), or hepatitis C virus antibody (antiHCV) positive, or other clinically active liver disease, or tests positive for hepatitis A antibody IgM, HBsAg or anti HCV at screening Participant has a history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody positive, or tests positive for HIV at screening</criteria>
