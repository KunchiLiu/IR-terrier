	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate the Safety of Intramuscular Injections of PLX-R18 in Subjects With Incomplete Hematopoietic Recovery Following Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>1. Age ≥18 years. 2. At least 6 months after HCT. 3. Sustained platelet count ≤50,000/µL and/or sustained Hgb ≤8 g/dL, related to the nature of the graft. 4. Stable donor cell chimerism. 5. If the subject had allogeneic HCT for a malignant disease, the subject should have complete donor chimerism. 6. ANC ≥1,000/mm3 at the time of screening. 7. General performance status evaluated by Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 02 scale. 8. Signed written informed consent. 1. Evidence of active malignancy at the time of HCT or at any time since the HCT. 2. Other known etiology of the thrombocytopenia (such as infection, medication, etc.). 3. Other known etiology of the anemia (such as blood loss, iron deficiency, etc.). 4. Current active infection requiring systemic treatment. 5. Acute graft versus host disease (GvHD) Grade III or IV, or severe chronic GvHD at the time of screening. 6. Treatment with cytokines, including thrombopoietin, erythropoietin, granulocyte colony stimulating factor (GCSF), granulocytemacrophage colony stimulating factor (GMCSF) in the last 4 weeks prior to treatment, or currently planned for the subject. 7. Subject has received prophylactic treatment with donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) within 6 months prior to treatment, or any other cell therapy within 3 months prior to treatment. 8. History of malignancy (other than the disease that required the HCT) within 5 years prior to screening. 9. History of significant transfusion reaction. 10. Known allergies to any of the following: dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), human serum albumin, bovine serum albumin, gentamicin, or antihistamine. 11. History of allergic/hypersensitivity reaction to any substance having required hospitalization and/or treatment with intravenous steroids/epinephrine. 12. Medical history of human immunodeficiency virus or syphilis infection. 13. Known active hepatitis B or hepatitis C infection at the time of screening. 14. A pregnant or lactating woman or a woman who plans to become pregnant during the study. 15. Serum Creatinine level &gt;2.5 mg/dL. 16. Serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (alanine aminotransferase), serum oxaloacetic pyruvic transaminase (aspartate aminotransferase) &gt;2.5 x upper limit of normal range. 17. International normalized ration (INR) &gt;2 or subjects who are on oral anticoagulant therapy with INR &gt;2 unless anticoagulation treatment can be safely interrupted/discontinued around each investigational product (IP) treatment. 18. Severe or uncontrolled/unstable cardiac, pulmonary, or renal disease, including myocardial infarction or cerebrovascular accident within 3 months prior to treatment. 19. History of solid organ transplantation. 20. Signs and symptoms of active central nervous system disease. 21. Life expectancy &lt;6 months</criteria>
