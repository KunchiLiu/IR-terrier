	<brief_summary>Community colleges have 45% of the nation's undergraduates and have a higher smoking prevalence rate than 4-year colleges. California's community colleges comprise the nation's largest higher education system, and Sacramento has the second largest community college district. As more colleges are encouraged to become smoke and tobacco-free campuses, smokers enrolled at community college campuses need greater support. However, community colleges may lack the student health clinic resources that 4-year colleges have for students who live on campus. Little evidence to date demonstrates effective interventions for smokers on community college campuses. This pilot study seeks to demonstrate the feasibility and promising outcomes of two cessation interventions, compared with usual care on a community college campus. The first intervention was based on a promising model of brief motivational interviewing delivered by peer educators, developed by the community lead Breathe California of Sacramento-Emigrant Trails (BCSET) through the Sacramento Taking Action Against Tobacco Dependence (STAND) project. The second intervention was based on direct enrollment into the California Smokers' Helpline, which has demonstrated utility for promoting smoking cessation among young adults with low socioeconomic status. Usual care consisted of students going to the student health center for smoking cessation assistance.</brief_summary>
