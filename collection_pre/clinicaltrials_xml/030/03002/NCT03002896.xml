	<brief_summary>The proposed project is a pilot randomized control trial of the Pep-Pal (Psychoeducation and Skills Based Intervention) versus a treatment as usual control group. A total of 120 caregivers; 40 caregivers of patients with HSCT (Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation), 40 caregivers of patients enrolled in phase I oncology trials, and 40 caregivers of patients with advanced cancer (Stage IV, solid tumor) will be enrolled in this study. The investigators do not expect different outcomes from these three groups, rather these populations are selected to optimize recruitment within a short time frame. The caregivers will be randomized to either treatment as usual or Pep-Pal intervention.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The proposed project is a pilot randomized control trial of the Pep-Pal intervention versus a treatment as usual control group. A total of 120 caregivers; 40 caregivers of patients with HSCT, 40 caregivers of patients enrolled in phase I oncology trials, and 40 caregivers of patients with advanced cancer (Stage IV, solid tumor) will be enrolled in this study. The investigators do not expect different outcomes from these three groups, rather these populations are selected to optimize recruitment within a short time frame. The caregivers will be randomized to either treatment as usual or Pep-Pal intervention. The proposed study population is based on prior research indicating that caregivers of patients receiving HSCT, caregivers of patients enrolled in phase I oncology trials, and caregivers of patients with advanced cancer experience significant distress. In addition, an initial study of caregivers of patients receiving allogeneic-HSCT were able to benefit from a brief, cognitive behavioral stress management treatment approach. A study examining distress in phase I oncology clinical trial patient caregivers highlighted the need for more support for this significantly distressed population. Furthermore, initial results of the qualitative development study for Pep-Pal yielded support for a mobilized platform delivery of resources for caregivers to manage distress because they acknowledged many barriers to engaging in in-person treatment to manage distress.</detailed_description>
