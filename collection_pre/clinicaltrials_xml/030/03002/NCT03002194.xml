	<brief_title>Change in Skin Elasticity With RF and PEMF</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is an open-label, baseline-controlled, single-center study to measure the change in skin elasticity after combined radio frequency (RF) and pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMF) treatment. Forty-five adult females will undergo weekly treatments over a period of 8 weeks. Skin elasticity will be measured by a Cutometer® prior to beginning treatment, week 7 and 3 months after completion of treatment. Photographs will be taken prior to treatment, at week 4, week 7 and 3 months after completion of treatment. Patient discomfort/pain and satisfaction questionnaires will be completed before, during and after treatment.</detailed_description>
