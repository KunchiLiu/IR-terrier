	<brief_title>EUS-guided Transenteric Drainage With a Novel Lumen-apposing Metal Stent</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with the following conditions would be recruited for drainage under EUS guidance with the new lumen apposing FCSEMS - Symptomatic or infected pancreatic pseudocyst or walled-off necrosis (WON) (SPAXUS 16 or 10 mm) - Acute cholecystitis by inoperable malignant diseases (SPAXUS 10 mm) - Acute cholecystitis by benign conditions with high-risk for operation (SPAXUS 10 mm) - Long-term cholecystostomy at high-risk for operation (SPAXUS 10 mm) - Symptomatic malignant obstruction of the distal CBD with unsuccessful transpapillary approach (the diameter of the CBD &gt; 10 mm) (SPAXUS 8 or 10 mm) Outcome paramaters include technical and clinical success, adverse events.</detailed_description>
