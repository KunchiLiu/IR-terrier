	<brief_summary>Based on evidence that radiation-induced damage to the hippocampus plays a considerable role in neurocognitive decline after cranial irradiation, hippocampal-sparing whole brain radiation therapy (HS-WBRT) has been proposed. This study will investigate the neurocognitive function and prognosis between HS-WBRT and conventional WBRT for the treatment of brain metastases from breast cancer.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Female patients with advanced breast cancer who is confirmed historically. New developing brain metastases (BM) is confirmed by gadolinium contrastenhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), with or without clinical symptoms and pathology, and without a history of BM treatment. At least 2 BM lesions with the diameter of the largest lesion &lt; 40 mm is eligible. And the distance from the border of a mass to the hippocampal margin should be more than 15 mm. The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) is from 0 to 2, and the expected life expectancy is â‰¥3 months. Concurrent chemoradiation. Patient who had received cranial irradiation previously. Patient who are enrolled in other clinical trial at the same time. Patient who has severe comorbidity or infection.</criteria>
