	<brief_summary>Objective: To confirm the psychometrics properties of the Intestinal Gas Questionnaire (IGQ) in subjects with Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) diagnosis and General population both complaining of Gas-Related Symptoms (GRS). IGQ has been developed previously simultaneously in UK English, French and Spanish through qualitative research with subject interviews. The conceptual framework of the IGQ assesses both GRS and their impact on daily life. Similar concepts were identified for both subjects with IBS diagnosis and general population and complaining of gas-related symptoms. The IGQ consists of a 24-hour recall symptom diary assessing 7 gas-related symptoms (17 items) and a 7-day recall questionnaire which assesses the impact of those symptoms (26 items)</brief_summary>
