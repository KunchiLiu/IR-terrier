	<brief_title>The Effects of Video Modeling of Audiological Testing on Pediatric Patient Compliance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of the current study is to determine if pre-exposure through video modeling will enhance testing compliance in a population of children who are receiving a diagnostic evaluation for Autism. Another purpose of this study is to determine if pre-exposure to the test setting can increase the compliance on individual test measures. To test the central hypothesis and accomplish the study objective, 2 aims guide the proposed study. 1. Determine the extent to which pre-exposure to expectations and tasks that occur during the audiological evaluation will increase audiological testing compliance. Hypothesis: Children receiving the intervention video, which will model what they will experience during the audiological evaluation, will show greater compliance during the evaluation than children who receive the placebo video. 2. Determine the extent to which enhanced testing compliance will increase the number of test measures obtained during an audiological evaluation. Hypothesis: Children who are more compliant during the audiological evaluation will allow the audiologist to obtain more test measures in a single appointment than the children who are less compliant.</detailed_description>
