	<detailed_description>The investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with three different formats of the same systematic review summary (Infographics, PLS, scientific abstract). The content of these three formats is based on the same systematic review, but the ways of data presentation will differ: visual presentation in plain language, plain language only, and text with scientific abbreviations. The interventions will be delivered online in January 2016, with physicians who are currently working at Clinical Hospital Split. The trial will be preformed online, and it will be voluntary and anonymous. The survey will consist of 5 parts, in the following order: 1) one format of the summary (randomly assigned), 2) health numeracy, 3) demographic data 4) comprehension test of the information given in the summary, and 5) user friendliness of information and overall satisfaction with the given summary assessed by survey.</detailed_description>
