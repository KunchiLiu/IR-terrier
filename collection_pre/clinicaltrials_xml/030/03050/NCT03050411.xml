	<brief_summary>Epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs), including gefitinib demonstrate excellent effect on the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with EGFR mutations. However, patients who are initially sensitive to the drugs eventually become resistance. Apatinib is a highly selective VEGFR2 inhibitor and reduces the angiogenesis of tumor efficiently. In this study, the investigators aim to explore the efficacy and reasonable dosage of apatinib combining with EGFR-TKI in advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer with EGFR-TKI resistance.</brief_summary>
