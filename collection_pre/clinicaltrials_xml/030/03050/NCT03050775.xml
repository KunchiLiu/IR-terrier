	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate patients' temperatures after using one of two ventilator circuits (breathing systems): the ANAPOD™ Heat and Humidification System (ANAPOD™ system) or the standard ventilator circuit with a heat-moisture exchanger (standard ventilator). The ANAPOD™ system will provide additional heat and humidity to patients through their breathing tube while the standard ventilator will not. The investigators are doing this research study to find out if the ventilator circuit providing additional heat and humidity will keep patients warmer during surgery and after surgery.</brief_summary>
