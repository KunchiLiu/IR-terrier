	<brief_summary>Fibromyalgia is a rheumatologic disease characterized by generalized chronic pain, hyperalgesia and allodynia. Physical exercises are recommended as the first choice of non-pharmacological therapy. Thus, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of modified Pilates method exercises compared to aerobic exercises in the treatment of patients with fibromyalgia. The hypothesis is that Pilates exercises will be as effective as aerobic exercise in the improvement of clinical outcomes, and that this improvement will be maintained over the medium to long term. It is also expected that aerobic exercises will be more cost-effective.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effectiveness and Cost-effectiveness of Modified Pilates Method Versus Aerobic Exercise in Patients With Fibromyalgia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fibromyalgia is a rheumatologic disease characterized by generalized chronic pain, hyperalgesia and allodynia. Physical exercises are recommended as the first choice of non-pharmacological therapy. Thus, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of modified Pilates method exercises compared to aerobic exercise in the treatment of patients with fibromyalgia. For this, the following outcomes of 98 patients will be evaluated by a blinded evaluator at baseline, 8 weeks, 6 and 12 months after randomization: fibromyalgia impact assessed by the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire, pain intensity assessed by the Pain Numerical Rating Scale, kinesiophobia assessed by the Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia, specific disability assessed by the Patient-Specific Functional Scale, functional capacity assessed by the 6-minute Walk Test, quality of sleep assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and health-related quality of life assessed by the EQ-5D-3L and SF-6D questionnaires. Participants will be randomly divided into Aerobic Group, who will perform aerobic exercises on treadmills and/or stationary bikes, and Pilates Group, which will perform exercises of the modified Pilates method. Both groups will be treated for eight weeks, twice a week. The hypothesis is that Pilates exercises will be as effective as aerobic exercise in the improvement of clinical outcomes, and that this improvement will be maintained over the medium to long term. It is also expected that aerobic exercises will be more cost-effective.</detailed_description>
