	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of an OA-specific aerobic and strengthening exercise program, delivered within the workplace, on mobility, pain, physical capacity, and resilience among workers with knee or hip OA as well as those with no joint pain. The investigators hypothesize that exercise designed for OA, delivered at work, will improve all of these outcomes.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The Canadian workforce is aging. The most prevalent age group is 50-54 years and most of these Canadians will aim to continue working over the next 10 years. However, the impact of arthritis on aging Canadians compromises their ability to continue working. By 2031, over 2 million Canadians aged 45 to 64 years will have arthritis. The investigators aim to boost the ability of adults with the most common arthritis, osteoarthritis (OA), as well as adults without OA, to engage in the workforce for as long as they desire. Identifying strategies to promote productivity among workers with knee and hip OA will be of great public health significance in the coming decades. However, the investigators face two challenges. First, obesity among sedentary workers is a risk for worsening knee and hip OA. Second, large occupational loads on the knee and hip worsen OA. Exercise has the most promise in addressing these challenges because it reduces pain and sick time, and improves mental health. Thus, there is a call for studies examining exercise for workers with knee and hip OA.</detailed_description>
