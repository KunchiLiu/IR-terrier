	<brief_title>Preventing Systemic Inflammation After Cardiac Surgery With Alkaline Phosphatase</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After cardiac surgery under cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) patients often show impairments of the immune system. Compared to placebo, CPB patients given alkaline phosphatase will have reduced composite endpoint of acute kidney injury, late extubation, gastrointestinal or neurological complications or death within 30 days.</detailed_description>
