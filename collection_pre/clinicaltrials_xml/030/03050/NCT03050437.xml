	<brief_summary>It has not been established whether platinum-based doublets is better than single agent chemotherapy in EGFR mutant NSCLC patients who failed first-line EGFR TKI. In this prospective trial, the investigators try to evaluate whether the progression-free survival of pemetrexed/cisplatin (PC) regimen is longer than that of pemetrexed single(P) regimen in NSCLC patients who have progressed after first line treatment of EGFR-TKI.</brief_summary>
