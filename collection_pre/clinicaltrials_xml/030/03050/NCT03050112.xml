	<brief_summary>Adults with a congenital heart disease, having undergone a surgical intervention or a re-do surgery in adulthood, are a growing group of subjects in the general population. This increase is explained by improved medical and surgical techniques, with a better survival rate as outcome. There is nowadays a growing interest in the quality of life of this group of subjects. However, studies give contradictory results. This can be explained on one hand by the vast majority of pathologies within this population, and on the other hand by the absence of a cardio-specific tool for quality of life measurement. The MacNew questionnaire is cardio-specific. It allows an evaluation of the quality of life based on the exploration of three domains: physical, emotional and social. The aim of this study is: - to evaluate the quality of life of these patients, by using the MacNew questionnaire - to explore the needs in terms of prevention, treatment and multi-disciplinary follow-up - to assess the mortality within this group of patients.</brief_summary>
