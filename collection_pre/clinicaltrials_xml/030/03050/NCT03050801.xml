	<brief_summary>Background: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) damages the connections between brain cells. This can lead to problems like memory loss. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) can help improve connections between brain areas in healthy people. Researchers want to see if it can be useful in patients with memory problems after TBI. Objective: To see how repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation can be used to improve the connections between parts of the brain and whether this will lead to changes in memory. Eligibility: Adults 18 50 years old with TBI who can speak and write in English. Healthy volunteers the same age and English ability. Design: Participants will be screened with a neurological exam and may have a urine pregnancy test. Participants with TBI will have 7-15 visits. Healthy volunteers will have 2-8. At the visits, participants will have all or some of the following: MRI for about 1 hour. They will lie in a machine that takes pictures in a magnetic field. They will do some memory tasks. Memory and attention tasks with pictures and with a computer Questions about their mental state and well-being TMS: A wire coil is held on the scalp and a short electrical current passes through it. Participants will hear a click and feel a pulling or twitch. They may be asked to make simple movements. rTMS is repeated magnetic pulses in short bursts. They will have this for about 20 minutes. A week after the last visit, some participants will return for a memory test.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Functional Connectivity as a Biomarker of rTMS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective: To use resting state functional connectivity (FC) as a biomarker of synaptic modulation by repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in paradigms intended to improve memory and learning and to pilot one such paradigm for improving memory in traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients. Ancillary outcomes include the effects of rTMS on the explicit and implicit memory systems and the potential effects of manipulating one system on the other. Study population: Healthy adult volunteers and patients with TBI Design: The study contains 3 experiments. Experiment 1 is designed to establish the number of rTMS sessions required to produce a meaningful change in resting parietohippocampal FC in healthy subjects. Experiment 2 will apply this information to an experiment aimed at enhancing fronto-striatal FC and, as a secondary outcome, enhancing implicit memory. This intervention will be contrasted with parietal stimulation and a negative control condition (vertex stimulation) in a between-groups design. In Experiment 3, we will adapt a paradigm used by others in healthy subjects to amnestic TBI patients in an effort to enhance parieto-hippocampal FC and, as a secondary outcome, explicit memory. This will be compared to negative control (vertex) stimulation in a within-subjects design Outcome measures: The primary outcome measure is the change in FC produced by serially applied rTMS. Secondary measures will be changes in explicit and implicit memory performance. We will explore whether white matter integrity predicts changes in FC in healthy subjects and patients.</detailed_description>
