	<brief_title>Study of Dupilumab Auto-injector Device When Used by Patients With Atopic Dermatitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study is conducted in 2 parts; part A and part B. Part A - Patients with moderate-to-severe AD will be randomized to receive dupilumab (dose 1) by auto-injector (AI) device or prefilled syringe.
