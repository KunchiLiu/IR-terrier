	<brief_title>Comprehensive Data Collection and Follow-Up for Patients With Thyroid, Parathyroid and Adrenal Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>If participant or participant's child agrees to take part in this study, information from the medical record will be recorded and entered into a research database at MD Anderson. Researchers will use this data to learn more about participant's or participant's child's current or suspected illness, surgery, and/or recovery as well as participant's or participant's child's medical history. Length of Study Participant's or participant's child's active participation on this study will be over after 15 years. Follow-Up Phone Calls Starting about 2-3 years after participant's or participant's child's testing and/or diagnosis and/or treatment and continuing for up to 15 years after participant's surgery, a member of the research team will contact participant by phone to follow up and see how participant or participant's child are doing. The first time participant receives a phone call or are asked in the clinic, participant will be asked for participant's verbal consent for participant or, if this is for participant's child, on behalf of participant's child, to speak to the member of the research team before participant or participant's child are asked any questions. After participant agrees, participant or participant's child will be asked a series of questions related to participant's or participant's child's disease (takes about 20-30 minutes) that ask about participant's or participant's child's current medical status and medical history. Each phone call should take 20-30 minutes to complete. If participant or participant's child are scheduled for a routine clinic visit around the time of participant's or participant's child's next follow-up phone call, the research team member may talk to participant or participant's child in person at that time, or a questionnaire can be mailed to participant or participant's child if needed. This is an investigational study. Up to 15,000 patients will be enrolled in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. All patients that are being seen at MD Anderson with diagnosed or suspected endocrine disease. Patients will be selected from patients undergoing evaluation and/or treatment in the Endocrine Center, either by selection from a participating Endocrine physician or by screening from study personnel for patients scheduled to be seen in the Endocrine Clinic. 2. In addition, we intend to contact family members of patients who are enrolled on the study, and found to be deceased at followup, to request permission to obtain cause of death, to determine whether cause of death may be related to endocrine disease.</criteria>
