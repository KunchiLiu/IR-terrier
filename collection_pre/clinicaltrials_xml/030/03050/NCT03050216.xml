	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria ((Recipient): Meets ONE of the following disease criteria: 1. Primary AML induction failure: no CR after 2 or more induction attempts 2. Relapsed AML or Secondary AML (from MDS or treatment related): not in CR after 1 or more cycles of standard reinduction therapy 3. AML relapsed &gt; 1 year after transplant: No reinduction required, and no more than 1 reinduction cycle is allowed. 4. Relapsed AML for patients &gt; 60 years of age the 1 cycle of standard chemotherapy is not required. 5. Available related HLAhaploidentical donor (aged 12 to 75 years) by at least Class I serologic typing at the A&amp;B locus 6. Karnofsky Performance Status ≥ 60% 7. Patients must have adequate organ within 14 days (28 days for pulmonary and cardiac) defined as: Creatinine: ≤ 2.0 mg/dL Hepatic: AST and ALT &lt; 3 x upper limit of institutional normal Pulmonary Function: oxygen saturation ≥ 90% on room air; PFT's required only if symptomatic or prior known impairment must have pulmonary function &gt;50% corrected DLCO and FEV1. Cardiac Function: LVEF ≥ 40% by echocardiography or MUGA, no uncontrolled angina, severe uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmias, or electrocardiographic evidence of acute ischemia or active conduction system abnormalities. . 8. Able to be off prednisone or other immunosuppressive medications for at least 3 days prior to NK cell infusion (excluding preparative regimen premedications). 9. Agrees to use contraception during therapy and for 4 months after completion of therapy. 10. Voluntary written consent prior to the performance of any research related procedures Exclusion Criteria (Recipient): 1. Acute leukemias of ambiguous lineage 2. Pregnant or breastfeeding The agents used in this study include those that fall under Pregnancy Category D have known teratogenic potential. Women of child bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test at screening. 3. Active autoimmune disease requiring immunosuppressive therapy. 4. History of severe asthma and currently on chronic medications (mild asthma requiring inhaled steroids only is eligible). 5. New or progressive pulmonary infiltrates on screening chest xray or chest CT scan unless cleared for study by Pulmonary. Infiltrates attributed to infection must be stable/improving (with associated clinical improvement) after 1 week of appropriate therapy (4 weeks for presumed or documented fungal infections). 6. Uncontrolled bacterial, fungal or viral infections including HIV1/2 or active hepatitis C/B chronic asymptomatic viral hepatitis is allowed. 7. Received any investigational agent within the 14 days before the start of study treatment (1st dose of fludarabine) Criteria For Initial Donor Selection: 1. HLAhaploidentical related donor (aged 12 to 75 years) with donor/recipient match based on a minimum of intermediate resolution DNA based Class I typing of the A and B locus It is recognized individual institutions may have differing donor age guidelines. This is acceptable as long as no donor is younger than 12 years or older than 75 years. 2. At least 40 kilogram body weight. 3. In general good health as determined by the evaluating medical provider. 4. Adequate organ function defined as: Hematologic: hemoglobin, WBC, platelet within 10% of upper and lower limit of normal range of test (gender based for hemoglobin) Hepatic: ALT &lt; 2 x upper limit of normal, Renal: serum creatinine &lt; 1.8 mg/dl 5. Performance of a donor infectious disease screen panel including CMV Antibody, Hepatitis B Surface Antigen, Hepatitis B Core Antibody, Hepatitis C Antibody, HIV 1/2 Antibody, HTLVA 1/2 Antibody, Rapid Plasma Reagin and Trypanosoma Cruzi (T. Cruzi) or per current standard institutional donor screen must be negative for HIV and active hepatitis B. 6. Not pregnant females of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within 7 days of apheresis. 7. Voluntary written consent (and assent if donor &lt; 18 years of age) prior to the performance of any research related procedure.</criteria>
