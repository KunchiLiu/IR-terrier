	<brief_summary>This phase II trial studies how well image guided hypofractionated radiation therapy works with nelfinavir mesylate and nivolumab in treating patients with melanoma, lung cancer, or kidney cancer that has spread. Hypofractionated radiation therapy delivers higher doses of radiation therapy over a shorter period of time and may kill more tumor cells and have fewer side effects. Nelfinavir mesylate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving hypofractionated radiation therapy, nelfinavir mesylate, and nivolumab may work better in treating patients with melanoma, lung, or kidney cancer.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Safety, tolerability and preliminary assessment of overall response rate (ORR) to combination of hypofractionated radiotherapy with nivolumab and nelfinavir mesylate (nelfinavir). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Correlate overall response rate (ORR) with: smoking status, underlying genetic mutations if known (e.g.: Kras, BRAF) circulating cell-free deoxyribonucleic acid (cfDNA), circulating tumor cells, PDL-1 expression in tumor and peripheral blood T cell receptor repertoire by sequencing. II. Progression-free survival (PFS)-6 (systemic control): the proportion of patients who are free from progression at 6 months. III. Overall survival. IV. The type and frequency of adverse events. OUTLINE: Beginning 7-14 days prior to start of nivolumab, patients receive nelfinavir mesylate orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-14 up to course 4. Patients also receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 14 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then undergo hypofractionated radiation therapy over 3-14 days starting after course 2 of nivolumab. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 6 months for up to 2 years.</detailed_description>
