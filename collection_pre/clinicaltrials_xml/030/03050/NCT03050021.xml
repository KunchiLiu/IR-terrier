	<brief_summary>Delirium is characterized by changes in mental status, inattension, disorganized thinking, and altered consciousness. Prevalence of delirium in critically ill patients has varied from 20~80% depending on the severity of illness. Despite its high prevalence, delirium is often under-recognized by clinicians due to the difficulties in diagnosis and no interest. Delirium is associated with increased mechanical ventilation days, hospital length of stay, and mortality. The purpose of this study is to analyze the prevalence of delirium and risk factors for delirium in critically ill surgical patients.</brief_summary>
