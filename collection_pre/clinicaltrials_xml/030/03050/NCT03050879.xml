	<brief_title>Indocyanine Green Tracer Using in Laparoscopic Gastrectomy With Lymph Node Dissection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Indocyanine Green Tracer is often applied in surgery for early gastric adenocarcinoma. Its application in laparoscopic gastrectomy with lymph node dissection for gastric adenocarcinoma is at the stage of cases accumulation, method studying and clinical research. There is no prospective studies to identify the clinical outcomes of Indocyanine Green Tracer using in laparoscopic gastrectomy with lymph node dissection for gastric adenocarcinoma. On the basis of more than 3000 cases of laparoscopic gastrectomy with lymph node dissection for gastric adenocarcinoma, we want to apply the Indocyanine Green Tracer, a cheap, easy to operate and no radiation pollution way, to predict the positive lymph nodes in gastric adenocarcinoma, to guid the scope of laparoscopic lymph node dissection for gastric adenocarcinoma.</detailed_description>
