	<brief_summary>Empagliflozin, a sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitor, was launched in the United Kingdom (UK) in August 2014. It can be expected that patients initiating empagliflozin may differ in their characteristics from patients initiating other glucose lowering drugs (GLDs) that have been on the market longer (e.g. patients may have poorer glucose control). Therefore, the proposed study aims to characterize patients with T2DM in the UK initiating empagliflozin in terms of baseline characteristics, concomitant medications, and comorbidities compared to patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) initiating other SGLT-2 inhibitors or other non-insulin GLDs. Due to the mode of action, some patients taking empagliflozin have experienced weight loss in clinical trials. A theoretical possibility exists that empagliflozin may be used by patients without T2DM. Therefore, this study also aims to assess the potential off-label use of empagliflozin compared to other non-insulin GLDs.</brief_summary>
