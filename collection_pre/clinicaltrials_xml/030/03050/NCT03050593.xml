	<brief_summary>The investigators wish to test a hypothesis that patients with HFpEF have different characteristics on echo, cardiac MRI and plasma protein &amp; chemical profiles compared to HFrEF and healthy volunteers.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Developing Imaging And plasMa biOmarkers iN Describing Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction (DIAMONDHFpEF)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Large scale prospective studies incorporating cardiac MRI, echocardiography and plasma sampling are currently lacking in HFpEF. The main aims of our study are to: 1. better phenotype and characterise HFpEF (also comparing with HFrEF and age- and sex- matched healthy controls) 2. provide mechanistic insights into pathophysiology 3. describe potential biomarkers and their relation to relevant clinical outcomes (exercise capacity, heart failure quality of life and prognosis)</detailed_description>
