	<brief_summary>This is a multi-center, open-label, non-randomized, parallel-group, adaptive, single dose study. This study will enroll up to 32 subjects using an adaptive design that can include up to 3 groups of 8 subjects with different degree of renal impairment and one group of 8 control subjects with normal renal function. Screening data will be reviewed to determine subject eligibility. Subjects who meet all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be entered in the study. First, approximately 16 subjects will be enrolled with severe renal impairment and matched subjects with normal renal function. There will be 8 subjects in each of the following groups based on renal function at screening: - Group 1: Healthy subjects with normal renal function (eGFR ≥ 90 mL/min/1.73m2) - Group 2: Severe renal impairment subjects (eGFR &lt; 30 mL/min/1.73m2) Based on safety and pharmacokinetic (PK) results from subjects with severe renal impairment (Group 2), Group 3 (Moderate Renal Impairment) and Group 4 (Mild Renal Impairment) will be enrolled if substantial change in the exposure of lasmiditan is observed in subjects with severe renal impairment.</brief_summary>

Considered clinically stable in the opinion of the Investigator 16. Presence of mild renal impairment (eGFR 6089 mL/min/1.73m2), moderate renal impairment (eGFR 3059 mL/min/1.73m2), or severe renal impairment (eGFR &lt; 30 mL/min/1.73m2) calculated using MDRD equation at screening All Subjects: 1. Females who are pregnant or are lactating 2. History of significant hypersensitivity to lasmiditan or any related products (including excipients of the formulations) as well as severe hypersensitivity reactions (like angioedema) to any drugs 3. Suicidal tendency, history of or disposition to seizures, state of confusion, clinically relevant psychiatric diseases 4. Subject is at imminent risk of suicide (positive response to question 4 or 5 on the CSSRS) or had a suicide attempt within 6 months prior to the screening visit 5. Presence or history of any disorder (including Parkinson disease) that could interfere with completion of the study based on the opinion of the Principal Investigator 6. Any history of tuberculosis and/or prophylaxis for tuberculosis 7. Positive results to HIV Ag/Ab Combo, Hepatitis B surface Antigen (HBsAG (B) (hepatitis B)) or Hepatitis C Virus (HCV (C)) tests 8. Maintenance therapy with any drug or significant history of drug dependency or alcohol abuse (&gt; 3 units of alcohol per day, intake of excessive alcohol, acute or chronic) 9. Use of any enzymemodifying drugs, including strong inhibitors of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes (such as cimetidine, fluoxetine, quinidine, erythromycin, ciprofloxacin, fluconazole, ketoconazole, diltiazem and HIV antivirals) and strong inducers of CYP enzymes (such as barbiturates, carbamazepine, glucocorticoids, phenytoin, rifampin and St John's Wort), in the previous 28 days before Day 1 of this study 10. Females who are pregnant according to a positive pregnancy test 11. Volunteers who took lasmiditan in the previous 28 days before Day 1 of this study 12.

Volunteers who donated 50 mL or more of blood in the previous 28 days before Day 1 of this study 15.

If the investigator concludes that there is no safety risk for subjects with isolated laboratory abnormalities (eg, those that do not reflect endorgan dysfunction; for example, elevated bilirubin in Gilbert's subjects) to participate in the study, such cases need to be discussed and approved by the sponsor's medical monitor prior to study enrollment 33. Presence of clinically significant physical, laboratory, or ECG finding that, in the opinion of the Investigator and/or sponsor, may interfere with any aspect of study conduct or interpretation of results 34. Subjects with acute, unstable, or untreated significant medical conditions. Subjects requiring treatment for renal impairment or other chronic disease (eg, wellcontrolled diabetes, hypertension) must be on a stable treatment plan (medicines, doses, and regimens) for at least 2 weeks (except insulin) prior to Day 1 and during the entire study. Small adjustments in the dosages of some concomitant medications may be permitted during the study, and will be discussed on a casebycase basis. In all cases, the subjects' treatment history must be reviewed and their enrollment must be agreed to by both the investigator and the sponsor's medical monitor 35. Positive screening of alcohol and/or drugs of abuse unless results can be explained by a prescription medication 36.
