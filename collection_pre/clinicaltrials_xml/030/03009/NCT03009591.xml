	<brief_summary>Introduction: The common clinical manifestations of hemophilia are skeletal muscle bleeds, especially hematomas and hemarthrosis. Repeated episodes of joint bleeding in certain joints, causing a progressive joint deterioration. Secondary disorders to this joint degeneration include: biomechanical alterations, loss of range of movement and periarticular muscle atrophy. Design. A prospective, multicenter and longitudinal pilot study to evaluate the efficacy of a treatment protocol with fascial therapy applied in patients with hemophilic arthropathy of the elbow. Aimed: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of a physiotherapy treatment by fascial therapy in patients with hemophilic arthropathy of the elbow Patients: A total of 60 patients with hemophilia and prophylactic treatment will be recruited for inclusion in the study. Patients will be recruited in 6 centers, from different regions of Spain. Intervention: Each session will last approximately 50 minutes, with three physiotherapy sessions taking place over a period of 3 weeks. The treatment program includes 11 maneuvers that must be administered bilaterally: Measuring instruments and study variables: goniometric evaluation (range of movement); visual analog scale (joint pain); Haemophilia Joint Health Score (joint status); DASH Questionnaire (functionality of upper limbs); SF-36 Questionnaire (perception of quality of life). At the same time, the study will allow to determine joint bleeding caused by applied physiotherapy treatment. Expected results: First, it is intended to demonstrate the safety of this physiotherapy technique in patients with hemophilia. Likewise, an improvement in the perception of elbow pain and joint mobility is expected. An improved functionality of the upper limb is also foreseen and with it, an enhanced perception of quality of life of these patients.</brief_summary>
