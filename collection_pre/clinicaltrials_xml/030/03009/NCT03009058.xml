	<brief_summary>During this open label study patients will receive IMM-101 in conjunction with a recognised standard of care for metastatic or unresectable cancer for the patient's specific tumour type. The primary objective of the study is to provide safety data for IMM-101 in combination with a number of selected standard of care regimens.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of IMM 101 in Combination With Standard of Care in Patients With Metastatic or Unresectable Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will consist of three phases - Screening, Treatment and Maintenance. Patients who provide informed consent, will participate in a Screening period of up to 28 days to establish eligibility. Once eligibility is confirmed, patients will enter the Treatment Phase of the study. In the Treatment Phase all patients will receive IMM-101 for 28 weeks. At Week 32, if the Investigator considers it in the patients' best interest patients will progress to the Maintenance Phase of the study and will continue to be dosed every 4 weeks (or as close to this interval as permitted due to practical or logistical considerations). Patients will be followed up for assessment of safety, response to treatment, survival, and immunological markers for up to 4.5 years.</detailed_description>
