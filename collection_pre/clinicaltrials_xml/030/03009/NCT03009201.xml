	<brief_summary>This phase Ib trial studies the side effects and best dose of ribociclib when giving together with doxorubicin hydrochloride in treating patients with soft tissue sarcomas that has spread to other places or that cannot be removed by surgery. Ribociclib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as doxorubicin hydrochloride, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving ribociclib and doxorubicin hydrochloride may work better in treating patients with soft tissue sarcoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ribociclib and Doxorubicin Hydrochloride in Treating Patients Metastatic or Advanced Soft Tissue Sarcomas That Cannot Be Removed by Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of ribociclib in combination with doxorubicin in subjects with advanced soft tissue sarcomas. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess preliminary anti-tumor activity of ribociclib in combination with doxorubicin in subjects with advanced soft tissue sarcomas. II. To assess preliminary anti-tumor activity of ribociclib in combination with doxorubicin in subjects with advanced soft tissue sarcomas. III. To characterize the safety and tolerability of ribociclib in combination with doxorubicin. IV. To characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) profiles of ribociclib and doxorubicin. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. Assessment of the association between potential biomarkers and clinical outcomes. OUTCOME: This is a dose-escalation study of ribociclib. Patients receive ribociclib orally (PO) daily on days 1-7, and doxorubicin hydrochloride intravenously (IV) on day 10. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. MAINTENANCE: Patients receive ribociclib PO daily on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 12 weeks for 12 months.</detailed_description>
