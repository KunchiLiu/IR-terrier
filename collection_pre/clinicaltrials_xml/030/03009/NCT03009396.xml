	<criteria>Signed fully informed consent provided as per this protocol. Participation in RHB10401 for 26 weeks, and a Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) score of ≥ 150 at Visit Week 26. OR More than 26 weeks, with a CDAI ≥150 at Visit Week 26 and all subsequent visits, and subject is between Week 26 and 52 within 4 weeks (28 days) of site activation (e.g. Subject with CDAI = 249 at week 26 and who is at week 38 at the time of site's activation for RHB10404 has a 4week window to be enrolled in the open label study via the Optional Screening Visit) Current treatment with at least one of the following therapies which may be discontinued by the investigator as clinically indicated after 8 weeks of open label RHB104 treatment: Oral 5acetyl salicylic acid (5ASA) compounds Azathioprine or 6mercaptopurine (6MP) or methotrexate Infliximab or adalimumab OR Current treatment with corticosteroid therapy which must begin tapering after 4 weeks of treatment with open label RHB104 (Refer to Appendix 13) White blood cell count ≥ 3.5x109 at screening (RHB10401 Visit Week 26 visit or Optional Screening visit) Subject agrees to use the following effective contraceptive methods diaphragm, cervical cap, contraceptive sponge or condom) with spermicidal foam/gel/cream/suppository IUD (intrauterine device) /IUS (intrauterine system) progestogen injection (DepoProvera®) throughout the study and for at least 6 weeks after last study drug administration, unless subject or partner of subject is postmenopausal or otherwise incapable of becoming pregnant by reason of surgery or tubal ligation, or has had a vasectomy. Postmenopausal is defined as having experienced 12 consecutive months without menstruation. In regions where local regulatory contraceptive requirements differ, the ICF (Informed Consent Form) will reflect local policies. 1. Positive stool results for C. difficile. 2. Currently diagnosed or history of uveitis confirmed by either an ophthalmologist or optometrist. 3. Treatment with any medication that causes QT prolongation or Torsades de Pointes, including but not limited to: amiodarone, amitriptyline, astemizole, cisapride, citalopram dose greater than 20 mg/day, dihydroergotamine, disopyramide, dofetilide, dronedarone, ergotamine, ibutilide, ondansetron or other 5HT3 (5hydroxytryptamine) receptor antagonists, pimozide, procainamide, quinidine, quinine, quinolones, ranolazine, risperidone, sotalol, terfenadine and tolterodine. QT prolonging drugs may be referenced at the CredibleMeds® web site: https://crediblemeds.org/index.php/drugsearch/ 4. Treatment with the following CYP3A4 interactive medications: alfentanyl, alprazolam, amlodipine, antiretroviral agents, apixaban, aprepitant, aripiprazole, atorvastatin, boceprevir, buspirone, carbamazepine, carvedilol, colchicine, cyclosporine, digoxin, diltiazem, estrogens, felodipine, fluconazole, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, haloperidol, ketoconazole, lovastatin, lurasidone, metoprolol, nefazodone, nifedipine, nisoldipine, nitrendipine, propranol, roflumilast, simvastatin, St. John's wort, and voriconazole. 5. Any evidence of any newly diagnosed significant hematological, hepatic, renal, cardiac, pulmonary, metabolic, neurological, psychiatric or other disease (e.g. porphyria) that might interfere with subject's ability to safely enter and or complete the study requirements. 6. Females who have a positive pregnancy test or are lactating. 7. Refusal to sign the study informed consent form. 8. Inability to be able to adequately communicate with the investigator or their respective designee and/or comply with the requirements of the entire study. 9. Clinically significant abnormalities of hematology or biochemistry as confirmed by repeat testing based on investigator's discretion, including but not limited to, elevations greater than 2 times the upper limit of normal of Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST), Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT), Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP) or creatinine clearance less than 60 ml/min at screening via estimated CockcroftGault formula: Creatinine Clearance = [140 age in years] * weight (kg) / 72 * Serum Creatinine (mg/dl) [multiply estimated rate by 0.85 for women], using actual body weight. 10. QTcF (shortening of the QT interval in the heart rate) &gt;450ms in males and QTcF&gt;460ms in females, bundle branch block, or major ST or T wave abnormalities that make the assessment of the QT impossible.</criteria>
