	<brief_summary>MRS and 11C-MET PET/CT are commonly used as supplementary imaging techniques for the differential diagnosis of non-enhancing supratentorial gliomas. However, both techniques have limitations leading to misdiagnosis; therefore, the investigators attempted to combine these two metabolic imaging tools to evaluate whether the combination of MRS and 11C-MET PET/CT can increase the sensitivity of the radiological diagnosis of non-enhancing supratentorial gliomas.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cerebral gliomas account for 29% of all primary brain tumors and 81% of malignant brain tumors. Structural imaging with MRI is the most commonly accepted method for obtaining radiological information leading to the diagnosis. However, most low-grade gliomas (LGGs), and even some high-grade gliomas (HGGs), are not enhanced in MRI-contrast imaging. Despite applying supplementary MRI sequences such as T2 FLAIR and DWI, non-enhancing gliomas remain difficult to differentiate from nontumorous lesions, including those arising from demyelination, inflammation, encephalomalacia and gliosis. To overcome the deficiencies of structural imaging, metabolic imaging is used as a complementary imaging technique for the diagnosis of brain tumors. MRS and PET/CT are two types of metabolic imaging tools that exhibit promising utility in brain tumor imaging. Previous research revealed that the maximum Cho/NAA index (CNImax) threshold of 2.0 predicted tumor infiltration with probabilities of 90% in HGGs and 87% in LGGs. However, when tumors are located near convex or ventricular systems, scalp fat and skull lipids could affect the quality of the MRS imaging. Moreover, the elevation of CNImax can be detected in other intracranial tumors such as lymphoma and some non-neoplastic lesions such as those caused by demyelination, encephalitis and vasculitis. PET/CT also allows the noninvasive study of various biologic processes in tumor tissue. Among various types of radiotracers synthetized to detect brain tumors, 11C-MET is a well-established PET/CT radiotracer for brain tumor detection and delineation. Because of its comparatively low background activity in normal brain tissue, 11C-MET PET/CT differentiates nontumorous lesions from malignant lesions with high sensitivity and specificity. Though the overall sensitivity for 11C-MET PET/CT is from 76% to 100%, the sensitivity is lower in studies with higher proportions of non-enhancing low-grade gliomas8. Given the advantages and limitations of MRS and 11C-MET PET/CT, the investigators attempted to evaluate whether the combination of these two metabolic imaging tools can improve the sensitivity of the radiological diagnosis of non-enhancing supratentorial glioma.</detailed_description>
