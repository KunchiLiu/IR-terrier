	<brief_summary>Iron deficiency may result from inadequate dietary intake, achlorhydria or excessive ingestion of proton pump inhibitors, parasitic infestations, chronic infections and repeated pregnancies. Iron supplementation of antenatal patients is a basic tenet of antenatal care programmes in numerous developing and underdeveloped nations. Postpartum anemia is defined as hemoglobin of less than 11.5 gm% during the postpartum period. The prevalence of postpartum anemia varies from 4 - 27%. Chronic iron deficiency due to inadequate intake/ lack of iron supplementation during pregnancy, repeated pregnancies and postpartum hemorrhage are important causes of postpartum anemia</brief_summary>
