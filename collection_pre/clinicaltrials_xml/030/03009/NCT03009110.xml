	<brief_summary>The Prophylactic Negative Pressure Wound Therapy in Obese Women at Cesarean Trial is a large pragmatic multi-center randomized clinical trial designed to evaluate the effectiveness, safety and cost-effectiveness of prophylactic negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) - a closed, sealed system that applies negative pressure to the wound surface via a single-use, battery-powered, portable device - to decrease surgical site infections (SSIs) in obese women.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Preventing Adverse Incisional Outcomes at Cesarean Multicenter Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Experimental evidence suggests that NPWT promotes wound healing by removing exudate, approximating the wound edges, and reducing bacterial contamination. Obesity (body mass index [BMI] ≥30kg/m2) increases the risk for both cesarean delivery and SSIs compared to non-obese women. The increased risk of SSIs is in part due to the increased thickness of the subcutaneous space, allowing collection of exudates and increasing tension on wound edges, promoting the growth of bacteria, and leading to wound infection and breakdown. Thus, prophylactic NPWT may be particularly effective in this patient population. During the 5-year project period, investigators from 4 collaborating perinatal centers in the United Stated (two university and two community) will randomize 2850 obese women undergoing cesarean delivery to receive either prophylactic negative pressure wound therapy with the Prevena device or standard wound dressing. Women will be followed up to 30 days postoperatively to ascertain study outcomes. The primary outcome for the trial is superficial or deep SSI after cesarean according to the CDC's National Healthcare Safety Network definitions. The investigators will also assess other wound complications, adverse events potentially attributable to NPWT and cost-effectiveness as measured by incremental cost per case of SSI prevented and per quality-adjusted life year (QALY).</detailed_description>
