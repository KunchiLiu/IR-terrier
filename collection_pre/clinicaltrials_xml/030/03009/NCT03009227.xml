	<brief_title>Study of Oncological Outcomes of D3 Lymph Node Dissection in Colon Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The design involves random allocation of eligible patients to D3 or D2 lymph node dissection group in 1:1 ratio. The extent of colonic resection itself is not influenced by the randomization and is predefined by the investigator prior to randomization. Requirements applied to centers participating in the trial and surgeons performing procedures are described in the protocol and refer to center volume and surgeon's experience with evaluation of non-editted video-recordings of procedures. Routine quality control includes requirement to photograph vessels with the clip to determine the extent of lymph node dissection performed and a thorough morphological assessment of the specimen. After surgery patients are treated according to local standards with no difference wether D2 or D3 lymph node dissection was performed. Short-term and long-term outcomes are registered as per protocol. This is a superiority trial evaluating statistical superiority. With the 50% five year survival according to national registry for colon cancer, expecting 10% improvement in survival with D3 lymph node dissection, enrollment of 768 patients during 3 year accrual period followed by 5 year follow up is required for a power of 80%. The intent-to-treat principle is used for the data analysis.</detailed_description>
