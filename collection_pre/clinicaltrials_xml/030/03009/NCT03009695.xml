	<brief_summary>Obesity is a metabolic disease that has reached epidemic proportions. Insofar no long-term effective drug treatment was developed for obesity. Lyfe style modulation and bariatric surgery are the only interventions with a limited rate of success. Obesity is due to several factors, mainly linked to a neurophysiological mechanism of "food addiction". The use of repetitive deep Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (dTMS) was proposed to reduce appetite and food craving in obese subjects, leading eventually to a weight reduction. dTMS was already tested successfully in other forms of addiction (smoking, alcohol, cocaine) and the usefulness of dTMS in the treatment of food addiction, and therefore in obesity, was hypothesized. End-points of this research will be: 1) effect on food craving; 2) acute and chronic effects on blood level of hormones acting on the appetite regulation; 3) chronic effects on body weight. The demonstration that a safe, non-invasive and repeatable methodology can treat obesity reducing food craving and modulating appetite/satiety hormones secretion will constitute a cornerstone in translational medicine of metabolic diseases.</brief_summary>
