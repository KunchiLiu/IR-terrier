	<brief_summary>This study is a prospective comparison between absorbable hemostatic agents as a group and the body's natural hemostatic ability without aid of therapy in patients undergoing bilateral sinus surgery with or without septoplasty.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Analysis of Hemostatic Agents Compared to Physiologic Hemostasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of absorbable hemostatic agents in comparison with physiologic hemostasis after endoscopic sinus surgery. The investigators aim to determine the relative efficacy of hemostatic agents to halt epistaxis and compare this with the degree of epistaxis observed without therapy and evaluate objective healing parameters.</detailed_description>
