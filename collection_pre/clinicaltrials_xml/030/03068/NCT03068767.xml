	<brief_summary>300 HBV carriers with inadequate serum vitamin D levels were randomized to two groups: one is supplied with vitamin D and another without as controls. The markers of HBV replication were compared before and after treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Relationship Between Vitamin D and Hepatitis B Virus Replication</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized case-control trial. A total of 300 HBV carriers with inadequate vitamin D (&lt; 30 ng/mL) level were enrolled. They were randomly divided to two groups: one group receiving vitamin D supplement (2000 IU/day) for 2 months and another group as controls. The serum vitamin D, HBV DNA and qHBsAg levels were measured at baseline and after vitamin D supplement. Whether HBV DNA and qHBsAg have significant change after vitamin D supplement can be determined.</detailed_description>
