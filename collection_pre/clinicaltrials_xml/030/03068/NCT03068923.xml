	<brief_summary>'The TOP Study' is a prospective cohort study whose main objective is to develop better prognostic biomarkers and identify children at risk of adverse thrombotic outcomes very early in the course after an initial venous thromboembolic events (VTE). The study will compare biomarkers in children that develop poor VTE outcomes (such as recurrence, postthrombotic syndrome and post PE impairment ) after an initial VTE with those that do not develop such outcomes.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>All newly diagnosed patients with a first radiologically confirmed thrombotic event (any site) diagnosed at Children's Medical Center, Dallas will be followed prospectively with global coagulation assessment over a 24-month period, and monitored for development of carefully defined adverse VTE outcomes in a blinded manner. Biomarker assessment will include global coagulation assays (thrombin generation assay and modified thromboelastography to study fibrinolysis) at 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months post VTE diagnosis.</detailed_description>
