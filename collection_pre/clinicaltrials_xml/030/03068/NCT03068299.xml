	<brief_summary>This research aims to analyze the effects of senior dance on the cognition, frailty, and burden in elderly caregivers of rural communities. This is a randomized clinical trial to be conducted with a sample of 58 elderly caregivers residing in rural communities. Data collection will be performed in the homes of the elderly and/or in the dependencies of the Family Health units (USFs - primary health care systems). They will answer Socio-demographic characterization instrument, ACE-R Battery, and electroencephalography for cognitive evaluation, five Fragility criteria proposed by Fried et al and Zarit Burden Inventory. The dance protocol will be applied to the experimental group (n=29) in the USFs and the control group (n=29) will receive health care, including guidance on health care and practices. The protocols include 24 interventions, 60 minutes each, weekly, during 6 months. Analysis of effects comparisons will be conducted between groups and be comparing baseline with final measurements. Dance intervention is expected to exert important positive effects on all study variables (cognitive performance, fragility assessment, and caregiver burden), compared to the group. The intervention of the control group is expected to exert positive effects on some variables of the study (mainly, caregiver burden).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Sample Variables above described of 58 participants will be measured. The participants will be randomized to the dance group (experimental) and to the health care guidance group (control). The group will be paired by age, sex, and schooling. This study focused on prevention of cognitive performance decline, frailty and burden.</detailed_description>
