	<brief_summary>This study evaluates an accelerated schedule of theta-burst stimulation using a transcranial magnetic stimulation device for treatment-resistant depression. In a double-blind fashion, half the participants will receive accelerated theta-burst stimulation while half will receive sham treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Accelerated Theta Burst in Treatment-Resistant Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is an established technology as therapy for treatment-resistant depression. The approved method for treatment is 10Hz stimulation for 40 min over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (L-DLPFC). This methodology has been very successful in real world situations. The limitations of this approach include the duration of the treatment (approximately 40 minutes per treatment session). Recently, researchers have aggressively pursued modifying the treatment parameters to reduce treatment times with some preliminary success. This study intents to further modify the parameters to create a more rapid form of the treatment and look at the change in neuroimaging biomarkers.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Male or female, 18 to 70 years of age. Able to provide informed consent. Diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) or Bipolar Affective Disorder Type II and currently experiencing a Major Depressive Episode (MDE). Participants must currently be on a stable and adequate dose of SSRI or SNRI antidepressant therapy. Participants may also have a history of intolerance to at least 2 antidepressant medications. These patients with the intolerance history will not be required to be currently taking an antidepressant medication. Participants must qualify as "Moderately Treatment Refractory" using the Maudsley staging method. Meet the threshold on the total HAMD21 score of &gt;/=20 at both screening and baseline visits (Day 5/14 and Day 0). In good general health, as ascertained by medical history. If female, a status of nonchildbearing potential or use of an acceptable form of birth control. The form of birth control will be documented at screening and baseline. Concurrent hypnotic therapy (e.g., with zolpidem, zaleplon, melatonin, or trazodone) will be allowed if the therapy has been stable for at least 4 weeks prior to screening and if it is expected to remain stable. Female of childbearing potential who is not willing to use one of the specified forms of birth control during the study. Female that is pregnant or breastfeeding. Female with a positive pregnancy test at participation. Total HAMD score of &lt; 20 at the screen or baseline visits. Current diagnosis of a Substance Use Disorder (Abuse or Dependence, as defined by DSMIVTR), with the exception of nicotine dependence, at screening or within six months prior to screening. Current diagnosis of Axis I disorders other than Dysthymic Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Social Anxiety Disorder, Panic Disorder, Agoraphobia, or Specific Phobia (unless one of these is comorbid and clinically unstable, and/or the focus of the participant's treatment for the past six months or more). History of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorders, or any history of psychotic symptoms in the current or previous depressive episodes. Any Axis I or Axis II Disorder, which at screening is clinically predominant to their MDD or has been predominant to their MDD at any time within six months prior to screening. Considered at significant risk for suicide during the course of the study. Has a clinically significant abnormality on the screening examination that might affect safety, study participation, or confound interpretation of study results. Participation in any clinical trial with an investigational drug or device within the past month or concurrent to study participation. Any current or past history of any physical condition which in the investigator's opinion might put the subject at risk or interfere with study results interpretation. History of positive screening urine test for drugs of abuse at screening: cocaine, amphetamines, barbiturates, opiates. Current (or chronic) use of opiates. History of epilepsy. History of rTMS failure with FDA approved rTMS parameters. History of any implanted device or psychosurgery for depression. History of receiving ECT. History of shrapnel or metal in the head or skull. "Low or High Treatment Refractory" using the Maudsley staging method.</criteria>
