Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test (urine or serum) within 24 hours prior to vaccination. 4. The subject must be in good health, as determined by: vital signs (heart rate &gt;55 to &lt;100 bpm; blood pressure: systolic ≥ 90 mm Hg and ≤150 mm Hg; diastolic ≤ 90 mm Hg; oral temperature &lt;100.0ºF); medical history; and targeted physical examination, when necessary, based on medical history. Stable medical condition is defined as: no recent increase in prescription medication, dose, or frequency of medication in the last 3 months and health outcomes of the specific disease are considered to be within acceptable limits in the last 6 months. 5. The subject is able to understand and comply with the planned study procedures, including being available for all study visits. 6. The subject has provided informed consent prior to any study procedures. 7. Subjects who have not received seasonal flu vaccine for the current year. Exclusion Criteria 1. Subject report of known hypersensitivity to allergy to components of the study vaccine or other components of the study vaccine. 2. Subject report of known latex allergy 3.

The subject has an active neoplastic disease (excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer or prostate cancer that is stable in the absence of therapy) or a history of any hematological malignancy. For this criterion, "active" is defined as having received treatment within the past 5 years. 8. The subject has longterm (greater than 2 weeks) use of oral or parenteral steroids, or highdose inhaled steroids (&gt;800 mcg/day of beclomethasone dipropionate or equivalent) within the preceding 6 months (nasal and topical steroids are allowed). 9. The subject received immunoglobulin or another blood product within the 3 months prior to enrollment in this study. 10. The subject has received an inactivated vaccine within the 2 weeks or a live vaccine within the 4 weeks prior to enrollment in this study or plans to receive another vaccine within the next 28 days. 11. The subject has an acute or chronic medical condition that, in the opinion of the investigator or appropriate subinvestigator, would render vaccination unsafe or would interfere with the evaluation of responses. These conditions include any acute or chronic medical disease or conditions defined as persisting for 3 months (defines ad 90 days) or longer, that would place the subject at an unacceptable risk of injury, render the subject unable to meet the requirements of the protocol, or may interfere with the evaluation of responses of the subject's successful completion of the study. 12. Subjects with an active infection or that has an acute illness or an oral temperature greater than 99.9F (37.7C) within 3 days prior to enrollment or vaccination. Subjects who had an acute illness that was treated symptoms resolved are eligible to enroll as long as treatment is completed and symptoms resolved &gt; 3 days prior to enrollment. 13. The subject is currently participating or plans to participate in a study that involves an experimental agent (vaccine, drug, biologic, device, blood product, or medication) or has received an experimental agent within 1 month prior to enrollment in this study, or expects to receive another experimental agent during participation in this study, or intends to donate blood during the study period. 14. The subject has any condition that would, in the opinion of the site investigator, place the subject at an unacceptable risk of injury or render the subject unable to meet the requirements of the protocol. 15.
