	<criteria>Present to ED primary for management of LBP, defined as pain originating between the lower border of the scapulae and the upper gluteal folds. Flank pain, that is pain originating from tissues lateral to the paraspinal muscles, will not be included. Musculoskeletal etiology of low back. Patients with nonmusculoskeletal etiologies such as urinary tract infection, ovarian cysts, or influenza like illness will be excluded. The primary clinical diagnosis, at the conclusion of the ED visit, must be a diagnosis consistent with nontraumatic, nonradicular, musculoskeletal LBP. Patient is to be discharged home. Patients admitted to the hospital are more likely to be treated with parenteral medication and therefore are not appropriate for this study. Age 1864 Enrollment will be limited to adults younger than 65 years because of the increased risk of adverse medication effects in the elderly. Nonradicular pain. Patients will be excluded if the pain radiates below the gluteal folds in a radicular pattern. Pain duration &lt;2 weeks (336 hours). Patients with more than two weeks of pain are at increased risk of poor pain and functional outcomes.(9) Prior to the acute attack of LBP, back pain cannot occur more frequently than once per month. Patients with more frequent back pain are at increased risk of poor pain and functional outcomes.(9) Nontraumatic LBP: no substantial and direct trauma to the back within the previous month Functionally impairing back pain: A baseline score of &gt; 5 on the RolandMorris Disability Questionnaire Not available for followup Pregnant or breastfeeding Chronic pain syndrome defined as use of any analgesic medication on a daily or neardaily basis Allergic to or intolerant of investigational medications Contraindications to nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs: 1) history of hypersensitivity to NSAIDs or aspirin 2) active or history of peptic ulcer disease, chronic dyspepsia, or active or history of gastrointestinal bleed 3) Severe heart failure (NYHA 2 or worse) 4) hypertension (JNC7 stage 2 or worse) 5) Chronic kidney disease 3 or worse 6) Current use of anticoagulants 7) Hepatitis 8) Alcoholism Contraindications to muscle relaxants: 1) Concurrent use of centrally acting opioids; 2) Renal impairment; 3) Liver abnormality including cirrhosis or elevated enzymes 4) Use of any of the following medications: fluvoxamine, fluoroquinolones, amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone, verapamil, cimetidine, famotidine, acyclovir, ticlopidine, oral contraceptive pills</criteria>
