	<brief_summary>The COBIS III registry is a multi-center, real-world registry of 2nd generation drug-eluting stenting in coronary bifurcation lesions in South Korea. From 31 major coronary intervention centers in Korea, a total of 3,000 patients (anticipated) will be enrolled in this database between January 2010 and December 2014. The aim of the study was to investigate long-term clinical results and predictors of adverse outcomes after percutaneous coronary intervention with 2nd generation drug-eluting stents for coronary bifurcation lesions in South Korea.</brief_summary>
