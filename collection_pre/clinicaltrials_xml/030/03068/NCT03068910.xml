	<brief_summary>This study will address a hypothesis that, in late pubertal girls with hyperandrogenemia, androgens antagonize progesterone's ability to suppress waking LH pulse frequency. All participants will receive 4 doses of progesterone; half of participants will be pretreated with androgen receptor blockade (spironolactone, 50 mg twice daily), while the other half will be pretreated with placebo (twice daily).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hyperandrogenemia and Altered Day-night LH Pulse Patterns</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Late pubertal obese girls with hyperandrogenemia have altered day-night patterns of LH secretion when compared to those without hyperandrogenemia. In addition, a previous study revealed that late pubertal adolescents with hyperandrogenemia demonstrate impaired suppression of LH pulse frequency with estradiol and progesterone administration for one week. This study will address an overall working model holding that daytime/waking LH pulse frequency is acutely suppressed by progesterone negative feedback when testosterone concentrations are low, but that daytime/waking LH pulse frequency is resistant to progesterone negative feedback when testosterone concentrations are high. The hypothesis is that, in late pubertal girls with hyperandrogenemia, progesterone suppression of waking LH frequency is greater in the setting of androgen receptor blockade (spironolactone, 50 mg twice daily) compared to the placebo condition. Sixteen late pubertal girls (postmenarcheal, but by no more than 4 years) with Tanner stage-specific hyperandrogenemia will undergo two CRU admissions separated by at least 4 weeks. During each admission, the acute effects of oral micronized progesterone (0.8 mg/kg at 1000, 1600, and 2200 h) on LH pulse frequency will be assessed. Subjects will be randomized to be pretreated for 2 weeks with either spironolactone (an androgen receptor blocker commonly used for hyperandrogenism) or placebo prior to the first admission; subjects will be pretreated with the other medication (placebo or spironolactone) for 2 weeks before the second admission in accordance with a cross-over design. Wake LH pulse frequency from spironolactone and placebo admissions will be analyzed via a hierarchical linear mixed model.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Late pubertal girls (i.e., postmenarcheal, but by ≤ 4 years) Hyperandrogenism, as defined by an elevated Tanner stagespecific free testosterone concentration and/or clinical evidence of hirsutism Age &lt; 10 or &gt; 17 years (this study is designed to elucidate mechanisms underlying emerging PCOS in late pubertal, postmenarcheal adolescent girls) Men and boys are excluded (this study is designed to elucidate mechanisms underlying HA and emerging PCOS in peripubertal adolescent girls) Inability to comprehend what will be done during the study or why it will be done Obesity associated with a diagnosed (genetic) syndrome (e.g., PraderWilli syndrome, leptin deficiency), obesity related to medications (e.g., glucocorticoids), etc. To ensure that blood withdrawal is within safe limits, weight &lt; 28.1 kg is an exclusion criterion. Since underweight can alter pulsatile LH secretion, BMIforage percentile &lt; 5 is an exclusion criterion. Positive pregnancy test or lactation. Subjects with a positive pregnancy test will be informed of the result by the screening physician. Under Virginia law, parental notification is not required for minors. However, the screening physician will encourage the subject to tell her parent(s). We will counsel the adolescent about the importance of appropriate prenatal care/counseling. We will offer appropriate followup at the Teen Health Clinic at UVA and/or encourage the adolescent to secure prompt care via their primary care physician's office. Virilization or a total testosterone &gt; 150 ng/dl (confirmed on repeat), which suggests the possibility of a virilizing neoplasm DHEAS &gt; 1.5 times the ageappropriate upper limit of normal (confirmed on repeat) Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH): A morning 17hydroxyprogesterone (17OHP) &gt; 300 ng/dl (confirmed on repeat) will suggest the possibility of CAH. If obtained during a luteal phase (as evidenced by high progesterone), the 17OHP will be repeated at 08000900 h during the early follicular phase (or, if oligomenorrheic, during follicular phase—confirmed by low serum progesterone). If a 17OHP &gt; 300 ng/dl is confirmed on repeat testing, an ACTHstimulated 17OHP &lt; 1000 ng/dl will be required for study participation. Morning cortisol concentration &lt; 3 µg/dL (confirmed on repeat), history of adrenal insufficiency, or symptoms suggestive of adrenal insufficiency (e.g., persistent anorexia, nausea, unintentional weight loss, etc.) Evidence of Cushing's syndrome by history or physical exam (e.g., history of impaired growth) Any abnormal TSH concentration will trigger repeat testing. In many cases when TSH is initially abnormal, a repeat TSH will be normal. These subjects will be permitted to continue study. If TSH remains abnormal on repeat testing, the subject will be referred to her primary medical provider. In some cases, a participant's primary medical provider will elect to simply observe a mildly low (&gt; 0.1) or mildly elevated (&lt; 10) if stable. In such cases, we will accept a TSH between 0.3 and 7 (inclusive) if it has remained stable for at least 6 months—such TSH values are exceedingly unlikely to influence the central reproductive axis or to influence the risks of the study. Notably, subjects with reasonablytreated primary hypothyroidism—reflected by TSH values between 0.3 and 7—on a stable dose of thyroid hormone (i.e., same dose for at least 2 months) will not be excluded. Prolactin concentration &gt; 30 ng/mL (confirmed on repeat) Persistent hemoglobin &lt; 11.5 g/dL for nonAfrican American subjects; hemoglobin &lt; 11.0 g/dL for African American subjects (confirmed on repeat). Importantly, documentation of a hemoglobin ≥ 11.0 g/dL for African American subjects or ≥ 11.5 g/dL for nonAfrican American subjects in the month prior to the CRU admission is required for frequent sampling protocol in the CRU. A previous diagnosis of diabetes, a fasting glucose ≥ 126 mg/dl, or a hemoglobin A1c ≥ 6.5% (confirmed on repeat) Elevated creatinine concentration and/or an estimated glomerular filtration rate &lt; 80 mL/min/1.73 m2 (confirmed on repeat) Persistently abnormal sodium or potassium concentration (confirmed on repeat) Bicarbonate concentrations &lt; 20 or &gt; 30 (confirmed on repeat) Liver test abnormalities (confirmed on repeat), with two exceptions: (1) mild bilirubin elevations will be accepted in the setting of known Gilbert's syndrome or when the subject's primary care provider provides a presumptive diagnosis of Gilbert's syndrome and has no plans for further workup; (2) mild transaminase (ALT, AST) elevations may be seen in obese girls, so stable elevations &lt; 1.5 times the upper limit of normal will be accepted in this group. Significant history of cardiac or pulmonary dysfunction (e.g., known or suspected congestive heart failure; asthma requiring intermittent systemic corticosteroids; etc.) Personal history of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) Personal history of ovarian, endometrial, or breast neoplasia Absolute contraindications to spironolactone use include anuria, acute renal insufficiency, significant impairment of renal excretory function, hyperkalemia, primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease), and concomitant use of eplerenone</criteria>
