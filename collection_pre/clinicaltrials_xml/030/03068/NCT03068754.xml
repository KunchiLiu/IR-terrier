	<brief_title>A Study to Assess the Efficacy and Safety of H.P. Acthar® Gel in the Treatment of Subjects With Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multicenter, multiple dose study to examine the effect of Acthar on functional decline in adult subjects with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Approximately 195 subjects will be enrolled. Following a screening period of up to 28 days, subjects with ALS and symptom onset (defined as first muscle weakness or dysarthria) ≤ 2 years prior to the Screening Visit will be randomized on a 2:1 basis to receive subcutaneous (SC) Acthar 0.2 mL (16 Units [U]) daily (QD) or SC matching placebo 0.2 mL QD for 36 weeks, followed by a 3 week taper.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Diagnosis of clinically definite ALS, clinically probablelaboratory supported ALS, or clinically probable ALS based on revised El Escorial criteria. 2. ALS symptom onset ≤ 2 years prior to the Screening Visit. 3. On riluzole 50 mg twice a day for ≥ 4 weeks prior to the Screening Visit. 4. Forced vital capacity (FVC) ≥ 60% at the Screening Visit. 5. Systolic blood pressure ≤ 140 mm Hg and a mean diastolic blood pressure of ≤ 90 mm Hg at the Screening and Baseline Visits. 1. History of use of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) preparations for treatment of ALS. 2. Any medical condition known to have an association with motor neuron dysfunction (other than ALS) which might confound or obscure the diagnosis of ALS. 3. Requires nocturnal continuous positive airway pressure or bilevel positive airway pressure. 4. Tracheostomy, diaphragm pacing, or ongoing need for assisted ventilation of any type at Screening Visit. 5. Known contraindication(s) to Acthar. 6. History of chronic active hepatitis including active or chronic hepatitis B, or acute or chronic hepatitis C. 7. History of tuberculosis (TB) infection, any signs/symptoms of TB, or any close contact with an individual with an active TB infection. 8. Clinically significant infection requiring intravenous administration of antibiotics and hospitalization in the 4 weeks prior to the Screening Visit.</criteria>
