	<brief_summary>This prospective observational study is designed to investigate the relationship between brain temperature, axillary temperature, rectal temperature, and bladder temperature of postoperative patients with brain trauma, and the relationship between brain temperature and prognosis. This study is conducted based on the following important assumptions. First, brain temperature of postoperative patients with brain trauma should be higher than the axillary temperature, rectal temperature and bladder temperature. Second, the consistency of brain temperature and bladder temperature is better than the consistency of brain temperature and axillary temperature, as well as that of brain temperature and rectal temperature. Third, brain temperature can help clinicians to predict the prognosis of patients with brain trauma. Therefore, brain temperature monitoring is significant in postoperative intensive care and treatment of patients with brain trauma.</brief_summary>
