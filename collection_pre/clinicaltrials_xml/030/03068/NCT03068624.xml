	<brief_summary>This clinical research study is divided into 2 parts: leukapheresis and treatment. In the leukapheresis part, white blood cells called T cells will be collected from participant to be made into specialized CD8+T cells. To make specialized CD8+T cells, researchers separate out T cells from blood and treat them so they are able to target melanoma cells. The blood cells are then given back to the participant in the treatment part of the study. This is known as "adoptive T cell transfer" or "adoptive T cell therapy". This consent form is for the treatment part of the study. The goal of this clinical research study is to learn about the safety of giving CD8+T cells with ipilimumab, cyclophosphamide, and IL-2 (aldesleukin) to participants with uveal melanoma that is metastatic (has spread). Researchers also want to learn if this combination can help to control the disease.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Cellular Adoptive Immunotherapy Using Autologous CD8+ Antigen-Specific T Cells and Anti-CTLA4 for Patients With Metastatic Uveal Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Groups: If participant is found to be eligible to take part in this study, participant will be assigned to a dose level of CD 8+ T cells based on when participant joins this study. Up to 3 dose levels of CD 8+T cells will be tested. At least 3 participants will be enrolled at each dose level. After the first group receives a dose level of the CD 8+ T cells, another group will be enrolled at a higher or lower dose level based on any side effects that are seen. It is then possible that a third group will be enrolled at a higher or lower dose level than the second group. All participants will receive the same dose levels of all other drugs on this study. Study Drug Administration: Participant will receive cyclophosphamide by vein over about 30-60 minutes on Day -2 (2 days before participant receives the CD8+ T cells). If the doctor thinks it is needed, participant will be given standard drugs to help decrease the risk of side effects. Participant may ask the study staff for information about how these drugs are given and their risks. On Day -1 participant will be admitted to the hospital and have a hepatic arterial catheter placed. This catheter is a sterile flexible tube that will be placed into a blood vessel in participant's liver while participant is under local anesthesia. Participant's doctor will explain this procedure to participant in more detail, and participant will be required to sign a separate consent form. Participant will stay in the hospital overnight after the placement. On Day 0, participant will receive the CD8+ T cells through the catheter over 60 minutes. Participant will stay in the hospital overnight after the dose. Starting within 6 hours after the CD8+T cell infusion and then 2 times each day after that for 14 days, participant will receive aldesleukin as an injection into the skin around participant's abdomen. Participant will be taught how to give participant these injections. On Days 1, 22, 43, and 64, participant will receive ipilimumab by vein over about 90 minutes. Study Visits: On Day -2: - Participant will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests. This routine blood draw will include a pregnancy test if participant can become pregnant. To continue participation in this study, participant cannot be pregnant. On Days 0, 7, 14, 22, 28, 35, 43, 49, 56, 64, 70, 77, 84, 112, and 140: - Participant will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 5½ tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, immune system tests, and tests on how long the T-cells survive in participant's body. - Sometime between Days 35 and 42 and again between Days 77 and 84, participant will have a CT scan to check the status of the disease. On Day 3, blood (about 5½ tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, immune system tests, and tests on how long the T-cells survive in participant's body. If the doctor thinks it is needed to check the status of the disease, blood (about 1½ tablespoons) will be drawn every 3-6 months for up to 3 years. The study tests may be repeated or participant may have additional tests performed anytime the doctor thinks it is needed. Some of the study tests may be done at participant's local clinic if participant cannot return to MD Anderson. The study staff will discuss this with participant. Length of Treatment: The treatment portion of the study will last until Day 64. Participant will no longer be able to take the study drugs if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if participant is unable to follow study directions. Participation on the study will be over after the follow-up. End-of-Study Visit: At Day 168: - Participant will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 5½ tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, immune system tests, and tests on how long the T-cells survive in participant's body. Follow-Up: Every 3 months after Day 84, unless the disease gets worse or participant starts another cancer therapy, participant will have a CT scan or x-rays to check the status of the disease. Every 3 months for up to 5 years, the study staff will call participant or ask participant's doctor how participant is doing. If participant is called, the calls should last about 10-15 minutes. If the doctor thinks it is needed, participant will return to the clinic every 4-6 weeks or more often if the doctor thinks is needed. Blood (about 5½ tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, immune system tests, and tests on how long the T-cells survive in participant's body. This is an investigational study. Specialized CD8+T cells are not FDA approved or commercially available. They are currently being used for research purposes only. Cyclophosphamide, ipilimumab, and aldesleukin are FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of uveal melanoma. Up to 30 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>
