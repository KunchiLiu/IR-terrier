	<brief_summary>This is a Phase Ib, open-label, multicenter, global study designed to assess the safety and tolerability of RO6870810 as monotherapy and in combination with daratumumab in participants with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. There are two parts to this study. A dose-escalation phase (Part I) will be used to evaluate the safety and tolerability and dose limiting toxicities, and to establish the maximum tolerated dose/optimum biological dose of RO6870810 when given as monotherapy or in combination with daratumumab. A dose-expansion phase (Part II) will further characterize the safety, tolerability and activity of RO6870810 as monotherapy or in combination with daratumumab at the defined expansion dose-levels.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Performance status &lt;/= on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) scale Life expectancy &gt; 3 months Relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. Participants with primary refractory myeloma only allowed in doseescalation phase of the study. Treated with at least three prior lines of multiple myeloma therapy including a proteasome inhibitor and an immuno modulatory agent or who are double refractory to a proteasome inhibitor and an immuno modulatory agent. Prior daratumumab treatment is acceptable only for participants receiving monotherapy treatment. Treatment with prior autologous transplant is permitted Documented diagnosis of symptomatic multiple myeloma, as defined by the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) Measurable disease defined as at least one of the following: serum Mprotein &gt;/=1 grams/deciliter (g/dL), urine Mprotein &gt;/= 200 milligrams/24 hours (mg/24h), serum free light chain (SFLC) assay: involved SFLCs &gt;/= 10 mg/dL (&gt;/= 100 mg/L) and an abnormal SFLC ratio (&lt;0.26 or &gt;1.65). Female participants of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within the 7 days prior to the first study drug administration. For women of childbearing potential: agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use contraceptive methods that result in a failure rate of &lt;/= 1% per year during the treatment period and for at least 28 days after the last dose of RO6870810 as monotherapy, or for at least 90 days after the last dose of daratumumab. For men: agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use contraceptive measures and agreement to refrain from donating sperm Plasma cell leukemia defined as peripheral plasma cell count &gt; 2000/cubic millimeter (mm^3) For expansion cohorts only: Primary refractory multiple myeloma defined as disease that is nonresponsive in participants who have never achieved a minimal response or better with any therapy History of other malignancy within 2 years prior to screening, except for ductal carcinoma in situ not requiring chemotherapy, appropriately treated carcinoma in situ of the cervix, nonmelanoma skin carcinoma, lowgrade, localized prostate cancer (Gleason score &lt;/= 7) not requiring treatment or appropriately treated Stage I uterine cancer POEMS syndrome (polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal protein and skin changes) Current or prior disease or treatment that could compromise protocol objectives in the opinion of the Investigator and/or the Sponsor Pregnant or breastfeeding female. Prior treatment with any antiCD38 therapy, including daratumumab (for participants receiving RO6870810 and daratumumab combination treatment) Prior treatment with small molecule BET family inhibitor participants who are currently receiving any other investigational agent or have received an investigational agent within 30 days or 5 halflives, whichever is longer, prior to study entry Uncontrolled cancer pain</criteria>
