	<brief_title>Antidiabetic Effects on Intrahepatic Fat</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Following enrollment, eligible participants were randomized (1:1:1) using computer-generated random numbers to the metformin (Glucophage, Bristol-Myers Squibb), liraglutide (Victoza, Novo Nordisk), or gliclazide (Diamicron, Servier) groups. All patients were informed about a proper diet and exercise. For the metformin group (n = 31), the dosage was 250 mg thrice a day during the first week, 500 mg thrice a day during the second week, and 1000 mg twice a day from the third week to the conclusion of the study. For the gliclazide group (n = 31), the initial dosage was 30 mg before breakfast, which was gradually titrated to a maximum of 120 mg/day to achieve a fasting capillary plasma glucose of &lt;7.0 mmol/L. For the liraglutide group (n = 31), the dosage was 0.6 mg/day during the first week, 1.2 mg/day during the second week, and 1.8 mg/day from the third week to the conclusion of the study.At the end of the study, data will be collected and analyzed.</detailed_description>
