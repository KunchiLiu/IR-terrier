	<brief_summary>This program will provide patients with type 1 and high risk type 2 diabetes the safest hospitalization by using wireless continuous glucose monitoring devices (CGM) to track their glucose parameters in real-time similar to other continuously monitored vital signs. The CGM will inform a team of health professionals who will monitor the patients' progress, communicate recommendations, and be available for discussion when recommended targets are not achieved. Health teams will utilize sensor results in addition to existing electronic medical records data to evaluate progress and manage care.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Managing Type 1 and High Risk Type 2 Diabetes in the Hospital Setting: Glucose as a Vital Sign (Pilot)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes who meet study criteria will be invited to participate in the study. All patients included in the study will be followed by an advanced practice diabetes nurse for glucose management during their hospitalization. All patients included in the study will receive a CGM. Patients with type 2 diabetes will be randomized to control (blinded CGM glucose values to APN, care team and researchers) or intervention (CGM blood glucose values will be used to aid with glucose management during the hospitalization). In addition, a research only supplemental order set will be implemented for all study participants. The order set focuses on any glucose point of care test that is between 70-79 mg/dL or â‰¥ 250 at bedtime or before the 4 am usual care blood glucose check. The goal is to prevent hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia for all study patients. The advanced practice diabetes nurse will work with the physician in charge of the patient's care as well as the patient's care team.</detailed_description>
