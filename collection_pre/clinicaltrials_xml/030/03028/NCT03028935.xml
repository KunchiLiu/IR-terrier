	<brief_summary>This randomized pilot clinical trial studies how well an evidence-based exercise and nutrition program adapted for Latinas will work in improving physical activity and dietary behavior in non-active, overweight, or obese rural Latinas. An exercise and nutrition program may reduce the risk for developing certain cancers, obesity, and chronic health conditions in Latinas who are non-active, overweight, or obese.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Adapt an effective evidence-based exercise and nutrition program to meet the needs of rural Latinas. II. Implement the adapted program in a rural Latina population. III. Evaluate feasibility and potential to improve physical activity and dietary behavior of the adapted program in a rural Latina population. OUTLINE: Phase I: Create a community advisory board to adapt Strong Women Healthy Hearts Program (SWHHP) using feedback on the existing SWHHP from Latinas residing in the community. Phase II: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 groups. INTERVENTION GROUP: Participants undergo instructor-led exercise and nutrition education classes for 60 minutes each twice a week for 12 weeks. CONTROL GROUP: Participants are placed on a wait-list and receive no intervention for 12 weeks and then undergo exercise and nutrition education classes as in Intervention Group.</detailed_description>
