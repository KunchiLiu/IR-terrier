	<brief_summary>The investigators are trying to determine if using a bladder scanner (type of ultrasound) to check how much urine is left in the bladder is the same as checking that volume with a catheter (tube that goes into your bladder to drain urine). After urogynecologic surgery, the investigators perform a voiding trial. Water is put into the participant's bladder through the catheter (tube draining your bladder). The catheter is then removed and the participant is asked to empty their bladder. After that, the investigators will use the bladder scanner (ultrasound) to see how much urine is left in the participant's bladder. After the ultrasound, the investigators will pass a very small catheter (tube) into the bladder to take out the remaining urine. The investigators will then compare the amount obtained from the catheter to the ultrasound amount. This will also help the investigators to figure out if they need to check how much urine is left in a patient's bladder after the voiding trial.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Accuracy of Bladder Scanners in Post-operative Voiding Trials</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary aim of this study is to determine if bladder scanners are accurate in determining a post-void residual volume (PVR) after Urogynecologic surgery. The secondary aim of this study is to determine if a post-void residual volume (PVR) measurement is needed after a back-fill voiding trial on Urogynecologic post-op patients.</detailed_description>
