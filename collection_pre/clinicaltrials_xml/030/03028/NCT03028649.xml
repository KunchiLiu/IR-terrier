	<brief_title>The Effect of β-hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate Supplementation on Physical Capacity and Body Composition in Trained Athletes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The effect of HMB supplementation is of great interest in sport. In view of the inconclusive character of the results of the studies conducted to date and of a relatively low number of studies investigating the effectiveness of HMB supplementation over a longer period on a large population of trained athletes, the aim of this study was to verify the effect of 12-week with HMB and a placebo supplementation on body composition, anaerobic and aerobic capacity, as well as concentrations of the selected biochemical blood markers in trained athletes, in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial.</detailed_description>
