	<brief_summary>The objective of the study is to determine whether five days of ginger (Zingiber officinale) supplementation is effective at reducing muscle soreness and improving muscle function following downhill running. Long-distance running is often associated with acute muscle pain, swelling, and reduced muscle functioning, and consequently, many runners utilize non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID). NSAID use is associated with gastrointestinal side-effects such as stomach discomfort, nausea, dyspepsia, asymptomatic ulcers, and symptomatic ulcers that, although rare, can be fatal. Ginger is a botanical compound that is Generally Recognized as Safe by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Evidence from osteoarthritis, dysmenorrhea, and resistance-training models indicate that ginger is effective at reducing general pain and muscle soreness. Therefore, this study will supplement 60 runners with roughly 1.5 g/day of ginger root or a placebo for 2 days prior to, the day of, and 2 days after downhill running. Participants will be evaluated for muscle soreness and function before and after the downhill run.</brief_summary>
