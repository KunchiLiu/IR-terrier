	<detailed_description>The study will test the impact of a community health worker (CHW)-delivered intervention aimed at helping families overcome barriers to childhood obesity prevention. Barriers include social, environmental, and family issues. This intervention will be compared to a control condition consisting of a community health worker (CHW)-delivered intervention aimed at helping families improve positive parenting skills. The intervention uses multiple delivery modalities to maintain novelty and prevent attrition/burden. These include home visits, telephone contacts, print (literacy sensitive newsletters), social media (Facebook), and community events. Parents and children will complete scheduled assessments at baseline, 6-, 12-, 18- and 24-month follow-up. The Specific Aims are: Aim 1: To determine the effectiveness of the intervention compared to the control condition on child physical activity, healthy eating, BMI and utilization of built environment resources. Aim 2: To determine the effectiveness of the intervention compared to the control condition on parent physical activity, healthy eating, BMI. Aim 3: To examine the potential scalability of the intervention guided by the RE-AIM (Reach Effectiveness Adoption Implementation Maintenance) model.</detailed_description>
