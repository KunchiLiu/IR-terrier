	<brief_summary>The goal of this clinical research study is to learn about the safety of giving SIR-Spheres treatment to patients with liver cancer in the same session rather than over 2 sessions, which is the standard of care.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>If participant agrees to take part in this study, they will have standard-of-care tests and procedures as a part of the planning for SIR-Spheres treatment. The SIR-Spheres treatment delivers radiation directly to the liver by a catheter placed in an artery in the groin. A catheter is a sterile flexible tube that will be placed into a large artery while participant is under local anesthesia and are mildly sedated. Participant's doctor will explain this procedure to them in more detail. If participant is one of the first 2 participants enrolled in this study, they will have their treatment over 2 sessions within 2-4 weeks, which is the standard of care. During participant's first session, an extra 10 minutes will be added to their standard imaging for research purposes. Each visit should take about 6 hours to complete. Participant will have about 2 hours of standard of care tests and imaging and will be asked to stay in the hospital for 1-2 hours after the procedure to recover from the anesthesia. The procedure itself should take about 2 1/2 hours to complete. If participant enrolls after the first 2 participants, they will have their treatment in 1 session. The visit should take about 8 hours to complete. During this visit, participant will have about 5 hours of standard of care tests and imaging. Participant will be asked to remain in the hospital for 1-2 hours after the procedure to recover from the anesthesia. The procedure itself should take about 2½ to 3½ hours to complete. Participant will sign separate consents for the tests, procedures, and SIR-Spheres treatment that further explains the procedures and risks. The standard of care tests will include blood draws for routine testing. Follow-Up: Participant will be called by the study staff 1 month after their SIR-Spheres treatment to ask how they are doing and if they are having any side effects. The phone call should last about 10 minutes. At about 3 months and 6 months after the treatment, participant will return to the clinic for a physical exam. Blood (about 6 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests. Length of Study: Participant will be off study after the follow-up visits. This is an investigational study. The SIR-Spheres is delivered using FDA approved and commercially available methods. It is investigational to learn if the procedure can be safely performed in a single session. Up to 12 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>
