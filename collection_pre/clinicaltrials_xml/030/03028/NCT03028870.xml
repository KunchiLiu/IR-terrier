	<criteria>Key Inclusion Criteria Include: 1. Males and females ≥ 40 and ≤ 80 years of age with moderate to severe chronic OA pain of the knee (lasting several hours daily) as their predominant pain condition for at least 6 months prior to screening 2. Diagnostic criteria for primary pain condition (American College of Rheumatology [ACR] clinical and radiographic criteria): At least 1 of the following in addition to knee pain: age &gt; 50, morning stiffness &lt; 30 minutes, crepitus on active motion, and KellgrenLawrence (KL) grade 2 or 3 radiographic evidence at the screening visit as determined by a local radiologist or rheumatologist. If a radiograph is not available, one must be taken and the diagnostic criteria must be confirmed before randomization. 3. Subjects whose OA pain of the index knee is not adequately treated prior to the screening visit: Subjects must have a selfreported average pain intensity rating of moderate or severe on a verbal rating scale (ie, none, mild, moderate, and severe) over the 7 days prior to the screening visit 4. The subjects must have "average pain over the last 24 hours" scores ≥ 4 and ≤ 9 on an 11point numerical rating scale (NRS) for the index knee on ≥ 3 consecutive days during the pain assessment period and come in for randomization within 96 hours after the latest qualifying pain score entry 5. Subjects who are willing and able to stop taking any/all analgesic medications, including overthecounter pain medications, opioids, marijuana, and topical analgesics for OA pain for the duration of the study, with the exception of studyspecific rescue medication. Key Exclusion Criteria Include: 1. Subjects with radiographic evidence of OA with KL grade 0,1 or 4 2. Subjects with chronic pain conditions other than OA of the knee as their predominant pain condition, including gout, pseudogout, psoriatic arthritis, active Lyme disease, rheumatoid arthritis or any other inflammatory arthritis, fibromyalgia, neuropathic pain conditions, bursitis, or acute injury or signs of active infection in the target pain area 3. Subjects scheduled for surgical interventions of the disease site or any other major surgery during the study conduct period 4. Subjects with a history of a prior joint replacement of the index knee 5. Subjects who have had arthroscopy on either knee or hip within 6 months of entering the study, or open surgery on either knee or hip within 12 months of entering the study 6. Subjects with a history of significant trauma to a knee, hip or shoulder within the previous year 7. Subjects who have significant pain, other than or more than knee pain, including significant hip, back pain, that may confound the analgesic efficacy assessments of this study.</criteria>
