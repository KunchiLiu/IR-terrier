	<brief_title>Effects of Limb Remote Ischemic Preconditioning for Prevention of Delirium in Elderly Patients After Non-cardiac Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Remote ischaemic preconditioning may confer the cytoprotection in critical organs. We hypothesized that limb remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) would safely decrease the incidence of delirium in elderly patients after non-cardiac surgery.The primary outcomes included the incidence of delirium in the first 7 days after surgery using the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) scale.The quality of recovery over a 6-month period was evaluated as well.Secondary endpoints included length of stay in the hospital after surgery (from day of surgery to hospital discharge), occurrence of non-delirium postoperative complications, and all-cause 6-month mortality.</detailed_description>
