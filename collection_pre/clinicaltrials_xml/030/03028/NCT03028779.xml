	<brief_title>Implementation of Fast-track Surgery Program for Total Hip and Knee Replacement and the Evaluation of the Risks and Benefits for the Patient</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary goal of the study is to evaluate the risk and the possible implementation of the project of the total knee (TKR) or hip (THR) replacement in a fast track setting. The specifics features of such a study are to introduce intervention modalities and care rapidly to minimize and prevent all known complications associated with THR or TKR. Following a total hip replacement (THR), the length of stay is usually 1 to 3 days and 3 to 5 days for a total knee replacement (TKR). The investigators have developed a new protocol with intensive care giving the possibility to return home in less than 24 hours and want to evaluate the feasibility and security of such a protocol. To evaluate the security and feasibility of this protocol the investigators want to recruit 150 participants who will agree to enroll in this study.The investigators will evaluate these variables; number of complications occuring within the 12 months fallowing the surgery, number of readmission post-surgery, pain control efficiency, number of blood transfusion needed, length of wound spread, patient satisfaction and the cost of the program implementation. The investigators want to identify the success and failure factors to optimise the program afterwards. In order to achieve the evaluation, the investigators will compare the data obtain from the 150 patients to the data retrieved in the medical files of the patients that already had the same usual intervention in the past, with the standard length of stay.</detailed_description>
