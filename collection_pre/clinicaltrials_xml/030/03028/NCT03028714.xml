	<brief_summary>Metabolic risk factors, such as central obesity, increase the risk of chronic diseases in adulthood and are prevalent in many university students. Increasing the knowledge about healthy nutrition and physical activity can positively impact students' lifestyle and prevent weight gain. This study aims to investigate the impact of online educational methods on nutrition knowledge, dietary habits, BMI, and physical activity in a sample of university students in the UK. Anthropometric measurements will be assessed and questionnaires will be completed at the beginning and at the end of the study. Written consent will be sought, the voluntary nature of participation will be emphasized while anonymity and confidentiality will be strictly maintained.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Impact of Online Quiz-games on Nutrition Knowledge and Related Outcomes Among University Students.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The intervention is a randomized-controlled trial with two data collection points: one at the beginning and one at the end of the study. The study will include healthy students from two UK Universities, who they will be randomly assigned either to the intervention or to the control group. Participants in both groups will be asked to undertake measurements and complete questionnaires before and after the study. Measurements include the assessment of BMI, body fat, lean mass, waist-to-hip ratio, systolic and diastolic blood pressure and blood glucose. In addition, nutrition knowledge and dietary habits will be estimated using online questionnaires as well as the level of physical activity using the IPAQ questionnaire and pedometers. Participants in the intervention group will receive access to an educational website including information about fruit and vegetables, fat, sugars, fast-food, meat, salt, meals and snacks, food labels, exercise, and alcohol. Each category will be linked to an online quiz-game that will include questions related to the topic. Students will be asked to play the games as much as they want to improve their knowledge scores. Access to the website and the games will be available for 10 weeks. Participants in the control group will receive no intervention. After 10 weeks, participants will be asked to undertake the same measurements and complete the same questionnaires as they did in the beginning of the study. The study aims to investigate the effectiveness of an online educational intervention, using game elements, on the level of nutrition knowledge of students, as well as, whether any changes in knowledge impact changes in dietary habits, physical activity and weight-related factors.</detailed_description>
