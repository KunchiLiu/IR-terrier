	<brief_title>Innate and Acquired Immunity to Influenza Infection and Immunization (SLVP029)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a study of healthy children and adults receive the current seasonal influenza vaccine. The volunteers were enrolled into one of 7 groups over a 5-year period. Immunization is administered; blood samples and NP swabs are collected at various time points based on groups assigned. Group A (LAIV4/annual return): Up to six 2-4 year old volunteers are given a quadrivalent live, attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV4). All participants in this group are asked to return annually for flu immunization and blood samples on Day 0 and Day 7 post immunization . Vaccine naive children returned 30 days later for a second immunization per standard of care. This group was discontinued in year 3 due to Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommendations against the use of LAIV. Group B (LAIV4/ single year): Up to twenty 2-4 year old volunteers were given a quadrivalent live, attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV4). Volunteers will participate for a single year. All participants in this group were immunized on Day 0. Blood samples were taken on on Day 0 and Day 7 post immunization. Vaccine naive children returned 30 days later for a second immunization per standard of care. This group was discontinued in year 3 due to ACIP recommendations against the use of LAIV. Group C (LAIV4/NP swab group): Up to twenty 2-4 year old volunteers were given a quadrivalent live, attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV4). Nasopharyngeal samples (NP) swabs were collected Day 1 and 21 and 28 post immunization. No blood was collected for this group. Vaccine naive children returned 30 days later for a second immunization per standard of care. This group was discontinued in year 3 due to ACIP recommendations against the use of LAIV. Group D (IIV4/annual return): Up to six 6 month-23 month old (inclusive) volunteers are given a quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV4). All participants in this group are asked to return annually for flu immunization and blood samples on Day 0 and Day 7 post immunization. Vaccine naive children returned 30 days later for a second immunization per standard of care. Group E (IIV4/single year): Up to twenty 6 month-23 month old (inclusive) volunteers were given a quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV4). Volunteers participate for a single year. All participants in this group were immunized on Day 0. Blood samples were taken on on Day 0 and Day 7 post immunization. Vaccine naive children returned 30 days later for a second immunization per standard of care. Group F (LAIV4/single year) Up to forty 9-13 year old (n= 20) and 18-49 year old (n= 20) volunteers were given live, attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV). Blood samples were collected Days 0, 7, and 28 and NP swabs were collected Days 1 and 28. This group was discontinued in year 3 due to ACIP recommendations against the use of LAIV. Group G (IIV4/single year) Up to forty, 9-13 year old (n= 20) and 18-49 year old (n= 20) volunteers were given a quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV4). Blood samples were collected Day 0,7, and 28</detailed_description>

Known or suspected impairment of immunologic function, including, but not limited to, clinically significant liver disease, diabetes mellitus treated with insulin, moderate to severe renal disease, or any other chronic disorder which, in the opinion of the investigator, might jeopardize volunteer safety or compliance with the protocol. 11.
