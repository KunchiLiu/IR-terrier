	<brief_summary>Unifusol (R) is a solution of arginine sodium succinate for intravenous infusions. Its effects include vasodilation, protection of inner layer of blood vessels and improvement of blood viscosity. The present phase I study is aimed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of Unifusol infusions in healthy volunteers.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Safety and Tolerability of UNIFUZOL (Solution for Infusions) in Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Unifuzol, solution for infusions,("NTFF POLYSAN" Ltd., Russia) contains succinic acid and arginine as active ingredients; it has demonstrated cardioprotective, anti-ischemic, endothelial protective and fibrinolytic activity in pre-clinical studies and is considered for clinical trials in peripheral vascular disease. The primary aim of the present Phase I study is to assess safety and tolerability of Unifusol (1.4% solution for infusions) at different infusion rates in healthy volunteers. Study objectives: 1. Assess the safety parameters (vital signs, the incidence of AEs, SAEs, laboratory abnormalities) during infusion of Unifusol (1.4% solution for infusions) in healthy volunteers at different infusion rates. - administration of a single infusion of 250 ml at a rate of 3 ml / min. - administration of a single infusion of 250 ml at a rate of 4.5 ml / min - administration of a single infusion of 500 ml at a rate of 4.5 ml / min 2. Study the pharmacokinetics parameters of the active components of the Unifusol (succinic acid and arginine) in healthy volunteers after single infusion at a dose of 250 ml at a rate of 4.5 ml / min. Study methods: 1. Determination of pharmacokinetic parameters of succinic acid administered at a single Unifusol infusion dose 250 ml at a rate of 4.5 ml / min (AUC, Cmax, Tmax, T1 / 2); 2. Determination of pharmacokinetic parameters of arginine after a single Unifusol infusion at a dose 250 ml at a rate of 4.5 ml / min (AUC, Cmax, Tmax, T1 / 2); 3. Determination of individual variations of the pharmacokinetic parameters of succinic acid and arginine in healthy volunteers; 4. Identification of significant gender differences in the pharmacokinetics of the active ingredients of Unifusol (succinic acid and arginine) in healthy volunteers; 5. Determination of the number of compartments in the pharmacokinetic model which will be most appropriate to the measured concentrations after a single infusion (single-chamber, two-chamber or three-chamber pharmacokinetic model).</detailed_description>
