	<brief_title>STELLARIS: Phase 3 Study for the Efficacy and Safety of CVC for the Treatment of Liver Fibrosis in Adults With NASH</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The STELLARIS study will be conducted in 2 parts. Part 1 will examine the surrogate endpoint of improvement in fibrosis of at least 1 stage (nonalcoholic steatohepatitis clinical research network [NASH CRN]) and no worsening of steatohepatitis at Month 12. Subjects from Part 1 will continue into Part 2 and additional subjects will be newly randomized in Part 2 to determine long-term clinical outcomes composed of histopathologic progression to cirrhosis, liver-related clinical outcomes, and all-cause mortality.</detailed_description>
