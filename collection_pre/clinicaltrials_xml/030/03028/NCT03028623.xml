	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and safety of salpingectomy versus standard tubal ligation in women undergoing surgical sterilization at the time of a planned cesarean delivery. Salpingectomy is currently being investigated as a potential strategy for ovarian cancer prevention. While this procedure is currently performed during hysterectomies, its feasibility at the time of cesarean delivery is not well established. This randomized, prospective clinical trial will compare the two sterilization methods to demonstrate that salpingectomy compared with standard tubal ligation at the time of cesarean delivery will not result in increased operative time, blood loss or other complications. This study is necessary to promote salpingectomy as a standard sterilization method during cesarean deliveries.</brief_summary>
