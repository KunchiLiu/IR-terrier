	<brief_summary>Laser therapy has been proposed as a novel treatment option in controlling subgingival microorganisms. This randomized controlled clinical trial evaluates the effect of 980nm diode laser as an adjunct to scaling and root planing (SRP) in the management of chronic periodontitis (CP).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Diode Laser Therapy As An Adjunct To Scaling And Root Planing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Conventional mechanical debridement can achieve a temporary decrease in the subgingival levels of Pg along with other pathogens. However, mechanical therapy alone may fail to eliminate pathogenic bacterial niches in inaccessible areas like deep pockets, root concavities, furcation areas etc. In search of more efficient and less traumatic techniques to improve periodontal healing, researchers proposed the use of lasers in periodontal therapy. The adjunctive use of lasers with conventional tools may facilitate treatment and have the potential to improve healing. The diode laser is highly absorbed in hemoglobin and other pigments and is excellent for use in soft tissue surgical procedures.Laser application in improving clinical outcome in periodontal therapy, needs to be further investigated with well designed clinical trials. The investigators attempted to evaluate the efficacy of diode laser as an adjunct to SRP in the management of CP by evaluating clinical parameters coupled with quantitative estimation of P.gingivalis using Real-time Polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay.</detailed_description>
