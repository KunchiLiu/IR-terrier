	<brief_title>Survivorship Care Plans in a Community Oncology Practice</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Part 1: The research team will use a sociotechnical work systems model, developed by researchers at the University of Wisconsin (UW) Systems Engineering Initiative for Patience Safety (SEIPS), to guide analysis of the work system barriers and facilitators to implementing an EHR-based care planning model in community oncology practice, collected from direct observations. Part 2: The research team will measure reach/maintenance (percentage of survivors with EHR-based survivorship care plans (SCPs) over a 9-month time period) and impact (pre/post survey of patient satisfaction and perceived care coordination).</detailed_description>
