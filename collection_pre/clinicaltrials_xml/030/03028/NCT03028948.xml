	<brief_summary>This clinical trial studies how well an interactive tailored website works in promoting sun protection and skin self-check behaviors in patients with stage 0-III melanoma. An internet-based program may help individuals to perform skin self-checks and engage in sun protection behaviors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Interactive Tailored Website to Promote Sun Protection and Skin Self-Check Behaviors in Patients With Stage 0-III Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the impact of the interactive tailored website (ITW) versus usual care on skin self-examination (SSE) and sun protection behaviors among individuals diagnosed with melanoma. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To examine mediators of the impact of the intervention. The effects of the intervention on SSE and sun protection behaviors will be mediated by melanoma knowledge, self-efficacy for SSE and sun protection behaviors, perceived benefits of SSE and sun protection behaviors, perceived barriers to SSE and sun protection behaviors, and perceived controllability of melanoma. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To examine moderators of the impact of the intervention. To evaluate whether ITW effects are moderated by the following factors: time since diagnosis, disease stage, age, sex, income, education, Internet experience, distress about melanoma, worry about recurrence, and evaluation and usage of the ITW. OUTLINE: Phase I: Patients review draft website content materials in a semi-structured format and provide feedback via open- and closed-ended questions for the development, testing, and finalization of ITW. Phase II: Patients are randomized into 1 of 2 arms. ARM I: Patients access ITW and complete each module over 30-40 minutes. ARM II: Patients receive usual care and are then offered ITW. All patients in Phase II complete surveys over 20-40 minutes at 8, 24, and 48 weeks.</detailed_description>
