	<brief_summary>A growing body of physiological evidence now exists to support a potential role for inhaled cannabis in the medical management of adults with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), particularly as it may related to improving pulmonary function, alleviating the symptom of breathlessness and improving exercise endurance. The purpose of this randomized double-blind crossover trials is to evaluate the efficacy and physiological mechanism(s) of action of inhaled vaporized cannabis targeted to relief of physical activity-related breathlessness and exercise endurance in symptomatic patients with severe-to-very severe COPD.</brief_summary>
