	<detailed_description>The research project is a study to assess the effects of a multi-component intervention in increasing physical activity among breast cancer survivors. Individuals meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria will be randomized to one of sixteen intervention groups for the 6 months. Intervention components will include print-based education, self-monitoring, Active Living counseling, supervised exercise sessions, and facility access. Blood samples will be collected at baseline. Assessments (anxiety, stress, sleep) and sample collection will also occur at 3 time points during the intervention (Weeks 13 and 25). Changes in physical activity will be assessed for each intervention group.</detailed_description>
