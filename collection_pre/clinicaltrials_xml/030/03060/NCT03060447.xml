	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Key Plasma HIV1 RNA levels &lt;50 copies/mL at screening PreART Plasma HIV1 RNA set point between 50 and ≤ 5,000 copies/mL measured within two years prior to ART initiation On ART for ≥ 6 months prior to screening Documented plasma HIV1 RNA &lt; 50 copies/mL for ≥ 6 months preceding the screening visit (or undetectable HIV1 RNA level according to the local assay being used if the limit of detection is ≥ 50 copies/mL). Unconfirmed virologic elevations of ≥ 50 copies/mL (transient detectable viremia, or "blip") prior to screening are acceptable. No documented history of resistance to any components of the current ART regimen Availability of a fully active alternative ART regimen, in the opinion of the Investigator, in the event of discontinuation of the current ART regimen with development of resistance. Hemoglobin ≥ 11.5 g/dL (males) or ≥ 11 g/dL (females) White Blood Cells ≥ 2,500 cells/μL Platelets ≥ 125,000/mL Absolute Neutrophil Counts ≥ 1000 cells/μL CD4+ count ≥ 500 cells/μL Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or bilirubin ≤ 2 × upper limit of normal (ULN) Estimated glomerular filtration rate ≥ 60 mL/min No autoimmune disease requiring ongoing immunosuppression No evidence of current hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection No evidence of current hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection (positive antiHCV antibody and negative HCV polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results are acceptable) No documented history of preART CD4 nadir &lt; 200 cells/μL (unknown preART CD4 nadir is acceptable) No history of opportunistic illness indicative of stage 3 HIV No acute febrile illness within 35 days prior to PreBaseline/ Day 13 Note: Other protocl defined Inclusion/Exclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
