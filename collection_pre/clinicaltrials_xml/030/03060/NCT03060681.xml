	<brief_summary>The most commonly used technique to anesthetize patients scheduled for thoracic or lumbar spine surgery is general anesthesia. Analgesic techniques vary from the use of neuraxial techniques like epidural, intrathecal, or caudal analgesia, nerve root infiltration to the use of systemic opioids, Paracetamol, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), steroids and gabapentinoids . In 2015, a promising regional analgesia technique was reported, that targets the dorsal, rather than ventral, rami of the thoracolumbar nerves as they pass through the paraspinal musculature, and called this a thoracolumbar interfacial plane block (TLIP).</brief_summary>
