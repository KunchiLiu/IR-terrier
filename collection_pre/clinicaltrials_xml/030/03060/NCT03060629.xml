	<criteria>Sexually active, defined as having had sexual intercourse with a male partner at least twice in the past 30 days prior to screening, and is considered by the site staff to be at risk for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection Access to a participating HIV Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN) Clinical Research Sites (CRS) and willingness to be followed for the planned duration of the study Willingness to discuss HIV infection risks and willing to receive HIV risk reduction counseling and appropriate referrals to minimize HIV acquisition, as applicable Negative beta human chorionic gonadotropin (betaHCG) pregnancy test performed prior to vaccination on the day of initial vaccination. Persons who are NOT of reproductive potential due to having undergone total hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy (verified by medical records), are not required to undergo pregnancy testing Participants must also agree not to seek pregnancy through alternative methods, such as artificial insemination or in vitro fertilization until 3 months after the last vaccination Investigational research agents received within 30 days before first vaccination HIV vaccine(s) received in a prior HIV vaccine trial. For volunteers who have received control/placebo in an HIV vaccine trial, the HVTN 705/HPX2008 (Protocol Safety Review Team) PSRT will determine eligibility on a casebycase basis Live attenuated vaccines other than influenza vaccine received within 30 days before first vaccination or scheduled within 14 days after injection (example: measles, mumps, and rubella [MMR]; oral polio vaccine [OPV]; varicella; yellow fever) Influenza vaccine or any vaccines that are not live attenuated vaccines and were received within 14 days prior to first vaccination (eg, tetanus, pneumococcal, Hepatitis A or B) Immunosuppressive medications received within 6 months before first vaccination</criteria>
