	<brief_summary>This study will be aimed at assessing the feasibility of a dual-device treatment prior to a rehabilitation session for an orthopaedic injury requiring immobilization, and its impact on improving outcomes and decreasing the risk for development of neuropathic pain. We will evaluate the clinical feasibility and effectiveness of incorporating the Alpha-Stim and Inter-X treatment into a standard rehabilitation protocol to address risk factors associated with the development of neuropathic pain (i.e., pain, range of motion, and skin temperature) as well as its impact on reduced pain medication.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Once patients provide consent and we have determined that they meet inclusion criteria the process will occur as follows: 1. Patients will be administered baseline demographic and standard medical history questionnaires, including information about prescription medication use. In addition, patients will fill out baseline self-report outcomes and be administered the (LANSS) Pain Scale. Range of motion and temperature will also be assessed during the initial session. Some of these measurements are standard of care and would be filled out by the patient even if they were not participating in the study. Usual CARE The usual care aspect of this study is the delivery of the pain treatment (NIN and CES) as is commonly used at the Center for the Intrepid. The experimental aspect is the combined delivery of the treatment, and the use of sham treatment as a control. The treatment (NIN and CES) will be delivered in a pragmatic fashion, with treatment delivered in conjunction with rehab visits and lasting approximately 4-weeks total. Each session will last approximately 20-40 minutes long, and will most often be delivered in conjunction with their rehab visit (physical therapy or occupational therapy) that occurs anywhere from 1 to 3 times each week. STRICTLY RESEARCH The experimental aspect of the study will be the comparison of combined treatment (NIN + CES), standard NIN with sham CES, to standard care alone. Before initiation of treatment patients will be randomized to either NIN + CES, NIN + Sham CES, or standard care only immediately after the immobilization device (cast, brace, etc) has been removed. Randomization with be performed with a random number gerator. All groups will continue with their own rehabilitation as indicated throughout the entire course of the study treatment, and beyond as indicated by their therapist. We will keep track of rehab appointments and visits, but not control for them. 3. At the 1-month follow-up, all subjects will fill out the same self-report outcome measures from baseline, to include prescription pain medication and be administered the LANSS pain scale. Range of motion and temperature will also be assessed. 4. At the 2 and 4-month follow-up the same assessments will again be administered. If the subject has completed formal therapy prior to the 2 and 4 month follow-up time points he or she will be asked to return to the clinic to complete these assessments. Patients may be contacted by telephone or email, if agreeable, to provide a reminder for the return appointment(s). 5. Outcomes will be compared between the three groups at each time point (i.e., initial, one month, two months, four months). 6. All patients will be followed out to 4 months. Although every attempt will be made to collect data at these specific times, due to the variability of patient and clinic schedules, the actual timing of collection may vary (+/- 1 week) and some of the proposed measures may not be collected at all time points.</detailed_description>
