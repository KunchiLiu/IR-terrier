	<detailed_description>The primary objectives of this study include: (i) The detection of patients with serum liver biochemistry abnormalities less than 8 weeks after intake of ZGGJ Pill; (ii) The record of overall individuals with demographics, underlying diseases, physical status, medication information, clinical laboratory index, and so on; (iii) The specimen collection of surveiled individuals. (iv) The attempt to establish a predictive model to screen susceptibilities to ZGGJ Pill.</detailed_description>
