	<brief_title>Proliferative Effects of Erythropoietin on Human Endometrium</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>20 postmenopausal women who are planned to treat with erythropoietin alpha for their renal conditions will be included to the study. Sample size was calculated with proper power analysis with accepting the difference of 1 mm in endometrial thickness as a significant change. After the informed consent, endometrial thickness (mm), uterine artery and subendometrial blood flow by doppler ultrasonography (RI, S/D) will be measured. Same measurements will be repeated on the 3rd day and 30th day. Patients' age, BMI, co-morbidities, administered erythropoietin doses will be noted. No adverse effect is expected with regard to the ultrasonographic examination. Date of the patients who do not attend for the appointments for repetitive examinations and uninterpretable doppler variables due to the atrophic uterus will be noted as the missing data and will be excluded from the study. Proper statistical analysis will be done.</detailed_description>
