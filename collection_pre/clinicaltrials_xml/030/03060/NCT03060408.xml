	<brief_summary>In this retrospective cohort study, the investigators reviewed and analyzed the electronic medical records of consecutive patients who underwent distal pancreatectomy either via laparotomy or laparoscopy. Intraoperative fluid administration amount, postoperative complications, length of hospital stay, and readmission rate were evaluated. The total fluid amounts were calculated using the sum of colloids multiplied by 1.5 or 2.0 and crystalloids.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Fluid Requirements in Pancreatectomy: Laparotomy vs. Laparoscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There has been recent progress in intraoperative fluid therapy. However, little is known about intraoperative fluid therapy in laparoscopic surgery. The purpose of this study is to determine whether there are differences in the basal fluid requirements during surgery between laparotomy and laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy. This study analyzed the records between June 2006 and March 2016. And 253 patients who underwent distal pancreatectomy via either laparotomy (73 patients) or laparoscopy (180 patients). This study was based on a retrospective review and analysis of the electronic medical records. The volume of intraoperative fluid administered, postoperative complications, length of hospital stay, and readmission rate were evaluated. The total volume of fluids was calculated as the sum of the volume of crystalloid plus the volume of colloid multiplied by 1.5 or 2.0.</detailed_description>
