	<brief_title>Systematic Hereditary Pancreatic Cancer Risk Assessment and Implications for Personalized Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research is being done to identify which pancreatic cancer patients should undergo genetic evaluation. A patient's personal and family history of cancer is the information typically used to make this decision, but there are currently no accurate, evidence-based guidelines that exist to help doctors use this information to make a decision. The investigators hope that by testing all new pancreatic cancer patients, they can determine which clinical factors predict for genetic mutations in order to create a risk assessment tool. The investigators want to determine which patients with pancreatic cancer will benefit from genetic testing. To do so, the investigators will offer all patients with pancreatic cancer in the Dana-Farber Gastrointestinal Oncology clinic referral for genetic evaluation. At the Cancer Genetics and Prevention clinic appointment, the provider will review the patient's personal and familial history of cancer and offer genetic testing.</detailed_description>
