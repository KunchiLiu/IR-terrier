	<brief_summary>Partial blood oxygen and carbon dioxide pressures obtained in critical ill neonates by transcutaneous sensors will be compared to respective values obtained by medically indicated arterial and capillary blood gas analyses. The influence of blood withdrawal method, sensor operational temperature and application time, presence of cyanotic heart malformations and/or intra or extra cardiac right to left shunt, vasoactive drugs, elevated non-conjugated bilirubin, and skin and soft tissue oedema, skin colour and perfusion conditions will be elucidated as well as sensor`s safety. Study duration will be 48 hours with sensors applied and additional 4 hours of further surveillance for thermal injury.</brief_summary>
