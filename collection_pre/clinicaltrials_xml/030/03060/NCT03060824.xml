	<brief_summary>During the use of Cardiopulmonary Bypass (CPB) for cardiac surgery there is an instant mixture of the patient's blood and the fluid needed to fill the extracorporeal circuit before use. This will change the composition of the body fluids. This study aims to plot these changes in regard to particle concentration (osmolality).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Changes in Plasma Osmolality Related to the Use of Cardiopulmonary Bypass With Hyperosmolar Prime.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>During the use of CPB for cardiac surgery there is an instant mixture of the patient's blood and the fluid needed to prime the extracorporeal circuit. Many studies have pointed to the benefits of using a hyperosmolar prime to counteract formation of tissue oedema. Rapid changes in osmolality may as a serious consequence lead to osmotic demyelination syndrome. At the Heart Centre of Ume√• University Hospital, Sweden, there is a tradition of using a hyperosmolar prime. This study aims to explore changes in osmolality during coronary artery bypass grafting surgery by repeated measurements of osmolality and concentration shifts of sodium, glucose and urea in plasma.</detailed_description>
