	<brief_title>Zeushield Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes (Z-CTLs) for Relapsed or Refractory Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this first in human study is to determine the safety and feasibility of Zeushield Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes(Z-CTLs) in patients with relapsed or refractory NSCLC. Z-CTLs therapy is a novel immunotherapy under investigation in which patients have their T-cells (a type of white blood cell) collected and modified in the laboratory, before they are given back to the patient. The T-cells are modified to transform the intracellular signal domain of PD-1 and CTLA-4 to immune activation stimulus signal and transform T cells to a new kind of cancer-killer cells: zeushield cytotoxic T lymphocytes (Z-CTls).</detailed_description>
