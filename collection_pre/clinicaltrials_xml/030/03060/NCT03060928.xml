	<brief_summary>Evaluation of clinical and radiological outcomes in patients undergoing Arthroscopic Rotator Cuff Repair with standard treatment compared to patients receiving biological stimulation with micro-perforations or with the combination of micro-perforations and use of Artelon® Tissue Reinforcement, a synthetic device based on degradable polyurethaneurea. The investigators believe that this kind of tendon-to-bone healing stimulation with the two proposed methods can increase the repair quality by significantly decreasing the lesion recurrence rate (currently described for 15% of patients) and can improve various parameters such as pain, range of motion and strength, thereby hastening the return to daily activities and psycho-physical well-being.</brief_summary>
