	<brief_summary>Obstructed defecation syndrome (ODS) is a common problem in women. Rectal prolapse and rectocoele are frequently identified in patients with ODS. Surgery is the only definite treatment for those patients and is preferably performed minimally invasive. The most used procedures are laparoscopic ventral mesh rectopexy (LVMR) and stapled trans-anal rectal resection (STARR). However, high-level prospective studies on treatment strategies for ODS currently are lacking and, thus, no consensus exist regarding the optimal treatment for patients with ODS. This study aimed to compare LVMR alone and LVMR combined with STARR evaluating functional and anatomical results.</brief_summary>
