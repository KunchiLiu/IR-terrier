	<brief_summary>In patients undergoing RIRS for kidney stone, we aim to show the effect of single lung ventilation with a double lumen tube on operative (operation scope duration, perforation, hemorrhage, etc. complications) and postoperative parameters (stone-free rates, complications like postoperative hemorrhage and fever, hospital stay, etc.) and to show changes in renal stone position during simultaneous normal ventilation and single lung ventilation.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In recent years open surgical treatment has changed to minimal invasive treatments for kidney stone treatment. Additionally, the treatment choices vary depending on the localization of the stone and its dimensions. In the European Urology Association (EUA) guidelines, it states the RIRS method can be used to treat stones up to 2 cm in the kidney. Due to RIRS the operation and scopy durations and hospital stay have clearly reduced compared to the standard treatment of percutaneous nephrolithotomy. However, the high hydrostatic pressure applied to the renal pelvis during RIRS may cause unwanted results in the postoperative period such as hydronephrosis and loss of renal parenchyma. During the operation, the stone may move during deep inspirium and expirium sequences linked to deep ventilation which may lengthen the operation and scope durations and brings risks such as perforation during laser lithotripsy application. In this study we aimed to apply single lung ventilation during the operation (one of the indications for single lung ventilation is to increase surgical view and ease manipulation) to minimize renal movement on that side and reduce peroperative and postoperative complications.</detailed_description>
