	<brief_summary>Subjective well-being refers to people's level of satisfaction with life as a whole and with multiple dimensions within it. Interventions that promote subjective well-being are important because there is evidence that physical health, mental health, substance use and health care costs may be related to subjective well-being. This randomized controlled trial will evaluate an online intervention, named Fun For Wellness (FFW), designed to promote well-being skills and self-efficacy in six domains of life: interpersonal, community, occupational, physical, psychological, and economic (I COPPE). The Usual Care (UC) control group will be wait-listed. Five hundred (500) community-based adult patient participants will be enrolled. We hypothesize that compared to the UC group, intervention group participants will show greater improvement in their overall subjective well-being, domain-specific well-being, health-related quality of life, and well-being self-efficacy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fun For Wellness: Online Well-Being Promotion Intervention in a Patient Sample</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjective well-being is a positive state affairs in six domains of life: interpersonal, community, occupational, physical, psychological, and economic (I COPPE). The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness, feasibility, and acceptability of an online intervention named Fun For Wellness (FFW), designed to promote skills and self-efficacy in the multidimensional I COPPE domains of life. In designing the program we considered the pressing societal need to promote universal health and well-being and prevent stress, illness and disease. Preventable conditions related to lifestyle such as obesity and stress afflict millions of people. Therefore, we saw a need to develop a universal tool for the adult population who would be comfortable with the online platform of FFW. Universal programs have been shown to be effective, for example, in reducing mental health problems in college students. While face-to-face interventions are effective in preventing serious conditions, they are very labor intensive and limited in reach. The ability to prevent adverse conditions and to enhance healthy behaviors through online interventions creates several opportunities: accessibility, scalability, interactivity, affordability, and fidelity of implementation. A randomized controlled trial of the FFW intervention in an employee sample, found initial evidence for the effectiveness of the FFW intervention. Participants who complied with the FFW intervention had significantly higher subjective well-being, as compared to compliers in the Usual Care group, in multiple I COPPE domains. For the current study, well-being and self-efficacy measures will be administered at baseline (T1), 30 days-post baseline (T2) and 60 days -post baseline (T3). A maximum of 500 patients will be enrolled. Recruitment will take place on-site through IRB approved study flyers at a community medical center. All other study activities will take place entirely online at a secure website. Hypothesis 1: Outcome effects: The online well-being program will be more effective than the usual care condition in improving: 1) overall well-being 2) domain well-being, and 3) health related quality of life (HRQOL) over time. Hypothesis 2: Self-efficacy effect: The online well-being program will be more effective than the usual care condition in improving I COPPE well-being self-efficacy. Hypothesis 3: Mediating effect: The effect of the online well-being program on- 1) overall well-being, 2) domain well-being and, 3) health related quality of life will be partially mediated by improvements in I COPPE well-being self-efficacy over time.</detailed_description>
