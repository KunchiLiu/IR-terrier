	<brief_summary>The aim of the current study is to compare a newly introduced material which is a combination of triple mix antibiotics paste and anti-hyperlipidemia drug simvastatin, the new material is named 3MIX-TATIN &amp; will be compared to triple antibiotic paste for management of necrotic primary molars by using lesion sterilization and tissue repair LSTR technique.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of Postoperative Pain After Using 3MIX-TATIN Versus Calcium Hydroxide Iodoform Paste In Necrotic Primary Molars Treated by Lesion Sterilization and Tissue Repair Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>3Mix-tatin will prepared by mixing three commercially available antibiotics with simvastatin. After removing the coating materials, 3 types of antibiotics are pulverized by porcelain mortars and pestles to achieve fine powders. A total of 100 mg ciprofloxacin, 100 mg metronidazole, and 100 mg cefixime will be mixed in a ratio of 1: 1: 1. Two milligrams of simvastatin will be added to the drugs blend to form 3-Mix-tatin. Preparation of 3Mixtatin will be trained and supervised by an expert pharmacist. 3Mixtatin will be stored in a tightly capped porcelain container, adding a small amount of silica gel in a bag inside the container to maintain low humidity. This powder will be mixed with normal saline to form a creamy paste of 3Mixtatin at the time of application. Local anesthesia using mepivicaine hydrochloride 3% (septodont, saint-maurdesFosses, France) will be administered. Rubber dam isolation. Access cavity will be prepared with a fissure bur in a high-speed handpiece, necrotic pulp tissue will be removed using a sterile sharp spoon excavator. The canal orifices will be enlarged with a round bur (one mm diameter and two mm depth) to create medication receptacles. Cotton pellet moistened with 2.5% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) will be placed in the pulp chamber for 1 minute. Bleeding, if present, will be controlled by applying sterile cotton pellet moistened with 10% sodium hypochlorite against the pulp stumps and will be maintained for 1 min. The 3-Mix-Tatin will be mixed with saline to obtain a creamy mix and placed over the canal orifices and the pulpal floor. The access opening will be sealed with a glass ionomer cement , and the tooth will be restored with a stainless steel crown.</detailed_description>
