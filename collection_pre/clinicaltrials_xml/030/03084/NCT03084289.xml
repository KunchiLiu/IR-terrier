	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and immunogenicity of novel routes of administration of the candidate malaria vaccine ChAd63 encoding ME-TRAP. 15 Healthy adult volunteers will be recruited in Oxford. All vaccinations will be administered intravenously or subcutaneously. Each volunteer will receive a single vaccination of ChAd63-ME-TRAP at different doses depending on the group.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Group1 consists of 3 volunteers receiving i.v. ChAd63 ME-TRAP at the dose of 5x10^8 vp. Group 2 consists of 3 volunteers receiving i.v. ChAd63 ME-TRAP at the dose of 5x10^9 vp. Group 3 consists of 3 volunteers receiving i.v. ChAd63 ME-TRAP at the dose of 5x10^10vp. Group 4 consists of 3 volunteers receiving s.c. ChAd63 ME-TRAP at the dose of 5x10^10 vp. Group 5 consists of 3 volunteers receiving s.c. ChAd63 ME-TRAP at the dose of 2x10^11 vp. The first Group 1 volunteer to receive intravenous ChAd63 ME-TRAP will be vaccinated alone. Safety data for the first 72 hours following vaccination must be satisfactorily reviewed before the remaining group 1 volunteers are vaccinated. The safety data for the first 72 hours following vaccination for all the volunteers in the group will again be reviewed before the first volunteer in the higher dose group 2 is vaccinated. Safety data for the first 72 hours following vaccination of this volunteer must be satisfactorily reviewed before the remaining group 2 volunteers are vaccinated. Similarly the safety data for the first 72 hours following vaccination for all the volunteers in this group will again be reviewed before the first volunteer in the higher dose group 3 is vaccinated. Once there is satisfactory review of the safety data of the first 72 hours post vaccination for this volunteer, the remaining group 3 volunteers will be enrolled to receive IV vaccination. In parallel with Group 1, the first Group 4 volunteer to receive subcutaneous Chad63 ME-TRAP will be vaccinated alone. Safety data for the first 72 hours following vaccination must be satisfactorily reviewed before the remaining group 4 volunteers are vaccinated. The safety data for the first 72 hours following vaccination for all the volunteers in the group will again be reviewed before the first volunteer in the higher dose group 5 is vaccinated. Once there is satisfactory review of the safety data of the first 72 hours post vaccination for this volunteer, the remaining group 5 volunteers will be enrolled to receive SC vaccination.</detailed_description>
