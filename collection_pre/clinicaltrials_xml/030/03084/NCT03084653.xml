	<brief_title>Choosing the Technique for First Abdominal Entry in Laparoscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Several methods, i.e., the Veress needle, open approach using the Hasson trocar and direct trocar insertion without insufflation have been described for initial abdominal entry in laparoscopy. On the other hand, relatively new approaches, e.g., the optical or radially expanding trocars did not become common yet. Despite the advantages of laparoscopic surgery, serious complications can be encountered during the initial entry. Development of a complication, e.g., major vascular and intestinal injury, would affect the outcome of the operation and it may result in conversion to the open approach. Because of low incidence of these complications, it is impossible to show any superiority of one approach to another. In this study, we aimed to analyze the rationale and the process of decision making of a surgeon about initial abdominal entry technique for laparoscopy.</detailed_description>
