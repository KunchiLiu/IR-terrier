	<criteria>1. Subject must be &gt; 18 years old 2. Subjects presenting with stable angina, silent ischemia or nonSTelevation ACS (unstable angina or biomarker positive) 3. Single vessel CAD with at least 2 separate lesions (≥10 mm apart) of ≥40% stenosis or a single long lesion of ≥20mm OR multivessel CAD, defined as at least 2 vessels with ≥40% stenosis 4. PrePCI iFR performed in all vessels intended for PCI 5. PrePCI iFR of &lt;0.90 of at least 1 stenosis 6. Subjects are able and willing to comply with scheduled visits and tests and to provide informed consent. 1. Pregnant or planning to become pregnant for the duration of the study 2. Acute STEMI within the past 7 days 3.
