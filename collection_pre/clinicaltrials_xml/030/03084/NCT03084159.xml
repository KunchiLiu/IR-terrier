	<brief_summary>This study will use an adapted education worksheet to support patient-centered chronic kidney disease (CKD) communication, shared decision making, and patient engagement and will test its impact on intermediate patient modifiable characteristics in a primary care practice with patients who have pre-dialysis CKD. The study team will enroll up to 50 patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) from a primary care clinic to start. Patients will receive the intervention, which consists of the physicians using the education worksheet during appointments with patients, and patients and providers will complete surveys about its use and to measure impact on knowledge and other areas related to patient outcomes. Once initial user testing is complete, the study team plans to submit an amendment to expand on this trial and incorporate comparison sites. This will be submitted and receive IRB approval prior to participant involvement. The study hypothesis is that patients who receive the intervention will have greater knowledge about their CKD diagnosis, higher satisfaction with provider communication, and higher scores related to managing CKD to keep themselves healthy compared to control populations.</brief_summary>
