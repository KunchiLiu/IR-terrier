	<brief_summary>Encephalitics is a serious condition in which the brain becomes inflamed (swollen). It usually happens as a direct result of virus, such as herpes simplex virus (HSV). HSV encephalitis is often treated with the drug acyclovir (an antiviral drug which slows the growth and spread of HSV in the body). Despite this however, around 2 out of every 3 people will have memory difficulties long term. Dexamethasone is a corticosteroid medication, which works by preventing the release of natural chemicals in the body which cause inflammation. It is possible that dexamethasone could help to reduce in swelling of the brain may improve the recovery of patients with HSV encephalitis. The aim of this study is to find out whether treatment with dexamethasone can improve long-term health outcomes in adults with HSV Encephalitis.</brief_summary>
