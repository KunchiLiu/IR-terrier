	<brief_summary>CMP-001-002 is a Phase 1b study of CMP-001 administered either subcutaneously (SC) or intratumorally (IT) followed by subsequent SC administration, in combination with Pembrolizumab in subjects with advanced cutaneous melanoma who are either receiving Pembrolizumab, or who have previously received an anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy for advanced cutaneous melanoma, and who have not responded (i.e. immunotherapy resistant). This study will be conducted in two parts: Part 1 will consist of a Dose Escalation Phase and a Dose Expansion Phase of CMP-001 - Dose Escalation Phase will be conducted to assess and identify a recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) for SC administration. - The Dose Expansion Phase is intended to further characterize the safety, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary evidence of antitumor activity of the RP2D of CMP-001 administered SC in combination with Pembrolizumab. Part 2 will assess the safety and preliminary evidence of antitumor activity of CMP-001, administered IT for 3 weekly doses, followed by CMP-001 SC dosing every 3 weeks (q3wk), when given in combination with Pembrolizumab.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subjects enrolled into Part 1 must have metastatic lesions where repeated IT injections are not feasible and in whom SC injection is the only viable route of CMP001 administration, based on Investigator judgment. Subjects with injectable lesions are NOT eligible to participate in Part 1. Subjects enrolled into Part 2 must have metastatic lesions that are amenable to repeated IT injections. All subjects enrolled into either Part 1 or Part 2 must meet all of the following inclusion criteria to be eligible: Histopathologically confirmed diagnosis of metastatic malignant melanoma arising from skin. Ocular melanoma subjects are not eligible. Male or female subjects age 18 or older 1. Currently receiving treatment with the antiPD1 antibody Pembrolizumab either alone or in combination. Subjects must have either Stable Disease (SD) or Progressive Disease (PD) per RECIST Version 1.1 while on Pembrolizumab. Subjects who have had SD must have been on Pembrolizumab for at least 12 weeks. There is no minimum treatment duration for subjects who have PD while on Pembrolizumab. OR 2. Subjects who have previously received any antiPD1/PDL1 therapy, alone or in combination, and who were deemed to have not responded to this therapy/combination irrespective of the timing of the prior therapy relative to first dose of CMP001. Subjects must have measurable disease by RECIST Version 1.1. Capable of understanding and complying with protocol requirements. A life expectancy of greater than 24 weeks at Screening. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 1. Most recent laboratory values (within 2 weeks prior to Week 1 Day 1 (W1D1)) before study entry meet the following standards: 1. Bone marrow function: neutrophil count &gt;/=1,000/mm3, platelet count &gt;/= 75,000/mm3 and hemoglobin concentration &gt;/= 8.0 g/dL. 2. Liver function: total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) of each institution, aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase ≤ 3 times the ULN range of each institution. 3. LDH ≤2.0 times the ULN range of each institution 4. Renal function: serum creatinine ≤1.5 times the ULN range of each institution. The subject or the subject's legally acceptable representative must sign a written informed consent form prior to the initiation of any study procedures. Pregnant or breast feeding. Received investigational therapy with another drug or biologic within 30 days prior to the start of CMP001 dosing on W1D1. However, if an investigational drug has a short halflife, a shorter wash out period may be acceptable upon permission given by the Sponsor. Received treatment with antiCTLA4 antibody within 30 days prior to the start of CMP001 dosing on W1D1. Known infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV). Developed autoimmune disorders of Grade 4 while on prior immunotherapy. Subjects who developed autoimmune disorders of Grade ≤ 3 may enroll if the disorder has resolved to Grade ≤1 and the subject has been off systemic steroids for at least 2 weeks. Subjects who experienced autoimmune colitis as a toxicity of prior immunotherapy must undergo screening colonoscopy to rule out ongoing inflammation or have documentation that colitis has resolved (i.e. prior colonoscopy). Require systemic pharmacologic doses of corticosteroids at or above the equivalent of 10 mg/d prednisone; replacement doses, topical, ophthalmologic and inhalational steroids are permitted. Active (i.e., symptomatic or growing) central nervous system (CNS) metastases. Subjects with CNS metastases are eligible for the trial if the metastases have been treated by surgery and/or radiotherapy, the subject is off corticosteroids and is neurologically stable for at least 2 weeks prior to Screening. Any concurrent uncontrolled illness, including mental illness or substance abuse, which in the opinion of the Investigator, would make the subject unable to cooperate or participate in the trial. Severe uncontrolled cardiac disease within 6 months of study entry, including but not limited to uncontrolled hypertension; unstable angina; myocardial infarction (MI) or cerebrovascular accident (CVA). Requires prohibited treatment (i.e., nonprotocol specified anticancer pharmacotherapy, surgery or conventional radiotherapy for treatment of malignant tumor). Women of childbearing potential who are unable or unwilling to use an acceptable method of contraception.</criteria>
