	<detailed_description>Using a 3-arm randomized trial design with repeated measures at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months, the study will randomize N=1650 smokers who present for LDCT lung cancer screening to an passive referral usual care control condition, proactive referral to a digital cessation intervention that combines web and text messaging, or proactive referral to a digital cessation intervention combined with Tobacco Treatment Specialist counseling. The Study will examine overall effectiveness of the interventions in promoting abstinence, the impact of proactive referral to treatment, and the total cost and cost effectiveness of the interventions. The Study will also examine the representativeness of the enrolled sample and explore barriers and facilitators to intervention adoption with LDCT clinic leaders. The trial is structured as a practical clinical trial to answer key questions of direct relevance to LDCT decision-makers.</detailed_description>
