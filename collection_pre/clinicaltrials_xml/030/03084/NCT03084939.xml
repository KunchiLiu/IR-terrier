	<brief_summary>This is a Phase III, randomized, multicenter, two-arm, open-label study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of trastuzumab emtansine compared with that of lapatinib + capecitabine in Chinese participants with HER2-positive, unresectable locally advanced breast cancer (LABC) or metastatic breast cancer (MBC) who have received prior trastuzumab-based therapy. A total of approximately 400 participants will be enrolled in China. Eligible participants will be randomized in a 3:1 ratio to receive either trastuzumab emtansine or control (lapatinib + capecitabine).</brief_summary>
