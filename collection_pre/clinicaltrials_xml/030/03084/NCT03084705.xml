	<brief_summary>The goal of this study is to determine the effectiveness of interactive feedback from a wearable device that senses hand function, the Manumeter, in improving upper extremity function in a pilot, randomized controlled trial with chronic stroke patients</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Wearable Device for Motivating Hand Use After Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this randomized controlled trial, the investigators will compare two groups of chronic stroke participants Group 1 of study participants will use the Manumeter with interactive functions to monitor and motivate upper extremity functional activity. Group 2 of study participants will use the Manumeter but receive no feedback and will be given the current standard-of-care, a booklet describing a home exercise program for increasing upper extremity exercise. The investigators hypothesize that study participants who interactively monitor functional activity with the Manumeter will improve their upper extremity function significantly more.</detailed_description>
