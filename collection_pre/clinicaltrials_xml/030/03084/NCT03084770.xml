	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to evaluate the most appropriate management of sporadic asymptomatic non-functioning pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (NF-PNEN) ≤ 2 cm. P NF-PNEN management will be decided at the hospital and all therapeutics decision will be decided/coordinated by the treating physician. Patients will be either submitted to surgical resection or to active surveillance.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In the last decade a dramatic increase in diagnosis of small, incidentally discovered, NF-PNEN was observed. Various study indicates the safety of a conservative management for this lesion and the The European Neuroendocrine Tumor Society (ENETS) proposed a "wait and see" approach for small NF-PNEN. Indications for surgery include the presence of a localized NF-PNEN in the absence of distant metastases as curative resection of these tumors is associated with favourable prognosis especially for low grade. In the last decade a dramatic increase in diagnosis of small, incidentally discovered, NF-PNEN was observed.Moreover, other investigators observed a clear relationship between the tumor diameter and low risk of malignancy and systemic progression. In particular, a tumor size ≤ 2 cm seems to be associated with a negligible risk of disease recurrence and with a very low incidence of aggressive features such as lymph node involvement.On this basis, the European Neuroendocrine Tumor Society (ENETS) proposed a "wait and see" approach for small NF-PNEN when incidentally discovered. Since then, various series evaluated the safety of a conservative management for small, sporadic, incidentally diagnosed, NF-PNEN. After a median follow-up of 28-45 months, all the studies confirmed that an intensive surveillance for incidental and small NF-PNEN is safe in selected cases. Nevertheless, available data are based only on retrospective series with a significant heterogeneity of inclusion criteria and different tumor diameter cut-off and the appropriate management of this entities (surveillance versus surgery) is still a matter of debate.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age &gt; 18 years Individuals with asymptomatic sporadic NFPNEN ≤ 2 cm Diagnosis has to be proven by a positive fineneedle aspiration (FNA) or by the presence of a measurable nodule on highquality imaging technique (CT or MR) that is positive at 68Gallium DOTATOCPET scan or Octreoscan. Patients who undergo surgery for NFPNEN&lt;2cm within 12 months. In these cases, diagnosis has to be proven by histological confirmation of NFPNEN Informed consent NFPNEN &gt; 2 cm of maximum diameter Presence of genetic syndrome (MEN1, VHL, NF) Presence of symptoms (specific symptoms suspicious of a clinical syndrome related to hypersecretion of bioactive compounds) or unspecific symptoms</criteria>
