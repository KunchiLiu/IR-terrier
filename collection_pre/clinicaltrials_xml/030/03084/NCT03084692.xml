	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to determine the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a combined therapeutic yoga and resistance exercise intervention for individuals with lung cancer and their caregivers. The investigators aim is to help reduce the fear of exercise by tailoring the program to meet the specific needs of the survivor with lung cancer. The investigators want to see whether individuals with lung cancer and their caregivers are interested in participating in this type of program, and if they are able to attend the intervention sessions and complete the program. The investigators also plan to study the preliminary effects of therapeutic yoga and resistance exercise on fitness outcomes for both individuals with lung cancer and their caregivers.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Therapeutic Yoga and Resistance Exercise for Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To determine the feasibility of a combined therapeutic yoga and resistance exercise intervention for lung cancer survivors and their caregivers. A single group before and after intervention study design will be used for this pilot feasibility trial. Brochures and information about the study will be distributed at the Cross Cancer Institute, and interested individuals will be screened for eligibility. A convenient sampling technique will be used to recruit individuals with lung cancer and their caregiver. Participants deemed eligible to take part in the study will provide written informed consent to participate in the study and will undergo baseline testing. The intervention will be carried out over a period of 8 weeks. The feasibility outcomes will include eligibility rate, completion rate, adherence rate and adverse events. Dyspnea will be the primary self-reported outcome to be measured for individuals with lung cancer. The secondary outcomes will include fatigue, shoulder range of motion, chest expansion, and muscular strength. The outcome measures for the caregivers will include quality of life (QoL) and muscular strength.</detailed_description>
