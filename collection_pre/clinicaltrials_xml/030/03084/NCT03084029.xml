	<brief_title>The Neural Basis of Oxytocin's Effects on Empathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The neuropeptide oxytocin (OXT) has been demonstrated to modulate empathy in previous behavioural studies. The present study aims at replicating previous findings on OXT on empathy as well as to determine the neural basis of these effects. In a between-subject, randomized double-blind design, subjects will be either administered intranasal OXT or placebo nasal spray (40 IU). 45 minutes after administration subjects will undergo (fMRI) tasks of empathic processing. During the tasks subjects will be shown empathy inducing stimuli, and the behavioral and neural response in terms of cognitive, emotional and indirect emotional empathy will be assessed. Before the administration of treatment, validated questionnaires assessing potential confounding variables, such as depression (Becks Depression Inventory (BDI)) or mood (Positive And Negative Affect Scale (PANAS)) will be administered to the subjects.</detailed_description>
