	<brief_summary>The HBeAg positive CHB subjects who are cirrhosis, platelet&lt;14.0*104/mm3 ，HBVDNA&gt;2000IU/ml,will be randomized to two groups. The subjects who go into group A will be treated by nucleotide analogue (NA) combination with peginterferon alfa-2a,180μg/week for 48 weeks. The subjects who go into group B will be treated by nucleotide analogue (NA) only for 48 weeks.</brief_summary>
