	<brief_summary>Given the importance of healthy lifestyle practices to cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention and the utility of church-based interventions in African-American adults, the investigators developed a theory-informed, strategically-planned, health and wellness intervention with Rochester, Minnesota (MN) and Twin Cities area (Minneapolis, St. Paul, MN) churches with predominately African-American congregations. The objective of the study was to partner with churches to implement a multi-component, health education program through the use of core educational sessions delivered through a digital-application accessible on demand via interactive access on computer tablets and the Internet. The overarching goal was to increase the awareness and critical importance of healthy lifestyles for CVD prevention and provide support for behavior change.</brief_summary>
