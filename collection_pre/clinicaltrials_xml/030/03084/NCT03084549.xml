	<brief_summary>Episiotomy is a common obstetric gesture (20 to 30% of deliveries by the low route). In postpartum, perineal pains associated with episiotomy are common, about 70% on D7 and persistent 13% at 5 months. Most studies of obstetrical analgesia have focussed on pain during labor or following a caesarean section. The perineal pain associated with the realization of an episiotomy has been much less studied and often undervalued. Local ropivacaine has shown its effectiveness in the reduction of postoperative pain in many indications (wall surgery, hemorrhoidectomy, infiltration of trocar scars during laparoscopy). This product has the advantage of being well tolerated, easy access and administration. Three recent studies compared the post-episiotomy analgesic efficacy of local ropivacaine versus lidocaine versus placebo and lidocaine versus no infiltration. Two of these studies showed statistically significant results. However, they focused on the results at 24 and 48 hours and did not evaluate the analgesic efficacy in the medium and long term.</brief_summary>
