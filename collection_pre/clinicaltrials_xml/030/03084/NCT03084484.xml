	<brief_summary>The importance of micronutrients has been extensively reviewed and it was concluded that for prevention and treatment of periodontitis daily nutrition should include sufficient antioxidants, vitamin D and calcium. Up to now there is limited research available investigating the effect of vitamin C supplementation on the periodontal condition. Supplementation of vitamins and micronutrients has however raised numerous questions on clinical efficacy. Recently, a significant increase of medical literature on the effect of nutraceutical dietary aliments on general health has been noted. the aim of the present study is twofold. The first objective is to investigate the effect of twice-daily kiwifruit consumption as sole treatment modality in untreated periodontitis, followed after two months by initial periodontal therapy supported by continued kiwifruit consumption. The second objective is to investigate the effect of twice daily kiwifruit consumption on periodontal and systemic parameters of these periodontitis patients 3 months after treatment.</brief_summary>
