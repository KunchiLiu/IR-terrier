	<brief_title>Arthroscopic Assisted Open Reduction Internal Fixation Versus Open Reduction Internal Fixation in Ankle Fractures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prospective Randomized Clinical Trial evaluating patients with ankle fractures undergoing AORIF versus ORIF Participants will be randomized into 2 different surgical groups, one group receiving only ORIF and the other group receiving AORIF. As standard of care patients will follow up in the office at approximately 3 weeks, 6 weeks and 12 weeks post operatively. Patients will be immobilized in a splint and will be non-weight bearing until their 3 week post-op visit. At the 3 week post-op visit, the patient will be fitted in a boot, be instructed to begin self-directed ROM and to continue non-weight bearing. At the 6 week post-op visit, the patient will begin weight bearing in the boot. In office study visit will occur at these same times. At each visit weight bearing status, return to sports, pain level, AOFAS and FAAM will be assessed. One additional study visit will be conducted over the phone or by mail at approximately one year post operatively and will consist of the FAAM.</detailed_description>
