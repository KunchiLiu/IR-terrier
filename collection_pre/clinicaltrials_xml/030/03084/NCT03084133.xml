	<brief_summary>The relative risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) is increased in first-degree relatives of patients with CRC or advanced adenoma. In the high-risk CCR population defined by a family history at the first stage of CRC or advanced adenoma before age 60, total colonoscopy is the recommended screening test. In France, the rate of screening colonoscopy in this population at high risk of CRC is insufficient, which limits the effectiveness of this targeted screening. The main reason for this low participation rate is that most patients undergoing RCC or advanced adenoma are unaware of the family implications of their diagnosis and therefore reluctant to disseminate this information to their patients Related matters. The need for a better perception of the personal risk of CRC in first-degree relatives of patients with CRC or advanced adenoma, with the expected coronary adherence to increasing screening, requires a good understanding of risk through Clear, adapted and comprehensible information that can be relayed personally by the case-index. The objective of this project is to develop a personalized prevention and screening program for the JRC in order to meet the needs of the relatives of the sick. The means of intervention that will be implemented respond to the need to better take into account the level of CRC risk in a family-based CRC screening and prevention approach adapted to a high-risk CRC group characterized by Family history at the first stage of CRC or advanced adenoma and, consequently, to improve the information of the subjects concerned by screening and prevention of CRC. The aim of the case-index education is to induce its intervention with its relatives to promote CCR screening. The use of the index case, as a means of providing information to relatives, implies an educational and psychological approach, based on evidence, but adapted and personalized.</brief_summary>
