	<brief_summary>This is a single-center and prospective study to identify specific biomarker in order to predict development of decompensation in cirrhotic patients. The duration of the study is 36 months and it provides a cohort of 200 patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of the Role of Plasma Biomarkers in the Development of Decompensation in Patients With Cirrhosis .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>At screening, patient will have taken blood samples and performed hepatic vein pressure gradient. After randomization, patient will be seen at follow up every 3 months to do blood sample and every 12 months to undergo hepatic vein pressure gradient , according to the guidelines. In addition, metabolomics analysis will be performed at screening and every 3 months. The results will be analyzed in relation to emergence of decompensation during follow up period, in order to identify specific metabolomics characteristics that may be able to predict decompensation.</detailed_description>
