	<brief_summary>Aim: to determine to what extent meal composition influences postprandial sensations independently of palatability. The postprandial responses to a low-fat (240 Kcal) versus a high-fat (275 Kcal) test meal (150 g humus) with the same physical and organoleptic characteristics (taste, smell, colour, texture, consistency, temperature) will be studied on a cross-over design. The responses to the meals will be tested on 2 different days. Participants (12 non-obese healthy men) will be instructed to eat a standard dinner the day before, to consume a standard breakfast at home after overnight fast, and to report to the laboratory, where the test meal will be administered 3 h after breakfast. Studies will be conducted in a quiet, isolated room with participants sitting on a chair. Perception will be measured at 5 min intervals 10 min before and 20 min after ingestion and at 10 min intervals up to 60 min after the probe meal.</brief_summary>
