	<brief_summary>This is a Phase III, double-blind, randomized multicenter study to compare the efficacy and to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of HLX02 and European Union (EU)-sourced Herceptin® in patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive, locally recurrent or previously untreated metastatic breast cancer.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Female ≥18 years of age on day of signing the informed consent form (ICF) Histologically or cytologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the breast Locally recurrent disease not amenable to curative surgery or radiation therapy, or metastatic disease with an indication for a taxanecontaining therapy Availability of formalinfixed paraffinembedded tissue block from the primary tumor, or a metastatic lesion, to confirm HER2positivity by the central laboratory, based on FISH amplification ratio ≥2.0 or IHC score 3+, and for hormone status (ER/PgR) determination (local or central laboratory). If not possible, a fresh biopsy is required No prior systemic chemotherapy, biological or targeted agent for recurrent or metastatic disease. Prior neo/adjuvant hormone therapy must be stopped at least 4 weeks before randomization. Use of herbal remedies or traditional Chinese medicines for anticancer, hematologic or liver function, or antiinfective treatment must be stopped at least 2 weeks before randomization or at time of the ICF signature at the latest Prior neo/adjuvant therapy containing trastuzumab and/or lapatinib (excluding other HER2targeting agents) must have been stopped at least 12 months before the ICF signature. If trastuzumab was not used, prior neo/adjuvant therapy with a taxane must have been stopped at least 6 months before the ICF signature. Prior neo/adjuvant therapy with other cytotoxics and/or hormone therapy must have been stopped at least 4 weeks before the ICF signature Measurable disease (at least one measurable target lesion assessed by CIR; boneonly or central nervous system [CNS]only metastases are not allowed) Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 01 Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) within institutional range of normal at baseline (within 42 days before randomization) as determined by either echocardiography (ECHO) or multigated acquisition (MUGA) scan Adequate hematologic, hepatic and renal function Estimated life expectancy ≥3 months Female patients are eligible to enter and participate in the study if they are of: Nonchildbearing potential Childbearing potential, have a negative serum pregnancy test at Screening (within 7 days of the first investigational product administration), are not breast feeding, and use highlyeffective contraceptive measures before study entry and throughout the study until 6 months after the last investigational product administration. Previously or currentlytreated (systemic chemotherapy, biological, or targeted agent, or any other anticancer agent) recurrent or metastatic breast cancer Known brain metastasis or other CNS metastasis that is either symptomatic or untreated. Central nervous system metastases that have been treated by complete resection and/or radiotherapy demonstrating stability or improvement are not an exclusion criterion provided they are stable as shown by computed tomography (CT) scan for at least 4 weeks before Screening without evidence of cerebral edema and no requirements for corticosteroids or anticonvulsants Underlying medical conditions or current severe, uncontrolled systemic disease that, in the Investigator's opinion, will make the administration of study drug hazardous. A major surgical procedure (defined as a procedure that would require more than 3 weeks without study treatment) within 4 weeks prior to enrolment or anticipation of the need for major surgery during the course of study Current uncontrolled hypertension (systolic &gt;150 mmHg and/or diastolic &gt;100 mmHg) or unstable angina. History of chronic heart failure of any New York Heart Association criteria, or serious cardiac arrhythmia requiring treatment (except atrial fibrillation, paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia). History of myocardial infarction within 6 months of randomization. History of LVEF decline to below 50% during or after prior trastuzumab neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy History of prior exposure to doxorubicin &gt;360 mg/m² (or equivalent) Use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception Known hypersensitivity to any of the study drugs Residual nonhematologic toxicity ≥ Grade 2 from prior therapy.</criteria>
