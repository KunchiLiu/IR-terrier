	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the dose-response of different doses of CHF 5259 pMDI on lung function and other clinical outcomes, to identify the optimal dose(s) in terms of benefit/ risk ratio for further development in the target subject population.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A 6-week Dose Ranging Study of CHF 5259 pMDI in Subjects With Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a phase II, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo and active controlled dose-ranging 6-arm parallel group study to identify the optimal dose of CHF 5259 pMDI with respect to lung function and other clinical efficacy and safety outcomes. After a 2 week run-in period under rescue albuterol and background ICS as needed, patients will be randomized to one of the 6 study treatment groups. Following randomization, subjects will be assessed after 3 weeks and 6 weeks of study treatment at the center. A follow-up phone call will be performed a week after the last visit. During the study, daily symptoms, rescue and background medication use and compliance with the study drug will be recorded via a subject diary. Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) will be assessed and recorded throughout the study. At screening and subsequent visits, subjects will undergo physical and vital signs examinations, spirometry measurements, and 12-lead ECG. Symptoms and COPD health status will be assessed through validated questionnaires. Routine hematology, blood chemistry, and pregnancy testing will be performed before enrollment and at end of study. 24-hour digital recording of ECGs (Holter) will be performed before and after the first dose and just before the last dose of study treatment.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Male or female subjects aged ≥ 40 who have signed an Informed Consent Form prior to initiation of any studyrelated procedure. Subjects with a diagnosis of COPD (according to GOLD 2017 Global Strategy for the Diagnosis, Management and Prevention of COPD Report) at least 12 months before the screening visit. Current smokers or exsmokers who quit smoking at least 6 months prior to screening visit, with a smoking history of at least 10 pack years A postbronchodilator FEV1 ≥50% and &lt;80% of the predicted normal value and, a postbronchodilator FEV1/FVC &lt; 0.7 at screening and a demonstrated reversibility to ipratropium defined as ΔFEV1 ≥ 5% over baseline 3045 minutes after inhaling 4 puffs of ipratropium Subjects under regular COPD therapy for at least 2 months prior to screening with either inhaled LAMA, inhaled ICS/LABA, inhaled ICS + LAMA Symptomatic subjects at screening with a CAT score ≥10. This criterion must be confirmed at randomization Symptomatic subjects with a BDI focal score ≤ 10. This criterion must be confirmed at randomization A cooperative attitude and ability to demonstrate correct use of the inhalers and ediary. Pregnant or lactating women and all women physiologically capable of becoming pregnant UNLESS they are willing to use highly effective birth control methods Diagnosis of asthma or AsthmaCOPD Overlap Syndrome (ACOS) as described in GINA Report 2016, history of allergic rhinitis or atopy (atopy which may raise contraindications or impact the efficacy of the study treatment according to Investigator's judgment) COPD Exacerbations: a moderate or severe COPD exacerbation that has not resolved ≤14 days prior to screening and ≤30 days following the last dose of any oral/systemic corticosteroid or antibiotic (whichever comes last). A Moderate or Severe COPD exacerbation during the runin period Use of antibiotics for a lower respiratory tract infection in the 4 weeks prior to screening or during runin Subjects treated with noncardioselective βblockers in the month preceding screening or during the runin period Subjects treated with longacting antihistamines unless taken at stable regimen at least 2 months prior to screening and to be maintained constant during the study, or if taken as needed Subjects requiring long term (at least 12 hours daily) oxygen therapy for chronic hypoxemia Known respiratory disorders other than COPD which may impact the efficacy of the study treatment according the Investigator's judgment. Subjects who have clinically significant cardiovascular condition Subjects who have a clinically significant abnormal 12lead ECG that results in active medical problem which may impact the safety of the subject according to Investigator's judgement Subjects whose 12lead ECG shows Fridericia corrected QT interval (QTcF) &gt;450 ms for males or QTcF &gt;470 ms for females at screening visit Medical diagnosis of narrowangle glaucoma, clinically relevant prostatic hypertrophy or bladder neck obstruction that in the opinion of the Investigator would prevent use of anticholinergic agents History of hypersensitivity to M3 receptor antagonists, β2adrenergic receptor agonist, corticosteroids or any of the excipients contained in any of the formulations used in the study which may raise contraindications or impact the efficacy of the study treatment according to the Investigator's judgement Clinically significant laboratory abnormalities indicating a significant or unstable concomitant disease which may impact the efficacy or the safety of the study treatment according to Investigator's judgement Subjects with serum potassium levels &lt;3.5 mEq/L (or 3.5 mmol/L) at screening Use of potent cytochrome P450 2D6 and 3A4 inhibitors within 4 weeks prior to screening Unstable or uncontrolled concurrent disease; fever, endocrine disease, gastrointestinal disease; neurological disease; hematological disease; autoimmune disorders, or other which may impact the feasibility of the results of the study according to Investigator's judgment History of alcohol abuse and/or substance/drug abuse within 12 months prior to screening Subjects who have received an investigational drug within 1 month or 5 halflives (whichever is greater) prior to screening visit, or have been previously randomized in this trial, or are currently participating in another clinical trial. Subjects who are mentally or legally incapacitated, or subjects accommodated in an establishment as a result of an official or judicial order. Subjects who have undergone major surgery in the 3 months prior to screening visit or have a planned surgery during the trial.</criteria>
