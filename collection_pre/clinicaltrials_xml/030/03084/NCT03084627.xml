	<brief_summary>Pregnancy is associated with an increase in nutrient requirements. During this period, women would be keener on adopting healthier behaviors. Thus, pregnancy represents an opportunity to improve the nutrient adequacy of the diet of mothers-to-be. This study is a randomized controlled trial, which aims at evaluating the efficiency of a tailored dietary advice tool in improving the nutrient adequacy of the diet of pregnant women, as measured by the PANDiet. Eighty pregnant women will be included in the study and randomized either in the "control" group, or in the "intervention" group. The control group will receive generic dietary advice based on a booklet edited by the French Institute for Health Promotion and Health Education (INPES). The intervention group will receive the same generic dietary advice plus tailored dietary advice to improve the nutrient adequacy of their observed diets. Dietary intakes will be evaluated online using a 3 days food record, at baseline and 6 weeks after patients received the booklet and/or the first tailored dietary advice. Thus, the nutrient adequacy of the diet could be evaluated before and after the intervention in both groups. The dietary follow-up for one patient will last 12 weeks only, but data will be collected at delivery. "Moreover, after, the 12-week dietary follow-up and before their deliveries, 10 participants (5 by group) will be contacted to participate in a qualitative interview. This interview will aim at understanding barriers and motivators to implement dietary advice (generic and/or tailored) in the diet of pregnant women in the study.</brief_summary>
