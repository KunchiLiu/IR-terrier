	<brief_summary>This is an open-label, multi-center, study to determine safety of fixed doses of durvalumab 1500 mg and tremelimumab 75mg combination therapy or durvalumab 1500 mg monotherapy in participants with advanced solid malignancies. The core study (and each tumor specific module) consists of a screening period, a treatment period, a safety follow-up period and a survival follow-up period. The study is planned to determine the short and long term safety including evaluation of nature of toxicities (AEs, adverse events of special interest (AESIs), SAEs, immune-mediated adverse events [imAEs]), interventions / treatment, and outcomes of treatment of these. Please note: initially this study will only recruit patients with urothelial and non-urothelial urinary tract cancer.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Participants must fulfill all of the following inclusion criteria along with other protocol/ module specific inclusion criteria: 1. Age ≥ 18 years at the time of screening. 2. Disease not amendable to curative surgery 3. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status as defined in the specific module. 4. No prior exposure to antiPD1or antiPDL1. 6) Adequate organ and marrow function independent of transfusion for at least 7 days prior to screening and independent of growth factor support for at least 14 days prior to screening. For inclusion in the Module A of the study participants should fulfill the following criteria: 1. Histologically or cytologicaly confirmed locally advanced or metastatic urothelial or nonurothelial carcinoma of the urinary tract (including the urinary bladder, ureter, urethra and renal pelvis) 2. Disease that has progressed during or after at least one previous platinum or nonplatinum based chemotherapy, either for metastatic disease or progressive disease less than 12 months after adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy 3. ECOG performance status 02 Participants will not be included in the study if they meet any of the following along with other protocol/ module specified exclusion criteria: 1. Involvement in the planning and/or conduct of the study. 2. Concurrent enrollment in another clinical study. 3. Any concurrent chemotherapy, investigational agent, biologic, or hormonal therapy for cancer treatment. 4. Local treatment of isolated lesions for palliative intent is acceptable (e.g., local surgery or radiotherapy). 5. Receipt of any investigational anticancer therapy within 28 days or 5 halflives, whichever is shorter, prior to the first dose of study treatment. 6. Radiotherapy treatment to more than 30% of the bone marrow or with a wide field of radiation within 4 weeks of the first dose of study drug. 7. Major surgical procedure (as defined by the Investigator) within 28 days prior to the first dose of IP. 8. History of allogenic organ transplantation. 9. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness. 10. History of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis 11. Has untreated central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis identified either on baseline brain imaging (please refer to RECIST for details on the imaging modality) obtained during the screening period or identified prior to signing the ICF. 12. History of active primary immunodeficiency. 13. Active infection including tuberculosis, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or human immunodeficiency virus (positive HIV ½ antibodies). 14. Current or prior use of immunosuppressive medication within 14 days before the first dose of durvalumab or tremelimumab. 15. Active or prior documented autoimmune or inflammatory disorders (including inflammatory bowel disease [e.g., colitis or Crohn's disease], diverticulitis [with the exception of diverticulosis], systemic lupus erythematosus, Sarcoidosis syndrome, or Wegener syndrome [granulomatosis with polyangiitis, Graves' disease, rheumatoid arthritis, hypophysitis, uveitis, etc]). The following are exceptions to this criterion: Participants with vitiligo or alopecia Participants with hypothyroidism (e.g., following Hashimoto syndrome) stable on hormone replacement Any chronic skin condition that does not require systemic therapy Participants without active disease in the last 5 years may be included but only after consultation with the study physician Participants with celiac disease controlled by diet alone 16. Receipt of live attenuated vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of IP. 17. Known allergy or hypersensitivity to study drug(s) 18. Any unresolved NCI CTCAE Grade ≥2 toxicities from prior anticancer therapy with the exception of vitiligo, alopecia, and the laboratory values defined in the inclusion criteria. 19. Pregnant or breastfeeding women.</criteria>
