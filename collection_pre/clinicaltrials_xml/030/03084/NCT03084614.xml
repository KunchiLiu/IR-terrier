	<brief_summary>Cellular lysates from purified protein derivative-positive donors have been reported to transfer tuberculin reactivity to na(SqrRoot) ve recipients, but not diphtheria reactivity; similarly, cell lysates from diphtheria-reactive donors appear to transfer diphtheria reactivity without impacting responses to tuberculin. A historically controversial topic, the terms transfer factor and dialyzed leukocyte extract were used to characterize the reactivity-transferring properties of lysates. We found that the cellular extract derived from antigen-specific memory CD8+ T cells induces interleukin (IL)-6 from antigen-matched antigen-presenting cells. This ultimately elicits IL-17 from bystander memory CD8+ T cells. We identified that dialyzable peptide sequences, S100a9, and the TCR &lt;= chain from CD8+ T cells contribute to the molecular nature of this activity. We further showed that extracts from antigen-targeted T cells enhance immunity to Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans. The observed anti-Candida activity of lysates was enhanced when the cells were taken from individuals with higher-than-average exposure to Candida and correlated with increased numbers of Candida-reactive T-cells. These effects are sensitive to immunization protocols and extraction methodology in ways that may explain past discrepancies in the reproducibility of passive cellular immunity. Work by other groups has revealed that memory CD8+ T cells are also the only cell population enriched in breast milk as compared to an equal volume of peripheral blood. Taken together, it may be that the CD8+ memory T cells in breast milk serve as a mechanism of passive cellular immunity transference from mother to offspring. We thus aim to expand our analysis into the potential that lysates taken from sources with enriched immunity against a given microorganism will induce greater in vivo and mouse model activity compared to lysates from non-immune sources, and that this difference in lysate activity will be directly related to the CD8+ T cell enrichment. In this study, we will collect blood and/or breast milk samples from donors with known or suspected exposure to pathogens, and also from healthy non-exposed volunteers. Research evaluations of samples will be done for the relevant microbe(s) of interest. The volume of blood taken from lacting mothers will be limited to 20mL or less per visit. Cells may be proliferated, immortalized, lysed and dialyzed, and/or stored. Cellular lysates will subsequently be used in both in vitro and pre-clinical animal models to assess for therapeutic potential.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA: 1. Age 18+ years. 2. Willing to allow storage of blood, breast milk, and cells for future research. 3. Willing to have genetic testing performed. 4. Meets one of the 3 following criteria: 1. Confirmed exposure: Exposure has been verifiably documented (eg, receiving an immunization or DNCB sensitization treatment). OR Clinical history is consistent with established epidemiology of the microbe of interest (eg, documentation of past infection; or to a lesser priority travel to endemic areas or living with an individual that suffers from chronic infection with the targeted microbe). AND Positive results on established clinical immunity tests (eg, viral RNA, antibody titers, etc). 2. Suspected exposure: Clinical history is consistent with established epidemiology of the microbe of interest (eg, travel to endemic areas, documentation of past infection) but no established clinical assay exists to verify exposure. 3. Nonexposed: Absence of exposure to targeted microorganisms as measured by lack of exposure to infected individuals, lack of travel to endemic areas, no immunization history, negative screening tests, or other methods of establishing exposure history to mucosal microbial agents. EXCLUSION CRITERIA: 1. Active use of immunosuppressive medications. 2. Any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, contraindicates participation in this study.</criteria>
