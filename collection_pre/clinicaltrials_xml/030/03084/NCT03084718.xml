	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the dose-response of different doses of CHF 781 pMDI on lung function and other clinical outcomes, to identify the optimal dose(s) in terms of benefit/ risk ratio for further development in the target patient population.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An 8-week Dose Ranging Study of CHF 718 pMDI in Asthmatic Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a phase II, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo and active controlled dose ranging 5-arm parallel group study to identify the optimal dose of CHF 781 pMDI with respect to lung function and other clinical efficacy and safety outcomes. After a 2 week run-in period under rescue albuterol as needed and background inhaled corticosteroid (ICS), patients will be randomized to one of the 5 study treatment groups. After randomization, patients will be assessed after 4 and 8 weeks of study treatment at the center. A follow-up phone call will be performed a week after the last visit. During the study, daily asthma symptoms, peak expiratory flow, rescue and background medication use, and compliance with the study medication will be recorded via subject diary. Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) will be assessed and recorded throughout the study. At screening and subsequent visits, patients will undergo physical and vital signs examinations, spirometry measurements, and 12-lead ECG. Routine hematology, blood chemistry, and pregnancy testing will be performed before enrollment and at end of study. 24-hr urine cortisol and creatinine will be assessed before and after the first dose and just before the last dose of study treatment.</detailed_description>

Inability to carry out pulmonary lung function testing, to comply with study procedures or with study drug intake. Current smokers or exsmokers (tobacco and vapor cigarettes) with a smoking history of &gt;10 packyears or having stopped smoking one year or less prior to screening visit. History of lifethreatening asthma, clinically significant uncontrolled disease or respiratory infection. An asthma exacerbation requiring oral corticosteroids within 3 months or hospitalization within 6 months prior to screening. Subjects with unresolved bacterial or viral respiratory tract, sinus or middle ear infection affecting asthma status within 2 weeks prior to screening. Subjects who received a vaccination within 2 weeks prior to screening or during the runin. Subjects with oral candidiasis at screening or at randomization. Subjects with any clinically significant, uncontrolled condition Subjects who have clinically significant cardiovascular condition Subjects who have a clinically significant abnormal 12lead ECG that results in active medical problem which may impact the safety of the subject according to Investigator's judgement. Subjects whose 12lead ECG shows Fridericia corrected QT interval (QTcF) &gt;450 ms for males or QTcF &gt;470 ms for females at screening and randomization visits. Subjects with known intolerance/hypersensitivity or contraindication to treatment with ß2adrenergic receptor agonists, inhaled corticosteroids or propellant gases/excipients.

Subjects who are mentally or legally incapacitated, or subjects accommodated in an establishment as a result of an official or judicial order. Subjects who have undergone major surgery in the 3 months prior to screening visit or have a planned surgery during the trial.</criteria>
