	<brief_summary>This study is investigating a new experimental therapy, MP0274, a DARPin® drug candidate targeting HER2. Preclinical studies suggest that MP0274 may provide additional benefit for the treatment of HER2-positive cancers. This is the first study of MP0274 in humans and its main purpose is to test its safety and tolerability in patients with HER2-positive cancer. This study will also examine the blood levels of MP0274 at several escalating dose levels and a recommended dose for further development will be determined. The recommended dose will be tested in a second part of the study to confirm safety and to further assess the preliminary biologic and anti-tumor activity</brief_summary>

Have histologically confirmed and documented HER2 positive solid tumor malignancy that is unresectable, locally advanced, or metastatic with progression 4. Have received standard, available therapies approved for their cancer, unless they are unsuitable for these treatments (incurable disease) 5.

Able to communicate well with the Investigator, and to understand and comply with the requirements of the study 1. Hematological malignancies or other second primary malignancy, that is currently clinically significant or requires active intervention 2. Known brain metastases who are clinically unstable despite treatment with anticonvulsives and/or corticosteroids for at least 8 weeks prior to study entry 3. Receipt of any of the following previous antitumor treatments: Cumulative doxorubicin ≥ 360 mg/m2 Cumulative epirubicin ≥ 720 mg/m2 Lapatinib within 7 days of scheduled dosing Day 1 Chemotherapy, trastuzumab, pertuzumab, or trastuzumab emtansine, other biologics, targeted or experimental therapy within 4 weeks of scheduled dosing Day 1 Nitrosoureas or mitomycin C chemotherapy within 6 weeks of scheduled dosing Day 1 Hormonal (e.g. tamoxifen) or aromatase inhibitor therapy within 8 weeks prior to study entry, except if no change in dose or schedule within 8 weeks prior to study entry Newly initiated therapy with bisphosphonate or receptor activator of nuclear kappaB ligand (RANKL)therapy within 8 weeks prior to screening. If stable on dosing schedule for more than 8 weeks prior study entry these therapies are allowed. However, no new therapy with bisphosphonate/RANKL is allowed during the course of the study 4.
