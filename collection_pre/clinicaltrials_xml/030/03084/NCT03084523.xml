	<brief_summary>Cerebrovascular disease is a major source of neural injury and there is an urgent need for comprehensive evaluation of these patients. High-resolution MRI (HR-MRI) allows direct visualization of intracranial vessel wall pathology in the setting of acute ischemic stroke and intracranial aneurysm (intracranial aneurysm rupture.Vessel wall enhancement on HR-MRI results from inflammation and has considerable potential as a marker of future stroke risk or aneurysm rupture. The investigator(s) have successfully developed and employed an intracranial HR-MRI protocol to identify vessel-wall enhancement in over 130 patients during the past year; however, with our finalized protocol there is a current lack of data on HR-MRI interrater reliability, vessel-wall enhancement prevalence in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients, and the local and systemic inflammation underpinning vessel-wall enhancement pathophysiology. The unmet need is a study validating HR-MRI reliability and the association of vessel-wall enhancement with both symptomatic and pro-inflammatory status in patients with cerebrovascular disease.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Intracranial atherosclerosis accounts for 10 to 40%, depending on ethnicity, of the 700,000 ischemic strokes in the United States every year.The annual rate of recurrent stroke in patients with optimally treated Intracranial atherosclerosis remains more than twice the average of other stroke etiologies (12.5% vs. 5%).Intracranial aneurysm ruptured affects up to 30,000 Americans every year and 50% of patients die within a month of intracranial aneurysm rupture.7 A robust literature has established that HR-MRI of extracranial carotid vessel wall enhancement can predict stroke, independent of stenosis. Vessel wall enhancement has been reported in symptomatic Intracranial atherosclerosis and intracranial aneurysm but the role of local and systemic inflammation is unknown. Inflammatory biomarkers are elevated in symptomatic extracranial atherosclerosis and in unstable intracranial aneurysm, but the association with HR-MRI findings in Intracranial atherosclerosis and intracranial aneurysm has not yet been explored.Vessel wall enhancement is typically demonstrated by the uptake of gadolinium MRI contrast into the aneurysm wall or atherosclerotic plaque. A novel MRI contrast agent, ferumoxytol, allows multicontrast weighting on T1w and T2w images and provides important insight into the role of local vessel wall inflammation by accumulating in macrophages on delayed T2* sequences. To identify effective prevention and treatment strategies for cerebrovascular disease, the investigator(s) need to critically evaluate HR-MRI techniques, determine vessel wall enhancement prevalence, and explore the link between vessel wall enhancement and inflammation. The investigator(s) hypothesize that vessel wall enhancement is reliable, associated with symptomatic Intracranial atherosclerosis/intracranial aneurysm and higher levels of inflammatory biomarkers. In order to answer our hypotheses, the investigator(s) propose a pilot study on 40 participants. The investigator(s) will opportunistically enroll participants who receive standard of care HR-MRI with gadolinium contrast or perform a baseline HR-MRI with gadolinium if needed. All participants will have 2 study HR-MRIs (0 and 72 hours) using ferumoxytol contrast. The investigator(s) will analyze two groups of participants (20 with intracranial atherosclerosis and 20 with intracranial aneurysms) with 10 asymptomatic and 10 symptomatic participants in both groups.</detailed_description>
