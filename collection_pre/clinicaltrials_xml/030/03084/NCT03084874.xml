	<brief_summary>Patients with COPD are more inactive and more sedentary than subjects of the same age and patients with other chronic diseases. This inactivity and sedentary behavior is accentuated after hospitalizations due to a COPD exacerbation, and it increases the risk for future hospitalizations and mortality. Therefore, there is a need for intervention to promote physical activity and to reduce sedentary behavior after these events. The present study aims to evaluate the efficacy of a coaching program to promote physical activity and reduce sedentary behavior in patients with COPD who have suffered a hospitalization due to a COPD exacerbation. Sixty-six COPD patients admitted to the hospital will be recruited during 18 months. Physical activity, sedentary behaviors, as well as other clinical and functional parameters will be evaluated after hospital discharge. Patients will be then randomized to an intervention and control group (1:1). The intervention group will receive an individualized coaching program. During a motivational interview an experienced physiotherapist will asses participant's usual exercise habits, possible barriers and facilitators, self-efficacy and motivation to increase physical activity and reduce sedentary time. Based on these data (and baseline physical activity/sedentary information) an individualized, progressive program with specific goals setting and self-monitoring will be established (patients will be active participants and decision makers in this process). The control group will receive the usual care during follow-up. Physical activity, sedentary behaviors, as well as the clinical and functional variables will be evaluated again at 12 weeks in both patients' groups.</brief_summary>
