	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to investigate the clinical outcomes, safety and cost-effectiveness of intravascular OCT imaging in patients with STEMI undergoing primary PCI.The study will enrolled about 4500 STEMI patients(1500 with OCT and 3000 without OCT during primary PCI）in 20 sites of China. The total duration of the study is expected to be 5 years, 2 years for enrolment and 3 years for total follow up.</brief_summary>
