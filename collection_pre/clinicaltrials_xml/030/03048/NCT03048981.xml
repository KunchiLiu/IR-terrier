	<brief_summary>Many patients undergoing surgery use naturopathic drugs, including fish oil. Fish oil has been reported to increase bleeding in patients through inhibiting platelet aggregation and prolonging of clot formation time. The Swedish Medical Products Agency recommends that patients stop taking the naturopathic medicines including fish oil two weeks prior planed surgery. The aim of this study is to examine the effects of fish oil given to healthy volunteers using point of care coagulation assessment and flow dependent Cellix instrument before and after intake of fish oil.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Healthy volunteers will be given maximum dose of fish oil for 7 days. Blood samples will be collected before and immediately after the 7 days of intake and analysed using point of care coagulation assessment instruments and flow dependent platelet aggregation using a microfluid flow controlled system (Cellix). For point of care coagulation assessment the multiple electrode platelet aggregometer Multiplate, the viscoelastic rotational thromboelastometers ROTEM and Sonoclot will be used. Flow cytometry may also be utilized.</detailed_description>
