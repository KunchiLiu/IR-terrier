	<brief_title>Post-market Registry Study on the Physica System Total Knee Replacement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a post-market registry study; the study device is FDA cleared and used according to the intended use. This is a multi-centre, prospective, non-randomized study. Subjects will be implanted with one of the following configurations of the Physica system: Physica KR (Kinematic Retaining), Physica CR (Cruciate Retaining) or Physica PS (Posterior Stabilized). The assignment of any patient involved in the study is determined by the aetiology preoperatively evaluated by the Investigator and falls within current practice. The decision to use a specific prosthesis design is decided by the Investigators independently and clearly separated from the decision to include the patient in the study. Baseline measurements (pre-operative clinical analysis and radiographic analysis at 6-week FU) will serve as internal control term during the assessment of post-surgery data out to 10 years. The primary objectives of this study are to obtain implant survivorship and to evaluate clinical, PROMs and radiographic outcomes for the commercially available Physica system.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Males and females of any race requiring a total knee replacement and suitable for the use of one of the configurations of the Physica system Age&gt; 22 (skeletally mature) Patients who are suffering from noninflammatory degenerative joint disease (NIDJD): including knee osteoarthritis, posttraumatic knee arthritis; or patients who are suffering from inflammatory arthritis; or patients that need correction of a functional deformity Suitable candidates for TKR who have undamaged and functional collateral ligaments Suitable candidates for TKR with Physica KR and CR who have an undamaged and functional posterior cruciate ligament; or suitable candidates for TKR using Physica PS with an absent or notfunctioning posterior cruciate ligament and/or severe anteroposterior instability of the knee joint Patients who understand the conditions of the study and are willing and able to comply with the prescribed rehabilitation and to perform all scheduled followup visits Patients who have signed the Ethics Committee/IRB approved studyspecific Informed Consent Form prior to the surgery Severe obesity, defined as a BMI &gt; 40 Patients with severe instability of the knee joint secondary to the absence of collateral ligament integrity and/or function Patients with active or any suspected infection (on the affected knee or systemic) Previous partial knee replacement (unicompartmental, bicompartmental or patellofemoral joint replacement), patellectomy, high tibial osteotomy Patients with significant bone loss on femoral or tibial joint side Current treatment for malignant and/or lifethreatening nonmalignant disorders Patients with known incompatibility or allergy to the product materials, and/or metal hypersensitivity to implant materials Vascular insufficiency of lower limbs severe enough to interfere with the study evaluation Patients with bone stock compromised by disease, infection or prior implantation that cannot provide adequate support and/or fixation to the prosthesis Patients with systemic or metabolic disorders leading to progressive bone deterioration which may impair fixation and stability of the implant Any concomitant disease and dependence that might affect the performance of the implanted prosthesis Any clinically significant pathology based on clinical history that the Investigator feels may affect the study evaluation (e.g. primary osteoporosis with significant bone loss, haemophilic disease, septicaemia, persistent acute or chronic osteomyelitis) Patients who have significant neurological or musculoskeletal disorders or disease that may adversely affect gait and compromise functional recovery and evaluation Patients who have neuromuscular or neurosensory deficit which would limit the ability to assess the performance of the device Previous history of infection in the affected joint and/or other local/systemic infection that may affect the prosthetic joint Varus/valgus deformities greater than 20 degrees Any psychiatric illness that would prevent comprehension of the details and nature of the study Patients currently participating in any other surgical intervention studies or pain management studies Female patients who are pregnant, nursing, or planning a pregnancy</criteria>
