	<brief_summary>This study is aimed to assess the effects of intravenously administered three fluid types on perfusion index and pulse variability index in patients during preoperative period. Patients will be randomly divided into three groups. Baseline, 5th, 10th, 15th, 20th, 25th and 30th min non-invasive blood pressure, oxygen saturation, heart rate, room temperature, perfusion index and pulse variability index will be measured and recorded.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Intravenous volume replacement alter the dynamics of microcirculation. Perfusion index and pulse variability index are the recent parameters to evaluate the tissue microcirculatory condition. This study is aimed to assess the effects of intravenously administered three fluid types on perfusion index and pulse variability index in patients during preoperative period. Patients will be taken to recovery room in the operating theatre and wait for 15 minutes to balance the skin temperature of the patients to the environment. Patients will be randomly divided into three groups using closed envelope technique as Group L (received 500 ml of Ringer's lactate), Group S (500 ml of saline) and Group H (received 500 ml of 6% hydroxyethylstarch). Baseline, 5th, 10th, 15th, 20th, 25th and 30th min non-invasive blood pressure, oxygen saturation, heart rate, room temperature, perfusion index and pulse variability index will be measured and recorded.</detailed_description>
