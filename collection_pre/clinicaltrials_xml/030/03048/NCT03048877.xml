	<brief_summary>Radioactive iodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer (RAIR-DTC) is a great challenge in the treatment of thyroid cancer. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), like sorafenib and lenvatinib which have been approved by food and drug administration (FDA), could not be affordable for most of the Chinese patients. Apatinib is a highly selective VEGFR2 inhibitor and reduces the angiogenesis of tumor efficiently, which had been proven effective in many solid tumors, is a Chinese domestic TKI targeting vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR). A phase II study aims to assess the efficacy and safety of apatinib in RAIR-DTC was enrolled 20 patients, and 10 of them had obtained a shout-term efficacy,the study demonstrate the peculiar potential in treatment of RAIR-DTC. In this study, the investigators aim to further explore the efficacy and safety of apatinib in RAIR-DTC.</brief_summary>

Pregnancy test (serum) has to be performed for woman of childbearing age within 7 days before enrolment and the test result must be negative. They shall take appropriate methods for contraception during the study until the 8th week post the last administration of study drug. For men, (previous surgical sterilization accepted), shall agree to take appropriate methods of contraception during the study until the 8th week post the last administration of study drug. 9. Patient has to voluntarily join the study and sign the Informed Consent Form for the study. 10. Good compliance is expected, according to the program requirements followup and recorded adverse reactions. 1. Other thyroid cancer histological subtypes (such as medullary carcinoma, lymphoma or sarcoma). 2. Received VEGFR inhibitor (such as vandetanib, cabozantinib, lenvatinib, sunitinib, sorafenib, etc.) treatment within 1 months. 3. Subjects with poorcontrolled arterial hypertension (systolic blood pressure&gt; 140 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure &gt; 90 mm Hg) despite standard medical management; coronary heart disease greater than Class II; IIlevel arrhythmia (including QT interval prolongation, for man ≥ 450 ms, for woman ≥ 470 ms) together with Class II cardiac dysfunction. 4. Factors that could have an effect on oral medication (such as inability to swallow, nausea, vomiting, chronic diarrhea and intestinal obstruction). 5. Subjects with high gastrointestinal bleeding risk, including the following conditions: local active ulcer lesions with positive fecal occult blood test (++); history of black stool, or vomiting blood in the past 3 months. 6.
