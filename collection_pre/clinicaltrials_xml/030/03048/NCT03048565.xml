	<brief_title>A Trial of a Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy Programme for Informal Caregivers of People With Chronic Illnesses</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary aim of the project is to pilot test the delivery of the Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) programme to informal caregivers of people with chronic illnesses in one region in Ireland so as to determine the feasibility of delivering the intervention to caregivers in Ireland. A two-group randomised pilot-feasibility trial comparing the MBCT programme (intervention) with no programme (control). The MBCT programme is delivered in group format over 8 weeks in sessions of 2hours/week. Participants are encouraged to practice mindfulness exercises and homework related to cognitive processes between sessions. The programme will be delivered by a trained mindfulness teacher. The study sample are caregivers in the Dublin region who are members of Family Carers' Ireland. A total of 40 caregivers will be recruited to the study, 20 per group, based on 1:1 randomisation using a computer-randomised number generator. Baseline (pre-intervention) and post intervention participant outcome data (stress, mindfulness and QoL) will be collected using self-reported validated scales administered to participants by post, with stamped-addressed envelopes provided for return. Other pilot measures (i.e. study processes) will be monitored and assessed by the research team to determine potential refinement needs. Feasibility outcome data will be collected by the research team (including time to recruit, attendance at classes, willingness of participants to be randomised) and by the participants (expenses diary) during the study period, using predesigned data collection forms. Mean differences with 95% confidence intervals will be calculated to determine any significant differences between the groups on the outcomes of stress, mindfulness and QoL.</detailed_description>
