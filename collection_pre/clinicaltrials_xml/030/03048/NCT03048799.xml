	<brief_summary>Post-prostatectomy urinary incontinence (IUPP) is a difficult to treat complication that causes a profound negative impact on the individual's quality of life, as well as seriously disrupts the physician-patient relationship and is a substantial public health problem . Urinary incontinence (UI) can occur both in the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and in the treatment of prostate cancer. In the treatment of benign disease, this complication is associated with a very low prevalence, initially of 9% and about 1% in 12 months postoperatively. In radical prostatectomy, the prevalence is higher, varying from 2% to 87%, depending on the populations and sites studied, the definitions used, the different methodologies employed in the evaluation of incontinence, and also the different degrees of intensity of the disease . Several authors have evaluated the incidence of incontinence after robotic radical prostatectomy, open and laparoscopically. With these techniques, the reported total UI incidence varies from 4% to 40% . With the high prevalence of IUPP, accelerating the recovery of urinary control is an important priority for patients and their caregivers, and the search for effective and low-risk treatments is a constant. Thus, the possibility of treatment with the radiofrequency (RF) feature arises.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiofrequency in the Treatment of Urinary Incontinence After Radical Prostatectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A current treatment proposal is the use of radiofrequency, which is a diathermic process generated by the radiation of an electromagnetic spectrum, resulting in an immediate retraction of existing collagen and subsequent activation of fibroblasts causing a neocollagenesis. In studies using radiofrequency to treat SUI, a therapeutic response to 50% was shown. Representing a more cost-effective treatment than surgery.</detailed_description>
