	<brief_summary>The CLEAR SYNERGY trial will study the long term effects of treatments following PCI to treat ST elevation myocardial infarction. These treatments address both the culprit artery (PCI with SYNERGY Stent) as well as the non-culprit arteries (randomization to routine colchicine and spironolactone).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Colchicine and Spironolactone in Patients With STEMI / SYNERGY Stent Registry</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multicenter, international SYNERGY Stent registry that is embedded within a randomized, blinded, double-dummy, 2x2 factorial design trial of colchicine versus placebo and spironolactone versus placebo in patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction who have undergone primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Patients with STEMI referred for PCI within 12 hours of symptom onset, and have culprit lesion amenable to stenting (after the initial 800 patients received SYNERGY stent [SYNERGY Stent phase], patients will be eligible if referred within 24 hours of symptom onset) (All patients participating in the drug portion are required to be randomized within 24 hours of index PCI and during initial hospitalization) 2. Written informed consent 1. Known allergy or contraindication to everolimus, the SYNERGY stent or any of its components 2. Unable to receive dual antiplatelet therapy 3. Age â‰¤18 years 4. Pregnancy, breastfeeding, or women of childbearing potential who are not using an effective method of contraception 5. Any contraindication or known intolerance to colchicine or spironolactone 6. Requirement for colchicine or spironolactone for another indication 7. Creatinine clearance &lt;30 mL/min/1.73 m^2 8. History of cirrhosis or current severe hepatic disease 9. Systolic blood pressure &lt;90 mm Hg 10. Serum Potassium &gt;5.0 meq/L 11. Current or planned use of HIV protease inhibitors, azole antifungals, or macrolide antibiotics 12. Active diarrhea 13. Any medical, geographic, or social factor making study participation impractical or precluding followup</criteria>
