	<brief_summary>This study will characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of QAW039 after a single oral dose of QAW039 in patients with hepatic impairment compared to healthy matched control subjects.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetics of Fevipiprant (QAW039) in Patients With Hepatic Impairment Compared to Matched Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to determine if the pharmacokinetic profile of Fevipiprant is different in patients with hepatic impairment compared to healthy matched volunteers to an extent that would require an adjustment of the dosage. Data from this study will be used to guide enrollment criteria in future clinical trials and to support regulatory submission and labeling information.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>All subjects Weight of at least 50 kg and no more than 120 kg and have a body mass index in the range 18.036.0 kg/m2 Patients with hepatic impairment Moderate hepatic impairment (Group 1): ChildPugh Class B (79 points), Severe hepatic impairment (Group 2): ChildPugh Class C (1015 points Mild hepatic impairment (Group 4): ChildPugh Class A (56 points) Healthy subjects Match in age (±5 years), gender, smoking status, and weight (± 15%) to an individual patient. In good health as determined by past medical history, physical examination, electrocardiogram, laboratory tests and urinalysis at screening. All subjects History of hypersensitivity and/or idiosyncracies to QAW039 or to drugs of similar classes (CRTh2 antagonists). Use of comedications that may impact QAW039 exposure such as broad range UGT inhibitors or strong inhibitors of OAT3, OATP1B3, and Pgp, including but not limited to probenecid, ritonavir, valproic acid, and rifampin Surgical or medical condition which might significantly alter the absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of drugs, or which may jeopardize the subject in case of participation in the study. History of malignancy of any organ system (other than localized basal cell carcinoma of the skin), treated or untreated, within the past 5 years, regardless of whether there is evidence of local recurrence or metastases. Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women. Women of childbearing potential Patients with hepatic impairment Hepatic impairment due to nonliver disease (e.g., right heart failure) Current symptoms or history of encephalopathy Grade III or IV within the past 6 months Primary biliary liver cirrhosis and biliary obstruction Emergency room visit or hospitalization due to liver disease within the preceding 3 months. Severe complications of liver disease within the preceding 3 months. Healthy subjects Liver disease or liver injury as indicated by abnormal liver function tests. Any single parameter of ALT, AST, γGT, alkaline phosphatase or serum bilirubin must not exceed 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) Any elevation above ULN of more than one parameter of ALT, AST, γ GT, alkaline phosphatase or serum bilirubin will exclude a subject from participation in the study A positive Hepatitis B surface antigen or Hepatitis C test result.</criteria>
