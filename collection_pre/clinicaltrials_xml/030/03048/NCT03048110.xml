	<criteria>Healthy subject as determined by the investigator or medically qualified designee based on medical evaluations including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and cardiac monitoring. Gender: Male. Age: 45 to 65 years (inclusive) at the screening visit. Race: White. Body mass index (BMI): ≥18.0 and ≤30 kg/m2.

In addition, participants must agree to utilize a second reliable method of contraception simultaneously. The second method which has to be used by a female partner of childbearing potential can be one of the following methods: diaphragm or cervical cap with spermicide or intrauterine device or hormonebased contraception. Results of alcohol tests are negative at screening and on Study Day 1. Medical and surgical history Existing relevant diseases of vital organs (e.g. liver diseases, heart diseases), central nervous system (for example seizures) or other organs (e.g. diabetes mellitus). Incompletely cured preexisting diseases for which it can be assumed that the absorption, distribution, metabolism, elimination and effects of the study drugs will not be normal. Febrile illness within 1 week before the first study drug administration. A medical history of risk factors for Torsades de Pointes (e.g. family history of Long QT Syndrome) or other arrhythmias. Known severe allergies, nonallergic drug reactions, or (multiple) drug allergies (excluding untreated, asymptomatic seasonal allergies like nonsevere hay fever during the time of study conduct). Known history of hypersensitivity (or known allergic reaction) to itraconazole, rifampicin or ODM201. Relevant hepatic disorders like cholestasis, disturbances of bilirubin metabolism, any progressive liver disease. Relevant renal disorders like recurrent glomerulonephritis, renal injury, and renal insufficiency. However, a history of a single episode of uncomplicated nephrolithiasis will not prevent participation. Subjects with porphyria. Subjects with diagnosed malignancy within the past 5 years except for cured skin basal carcinoma.</criteria>
