	<brief_title>Efficacy of New Protocols in the Treatment of Upper Limb Dysfunctions in Patients With Cerebral Palsy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cerebral palsy (CP) is the most common childhood motor disability. Spasticity and loss of dexterity are the major problems for motor disability of upper extremity (UE) in patients with CP. This study propose two novel treatment protocols: sensory electrical stimulation (SES) and virtual reality constraint-induced therapy (VRCIT) to improve function of UE in patients with CP. Investigators hypothesize that combined SES and VRCIT treatment have better effect than single therapy (SES or VRCIT).</detailed_description>
