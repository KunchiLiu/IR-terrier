	<brief_summary>Treatment strategies of II. degree burn wounds and split-skin grafted III. degree burn wounds aim at reducing infection and improving reepithelialization. The aim of this study is to evaluate time to reepithelialization, pain, microbiology and handling of manuka honey dressings with second-degree burn wounds and split-skin grafted burn wounds.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Manuka Honey in Second- and Grafted Third-degree Burns</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In plastic and reconstructive surgery, treatment strategies of second-degree burn wounds and split-skin grafted third-degree burn wounds aim at reducing infection and improving reepithelialization. Although previous studies indicate that burn patients benefit from wound dressings containing manuka honey, only a few studies can be found. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate time to reepithelialization, pain, microbiology and handling of manuka honey dressings with second-degree burn wounds and split-skin grafted burn wounds.</detailed_description>
