	<brief_summary>Immediate potent inhibition of platelet function is critical for the prevention of periprocedural ischemic event occurrences in high risk N-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Currently, dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and an oral P2Y12 receptor blocker (with loading doses) is widely used for PCI. However, immediate, potent and reversible inhibition of platelet aggregation is not possible even with the newer oral agents, prasugrel and ticagrelor. Therefore, an intravenously administered GPIIb/IIIa receptor inhibitor (tirofiban) or P2Y12 receptor blocker (cangrelor) with fast onset and offset of actions will provide more desired antiplatelet effects in the setting of PCI. This study will measure and compare the anti-platelet effects of Tirofiban and Cangrelor in patients presenting with N-STEMI and undergoing PCI.</brief_summary>
