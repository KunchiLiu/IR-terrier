	<brief_summary>Developed from adapting and combining two evidence-based programs, Project CONNECT (a linkage-to-services program that targets barriers within the probation and substance abuse treatment systems) and TIES (a program that teaches family engagement skills to providers), Family CONNECT is a linkage-to-services program that targets both family and system-level factors to increase youth use of and retention in substance use services. Using Linkage Specialists embedded within probation departments, Family CONNECT will be implemented in two NYS probation departments. This proposed study will evaluate the impact of Family CONNECT on (1) youth referral from probation to substance abuse treatment, (2) youth and family engagement in substance abuse treatment, (3) youth enrollment/retention in substance abuse treatment, and (4) youth substance use and recidivism. This study will also identify family and probation organizational factors influencing Family CONNECT implementation in probation settings. 50 (+2 pre-pilot) caregiver-youth dyads and up to 36 probation officers will be recruited as participants in the study. Caregiver-youth dyads will be evaluated at baseline, 2 and 6 months; probation officers at baseline, 6, 12, and 18 months; linkage specialists at baseline, 6, 12, and 18 months. Counts of youth referred, youth who start treatment, and youth retained in treatment will be obtained from the juvenile justice agency at pre-implementation, baseline, 2 and 6 months, counts of youth recidivism will be obtained at 2 and 6 months.</brief_summary>
