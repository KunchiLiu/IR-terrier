	<brief_summary>VascTrac is a mobile medical application that tracks users' physical activity levels in order to predict endovascular failure of patients with Peripheral Artery Disease.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>VascTrac Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD) Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>VascTrac uses open-source software from Apple's ResearchKit to passively track physical activity levels of users who sign up. The goal is to predict post-intervention endovascular failure before it occurs. Currently, physicians have no way of knowing when procedures such as angioplasties fail; with VascTrac, researchers hope to find downward trends in physical activity that will predict and indicate endovascular failure. All users are assigned numbers and their medical data is securely coded, decreasing the risk of promulgation of personal information.</detailed_description>
