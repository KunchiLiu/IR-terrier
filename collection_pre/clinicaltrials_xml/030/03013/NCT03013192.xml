	<brief_summary>Patients who are prescribed physical therapy exercises for their shoulder will have increased compliance to their PT exercises, an increased PROMIS- Upper Extremity CAT score, and will have increased range of motion (or reach maximum range of motion earlier) at the end of the 3 month EpxPhysicalTherapy intervention.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Three Month Automated Messaging Intervention</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patient compliance to their prescribed physical therapy (PT) exercises is reported to be 22-40% in various studies. Further, Vasey et al. found that about 8% of patients do not even schedule a follow up PT appointment after it is prescribed. Low adherence presents a problem since long term completion of prescribed home exercises has been correlated with improved health outcomes. Sluijs et al. found that low adherence to PT exercises can be primarily attributed to three factors: (1) the barriers patients perceive and encounter, (2) the lack of positive feedback, and (3) the degree of helplessness. An automated phone/texting system can help with these three points by increasing positive feedback, increasing compliance, and monitoring patient progress. The system can continually remind the patient that their end goal is possible, which will decrease their feeling of helplessness in their condition. Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) scores have created a unique measurement that allows for cross study comparison between multiple medical disciplines. PROMIS attempts to measure the physical, mental, and social health of individuals with chronic conditions. PROMIS has been validated as a cross study/discipline tool by multiple studies. PROMIS- Upper Extremity is a subcategory of PROMIS Physical Function and focuses on activities that require the use of the upper extremities including shoulder, arm, and hand activities. Examples include writing, using buttons, or opening containers. Using PROMIS- Upper Extremities as a measure of upper extremity physical function has been validated by DÃ¶ring et al. and Hays et al. While PROMIS- Upper Extremity has not been used to monitor shoulder function after PT intervention in literature, PROMIS scores have been used to monitor ankle, foot, and knee function after rehabilitation. Telemedicine shows promise in improving the outcomes of orthopedic interventions. Medication adherence and patient outcomes have been shown to improve in interventions that include reminders. Also, because the adoption of cell phones is nearly ubiquitous worldwide and the vast majority of cell phone users text message, a text-message-based intervention seems particularly promising. Many studies have shown that SMS text messaging has increased treatment compliance. PT adherence to prescribed exercises seems to be limited by compliance, so Epharmix along with several orthopedic surgeons set out to develop an intervention. The result, EpxPhysicalTherapy (EpxPT), is an automated system that ensures that patients have both scheduled their physical therapy appointment and have performed their home exercises. It also sends motivational text messages to the patient to encourage the participant to perform their exercises since a lack of positive reinforcement has been correlated with decreased compliance. When a patient identifies that they have been unable to schedule a PT appointment or have not completed their exercises for multiple days in a row, an alert is sent to the healthcare team. The system was designed to deliver either voice or text-based automated messages to patients in a way that avoids an additional burden on the healthcare team. EpxPT offers numerous advantages to strictly app-based or text message-based systems in both older and underprivileged patient populations. Older patients, who may be more comfortable with voice messages, have that option, and patients without a smartphone will still be able to receive the intervention. Patients identified to be eligible for this study and have consented will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: Group 1 will receive the standard of care alone (control) and Group 2 will receive the EpxPT intervention. In Group 2, EpxPT will remind the patient to schedule their first PT appointment. Group 2 patients will also be asked if they have completed their prescribed PT exercises every other day. They will then be sent a motivational text messages or voice call in order to highlight the importance of completing their PT regimen. Group 2 patient compliance will be tracked through the text responses recorded in the Epharmix database. Both Group 1 and Group 2 patients will be seen at a follow up appointment once a month for three months. At this appointment, patients in both groups will be asked about their PT compliance (this will be the measurement of compliance for Group 1), and range of motion and a PROMIS- Upper Extremity CAT score will be measured. - Aim 1: To compare control and intervention group compliance to their prescribed physical therapy home exercise regimen - Aim 2: To compare control and intervention group shoulder range of motion after a 3 month intervention - Aim 3: To compare control and intervention group PROMIS- Upper Extremity CAT scores after a 3 month intervention</detailed_description>
