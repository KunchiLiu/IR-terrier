	<brief_summary>A new law about the advance directives (AD) has been recently voted in France on February 2, 2016. This " Claeys-Leonetti " law has made the AD more binding, as in other countries. This should lead to a greater respect of the human autonomy principle. However, the interpretation of these guidelines is often difficult and may differ between doctors. Indeed, the subjectivity of these interpretations could lead to different medical decisions by physicians. The investigators intend to assess the effect of advance directives (AD) on decision making in care by intensivists, using a simulated (hypothetical) situation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessment of Factors Involved in the Decision-making for ICU Patients' Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Observational simulation (hypothetical) study of intensivist decisions for selected real patients. Each patient writes advance directives (AD) after receiving clear information (videos and interview with an independent intensivist). Intensivists answer to 5 questions for two simulations (hypothetical) models (scenario) on pneumonia and occlusive syndrome, in 3 times: without the AD, with AD, and with AD by knowing the drafting conditions (information from intensivist).</detailed_description>
