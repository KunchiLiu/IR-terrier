	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of targeted video interventions designed to increase organ donation knowledge, intentions, and designations among adolescents enrolled in driver's education classes, as well as to increase the commitment of parents/legal guardians to authorize organ donation in the event of their adolescent's death. The central hypothesis is that integrating donation education into the driver's education curriculum will increase knowledge and attitudes that facilitate the behavioral action of donor designation at the time of getting a new driver's license.</brief_summary>
