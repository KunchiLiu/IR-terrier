	<brief_title>A Clinical Research of CAR T Cells Targeting EpCAM Positive Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is being conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells targeting EpCAM in treating patients with EpCAM positive cancer. In the research, the investigators design a novel CAR consists of a EpCAM targeting antibody scFv with two intracellular signaling domains derived from CD3 zeta and CD28. Autologous T cells will be gene-engineered with the CAR gene using a lentivirus vector. Prior to T cell infusion, the patients will be subjected to preconditioning treatment. The infusion dose is (1-10)×106 EpCAM-CAR positive T cells/kg, and the specific cells numbers depends on the situation of individual CAR-T cells preparation. The way of infusion is vascular interventional mediated or endoscopy, and the cells perfusion process would lasts 15min to 30min, and the specific time depends on patent's tumor-burdened state. After T cell infusion, the patients will be evaluated for 24 months for adverse reactions, persistence of CAR T cells and efficacy.</detailed_description>
