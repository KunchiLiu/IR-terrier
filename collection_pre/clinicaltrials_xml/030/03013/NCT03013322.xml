	<brief_summary>Anticholium® per Se is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, monocentric trial to assess whether the CAP can be transferred from bench to bedside. In this pilot study, 20 patients with perioperative sepsis and septic shock as a result of intra-abdominal infection are enrolled. According to randomization, participants are treated with physostigmine salicylate (verum group) or 0.9% sodium chloride (placebo group) for up to 5 days. The mean Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score during treatment and subsequent intensive care of up to 14 days is used as surrogate outcome (primary endpoint). Secondary outcome measures include 30- and 90-day mortality. An embedded pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics study investigates plasma concentrations of physostigmine and its metabolite eseroline. Further analyses will contribute to the understanding of the role of various cytokines in the pathophysiology of human sepsis. A computer-generated list is used for blocked randomization.</brief_summary>
