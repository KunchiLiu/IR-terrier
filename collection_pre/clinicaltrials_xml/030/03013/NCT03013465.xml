	<brief_title>Daily Consumption of Well-Cooked Broccoli May Affect Glucosinolate Metabolites and Inflammatory Biomarkers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Consumption of Brassica vegetables is inversely associated with incidence of several cancers, including cancer of the lung, stomach, liver, colon, rectum, breast, endometrium, and ovaries. Brassica vegetables are a good source of many nutrients, but the unique characteristic of Brassicas (Broccoli in particular) is their rich content of glucosinolates. Glucosinolates are sulfur-containing compounds that are converted to isothiocyanates (ITC) by an enzyme in the plant called myrosinase, which is released when the vesicles containing myrosinase are ruptured by chewing or cutting. The isothiocyanates are considered to be the active agent for cancer prevention. Some of the mechanisms by which isothiocyanates likely inhibit cancer include modulation of cytochrome P450 enzymes, induction of phase II enzymes, and apoptosis. The aim of this study is to investigate how daily consumption of broccoli with myrosinase inactivated by cooking influences glucosinolate metabolism and absorption, and consequent regulation of inflammatory markers.</detailed_description>
