	<brief_summary>The primary objective of the trial is to determine the effect of a 24-week concomitant coaching on patient reported outcomes of patients receiving standard treatment for mRCC with sunitinib.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Role of PRoactivE Coaching on PAtient REported Outcome in Advanced or Metastatic RCC Treated With Sunitinib</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal of our study is to define the benefit of proactive coaching in mRCC, when compared to a reactive approach, which is considered the standard of care. Patients in the Coaching Arm A will be trained continuously at personal interactions of coach and patient (Face-to Face meetings as well as telephone contacts). The patient is educated on nature and severity of treatment emergent Adverse events (TEAE) of the Sunitinib-Therapy. Quality of Life (QoL) is assessed during sunitinib treatment in both arms (Arm A Coaching and Arm B non Coaching).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Written informed consent and any locallyrequired authorization (EU Data Privacy Directive in the EU) obtained from the subject prior to performing any protocolrelated procedures, including screening evaluations 2. Age ≥ 18 years at time of study entry 3. Advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma, not amendable to surgery with curative intent, rendering the patient eligible for Tyrosin Kinase Inhibitor (TKI) treatment with sunitinib 4. Intended firstline treatment with sunitinib 5. Documented progressive disease within 6 months prior to study inclusion 6. Patients with measurable disease (at least one unidimensionally measurable target lesion by CTscan or MRI) according to modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1) as well as nonmeasurable disease are eligible. 7. Prior radiotherapy and surgery are allowed if completed 4 weeks (for minor surgery and palliative radiotherapy for bone pain: 2 weeks) prior to start of treatment and patient recovered from toxic effects. 8. Female subjects must either be of nonreproductive potential (ie, postmenopausal by history: ≥60 years old and no menses for ≥1 year without an alternative medical cause; OR history of hysterectomy, OR history of bilateral tubal ligation, OR history of bilateral oophorectomy) or must have a negative serum pregnancy test upon study entry. 9. Subject is willing to receive additional concomitant coaching and able to comply with the QoL/PRO (patientreported outcome) assessments specified in the protocol for the duration of the study including scheduled visits, examinations and follow up. 1. Any other anticancer treatment aside of sunitinib for mRCC (except palliative radiotherapy) 2. Previous malignancy (other than mRCC) which either progresses or requires active treatment. Exceptions are: basal cell cancer of the skin, preinvasive cancer of the cervix, T1a or T1b prostate carcinoma, or superficial bladder tumor [Ta, Tis and T1]. 3. CNS metastases, unless local therapy has been completed for at least 3 month and patient does not require the use of steroids. 4. Chronic liver disease with ChildPugh B or C score 5. Female subjects who are pregnant, breastfeeding or male or female patients of reproductive potential who are not employing an effective method of birth control (failure rate of less than 1% per year) 6. Any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would interfere with evaluation of the concomitant coaching or QoL assessments or interpretation of patient safety or study results 7. Participation in another clinical study with an investigational product during the last 30 days before inclusion 8. Any previous treatment with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor for metastatic disease. Adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy for localized disease is permitted, provided that relapse occurred at least 6 months after last exposure 9. Previous enrollment or randomization in the present study (does not include screening failure). 10. Involvement in the planning and/or conduct of the study (applies to both Pfizer staff and/or staff of sponsor and study site) 11. Patient who might be affiliated or otherwise dependent on the sponsor, site or the investigator 12. Patient who has been incarcerated or involuntarily institutionalized by court order or by the authorities [§ 40 Abs. 1 S. 3 Nr. 4 AMG]. 13. Patients who are unable to consent because they do not understand the nature, significance and implications of the clinical trial and therefore cannot form a rational intention in the light of the facts [§ 40 Abs. 1 S. 3 Nr. 3a AMG].</criteria>
