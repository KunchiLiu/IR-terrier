	<brief_summary>This randomized controlled trial will use a longitudinal repeated-measures design to examine the effects of two interventions, behavioral support interventions and a parent-infant transactional program, on parents' stress, PPD and sleep quality, parent-infant interactions, and their preterm infants' stress (saliva cortisol levels), sleep patterns, emotional regulation, and neurobehavioral developmental outcomes from 7 days to 2 years corrected age.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The proposed study has five specific aims: 1. to develop behavioral-support interventions for preterm infants who receive painful, stressful procedures in the NICU, 2. to develop a parent-infant transactional program (PITP) for parent-infant dyads with preterm infants in the NICU, 3. to determine the short-term effects of the behavioral-support interventions and PITP on infant stress (salivary cortisol levels) and sleep patterns, 4. to determine the short-term effects of the PITP on parental stress, depression, social support, and sleep quality during postpartum, and 5. to determine the long-term effects of the behavioral-support interventions and PITP on parent-infant interactions and infants' long-term emotional regulation and neurobehavioral outcomes.</detailed_description>
