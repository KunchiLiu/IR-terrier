	<brief_title>Delinieation of GIP's Effects During a Meal in Humans Using GIP Receptor Antagoniasation (GA-4)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aim: To evaluate the role of GIPR signalling in postprandial physiology, including lipid, bone and glucose homeostasis, using a naturally occurring GIP fragment, which antagonises the GIPR. Twelve healthy men (age 18-70 years, BMI 19-27 kg/m2) with normal kidney and liver parameters and haemoglobin levels and no first-degree relatives with type 2 diabetes will be included in a randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled cross-over study. Study consists of four study days with concomitant infusions of A) GIP-A, B) GLP-1 receptor antagonist Exendin[9-39], C) GIP-A + Exendin[9-39], or D) saline (placebo).</detailed_description>
