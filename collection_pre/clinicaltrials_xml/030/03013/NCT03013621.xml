	<brief_summary>Acute renal failure (ARF) is a frequent complication in the postoperative cardiac surgery, and is a major risk factor for mortality in this context. The right ventricular dysfunction post cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is also a common complication, close to 100% if one takes into account the transient dysfunction. A recent study showed that right ventricular dysfunction and the IRA seemed related, rather on the slope of venous congestion. We wish to study this phenomenon more specifically in particular to offer reliable diagnostic markers of venous congestion.</brief_summary>
