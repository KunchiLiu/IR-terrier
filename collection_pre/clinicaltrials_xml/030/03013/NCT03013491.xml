	<brief_summary>The purpose of this first-in-human study of CX-072 is to characterize the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD) and antitumor activity of CX-072 administered intravenously (IV) as a single agent or in combination with ipilimumab or vemurafenib in adult subjects with advanced or recurrent solid tumors or lymphomas. PROCLAIM-001: PRObody CLinical Assessment In Man CX-072 clinical trial 001 CX-072 is a Probodyâ„¢ therapeutic directed against PD-L1 (programmed cell death ligand 1). Probody therapeutics are proteolytically-activatable antibodies (Abs) designed to widen the therapeutic index by minimizing drug interaction with normal tissue while retaining anti-tumor activity. Probody therapeutics are "masked" to attenuate binding to target in healthy tissue but can become "unmasked" in the tumor microenvironment by tumor-specific protease activity. PROBODY is a trademark of CytomX Therapeutics, Inc.</brief_summary>
