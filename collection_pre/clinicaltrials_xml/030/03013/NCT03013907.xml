	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to adapt and then evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy of a telephone-based intervention (UPLIFT: Using Practice and Learning to Increase Favorable Thoughts) for individuals with elevated depressive symptoms and hypertension. UPLIFT is a group-based intervention that is delivered over 8 weekly sessions for 1 hour/week by phone. Aim 1 of this study is to adapt UPLIFT using qualitative focus groups and individual interviews and to test the adapted UPLIFT program in a single-arm design. Aim 2 of this study is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) that will compare the effects of the adapted UPLIFT program to usual care (UC) and to test mediators and moderators of the effects of UPLIFT.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Once 16 participants are enrolled (to form 2 groups of 8 patients each), an independent study staff member will determine participants' group assignments. The randomization sequence will be created a priori by Dr. Keith Goldfeld (biostatistician) by using a computer-generated list of random numbers with stratification by antidepressant medication use and baseline levels of depressive symptoms (PHQ scores &lt;10 and ≥10). UPLIFT: Eligible participants will complete 8 weekly group sessions by phone. The intervention builds cognitive-behavioral and mindfulness skills to help reduce depressive symptoms. Each hour-long weekly session consists of: check-in, instruction, skill building, discussion, and a home-based practice assignment. Usual care: Subjects randomized to UC will be advised to seek help from their primary care physician (PCP) or other sources as they normally would if they encountered symptomatic deterioration or other difficulties over the course of the study. All treatments received over the course of the study for the UC group and outside of the study (for the intervention group) will be assessed at each time point.</detailed_description>
