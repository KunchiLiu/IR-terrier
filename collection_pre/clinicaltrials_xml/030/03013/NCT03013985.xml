	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to find out if treatment with Glargine U300 when compared to Glargine U100 will result in similar sugar control in patients with Type 2 Diabetes (T2D), who are admitted to the hospital and then transition at home, after discharge from the hospital.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Glargine U300 Hospital Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Several randomized clinical trials done previously in medicine and surgical patients with T2D have shown that basal bolus regimen with glargine results in a lower mean daily blood glucose (BG) concentrations compared to the sole use of sliding scale regular insulin (SSI) and in lower rate of hospital complications. Glargine U300 results in similar improvement but in lower rate of hypoglycemia than treatment with glargine U100. No previous studies; however, have compared the efficacy and safety of glargine U300 in the management of hyperglycemia and diabetes in the hospital setting. This study will determine if treatment with glargine U300 has a similar glucose control in patients with diabetes admitted to the hospital and if glargine U300 will result in lower number of low blood sugars compared to glargine U100 .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Males or females between &gt; 18 years admitted to a general medicine or surgical service. Known histories of T2D treated with either diet alone, oral monotherapy, any combination of oral antidiabetic agents, shortacting GLP1RA (exenatide, liraglutide) or insulin therapy with the exception of degludec and glargine U300. Subjects must have an admission/randomization BG &gt; 140 mg and &lt; 400 mg/dL without laboratory evidence of diabetic ketoacidosis (bicarbonate &lt; 18 mEq/L, pH &lt; 7.30, or positive serum or urinary ketones). Subjects with increased BG concentration, but without a known history of diabetes. Subjects with a history of diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state, or ketonuria (40). Patients treated with degludec or glargine U300, or with longacting weekly GLP1RA (weekly exenatide, dulaglutide or albiglutide). Patients with acute critical or surgical illness admitted to the ICU or expected to require admission to the ICU. Patients with clinically relevant hepatic disease (diagnosed liver cirrhosis and portal hypertension), corticosteroid therapy, or impaired renal function (eGFR&lt; 30 ml/min). Mental condition rendering the subject unable to understand the nature, scope, and possible consequences of the study. Female subjects who are pregnant or breast feeding at time of enrollment into the study.</criteria>
