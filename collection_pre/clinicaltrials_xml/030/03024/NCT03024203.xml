	<brief_summary>Cognitive remediation (CR) is the best treatment to improve neurocognitive abilities for individuals with psychosis, however, there is no gold standard method of cognitive remediation available. Cognitive training refers to the training component of CR in which people practice computerized exercises that train specific cognitive abilities. There is no agreed upon approach within the field as to the type of training that is most effective with some studies, training higher level cognitive abilities, some training perceptual abilities, and others training general cognitive skills. This study will directly compare two competing methods of cognitive training on measures of neurophysiology, neurocognition, functional competence, and real-world functional performance.</brief_summary>
