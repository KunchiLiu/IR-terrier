	<brief_summary>The mechanism of Upper airway obstruction (UAO) during anesthesia shares many similarities with the upper airway obstruction observed during obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) via nasal mask (NM) can maintain the airway patent with near 100% success in patients with OSA. Obesity is a major risk factors for obstructive sleep apnea and obese patients have a higher prevalence of UAO during anesthesia. The investigators hypotheses that nCPAP should eliminate airway obstruction in obese patients under anesthesia. The investigators propose to test this hypothesis and determine the efficacy of nCPAP on maintaining airway patency in obese patients who require general anesthesia compared with CPAP administering face mask.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nasal Continuous Positive Airway Pressure and Airway Patency in Obese Patient</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Upper airway obstruction (UAO) is an unpredictable and frequently occurring complication during induction of general anesthesia. Since obese patients are more vulnerable to develop airway obstruction either during sleep1 or under anesthesia, and the segment of obese individuals in the entire population keep growing, difficult airway management under anesthesia becomes even more challenging than ever. The most serious event related to difficult airway management under anesthesia is "cannot intubate, cannot ventilate". The mechanism of UAO during anesthesia has not been well understood. Obese patients are a high-risk group for perioperative airway catastrophe and prone to develop progressively narrower pharyngeal airways due to an increase of soft tissue volume surrounding the pharyngeal airway. The mechanism of UAO during anesthesia shares many similarities with the upper airway obstruction observed during obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) via nasal mask (NM) can maintain the airway patent with near 100% success in patients with OSA. Obesity is a major risk factors for obstructive sleep apnea and obese patients have a higher prevalence of UAO during anesthesia. Therefore, the investigators hypotheses that nCPAP should eliminate airway obstruction in obese patients under anesthesia. The investigators propose to test this hypothesis and determine the efficacy of nCPAP on maintaining airway patency in obese patients who require general anesthesia.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Body Mass Index:30 to 50 kg/ m2, Age: 1865 years old ASA physical status classification: IIII Requiring general anesthesia for elective surgery 1. Patients with major cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, cerebral vascular disease or American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status class IV or greater. 2. Abnormal vital signs on the day of admission for surgery [heart rate (HR, &gt;100 bpm or &lt;40 bpm), blood pressure (BP, &gt;180/100 mmHg or &lt;90/60 mmHg), room air transcutaneous oxyhemoglobin saturation (SPO2) &lt;96%] that are not correctable with his or her routine medication or commonly used preoperative medication. 3. Having claustrophobia and not able to tolerate the mask. 4. Any person with an anticipated difficult airway or those with a history of difficult airway. This will include subjects who require or may require either a fiberoptic intubation or intubation while awake. 5. Gastricesophageal reflex disease that is refractory to treatment or a full stomach. 6. The subject has been in bed for more than 24 hours. 7. Neurological symptoms associated with neck extension, a neurological deficit from a previous stroke or spinal cord injury, a recent stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) within 2 weeks. 8. Pregnant women and women less than one month postpartum. Ruling out pregnancy will be conducted by careful history and physical examination as performed routinely prior to surgery. If the history is believed to be unreliable, the patient will be excluded unless a pregnancy test is performed and the result of the test is negative. 9. Emergency cases and subjects who have not adhered to the ASA NPO (Nil Per Os) guidelines.</criteria>
