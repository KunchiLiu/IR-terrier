	<brief_summary>The purpose of this clinical study is to evaluate the safety and the efficacy of BonoFill-II as an autologous bone-regenerating graft in the reconstruction of deficient bone in two clinical indications: 1. Long bone extra-articular comminuted fracture 2. Large bone defect or gap incapable of self-regeneration</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Enhancement of Bone Regeneration and Healing in the Extremities by the Use of Autologous BonoFill-II</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Endpoint: To establish that the transplantation of BonoFill-II into bone defect/gap is safe under the following conditions: - No treatment-related appearance of heterotrophic bone ossification - No excessive bone formation at the transplantation sites - No abnormalities in the treated sites Secondary Endpoint: To establish that the transplantation of BonoFill-II into bone defect/gap is effective under the following conditions: 1. Long bone extraarticular comminuted fracture: - Enhancement of fracture healing is considerably faster than the common time period known for these clinical conditions in at least two thirds of the treated subjects. 2. Large bone defect or gap incapable of self-regeneration: - A newly formed bone tissue is generated within the bone gap which re-establishes bone continuity in at least two thirds of the treated subjects.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Long bone extraarticular comminuted fracture: Subject with fracture requiring temporary fixation (to be carried out prior to enrollment in the study) followed by definitive treatment (to be carried out in the framework of the study). This could be the outcome of various reasons, such as an open fracture, and/or a multisystem injury where definitive treatment could not have been performed upon admission. Large bone defect or gap incapable of selfregeneration Subject who suffer from a large bone defect or gap incapable of selfregeneration Intraarticular fractures Age is under 18 or above 75 A simple fracture manageable by one definitive treatment Pregnant or lactating women Patients with active infection anywhere in the body except in the injured bone site that is in question and needs osteogenic treatment. Subjects with recorded medical history diseases such as heart diseases, renal failure. Subject treated currently with systemic steroids. Subjects with known autoimmune diseases, such as Addison's disease, Celiac disease sprue (glutensensitive enteropathy), Dermatomyositis, Graves disease, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, Multiple sclerosis, Myasthenia gravis, Pernicious anemia, Reactive arthritis, Rheumatoid arthritis, Sjogren syndrome, Systemic lupus erythematosus. Subjects diagnosed with osteoporosis Subjects that have a known scar healing problem (keloid formation). Subjects treated with Bisphosphonate drugs Oncology patients in treatment Subjects who received chemotherapy or radiotherapy treatment in the past Subjects participating in another clinical trial 30 days prior to and during the study period. Subjects with a known history of any significant medical disorder, which in the investigator's judgment contraindicates the subject's participation. Subjects with any known allergy for local/general anesthesia. Positive serology for either HIV, hepatitis B or hepatitis C. Abnormal clinically significant laboratory test and findings, as per the investigator's judgment.</criteria>
