	<brief_summary>The Investigators goal was to study the effect of high flow nasal cannula oxygen (HFNC) on the rate of post-operative pulmonary complications in thoracic surgical patients. The Investigators hypothesis is that prophylactic HFNC oxygen, as compared to standard oxygen treatment, will reduce the incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications, improve post-operative pulmonary function, and reduce ICU and hospital length of stay.</brief_summary>
