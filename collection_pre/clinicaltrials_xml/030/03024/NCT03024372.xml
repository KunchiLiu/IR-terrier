	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate a promising strategy to improve maturation and patency rates following creation of AV fistulas and assess whether an anastomosis performed with Anastoclips (interrupted, nonpenetrating) would produce better maturation and/or patency than one performed with conventional suturing techniques.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Continuous Suturing Versus Interrupted Clips for Brachiocephalic AV Fistula Creation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This will be a single blind (patient and dialysis center), prospective, randomized trial conducted at a single center. The study intervention will be randomization between conventional sutured anastomosis (Control group) and use of Anastoclips (Treatment group), which provide an interrupted closure without intimal penetration.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Requiring brachiocephalic fistula judged to be best option for access after vein mapping (Surgeons will be required to do 10 cases using Anastoclips prior to enrolling) Able to provide informed consent in English or Spanish Age 18 years or greater With estimated life expectancy of 2 years or more Able to comply with study procedures including all scheduled followup visits Unable to provide informed consent in English or Spanish Age &lt; 18 years With pacemaker, IACD, or other permanent obstructive device on that side (a temporary tunneled dialysis catheter is not an exclusion) Unable (or in surgeon's judgment a poor risk) to comply with study procedures and followup visits With estimated life expectancy of less than 2 years Females must be either: Of nonchildbearing potential, which is defined as postmenopausal (at least 12 months without menses prior to Treatment Day) or documented surgically sterile or post hysterectomy (at least 1 month prior to Treatment Day) Or, of childbearing potential, in which case must have a negative urine pregnancy test at Treatment Day</criteria>
