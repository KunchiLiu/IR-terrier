	<brief_summary>The quality of the renal transplant prior to transplantation is essential for the recovery of graft function in the days following transplantation and its long-term survival. When the kidneys are perfused on perfusion machines before transplantation, the resistance parameters as well as the histological score on the pre-implantation biopsy participate in the evaluation of the quality of the graft. The metabolomic profile of the infusion fluid could provide additional evidence.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Donors aged 18 years or more in brain death or who died of cardiac arrest collected locally in Tours, associated with the major local recipients of the grafts over the same period.
