	<brief_title>Stroke Registration of Young Adults in China</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 15% of all ischemic strokes (IS) occur in young adults and adolescents. Youth IS refers to the young ischemic stroke patients, aged 18 to 45 years old, about 5%-10% in all cases of cerebral apoplexy. Youth IS is different from old age IS for risk factors, secondary prevention standards compliance and prognosis. So it is meaningful to learn and study the youth IS risk factor,the secondary prevention and its relationship with prognosis.</detailed_description>
