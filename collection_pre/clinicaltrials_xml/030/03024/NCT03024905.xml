	<detailed_description>In order to reduce the number of women dying in childbirth and to improve women's health in pregnancy, this trial is designed to assess if several interventions combined can increase the number of women delivering in health care facilities. The design of the study is "Multiple Baseline Design". Community health workers are trained to collect baseline data on women using mobile phones in one rural district in Tanzania. The district has four distinct divisions. After 6 months of baseline data in the district, one division will experience the interventions. The interventions are education about the importance of attending antenatal care visits with nurses and facility deliveries, a voucher for transport to access the health facility at the time of delivery, and birthing supplies to be used either at the health facility, or on route if the women does not make it to the health facility. The intervention will be begun in each of the other divisions in 3 month intervals (i.e. the second division starts to experience the interventions 3 months after the first, the third, 3 months after the second and the fourth 3 months after the third). The trial will continue for a total of 27 months including the baseline period.</detailed_description>
