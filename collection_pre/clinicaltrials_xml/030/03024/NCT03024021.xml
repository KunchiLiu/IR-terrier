	<brief_title>Cerebral Oxymetry and Neurological Outcome in Therapeutic Hypothermia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Our study is planned as a prospective observational study. Patients undergoing therapeutic hypothermia in our intensive care unit after cardiac arrest will be enrolled. Each patient's cerebral oxygenation will be monitored with near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) in every 6 hours during our 24 hour lasting hypothermia period. Afterwards, patients will be monitorised in every 6 hours during the first day of hypothermia and than the mean values of daily cerebral oxygen values will be noted in the third, fourth and fifth days of nomothermia. Regional oxygen saturation (rSO2) will be noted from left and right probes. Full Outline of Unresponsiveness (FOUR) Score, Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) and cerebral performance category scale (CPC) will be noted at the beginning of therapeutic hypothermia and each day during normothermia, day 21 and the day of discharge from ICU.</detailed_description>
