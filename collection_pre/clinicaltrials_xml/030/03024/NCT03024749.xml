	<brief_summary>Spinal arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) and arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are complex neurosurgical lesions that are very challenging to manage. Spinal vascular malformations account for 3%-4% of all intradural spinal cord mass lesions. Over the last few decades our understanding of these lesions has dramatically increased thanks to neuroimaging technology (e.g. spinal angiography and indocyanine green angiography). Various treatment modalities including conservative observation, endovascular embolization, microsurgical resection, radiation therapy, and combined therapies have been reported. The treatment for these AVMs and AVFs depends on their location, the type of malformation, the area of the spine involved, and the condition of the patient at the time of treatment. Due to the rarity of these spinal vascular lesions, reports of their management and outcomes have been limited to small series and case reports. And the rates of obliteration and outcomes are not satisfactory, especially the spinal AVMs. Spinal vascular lesions are rare but represent a formidable challenge for the treating neurosurgeon.The purpose of this study is to establish multimodality treatment mode and evaluate the anatomical cure rate and functional preservation rate.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Multimodality Treatment of the Spinal Arteriovenous Malformations and Fistulas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multicenter, prospective, observational, registration study. There are nine centers involved in the study. The investigators set up a more detailed classification system for spinal vascular malformations. In accordance with inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria, this cohort study will include 380 samples in the study period of three years. According to the spinal angiography, the correct diagnosis and treatment strategy will be made. The minimally invasive surgical treatment methods and new techniques will be adopted such as spinal superselective angiography, preoperative embolization, intraoperative electrophysiological monitoring, intraoperative angiography, etc. All the enrolled patients will be visited a total of four times, postoperative day 1 and postoperative day 7, followed up postoperative 3 months and 12 months. The anatomical cure rate and spinal cord function will be assessed objectively. All data will be recorded in the network database platform.</detailed_description>
