	<brief_summary>This is an observational study in 3 cohorts of monochorionic diamniotic (MCDA) twins. The aim of the study is to assess whether unequal placental sharing can be predicted in pregnancy and whether it is predictive of pregnancy outcome.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Unequal Placental Sharing in Monochorionic Diamniotic Twins: an Observational Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In all cohorts, serial ultrasound will be performed during pregnancy. MRI will be offered once during pregnancy. After delivery, placental examination will be performed. In unselected MCDA twins, the investigators will assess the relationship between unequal placental sharing and the risk of fetal or neonatal loss. The investigators will also establish whether umbilical vein measurements or MRI can be used to predict placental sharing. In cases complicated by twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS), the investigators will look at the association between unequal placental sharing and intrauterine fetal demise after laser surgery. In cases complicated by selective intra-uterine growth restriction (sIUGR), the the relationship between unequal placental sharing and the risk of fetal or neonatal loss and birth prior to 34 weeks will be assessed. Furthermore, data on neurological outcome at 2 years of age in all cohorts will be collected.</detailed_description>
