	<brief_summary>BOSS-Trial I is a phase 2 clinical trial with the following objectives; 1. to prove the feasibility of a Bluetooth-equipped sphygmomanometer system in real-world clinical practice and wireless connection to the main server; 2. to prove the feasibility of the BP management strategy, including the pre-specified BP range, BP management algorithm, and behavioral; and 3. to gather information for the phase 3 trial including BP variability indices and their potentials as a treatment guidance.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Optimization of Blood Pressure Management After Acute Ischemic Stroke and Its Prognostic Significance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Elevated blood pressure is an established risk factor for recurrent stroke and vascular events in ischemic stroke survivors, but - Current guideline (JNC VIII) has omitted or only partially covered a number of practical and important issues as follow; - When and how we measure blood pressure? - Is it justifiable to apply the same blood pressure threshold for office BP and home BP? - Should stroke survivors be treated by the same BP goal for non-stroke subjects? - Is it justifiable to apply the universal BP threshold for different mechanisms of ischemic stroke? - Is it really about only blood pressure or might it really be "beyond blood pressure?" - Lifestyle modification should accompany all the pharmacological intervention but is usually in adequate to initiate behavioral changes. - Frequent BP measurement at home will provide more detailed and reliable information than occasional office BP's.</detailed_description>
