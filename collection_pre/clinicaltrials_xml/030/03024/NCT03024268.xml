	<brief_title>MitraClipÂ® and Hemodynamic Effects of Relevant Iatrogenic Atrial Septum Defect Closure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Transcatheter mitral valve repair with the MitraClip system is a therapeutic alternative to surgery in selected high-risk patients. Clip placement requires interatrial transseptal puncture and meticulous manipulation of the steerable sheath. There is evidence that the persistence of a relevant iASD after MitraClip is associated with worse clinical outcomes and increased mortality. The purpose of this study is to investigate, if the interventional closure of an persistant hemodynamic relevant iASD 30 days after MitraClip implantation, has favorable effects on clinical outcome. Eligible patients, after obtaining written informed consent, are 1:1 randomized either in group A (interventional occlusion of iASD) or group B (best supportive care).</detailed_description>
