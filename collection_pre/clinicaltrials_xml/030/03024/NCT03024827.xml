	<brief_title>Cannabidiol in Children With Refractory Epileptic Encephalopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Epileptic Encephalopathies are a group of epilepsies that develop in children. These epilepsies can cause frequent and difficult to control seizures. Because of the ongoing seizures, these epilepsies can also cause cognitive impairment and neurological impairment. In many children with these Epileptic Encephalopathies, seizures are difficult to control with medical treatment, such as anti-convulsants or non-drug treatments like the ketogenic diet (a high fat, adequate-protein, low-carbohydrate diet). This has resulted in a need to find therapies that are effective and better tolerated for children with epileptic encephalopathies. There is very limited data regarding the use of cannabis products in children, in particular cannabidiol-enriched cannabis oil in children with epilepsy. However, hemp oil products with high cannabidiol and low tetrahydrocannabinol ratios have been reported to provide seizure relief and cognitive improvement in children who take them.</detailed_description>
