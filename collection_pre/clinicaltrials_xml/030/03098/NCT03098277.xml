	<brief_summary>This clinical trial studies movement tracking devices in optimizing and monitoring physical activity in patients with solid tumors undergoing chemotherapy in a health care facility during the day without spending the night. Movement tracking devices, such as Microsoft Kinect 2 and Microsoft Band 2, may help doctors learn about the health of cancer patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Movement Tracking Devices to Monitor Physical Activity in Patients Undergoing Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the feasibility of monitoring cancer patients using wrist-worn activity monitors and movement trackers. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the association between activity and patient reported fatigue. II. To evaluate the association between movement and incidents of health care interventions (hospitalizations, physical visits, intravenous hydration, etc.) TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To compare physician and patient assessed Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) and Karnofsky performance status scores with the data obtained from movement trackers. OUTLINE: Patients perform 2 physical activities in an exam room that are recorded using a Microsoft Kinect 2 stationary movement tracking device on days 1 and 21. The first activity is rising from a chair, walking 10 feet, and returning to the chair. The second activity is moving from the chair to the step-up examination table. Patients also wear a movement tracking wristband, Microsoft Band 2, around their wrist, complete a smartphone application based patient reported outcome (PRO) questionnaire, and weigh themselves daily for 60 days. After completion of study, patients are followed up at 90 days.</detailed_description>
