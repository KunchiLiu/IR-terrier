	<brief_summary>This study focuses on the integration of HIV and NCD screening and care. The investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial examining the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of the intervention strategy in Kisarawe District, Tanzania, a rural area 40 KM southwest of Dar es Salaam. The study will match two similar HIV care and treatment centers (CTC) in the District, one of which will be randomized to receive the enhanced intervention which will integrate diabetes (DM) and hypertension (HTN) screening with the existing HIV testing program, and integrate care for DM and HTN into the HIV care program. Comparisons of the community HIV testing rates in the two communities, engagement in HIV care among those testing positive, and 24-month retention in HIV care will be assessed among a cohort of 89 newly enrolled patients per community. Specifically, the aims are to determine: 1. Whether integrating DM and HTN screening with HIV testing will increase the uptake of community-level HIV testing. 2. If integrating DM/HTN care with HIV care enhances engagement in HIV care. 3. Whether integration of DM/HTN care with HIV care enhances retention in HIV care for those newly enrolled in HIV care. 4. The cost-effectiveness of integrating NCD screening and care with HIV screening and care with regard to the incremental cost per HIV infected client engaged in HIV care, and cost per newly enrolled HIV client retained in HIV care over 24-months.</brief_summary>
