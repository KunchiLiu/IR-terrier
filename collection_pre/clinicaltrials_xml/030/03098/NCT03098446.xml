	<brief_title>The Effect of Sitting and Moderate Exercise on Plasma Triglyceride Elevation After a Meal</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects will undergo three weeks (two intervention, one washout) of testing during which they will participate in two conditions: 1) prolonged sitting (~14-hours/day) with a 1-hour bout of acute exercise at 65% of pre-intervention VO2max and 2) prolonged sitting (~14-hours/day) without an acute bout of exercise. During each intervention week, subjects will have 2 days of dietary and activity control, followed by 4 days during which prolonged sitting will occur. On the evening of the 4th day, subjects in the exercise group will perform the acute bout of exercise. On day 5, all subjects will undergo a lipid tolerance test to determine the body's ability to clear triglycerides from the blood as well as insulin/glucose response and substrate oxidation. Blood samples will be assayed for the previously mentioned substances and postprandial gas collection will be analyzed via indirect calorimetry.</detailed_description>
