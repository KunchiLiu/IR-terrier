	<brief_summary>The patients will be allocated to 2 groups: the LMA group and the endotracheal tube (ET) group. Airway management will be done with the LMA Protector for the patients of the LMA group and with the classic endotracheal tube for the patients of the ET group. The main purpose of the study is to determine if the application of the LMA Protector causes less laryngopharyngeal symptoms than the endotracheal tube after minimally invasive thyroidectomy. The secondary purpose is to confirm that the LMA Protector is a safe alternative airway management device for minimally invasive thyroidectomy.</brief_summary>
