	<brief_title>Use of a Rapid Turnaround Test for NG/CT to Improve Treatment of Women Presenting With Possible STIs</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All females ages 18-55 presenting to the UMMC Emergency Department or Urgent Care whose provider suspects sexually transmitted infection will be offered study enrollment and be randomly assigned to either the control or the experimental group. Both groups will have a urinalysis, a pregnancy test, a pelvic exam, and an endocervical sample collected, but the experimental group's urine will be used to run the rapid turnaround test (RTAT) instead of the standard PCR. Data will be collected regarding provider decision making, length of stay in the emergency department, patient satisfaction, clinician satisfaction, further healthcare sought by patient, and cost surrounding each treatment.</detailed_description>
