	<brief_summary>Gastric carcinoma is a disease with a high mortality. Peritoneal washing cytology has a recognized prognostic utility. However sensibility of this study is not appropriate. Studies with PCR (polymerase chain retrotranscription) can increase sensibility and accurate staging information. Objective: To analyze the sensibility and specificity of the expression of CK20, CEA and Ber-EP4 with PCR technique in peritoneal washings of advanced gastric carcinoma without clinical evidence of peritoneal carcinomatosis. Methodology: Retrotranscription analysis (RT-PCR) and quantitative PCR (qPCR) of CK20, CEA and Ber-EP4 in peritoneal washing. Test the feasibility of qPCR with this new marker (Ber-EP4). Comparison of the results with data obtained with conventional cytology. Study of peritoneal recurrence.</brief_summary>
