	<brief_title>Efficacy and Tolerability of Grazoprevir and Elbasvir in Peginterferon Alfa Plus Ribavirin Experienced Patients With Chronic Genotype 1 HCV and HIV Co-infection: a Non-randomised, Open-label Clinical Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objective •To assess the efficacy of grazoprevir 100mg and elbasvir 50mg by determining the proportion of sustained virological response 12 weeks after the end of therapy (SVR12; HCV RNA concentration less than 10 IU/ mL at follow-up week 12) in peginterferon alfa plus ribavirin experienced patients with genotype 1 HCV and HIV co-infection, compared with treatment-naïve patients with 1 HCV and HIV co-infection. Secondary Objective •To assess the tolerability of grazoprevir 100mg and elbasvir 50mg in peginterferon alfa plus ribavirin experienced patients by measuring frequency of SAEs and AEs leading to discontinuation.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Men and nonpregnant women, at least 20 years of age with chronic genotype 1 HCV and HIV coinfection. HCV RNA &gt; 10,000 IU/mL Stable antiretroviral therapy (ARV) with confirmed plasma HIV1 RNA &lt; 200 copies/mL CD4 Tcell count &gt; 100 cells/L peginterferon alfa plus ribavirin failure: null response &lt;1 log10 IU/mL reduction in HCV RNA at week 4; detectable HCV RNA since week 12 to the end of treatment; detectable HCV RNA for 12 to 24 weeks after the end of treatment; or discontinuation of peginterferon alfa plus ribavirin due to grade 3 or grade 4 adverse effects at any moment. Decompensated liver disease (presence or history of ascites, oesophageal or gastric variceal bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy, or other signs of advanced liver diseases) Liver cirrhosis with ChildPugh class B or C, or with a ChildTurcottePugh score of more than 6 points and albumin below 3 g/dL or platelet count below 75,000/ μL History of malignant disease, or evidence of hepatocellular carcinoma ARV with protease inhibitor containing regimen HBsAg and HBV core antibody should be checked in all patients. HBsAg positive patients should be excluded from the study. HBV core antibody positive patients should be closely monitored for hepatitis flare or HBV reactivation during HCV treatment and posttreatment followup. Appropriate patient management should be instituted for HBV infection as clinically indicated.</criteria>
