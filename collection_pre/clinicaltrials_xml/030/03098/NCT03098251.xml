	<brief_summary>According to a large amount of case affected with hepatolithiasis, we developed a typing system of Hepatolithiasis based on 3D digital conformation. And we hypothesized that it could predict a more precise construction of this disease, hence, typing by 3D conformation will improve the outcome of surgical treatment.The investigators will use a multicenter ambispective cohort study to test this hypothesis.</brief_summary>

In this cohort study, two group will be enrolled to compare the outcomes.</detailed_description>
