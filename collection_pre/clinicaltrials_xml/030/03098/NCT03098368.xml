	<brief_summary>Parkinson's disease (PD) is the neurodegenerative disease which is caused by Lewy bodies deposition in central and peripheral nervous system. The mains symptoms include both motor and non motor symptoms such as bradykinesia, rigidity, rest tremor, postural instability, autonomic dysfunction or neuropsychiatric symptoms. Moreover, the PD symptoms not only occur in the daytime, but also in the nighttime. The nighttime symptoms or nocturnal symptoms can make the patients disabling as well as the daytime symptoms. The bradykinesia that occurs in the nighttime is called nocturnal hypokinesia which also make many serious consequences such as bedsore, falling or aspiration or death. In this study, the investigators aim to study the effects of rotigotine transdermal patch compare to placebo on mainly the aspect of nocturnal hypokinesia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Rotigotine Effect on Nocturnal Hypokinesia Compares to Placebo Control: A Quantitative Assessment by Wearable Sensors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators recruited PD patients who had history of nocturnal hypokinesia and randomized by running number (blind) into 2 groups including active and placebo group. Baseline demographic, disease characteristics, nocturnal questionnaires and wearable nocturnal sensors data were collected before drug titration. In active group, participants received the rotigotine transdermal patch titration from 2 mg/day to maximum dosage which participants had no side effect or 16 mg/ day every week. In placebo group, participants would get the placebo patch titration as the active group. After participants got maintenance dosage, participants would get the physical examination, nocturnal questionnaires and wearable nocturnal sensors as before study.</detailed_description>
