	<brief_summary>This multi-center, randomized controlled trial study is planned to include 162 outpatients with onset of acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding to compare the rate of identification of stigmata of recent hemorrhage (SRH), and other clinical outcomes, including the 30-day rebleeding rate, between 'early' colonoscopy and 'elective' colonoscopy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparing Early Versus Elective Colonoscopy</brief_title>

Elective colonoscopy will be performed between 24 and 96 h after the initial visit.</detailed_description>
