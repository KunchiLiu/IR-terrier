	<brief_title>Effectiveness of a Buteyko-based Breathing Technique for Asthma Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators explore the effects of a Buteyko-based breathing technique training using a treatment group vs. control group design and a repeated measures design with follow-up measurements 3 and 6 months after the intervention. The sample size calculation was made for an effect of d = .20 with repeated measures, a power of 1- β = .80 and α = .05. Additionally the investigators plan to take measurements (only once) from healthy volunteers matching them (age and gender) with the asthma patients.</detailed_description>
