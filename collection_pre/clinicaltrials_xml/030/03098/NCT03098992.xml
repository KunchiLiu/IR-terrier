	<brief_summary>There are many existing treatments of female stress urinary incontinence such as the use of adult absorbent pads and diapers, behavioral training, including bladder training, pelvic muscle exercises, biofeedback, urethral plugs, intravaginal prosthesis, electrical stimulation, periurethral injections, and reconstructive surgery. However, there is still a lack of effective minimally invasive treatment options that are independent of patient compliance. One emerging approach of minimally invasive SUI therapy is pelvic floor reinforcement using laser therapy. The primary objective of this post-marketing study is to confirm the effectiveness and safety of the FotonaSmooth® device in the treatment of stress urinary incontinence (SUI) in a large number of females using objective and subjective methods. Patients with stress incontinence will be assigned to two groups, an active group, where the Fotona Dynamis Er:YAG Laser System will be used, and a sham group where a very low laser setting will be used, and parameter presentations will be masked. Participants will be adult females, 18 years old and older with clinical and urodynamic diagnosis of Stress Urinary Incontinence,who have had no significant improvement in urinary incontinence from at least one previous conservative treatment, such as behavioral measures, pelvic floor muscle training or the use of absorbent pads</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Prospective, randomized, 2-treatment, sham-controlled, single (patient only) blinded, study design using convenience sampling to enroll subjects as they present and are found to be eligible per the inclusion/exclusion criteria. This multicenter clinical trial utilizes a randomized assignment allocation schedule stratified by clinical site. Allocation rule pertains to the ratio of subjects in each treatment arm. Sampling rules pertain to the number of subjects in each active treatment arm. Two treatment arms enrolled on a 2:1 ratio: Active arm is the Fotona Dynamis Er:YAG Laser System and the control arm is a sham treatment with a very low laser setting and parameter presentations masked. The active arm subjects will be followed out to 12 months post-treatment. The sham arm subjects will be followed out to 6 months and then offered the active treatment.</detailed_description>
