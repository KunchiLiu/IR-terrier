	<brief_summary>The prevalence of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and the proportion of endovascular procedures for treatment are increasing worldwide. For many cases of treatment or procedures no randomized controlled trials (RCT) or results from meta-analyses are so far available. The decision for treatment and selection of procedure is therefore not uncommonly left up to the personal expertise of the physician. The IDOMENEO study represents a multistage multimethodological project for healthcare research and quality assurance in interdisciplinary vascular medicine, which undertakes a comprehensive examination of this topic. Various methods and data sources (even routine data) are linked in a meaningful way. The essential components of the total project are implementation of a register platform (GermanVasc), which conforms to data protection and data security as well as the development of instruments for valid measurement of the quality of life of patients with PAD. The data protection-conform linking of primary data in the register and routine data of the consortium partner BARMER should also enable validation of the data sources.</brief_summary>
