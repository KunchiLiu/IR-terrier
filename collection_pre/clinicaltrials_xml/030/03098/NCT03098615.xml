	<brief_title>Study Evaluating the Effect of Jublia on Dermatophytomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dermatophytomas are known to be resistant to even long courses of systemic antifungals, and have therefore been excluded from both topical and systemic clinical trials for onychomycosis, including those for Efinaconazole solution. Efinaconazole (Jublia) 10% solution is an FDA approved topical medication indicated for treatment of DLSO, and the utility of this medication likely exceeds published results. Efinaconazole solution's novel ability to penetrate into the subungal space likely accounts for improved treatment results seen in DLSO treated with Jublia. We will investigate the utility of topical efinaconazole solution in the treatment of dermatophytomas.</detailed_description>
