	<brief_summary>Pelvic organ prolapse repair involves conservative treatments and surgical treatments. Conservative treatments are for patients with moderate prolapse. Treatment of symptomatic prolapse remains essentially surgical. According to detailed medical history and a thorough physical exam, surgical techniques may be performed by high abdominal, low vaginal or mixed routes with or without the use of a reinforcing implant. Restorelle Direct Fix is indicated for transvaginal anterior and posterior surgical repair either as mechanical support or as reinforcement of pelvic floor defects. Advantages and disadvantages of vaginal prostheses are known but only limited data have been reported on the use of Restorelle® in the treatment of pelvic organ prolapse. This study is designed to collect data on the safety and efficacy of Restorelle® Direct Fix in pelvic organ prolapse repair.</brief_summary>
