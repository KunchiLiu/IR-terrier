	<brief_summary>The 2013-2015 Ebola Virus outbreak in Western Africa was unprecedented in size and geographic scope. There were over 28,000 cases and 11,000 deaths. During and following the outbreak, it became evident that spectrum of disease being observed in the communities and the Ebola treatment units was much broader than previously thought. In this study, we aim to identify host genetic factors that underlie the observed variation in disease susceptibility, severity, clinical sequelae, viral persistence, and serological response. We will enroll EVD survivors, close contacts of survivors, EVD healthcare workers, and individuals who have received investigational Ebola vaccines (population controls), and collect a blood sample, HIV/syphilis infection status, demographics, and medical history from participants. Most subjects will complete study participation after a single study visit; subjects having HIV/syphilis testing done as part of this study will return for a second visit to receive their HIV/syphilis test results and post-test counseling. We will genotype participants and compare results between cohorts to address the study aims. This may provide insight into pathogenesis and host immunity and potentially suggest new methods of intervention.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA: EVD Survivor: At least 3 years of age Positive EBOV serology or documented RTPCR positive status Willing to allow storage of biological samples for future research purposes Direct EBOV exposure control: At least 3 years of age Meets at least 1 of the following: Household member, family member, friend, careprovider, or sexual partner of survivor who was in closecontact with the survivor within 3 weeks of the EVD event, and has no history of an ETU stay or treatment for EVD at a CCC or holding center Healthcare worker who participated in treatment of EVD patients with no history of an ETU stay or treatment for EVD at a CCC or holding center Participant in PREVAIL III enrolled as a closecontact Willing to allow storage of biological samples for future research purposes No known EBOV exposure population controls: At least 3 years of age. Meets at least 1 of the following: Enrolled in PREVAIL I Enrolled in PREVAC/PREVAIL V Willing to allow storage of biological samples for future research purposes EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Severe illness from current illness (e.g. malaria) requiring treatment that would be compromised by enrollment in this study. Individuals excluded due to current illness can be enrolled following recovery. Any condition in the judgement of the study staff that would make the volunteer unable to participate in the study. Incapacity to provide consent, e.g., because of decisional impairment.</criteria>
