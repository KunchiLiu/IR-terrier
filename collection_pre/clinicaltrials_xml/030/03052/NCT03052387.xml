	<brief_title>Vertical Augmentation Using Onlay Versus Inlay Autogenous Graft With Simultaneous Implant Placement.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>to study the vertical augmentation with simultaneous implant placement at anterior maxillary region. - P: Patient requires implant at anterior maxillary ridge with vertical deficiency. - I:Inlay Sandwich Technique with immediate implant placement. - C:Onlay autogenous graft immediate implant placement. - O:Outcome name Measuring device Measuring unit Primary outcome: Vertical bone gain CBCT Millimeter -Secondary outcome(a): Crestal bone loss CBCT Millimeter</detailed_description>
	<mesh_term>Bone Resorption</mesh_term>
	<criteria>* Patients with partially edentulous anterior maxillary ridges. Patients were free from any systemic disease that interferes with bone healing. Absence of local pathosis at anterior maxillary area. No history of any grafting procedure at the designated edentulous ridge. The edentulous ridge vertical dimension was less than 10 mm measured from the alveolar crest to the nasal floor (i.e.ridge had vertical inadequacy) with normal horizontal alveolar dimension or patient with Increased InterArch Space. * Patient with fully dentulous maxilla. Pregnant females. Presence of bad habits (severe bruxism, clenching). Systemic diseases that may interfere with bone healing.e.g. uncontrolled Diabetes.</criteria>
