	<brief_summary>The purpose of the BIOLUX P-III BENELUX Registry is to further investigate the safety and clinical performance of the Passeo-18 Lux Drug Coated Ballon when used in daily clinical practice for the treatment of isolated atherosclerotic lesion (vessel narrowing) in popliteal arteries</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Age ≥ 18 years or minimum age as required by local regulations Subject must be willing to sign a Patient Data Release Form (PDRF) or Patient Informed Consent (PIC) where applicable Lesion(s) in the popliteal arteries suitable for endovascular treatment, treated with or scheduled to be treated with the Passeo18 Lux drug coated balloon. Isolated popliteal artery lesion: at least 2 cm of healthy segment between lesion(s) in the popliteal artery and lesion(s) in distal superficial femoral artery Inflow free from flowlimiting lesion. Patients with flowlimiting inflow lesions (&gt; 50% stenosis) can be included if lesion(s) have been treated successfully before or during the index procedure, with a maximum residual stenosis of 30% per visual assessment At least one native artery with direct outflow artery to the foot Rutherford classification 25 Patient with bypass surgery in the same limb can be enrolled if there is at least 2 cm healthy segment between popliteal artery and anastomosis Life expectancy ≤ 1 year Rutherford classification 6 Lesion involving the superficial femoral artery (arterial intersection with the femur in an anteroposterior view) or extending in infrapopliteal arteries (origin of the anterior tibial artery or tibioperoneal trunk) Aneurysm at the level of the popliteal artery Failure to successfully cross the target lesion with a guide wire (successful crossing means tip of the guide wire distal to the target lesion in the absence of flow limiting dissections or perforations) Intraprocedural decision not to proceed with the Passeo18 Lux DCB for any reason not related to the device (for instance blood flow limiting dissection after predilatation) Subject is currently participating in another investigational drug or device study that has not reached its primary endpoint yet Subject is pregnant or planning to become pregnant during the course of the study</criteria>
