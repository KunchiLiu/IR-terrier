	<criteria>Males Age 1865 inclusive Established T2DM for ≥ 1 year Taking maximally tolerated doses of metformin with or without a sulfonylurea agent Baseline hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) 7.5%10.0% No use of any antihyperglycemic agents other than metformin or sulfonylureas No current or previous chronic use of insulin (≥ 1 week other than for hospitalizations) No history or clinical suspicion of type 1 diabetes mellitus No concurrent chronic use of any corticosteroids by any route and for any indication, or concurrent conditions that may require the initiation of glucocorticoids during the study No concurrent lipidlowering medications whose levels are dependent on CYP3A pathway clearance (e.g., simvastatin, lovastatin, atorvastatin, fluvastatin and rosuvastatin) should either be washed out for at least one month prior to enrollment and/or switched to alternative LDLcholesterol lowering agents (e.g., pravastatin or ezetimibe) for at least one month. No contraindications or known intolerance to mifepristone No concurrent use of strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., cyclosporine, ergotamine, fentanyl, quinidine, sirolimus, tacrolimus, imidazole antifungals, HIV protease inhibitors, certain macrolide antibiotics) No concurrent use of CYP3A inducers (e.g., phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, rifampin) No concurrent use of medications that may prolong the QT interval (e.g., selected antipsychotics and antidepressants, quinolone antibiotics) No daily use of warfarin or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents Baseline K+ and Mg+2 within the laboratory normal ranges, with or without oral K+ and/or Mg+2 supplementation Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) averaging &lt; 280 mg/dL and without polyuria or polydipsia No symptomatic hypoglycemia averaging &gt; once per day Mean BP &lt; 140 mmHg systolic or 90 mm Hg diastolic Baseline LDLcholesterol &lt; 200 mg/dL if on lipidlowering therapy or &lt; 250 mg/dL while not on lipidlowering therapy Fasting triglycerides ≤ 500 mg/dL if on lipidlowering therapy HDLcholesterol ≥ 25 mg/dL No known history of prostate cancer, or elevated level of prostatespecific antigen (PSA) at screening Estimated GFR ≥ 30 mL/min No concurrent endocrinopathies that have not been stabilized with replacement or other definitive therapies (including known adrenal insufficiency regardless of replacement therapy, cortisol &lt; 5 μg/dL at screening) No active hemolytic anemias or hemoglobin variants that render the measurement of HbA1c potentially unreliable No other clinically significant hepatic, cardiovascular (including known personal or family history of, or risk factors for longQT syndrome, QTcF prolongation on ECG &gt; 500 ms), infectious (including HIV or any viral hepatitis), inflammatory, neoplastic or other systemic disease that may contraindicate the change of lipidlowering therapy, renders mifepristone unsafe, or otherwise confounds data interpretation Subjects not likely to start other drugs that may influence the study's outcomes (e.g., weight loss agents) Subjects who are able and willing to comply with all components of the study protocol, attend all scheduled followup visits, or who do not present other foreseeable barriers that might make the implementation of the protocol problematic or confound data interpretation</criteria>
