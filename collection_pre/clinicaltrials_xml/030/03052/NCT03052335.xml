	<brief_title>The Efficiency of Colon Capsule Endoscopy in Colon Cancer Screening</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multicentre, multidisciplinary (3 gastroenterology units; biostatistics department; cooperation with general practitioners), prospective study is focused on examination of individuals with average colorectal cancer (CRC) risk (asymptomatic, age 50-75 years). In years 2017 - 2019, there will be 230 persons with positive semi-quantitative immunochemical fecal occult blood tests (FIT; QuikRead, Orion Diagnostica Oy, Finland) with cut-off level 75 ng/ml involved. Every person will be examined by second generation colon capsule endoscopy (CCE2) and optical colonoscopy afterwards. Main objective is to show that the negative predictive value (NPV) of the CCE2 applied in patients with positive FIT results is sufficient to include this method in the National CRC screening as filter test with aim to reduce the necessity of subsequent optical colonoscopy.</detailed_description>
