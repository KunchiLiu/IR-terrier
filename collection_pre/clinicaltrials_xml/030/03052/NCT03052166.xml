	<brief_summary>Brief Summary: The QT Ultrasound system is an automated scanner which transmits pulsed ultrasound plane waves through the breast, as well as collects reflected ultrasound output. As the patient lays prone on a table, the breast is submerged in a warm water bath. The transmitter and receiver assembly moves around the suspended breast to record data for successive sub-volumes of targeted tissue. More than 2000 elements in the curvilinear transducer's array encircle the breast to gather data from the tissue structures of the breast, from nipple to chest wall. Information gathered from this automated QT scan encompasses the entire breast which is currently not commercially available using any other ultrasound technology.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Case Collection Study to Determine the Accuracy, Call Back and Cancer Detection Rates of QT Ultrasound in Breast Imaging</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, multicenter, multi-arm case collection study, with IRB approval. The study will follow an adaptive design with an initially planned total enrollment of approximately 350 cases to include both benign and malignant cases, representative of all tissue densities. The images and clinical data accrued in this prospective case collection will be used for creation of a database to facilitate future reader's studies, publications, building teaching files, and future marketing for QT Ultrasound.</detailed_description>

Pregnancy Currently breastfeeding Allergies to device materials History of breast cancer in the past 12 months Most recent screening mammography exam was completed more than 3 months but less than 11 months prior. History of breast surgeries or interventional breast procedures in the past 12 months, except for Fine Needle Aspiration(s) or Cyst Aspiration(s) Physical inability to tolerate the procedure on the scanner, i.e. inability to lie prone and still for up to 30 minutes at a time Open wounds, sores or skin rash present on the breast(s) or nipple discharge from the scanned breast Breasts too large for scanner, i.e. inability to successfully "fit" breast after the subject is placed on scanner Body weight greater than 400 lbs.
