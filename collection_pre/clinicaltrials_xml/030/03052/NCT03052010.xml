	<detailed_description>PrEP as a bridge to ART strategy will be introduced into 24 Kenyan public HIV-1 care centers according to national guidelines, in staged fashion, stratified by region (a stepped wedge design). Monitoring and evaluation activities will identify implementation barriers and solutions, characterize costs, and provide best practices for further scale-up. A research component will establish prospective open cohorts of couples at each clinic (up to 200) to study how the program is effectively implemented. Follow-up in the cohorts will be for up to 36 months at each care center and will evaluate impact, costs, and facilitators and barriers to implementation at patient, provider and health system levels.</detailed_description>
