	<brief_title>Prostatic Artery Embolization (PAE) for Treatment of Signs and Symptoms of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) Using Bead Block Microspheres</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This pilot study will be a single center, open labeled, non-randomized feasibility study to evaluate the initial safety of PAE for the treatment of symptomatic bladder outlet obstruction. 50 adult male subjects will be enrolled in this study. If eligible patients will undergo the prostate artery embolization procedure in the Interventional Radiology department. An angiogram of the prostate arteries will be done. Small beads called Bead Block microspheres will be injected into the prostate artery to slow blood flow to the prostate in the hope of providing relief with minimal side effects and complications, for lower urinary tract symptoms caused by BPH. After the procedure the patient will be followed at 4 weeks, 12 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months post procedure.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Diagnosis of LUTS secondary to BPH refractory to/contraindicated for medical treatment. Patients with indwelling foley catheters will be treated with culture directed antibiotics one time for 57 days. The catheter will be removed so urodynamic testing and cystoscopy can be completed as part of the screening visit. It will be replaced when testing is completed.

For men &gt;60: PSA &lt; 4 (or) PSA 420 with a documented negative biopsy within previous 12 months. History of prostate or bladder cancer, pelvic radiation, untreated bladder stones, On alphablockers within the past 2 weeks unless on a stable dose of medication with a stable urination pattern for 2 weeks prior to enrollment and the willingness to stay on the same dose for the duration of the study or if criteria are met at the 1 year follow up visit and/or part of a Trial without catheter (TWOC) and patient is currently in Acute Urinary Retention (AUR). On 5alpha reductase inhibitors within the past 6 months. Unless on a stable dose of medication with a stable urination pattern for 30 days prior to enrollment and the willingness to stay on the same dose for the duration of the study or if criteria are met at the 1 year follow up visit On phenylephrine, pseudoephedrine, imipramine, an anticholinergic or cholinergic medication within the past 2 weeks. Unless on a stable dose of medication with a stable urination pattern for 2 weeks prior to enrollment and the willingness to stay on the same dose for the duration of the study or if criteria are met at the 1 year follow up visit. On estrogen, androgen, any drug producing androgen suppression, or anabolic steroids within the past 4 months unless on stable dose of medication for 30 days prior to enrollment and the willingness to stay on the same dose for the duration of the study or if criteria are met at the 1 year follow up visit Daily use of a pad or device for incontinence required. Current urethral strictures/Bladder neck contracture (BNC) (past urethral strictures which have been treated successfully &gt; 6 months prior are eligible) renal insufficiency (i.e. creatinine &gt; 1.8) Known primary neurologic conditions such as multiple sclerosis or Parkinson's disease or other neurological diseases known to affect bladder function. Neurogenic bladder, Hypotonic Bladder Prior treatment for urinary incontinence Penile prosthesis. Artificial urinary sphincter. Documented bacterial prostatitis within the past year. Active urinary tract infection (UTI) unless in case of regular catheter dependence and thought to represent colonization. History of chronic prostatitis within the last 1 year Known bleeding disorders (e.g. VWD) Prior prostate procedures (e.g. Transurethral Microwave Therapy (TUMT), Transurethral Needle Ablation of the Prostate (TUNA), Waterinduced Thermotherapy (WIT), Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP), Photoselective Vaporization of the Prostate (PVP) Prior treatment for overactive bladder (e.g. intravesical botox) Enrolled in another treatment trial for any disease within the past 30 days Declines or unable to provide informed consent Condition precluding catheterbased intervention (ie occluded vessel, severe atheromatous disease) Any serious medical condition likely to impede successful completion of the study, such as certain mental disorders, uncontrolled diabetes, cardiac arrhythmias, cardiac disease including congestive heart failure, significant respiratory disease, or known immunosuppression.
