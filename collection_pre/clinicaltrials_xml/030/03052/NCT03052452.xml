	<brief_summary>The proposed My Nutritional Health (MNH) app is a unique tool for consumers interested in tracking their food intake and linking diet to symptoms. The investigators will test this app for developmental purposes among a sample of 100 participants who are patients of dieticians at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center (CSMC) and the University of Michigan (UM) with varying presentation of GI symptoms and suspected food intolerances. The MNH app will be used as a data collection platform for this study and can be utilized by any device supporting iOS (tablets, ipads, iphones, and Android. The investigators will use the data collected in the app testing to develop population level FAST scores. The MNH app includes two integrated functions: 1. Patient Symptom and Food Consumption Reporting 2. FAST Score calculation It is important to note that, per this protocol, the MNH app will only be evaluated for developmental purposes. It is currently not meant to serve as a diagnostic tool, nor to provide referrals for patients with food and symptom patterns that may suggest a food intolerance. In this respect, our test app is not governed by FDA or other regulatory bodies, as it does not make diagnoses or offer specific guidance. The purpose of this study is only to develop normative scoring distributions of FAST within the context of patients visiting GI dieticians as part of routine care.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study aims are: AIM 1 - To validate FAST Instrument against existing patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures. AIM 2 - To assess sensitivity of FAST instrument to changes in patient diet. Investigators will collect information about food intake and related symptoms using the MNH App, for validating the FAST instrument, and assessing its sensitivity to change in patient diet. For this study, 100 participants who are scheduled to see dieticians at either Cedars-Sinai Medical Center or the University of Michigan will be recruited. You will be asked to report information regarding your food intake for two weeks (one week pre- and post-dietician visit). The MNH app will prompt you (through push notifications) at three time points during each day, asking you to log into the app to report food intake and any physical symptoms that you are experiencing. Investigators will reach out to you on day 3, during the first week of enrollment via telephone to inquire about your progress, assist in trouble shooting for technical difficulties, and answer any questions you may have. At the end of each week, you will be asked to respond to a standardized questionnaire about GI symptoms (the 15-item Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale; GSRS)(1) and a questionnaire about general health status (the PROMIS-10, a 10-item questionnaire developed by NIH-PROMIS, the National Institutes of Health - Patient Reported Outcome Measurement Information System) through the MNH mobile app.</detailed_description>
