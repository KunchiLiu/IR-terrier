	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to combat the growing global health issue of sedentary behavior and the associated health consequences of prolonged sitting in the workplace. The population of desk-based workers makes up a relatively large population and are an important target for this health promoting initiative with a focus on improving posture, encouraging movement, and fostering a more active and healthy business community. It's important to recognize that occupational therapy practitioners can contribute to community health promotion/disease prevention programs by the skill-set of practitioners to understand habits and routines that influence the adoption and maintenance of healthy behaviors.</brief_summary>
