	<brief_summary>Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over the primary motor cortex (M1) will be applied for patient who suffer from neuropathic pain following spinal cord injury The tDCS treatment will be coupled with a video of a man walking (creating a visual illusion) in order to enhance functional ability and reduce pain</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>tDCS and VI to Treat Neuropathic Pain and Function in SCI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Non-invasive cortical brain stimulation is a promising method for treating cases of neuropathic pain in patients with spinal cord injury (SCI). Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over the primary motor cortex (M1) appears to modulate cortical excitability and can reduce pain levels following SCI, however its effects remaining for short-term and may not be useful for the rehabilitation progress in these patients. Recent findings suggest that M1 stimulation combined with visual illusion (VI) enhances the reduction in pain which maintain up to 3 month following treatment. The current study aims to reveal whether reduction of neuropathic pain in patients with SCI through tDCS have beneficial effect on functional ability during rehabilitation program. In the present study the investigators will use anodal stimulation of the M1 via neuroConn DC stimulator. Current intensity of 2mA or sham stimulation will be given during 20 min in parallel to a visual illusion of walking legs (or neutral video for sham stimuli).</detailed_description>
