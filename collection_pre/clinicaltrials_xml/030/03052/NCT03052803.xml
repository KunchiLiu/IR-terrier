	<brief_title>Comparison of Devices Evaluating Fractional Flow Reserve in Coronary Arteries</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The decision to perform a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is usually based on angiographic results alone. Angiography can be used for the visual evaluation of the inner diameter of a vessel. Visual evaluation is limited by inter-individual variability. Fractional flow reserve provides a functional evaluation, by measuring the pressure decline caused by a vessel narrowing. The original studies validating the use of FFR were conducted with only one device (St-Jude MedicalÂ®). Recently, new FFR devices have been commercialized but have not yet been compared.</detailed_description>
