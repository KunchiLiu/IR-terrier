	<brief_summary>The aim of the project is to investigate the effects in humans of a daily intake of whole milk compared to skimmed milk primarily and secondarily respectively on: - Blood lipids: total-, LDL-, and HDL-cholesterol and triglycerides - Risk markers of diabetes type 2: plasma glucose and insulin</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Whole Milk Compared With Skimmed Milk and Effect on Lipids</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will be a randomized controlled 2 x 3 weeks crossover intervention study with no wash-out period, as the lipids in the blood are known to adjust after 2 weeks. The effects of a diet containing 0.5 L of whole milk (17.5 g of milk fat/day) will be compared with a diet containing 0.5 L of skimmed milk (1.5 g of milk fat/day). Blinding is not possible since the appearance of the test foods cannot be concealed. The study subjects will receive the two test foods in random order, decided by draw of lots. Blood samples will be drawn on the first day of the period and in the end of the period for each 3 week-periods.</detailed_description>
