	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to conduct survey-based assessments for the safety of air travel in patients with pulmonary Langerhans cell histiocytosis (PLCH). The study will enroll patients through the clinic network at Rare Lung Disease Consortium (RLDC) and through the Histiocytosis Association website. Patients will have access to the questionnaire via REDCap (an online data management system) and each patient will be provided with a link to complete the survey. The investigators plan on enrolling approximately 200 patients with PLCH for the purpose of this study. Secondary aims of this study include further characterization of the clinical aspects of disease and to establish a contact registry for these patients, in order to facilitate future studies.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study will enroll participants through the clinic network at the Rare Lung Disease Consortium (RLDC) and through the Histiocytosis Association websites. Participants will have access to the questionnaire via REDCap (an online data management system) and each participant will be provided a link to complete the survey. In case of lack of internet access or inability to complete the online questionnaire, a paper survey will be mailed out with a pre-paid envelope to return the survey. Primary Study Objective(s): To define the risk of pneumothorax associated with air travel in patients with PLCH. Secondary Study Objective(s): To establish a contact registry for patients with PLCH to facilitate future trials To assess the rate of pneumothorax recurrence in patients with PLCH To assess the efficacy of pleurodesis in preventing recurrent pneumothoraces among patients with PLCH</detailed_description>
