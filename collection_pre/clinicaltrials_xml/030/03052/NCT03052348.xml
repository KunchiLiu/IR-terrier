	<brief_summary>Staphylococcus Aureus is a common pathogen colonising the skin of Atopic Dermatitis patients and is responsible for the frequent relapses and complications associated with the disease. Synalar cream; Supiroban 2% and Cetamacrogol, are frequently used separately in the treatment of AD. However the use of Supiroban 2%, in a mixture of Synalar cream and Cetamacrogol cream as a combined formulation, has not been studied in children suffering from severe AD. The aim of this trial is to determine the efficacy of combination therapy which includes a topical antibiotic, a topical steroid cream and a moisturizing cream over a 3 to 4 month period in children. Trial Design: A two-center, single blinded, randomized parallel group, superiority trial. Type of control: Active controls without placebo Study population and Setting: A sample of 44 subjects will be recruited from Red Cross Children's Hospital and Umtata Hospital. Estimated duration of trial: 6 months. Duration of participation: Each subject will participate in the trial for a maximum of 90 days. Primary endpoint: reduction in SCORAD scores; frequency of clinical flares for AD and improvement in the quality of life at 90 days. Benefit/Significance A simple and effective approach to the management of atopic eczema.</brief_summary>
