	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of cancer not amenable to curative therapy. Patients who have a diagnosis for which a PD(L)1 inhibitor is FDA approved must have previously received treatment with one of these therapies. Patients must have a disease that is measurable by RECIST v1.1 and at least 2 tumors that are accessible to biopsy. Patients must be 18 years of age or older. Patients must have ECOG Performance Status ≤2. Patients must meet the following laboratory criteria: 1. ANC ≥1.5 x 109/L (≥1500/mm3) 2. Platelet count ≥100 x 109/L (≥100,000/mm3) 3. Hemoglobin ≥8.0 g/dL (≥4.96 mmol/L) 4. Serum creatinine ≤1.5 x ULN or 24hour creatinine clearance ≥60 mL/minute 5. AST ≤2.5 x ULN; ALT ≤2.5 x ULN or AST/ALT &lt;5 x ULN if liver involvement 6. Serum bilirubin ≤1.5 x ULN, except in patients with Gilbert's Syndrome who must have a total bilirubin &lt;3 mg/dL (51.3 μmol/L) Patients who have received prior therapy with a TLR agonist (prior treatment with a topical TLR agonist (e.g. imiquimod) is permitted). Patients who have received treatment with IFNα within the previous 6 months prior to enrollment. Patients with known hypersensitivity to any oligodeoxynucleotide that cannot be adequately managed with appropriate prophylaxis. Patients with active autoimmune disease requiring diseasemodifying therapy. Patients requiring concurrent systemic steroid therapy higher than physiologic dosage (7.5 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent). Patients with another primary malignancy that has not been in remission for at least 3 years. The following are exempt from the 3year limit: nonmelanoma skin cancer, curatively treated localized prostate cancer with nondetectable prostatespecific antigen, cervical carcinoma in situ on biopsy or a squamous intraepithelial lesion on Papanicolaou (Pap) smear, and thyroid cancer (except anaplastic). Patients with active infections requiring systemic treatment. Patients who are known to be hepatitis B surface antigen positive. Patients with a known diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding. Patients with known central nervous system, meningeal, or epidural disease. Patients with stable brain metastases following definitive local treatment are eligible if steroid requirement is &lt;7.5 mg/day of prednisone (or equivalent). Patients with impaired cardiac function or clinically significant cardiac disease.</criteria>
