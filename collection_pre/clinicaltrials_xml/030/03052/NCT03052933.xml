	<brief_summary>COPGEM (Copanlisib and Gemcitabine)chemotherapy regimen is proposed as the salvage treatment for relapsed or refractory peripheral T-cell or NK/T-cell lymphomas in this study protocol, which would be expected to be feasible and effective in this group of patients. Copanlisib (BAY 80-6946), a highly selective and potent class-1 PI3K inhibitor with sub-nanomolar IC50s against PI3Kα and PI3Kδ, has demonstrated activity in relapsed/refractory, aggressive NHLs, suggesting an ORR of 50% for T-cell lymphomas. Gemcitabine has demonstrated clinical antitumor activity against PTCLs including NK/T-cell lymphomas both as single-agent (ORR 30-50%) and in combination therapy, with limited extramedullary toxicities. Considering the evidence of activity for both agents against PTCLs, the investigators propose that targeted therapy with copanlisib in combination with gemcitabine will exhibit early elimination of rapidly growing tumor cells and be a rational therapeutic modality for use in relapsed or refractory PTCLs, if the overlapping toxicities can be managed.</brief_summary>
