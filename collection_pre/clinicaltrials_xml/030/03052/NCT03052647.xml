	<brief_summary>The objective of this study was to compare the an adhesive latch device (" Dermaclip") to subcuticular skin closure at the time of cesarean section. Currently, no studies exist comparing these two closure techniques. The hypothesis is dermaclip closure is faster than subcuticular closure. The null hypothesis is there is no difference in closure times. There is a study (see reference at bottom) that compares staples closure to subcuticular closure, but none comparing subcuticular to dermaclip closure. Dermaclip device is easily deployed and is expected to be as fast as staples closure compared to subcuticular as noted in the prior study referenced below.</brief_summary>
