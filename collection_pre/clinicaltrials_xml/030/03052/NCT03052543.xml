	<brief_summary>This pilot study is being conducted to determine whether the intraoperative presence of a Bispectral Index Monitor (BIS), a non-invasive monitor, affects the perioperative and postoperative indices and outcomes. The BIS monitor is an adhesive sensor that is applied to the forehead to monitor EEG waves. This monitor is not a Standard of Care Monitor, yet in adult and pediatric studies it has been shown to decrease time to emergence, decrease volatile anesthesia requirement, decrease recovery time and in some cases, decrease post-operative morbidity (REFS). The effect on intra-operative and post-operative parameters, when BIS is present but not specifically designated to be used as a monitor to guide anesthesia delivery, has not been specifically examined. This will be the first pediatric study which applies BIS on all patients and randomizes the anesthesiologists to either be or not be privy to seeing the BIS values during intra-operative period.</brief_summary>
