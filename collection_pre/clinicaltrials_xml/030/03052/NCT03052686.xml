	<brief_title>Retrospective Study of 110 Cases of Uterine Rupture to Determine Obstetric and Neonatal Complications</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a retrospective study, gathering data of five maternity in the department of Val d'Oise in France, during 13 years (between 01/01/2000 an 31/12/2013). The incidence of uterine rupture increases with increasing cesarean rates. It occurs at a rate of 0.08% across all childbirths in France, and 0.5 to 1% of the childbirths on cicatricial uterus in France. Although the risk factors are known, it is usually unexpected. This is a serious complication for the mother (mortality &lt;1%, severe morbidity at 15% ) and for the child (mortality for 3 to 6 % for childbirth at term, neonatal asphyxia for 6 to 15%) that can occur during pregnancy or during labor.</detailed_description>
