	<brief_summary>The role of disorders of socio-emotional processes in cerebral diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, frontal temporal dementia, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, traumatic brain injury, stroke, focal lesions, has been recognized recently. Social cognition refers to a large group of emotional and cognitive abilities regulating inter-individuals relationships and it includes mainly theory of mind, emotional information processing and empathy. However, assessment of socio-emotional processes is still largely based on experimental tests that are not validated for clinical purpose. In addition their long duration of administration is not adapted to clinical examination. Finally these tests have not been standardized and normalized in French-speaking population.</brief_summary>
