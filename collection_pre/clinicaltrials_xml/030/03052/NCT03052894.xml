	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to determine the accuracy of a hydraulically coupled twitch monitor compared to the kinemyographic twitch monitor in current use to measure the extent of neuromuscular blockade in patients undergoing general anesthesia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Validation of a Muscle Relaxation Monitor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Neuromuscular blockade (paralysis) is necessary for many surgical procedures to provide optimal surgical conditions. The extent of paralysis typically assessed during routine clinical care by examining the muscle response of the thumb ("twitch") following delivery of a series of the "train-of-four". Quantitative assessment of neuromuscular block can be assessed using kinemyography. This technique measures movement of the thumb as assessed by distortion of a piezoelectric foil. This method is unsuitable when the thumb cannot move freely, such as when the arms are tucked at the side. The proposed method is a simple technique that can constructed with equipment that is readily available in most operating rooms. If validated, it would provide a simple method to assess quantitatively the extent of neuromuscular blockade and recovery of muscle strength. In addition, it provides a method to assess blockade where the available method cannot be used because free movement of the thumb if restricted.</detailed_description>
