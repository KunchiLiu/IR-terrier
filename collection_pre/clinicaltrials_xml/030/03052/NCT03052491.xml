	<brief_summary>This open-label field trial evaluates the effects of treatment with a multi-pathway dietary supplement (Stem Cell 100+) that has been commercially available for several years. The objective of the intervention trial is to determine if normal subjects over 35 years of age experience any observable health benefits from the dietary supplement as to their blood pressure, pulse rate, blood cholesterol, lung capacity, stress levels, or self reported changes in markers of overall health and life expectancy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of a 10 Component Dietary Supplement on Health and the Quality of Life</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently, only dietary restriction has been verified to slow the rate of aging and to promote general health. This trial is designed to see whether a complex supplement (Stem Cell 100+) that targets multiple longevity pathways could also have positive effects on several markers of successful aging and good health. Multipath causes of aging include: stem cell function, telomere loss, chronic stress, inflammation, insulin-like growth factors, autophagy, vascular loss, neural dysfunction, and oxidative stress. The goal of the study was to test the effects of this novel multipath intervention strategy in a clinical trial of healthy people using health markers such as blood pressure, cholesterol status, lung function, stress levels, and self-reported health status. Hundreds of published animal and human clinical studies have been done with each of the individual active ingredients in the formulation, which target many critical causes of aging. Based on their published animal studies showing extension of life span in a model animal and their laboratory work on adult human stem cells, the investigators believe that Stem Cell 100+ will provide evidence of efficacy in addressing multiple index markers of health and life expectancy outcomes.</detailed_description>
