	<brief_summary>This is a prospective clinical validation study of a novel regulatory approved (CE-IVD) diagnostic assay called ImmunoXpert™ that will enroll 1222 pediatric patients. The study aims to externally validate the tool's diagnostic accuracy and estimate the potential improvement in health and economic outcomes following the usage of ImmunoXpert™. Additionally, statistical analysis will be performed to compare ImmunoXpert™ accuracy to current practice lab testing (e.g. WBC, CRP, and PCT) and clinical suspicion at time of requisition. Enrolled patients will be managed according to the current standard of care and per standard institutional procedures.</brief_summary>
