	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to invite all people diagnosed with cancer who meet the eligibility criteria to complete questionnaires before their treatment begins and at regular intervals over time to assess the impact of cancer and its treatment on people's lives in the short, medium and long term. We will explore a range of factors to determine their role in both recovery of health and well-being and self-management. Although it is known that people who have had cancer are likely to experience a number of physical and psychological problems as a result of the disease and treatment, it is not known what the 'typical' course of recovery of health and well-being looks like, how long it takes and how this can be influenced. We will determine pathways to recovery of health and well-being following cancer diagnosis (initially breast cancer diagnosed &lt;50 years, Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma and gynaecological cancers) and identify what factors influence this. This includes assessing the relative importance of the person's illness, personal attributes, perceived burden of treatment, role of the environment they live in, including health / social care and personal networks of support, and their ability and capacity to self-manage. We will identify who is most at risk of problems and what environmental supports and resources people are able to mobilise to support their self-management. We will also explore who has the confidence and ability to manage during and beyond treatment and what factors influence this and whether this leads to earlier problem resolution and restoration of health and well-being. This knowledge will be used to develop and test future supportive interventions to enhance the rapid recovery of health and well-being - our long term aim being to design ways of helping people with cancer in areas we identify as problematic for them.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>OVERALL ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Have a new diagnosis (confirmed or probable) of one of the selected cancer types determined through clinical assessment, cytology, histology or imaging or Have new / second primary cancer at a site previously treated for cancer Be awaiting primary curative intent treatment, including neoadjuvant treatment Be â‰¥16 years old. Be able to complete questionnaires in English Be able to provide written, informed consent They do not have one of the specified cancer types Disease is recurrence / progression (either locally advanced or metastatic) at an existing cancer site They are having treatment for a potentially curative recurrence of disease e.g. locally advanced disease (i.e. they have been previously treated for the same cancer) They have metastatic disease from a cancer at another site COHORTSPECIFIC ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: BREAST CANCER COHORT Inclusion: Women under 50 years Stage 1, 2 or 3 breast cancer Have no distant metastases Patients due to undergo neoadjuvant treatment should be approached before this starts For those whose core biopsy shows DCIS only but postexcision biopsy pathology confirms invasive cancer, approach should be made as soon as possible following diagnosis and completion of the baseline questionnaire should be prior to the start of adjuvant treatment Exclusion: Confirmed diagnosis of CIS (ductal or lobular) only Men NONHODGKIN LYMPHOMA COHORT Inclusion: Any pathological diagnosis of Diffuse Large B Cell lymphoma (DLBCL) including; Secondary transforming or transformed DLBCL which has transformed from an indolent/low grade lymphoma (most commonly Follicular Lymphoma) as long as the low grade lymphoma was not treated and this is a recent transformation for which curative intent treatment has not yet started. Rare subtypes such as T cell rich Large B Cell Lymphoma and primary mediastinal (thymic) large Bcell lymphoma Patients who have started steroid prephase treatment are eligible for approach before the start of chemotherapy. GYNAECOLOGICAL CANCERS COHORT OVARIAN CANCER SUBCOHORT Ovarian Inclusion criteria: Have a confirmed diagnosis either from cytology, histology, imaging or diagnostic primary surgery of either; Epithelial ovarian cancer including primary peritoneal cancer; fallopian tube cancer Ovarian carcinosarcoma Granulosa tumour of the ovary Where possible patients should be entered prior to any treatment including surgery. Where the diagnosis is only made at the time of surgery, women may still enter the study following surgery. Approach should be made as soon as possible following diagnosis and completion of the baseline questionnaire should occur prior to the start of adjuvant treatment. FIGO Stages: IA, IB, IC1, IC2, IC3, IIA, IIB, IIIA1 Ovarian Exclusion criteria: Borderline ovarian cancer Germ cell tumour Sarcoma ENDOMETRIAL CANCER SUBCOHORT Endometrial Inclusion criteria: Have a confirmed diagnosis either from cytology, histology or imaging of; endometrial cancer endometrial carcinosarcoma FIGO Stages: IA, IB, II, IIIA, IIIB, IIIC1, IIIC2 Endometrial Exclusion criteria Choriocarcinoma Germ cell tumour Sarcoma CERVICAL CANCER SUBCOHORT Cervical Inclusion criteria: Have a confirmed diagnosis either from cytology, histology or imaging of; Cervical cancer FIGO Stages: IA2, IB1, IB2, IIA1, IIA2, IIB, IIIA, IIIB Cervical Exclusion criteria: FIGO stage IA1 Cervical carcinoma in situ (CIS) Sarcoma Small cell cancer of the cervix</criteria>
