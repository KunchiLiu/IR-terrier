	<brief_summary>The vagal stimulation is a promising therapy for a lot of disorders as well as hemodynamic regulatory way. In order to minimize the harm of a surgery chip implantation, actually it was developing a non-invasive device that is able to stimulate the auricular branch of vagal nerve. It has been shown that trans-auricular vagal stimulation (tVNS) causes direct stimulation of the vagal nerve. However, there are still no strong evidences about it actions regarding the autonomic modulation. The aim of this study is to evaluate effects of tVNS on heart rate, blood pressure and the autonomic control in healthy and hypertensive subjects, at rest and after orthostatic position</brief_summary>
