	<brief_title>Oral Melatonin Plus Zinc Supplementation in Chronic Fatigue Syndrome/Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic Fatigue Syndrome/Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME) is a complex medical condition, characterized by severe disabling fatigue with no known cause, no established diagnostic tests, and no universally effective treatment. No studies have evaluated symptomatic treatment using oral melatonin plus zinc supplementation in CFS/ME. The primary endpoint was to assess the effect of melatonin plus zinc supplementation on self-reported fatigue. Secondary measures included self-reported outcomes of sleep problems, anxiety/depression, dysautonomia, QoL and side-effects during treatment.</detailed_description>
