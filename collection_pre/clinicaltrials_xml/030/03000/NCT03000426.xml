	<brief_title>Photobiomodulation of Palatal Donor Site After Free Gingival Graft Removal</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, parallel and controlled clinical trial. The population evaluated in the study was selected at Science and Technology Institute (STI) -São José dos Campos, College of Dentistry. Patients were assigned to one of the three treatment groups: - Group 1: ridge preservation surgery through free gingival graft and photobiomodulation (PBM) application through a gallium aluminum arsenide laser (GaAlAs) in the donor area using a 60 Joule/cm² dose - Group 2: ridge of preservation surgery through free gingival graft and PBM through a gallium aluminum arsenide laser (GaAlAs) in the donor area using a 15 Joule/cm² dose - Group 3: ridge preservation surgery through free gingival graft and PBM Sham. All surgeries were performed by the same expert periodontist (MPS). A blade 15c (Swann-Morton® - Sheffield, England) mounted on No. 3 scalpel handle will make an intrasulcular incision around the tooth indicated for exodontia. Then, the tooth will be extracted through the use of appropriate instruments in order to obtain a minimally traumatic exodontia. After the exodontia, curettage and irrigation of the dental socket will be performed. After that, the socket will be filled with xenogenous bone graft (GenOx Inorg; Campinas, SP), and sealed with a free gingival graft removed from the palate. For the free gingival graft removal, a circular template of 5 millimeters in diameter will be used. This mold has the objective of standardizing the palatal graft removal ensuring the wounds will have always the same size. After the circular incision, the graft will be removed with a thickness of 2 millimeters. After free gingival graft removal from palate, it will be adjusted to the entrance of the socket and sutured with Vicryl® 5.0 reabsorbable (Ethicon Johnsons do Brasil, São José dos Campos - SP). The evaluated parameters were wound remaining area (WRA), scar and tissue colorimetry (TC), tissue thickness (TT) and postoperative discomfort (D), evaluated at baseline and 7, 14, 45, 60, and 90 days after surgery. Statistical Analysis: All data were expressed as mean ± standard deviation or expressed in percentages during the descriptive phase. Data were analyzed according to distribution by the Shapiro-Wilk test. For the remaining wound area, tissue colorimetry, tissue thickness, and postoperative discomfort parameter analysis, two way repeated measures ANOVA was performed for intra- and intergroup analysis. T test was used for intergroup comparison of the number of analgesics taken. The presence or absence of scars was measured by Q-square test. Statistical analysis was performed using Sigma Plot 12.0. In all tests a significance level of 0.05 was chosen.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Patients presenting indication of anterior maxillary exodontia (15 to 25), with normal gingival contour in the teeth indicated for exodontia; The tooth included in the study, as well as the adjacent teeth do not present a loss of periodontal insertion. Patients agreed to and signed the formal consent to participate in the study after receiving an explanation of risks and benefits from an individual who was not a member of the present study (Resolution no. 196 October, 1996, and Ethics and Code of Professional Conduct in Dentistry 179/93). Were excluded patients with systemic problems that contraindicated surgical procedure Those under medication that could interfere with the wound healing Those who smoked Those who were pregnant or lactating, and Those who had had periodontal surgery on the study area.</criteria>
