	<brief_summary>EUS - guided choledocho-duodenostomy (ECDS) is an established option for bile duct drainage in unresectable malignant distal CBD strictures when endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) fails. However, how primary ECDS compares with ERCP with covered self-expanding metallic stents (CSEMS) in unresectable malignant distal CBD strictures is uncertain. The aim of the current study is to compare primary ECDS versus ERCP with CSEMS in unresectable malignant distal CBD strictures. We hypothesis that ECDS is associated with a higher 1-year stent patency rate.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>EUS - Guided Choledocho-duodenostomy Versus ERCP With Covered Metallic Stents in Patients With Unresectable Malignant Distal Common Bile Duct Strictures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Malignant biliary obstruction is a common sequela of pancreatic cancers or distal bile duct cancers, and its development can hinder the use of chemotherapy, decrease patient quality of life and decrease survival. Malignant biliary obstruction is traditionally palliated with ERCP with metallic stent insertion. However, these stents are prone to obstruction due to tumour ingrowth. In addition, ERCP may not always be possible due to tumour obstruction and percutaneous biliary drainage may be required. Recently, ECDS has been described as an alternative to percutaneous biliary drainage in patients with failed ERCP. The procedure is also associated with potential advantages as compared to conventional ERCP. In particular, the risk of tumour ingrowth into the stent placed after ECDS is low and stent patency rates may be better than ERCP. Thus, the aim of the current study is to compare primary ECDS versus ERCP with CSEMS in unresectable malignant distal CBD strictures.</detailed_description>
