	<brief_summary>Direct active unloading of the left ventricle with the Impella CP System prior to PPCI in patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is safe and feasible</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Door To Unloading With IMPELLA CP System in Acute Myocardial Infarction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A multi-center, prospective, randomized, two-arm feasibility trial to assess the potential role of unloading with the Impella CP prior to revascularization in reducing infarct size. The study design includes 1:1 randomization between: 1) Delay Arm: 30 minutes of unloading with Impella CP prior to primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI); and 2) Immediate Arm: initiation of Impella CP unloading followed immediately by PPCI.</detailed_description>
