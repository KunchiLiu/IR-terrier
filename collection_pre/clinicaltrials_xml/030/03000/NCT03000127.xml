	<brief_summary>Fatigue is a major symptom in people with multiple sclerosis (MS), for which treatments are limited. Several studies have shown that a large proportion of men with MS have low testosterone levels. We propose a two-site clinical trial using topical testosterone gel as a treatment for MS-related fatigue in men with progressive MS who have low or low-normal testosterone levels.</brief_summary>
