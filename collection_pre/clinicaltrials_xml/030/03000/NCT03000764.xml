	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to seeking a molecular signature of pathological radiation induced fibrosis based on the response of skin fibroblasts after irradiation, comparing two groups of patients distinguished by their individual radiosensitivity. The signature will integrate recent insights in terms of alternative splicing of mRNAs and level of expression of non-coding RNAs, particularly long non-coding RNAs, snRNAs, snoRNAs and microRNAs. In each group each expression patterns of candidate HSP proteins potentially predictive of pathological radiation induced fibrosis (HSP27, HSP70, αβ crystalline) in the serum and on cell culture will be characterized.</brief_summary>
