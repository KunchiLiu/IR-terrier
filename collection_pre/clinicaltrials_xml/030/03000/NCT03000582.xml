	<detailed_description>Creatine nitrate contains several nutrients that may increase anaerobic exercise performance. Theoretically, dietary supplementation of creatine nitrate during resistance training can improve the quality of training leading to greater changes in strength, power and fat free mass. Endothelial function measured by flow-mediated dilation (FMD), a non-invasive vascular health parameter that can be measured via ultrasonography, is a predictor of cardiovascular disease risk which precedes traditional risk markers. Diet, physical activity and pharmaceutical interventions can all impact vascular function and health. The purpose of this study is to determine the acute vascular response of creatine nitrate supplementation on FMD by analyzing the pharmacokinetics of creatine nitrate supplementation.</detailed_description>
