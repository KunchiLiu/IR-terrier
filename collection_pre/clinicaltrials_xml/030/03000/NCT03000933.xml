	<brief_title>Human Papillomavirus in Young People Epidemiological Research 2 (HYPER2)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>HYPER-2, will be a cross-section study, using the same recruitment and testing strategies used in HYPER 1, which determined the prevalence of anal, genital and oral HPV among men who have sex with men aged 16-20 years. Given the differing age groups that will have been offered vaccination over the 2 study period, men aged 16-19 will be recruited in the first year (2017) and men aged 16-20 will be recruited in the second year (2018) to ensure that the participants included in the HYPER-2 study would have been eligible for the free male HPV vaccine in Australia. A total of 200 men will be recruited over a 2-year period, and HPV vaccination status for each participant will be verified against the National HPV Vaccination Program Register. This 2-year cross-sectional study will recruit men who report sex with men aged from 16 to 20 years.</detailed_description>
