	<brief_title>Effects of Hypertonic Dextrose Water Injection for Supraspinatus Tendinosis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Supraspinatus tendinosis is a degenerative process of tendon. It can be caused by external trauma episode and imbalanced of self-repair process. It can cause patients with shoulder pain when shoulder over head exercise and heavy lifting. It can also influence the sleep quality due to pain symptoms of shoulder. Usually these patients had limited response to medication and physical modality. Moreover, it can cause shoulder tear or rupture, which can disability with aging. Prolotherapy is an injection therapy for chronic painful musculoskeletal conditions. It involves the injection of small volumes of an irritant agent, most commonly a hyperosmolar dextrose solution, at multiple painful tendon and ligament insertions where they connect to bone, over several treatment sessions. The injection of an irritant solution initiates an inflammatory cascade at the site of injection, which causes fibroblast proliferation and subsequent collagen synthesis, resulting in a stronger tendon or ligament. Hyperosmolar dextrose appears to be the most commonly used agent today, with morrhuate sodium used slightly less often. There is promising recent evidence for prolotherapy, with hyperosmolar dextrose in treating painful tendinopathies. The aim of this study is to hypertonic injection in supraspinatus tendinosis patients about clinical and ultrasound image presentation. The investigators conducted a double blinded randomized controlled trial for 60 participants with chronic shoulder pain for 3 months with supraspinatus tendinosis. In study group, 4 injections with 20% dextrose water was injection in supraspinatus tendon with 2 weeks interval for 8 weeks and control group received normal saline. SPADI, VAS and ultrasound data were obtained before and after intervention, 6month and 12 months after enrolled in this study. The ANOVA and independent t test are applied for analysis by SPSS 20.0 with P value less than 0.05 as statistical significance.</detailed_description>
