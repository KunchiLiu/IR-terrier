	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare cardio-metabolic risk, glucose tolerance, and night time blood pressure between healthy control subjects and patients with adrenal insufficiency. No intervention will be administered and the study is observational only.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Circadian Function and Cardio-metabolic Risk in Adrenal Insufficiency</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We propose to use a case control design to test the main hypothesis that as compared to healthy control subjects matched for sex, age, adiposity and race/ethnicity, patients with adrenal insufficiency, whether primary or secondary, have disturbances of the circadian system that are associated with high day to day variability of sleep time as well as elevated markers of cardio-metabolic risk, including abnormal oral glucose tolerance and reduced nocturnal blood pressure dipping. A secondary hypothesis of the study is that adrenal insufficiency patients on a replacement regimen (as part of their standard of care ongoing treatment) that results in daytime cortisol profiles approximating the normal diurnal variation will have better cardio-metabolic function than adrenal insufficiency patients who have grossly abnormal cortisol profiles.</detailed_description>
