	<criteria>Signed and dated written informed consent. Male or female ≥ 18 years of age. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 or 1. Histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the small intestine that is advanced (not amenable to surgery) or metastatic (clinical stage IV). Note: Tumors such as ampullary carcinoma or duodenal cancer having intestinal features upon pathological examination are eligible. At least one prior systemic treatment (including neoadjuvant therapy) for adenocarcinoma of the small intestine, with intolerance to prior therapy, failure of the most recent therapy (of any line) or recurrent disease. At least one measurable lesion as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 criteria that has not been previously irradiated and which can be followed by CT or MRI. Adequate organ function including: Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 × 109/L Platelets ≥ 100 × 109/L Hemoglobin ≥ 9/g/dL (may have been transfused) Total serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN) Aspartate aminotransferase (AST/SGOT) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT/SGPT) ≤ 2.5 × ULN (or ≤ 5 × ULN if liver metastases are present) Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN or estimated creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min as calculated using the CockcroftGault (CG) equation Archival tissue [paraffin block(s) or unstained slides from paraffin block(s)] from the primary tumor and/or a metastatic site judged reasonably available prior to initiating treatment, or willingness to undergo fresh pretreatment tumor biopsy. (Prior to initiating treatment, the screening team must have documentation that an archival or fresh tumor specimen has been requested from a local or outside facility. However, physical possession of requested tissue or waiting for histological analysis or confirmation that an acquired specimen contains tumor tissue sufficient for analysis is not a requirement prior to initiating treatment.) If no archival tissue is available and patient consents to a fresh biopsy, but the patient's lesion is deemed inaccessible to safe biopsy, the patient will be allowed to enroll if otherwise eligible. Female patients of childbearing potential and male patients able to father children who have female partners of childbearing potential must agree to use at least two methods of acceptable contraception from 15 days prior to first trial treatment administration until at least 60 days after study participant's final dose of avelumab. Females of childbearing potential are defined as those who are not surgically sterile or postmenopausal (i.e. patient has not had a bilateral tubal ligation, a bilateral oophorectomy, or a complete hysterectomy; or has not been amenorrheic for 12 months without an alternative medical cause). Postmenopausal status in females under 55 years of age should be confirmed with a serum folliclestimulating hormone (FSH) level within laboratory reference range for postmenopausal women. Male patients able to father children are defined as those who are not surgically sterile (i.e. patient has not had a vasectomy). Serum pregnancy test (for females of childbearing potential) negative at screening. Reenrollment of a subject that has discontinued the study as a pretreatment screen failure (i.e. a consented patient who did not receive avelumab) is permitted. If reenrolled, the subject must be reconsented. Only the screening procedures performed outside of protocolspecified timing must be repeated. Prior therapy with antibody or drug specifically targeting T cell regulatory proteins, including but not limited to: Prior immunotherapy with IL2 or IFNα, or an antiPD1 (including nivolumab), antiPDL1, antiPDL2, antiCD137, or anticytotoxic Tlymphocyteassociated antigen4 (CTLA4) antibody (including ipilimumab), or any other antibody or drug specifically targeting Tcell costimulation or checkpoint pathways. Within 28 days before first dose of avelumab: Anticancer treatment, major surgery requiring general anesthesia, or the use of any investigational agent. Within 14 days before first dose of avelumab: Therapeutic or palliative radiation therapy. (Subjects receiving bisphosphonate or denosumab are eligible provided treatment was initiated at least 14 days before the first dose of avelumab.) Within 7 days before first dose of avelumab: Use of corticosteroids or immunosuppressive medication is exclusionary, except the following in the absence of active autoimmune disease: Subjects are permitted the use of corticosteroids with minimal systemic absorption (e.g. topical, ocular, intraarticular, intranasal, and inhaled); Systemic corticosteroids at physiologic doses ≤10 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent are permitted; Adrenal replacement steroid doses including doses &gt; 10 mg daily prednisone are permitted; A brief (less than 3 weeks) course of corticosteroids for prophylaxis (e.g. CT scan premedication against contrast dye allergy) or for treatment of nonautoimmune conditions (e.g. delayedtype hypersensitivity reaction caused by a contact allergen) is permitted. Previous malignant disease other than adenocarcinoma of the small intestine within the last 5 years, with the exception of basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or cervical carcinoma in situ considered curatively treated (i.e. complete remission achieved at least 2 years prior to first dose of avelumab AND additional therapy not required while receiving study treatment). All subjects with brain metastases, expect those meeting the following criteria: Brain metastases that have been treated locally and are clinically stable for at least 2 weeks prior to enrollment No ongoing neurological symptoms that are related to the brain localization of the disease (sequelae that are a consequence of the treatment of the brain metastases are acceptable. Subjects must be either off steroids or on a stable or decreasing dose of ≤ 10 mg daily prednisone (or equivalent) Receipt of any organ transplantation including allogeneic stemcell transplantation. Significant acute or chronic infections including, among others: Known history of testing positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Positive test for hepatitis B virus (HBV) surface antigen and/or confirmatory hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA (if antiHCV antibody tested positive). Active autoimmune disease with reasonable possibility of clinically significant deterioration when receiving an immunostimulatory agent: Subjects with Type 1 diabetes mellitus, vitiligo, psoriasis, hypo or hyperthyroid disease not requiring immunosuppressive treatment are eligible. Subjects requiring hormone replacement with corticosteroids are eligible if the steroids are administered only for the purpose of hormonal replacement and at doses ≤ 10 mg or 10 mg equivalent prednisone per day. Administration of steroids through a route known to result in a minimal systemic exposure (topical, intranasal, introocular, or inhalation) are acceptable. Interstitial lung disease that is symptomatic or which may interfere with the detection or management of suspected drugrelated pulmonary toxicity. Uncontrolled asthma [defined as having 3 or more of the following features of partially controlled asthma within 28 days prior to starting study treatment: Daytime symptoms more than twice per week, any limitation of activities, any nocturnal symptoms/awaking, need for reliever/rescue inhaler more than twice per week, or known lung function (PEF or FEV1) without administration of a bronchodilator that is &lt; 80% predicted or personal best (if known)]. Current symptomatic congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association &gt; class II), unstable cardiac arrhythmia requiring therapy (e.g. medication or pacemaker), unstable angina (e.g. new, worsening or persistent chest discomfort), or uncontrolled hypertension (systolic &gt; 160 mmHg or diastolic &gt; 100mmHg). Or any of the following occurring within 6 months (180 days) prior to first dose of avelumab: Myocardial infarction, coronary/peripheral artery bypass graft, cerebrovascular accident or transient ischemic attack. (Use of antihypertensive medication to control blood pressure is allowed.) Concurrent treatment with a nonpermitted drug. Requirement of anticoagulant therapy with oral vitamin K antagonists such as Coumadin (warfarin). Lowdose anticoagulants for the maintenance of patency in a central venous access device or the prevention of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism is allowed. Therapeutic use of low molecular weight heparin is allowed. Persisting toxicity related to prior therapy that has not reduced to Grade 1 [National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) version 4.03; however, alopecia and sensory neuropathy Grade ≤ 2 is acceptable. Known severe (Grade ≥ 3 NCICTCAE) hypersensitivity reactions to monoclonal antibodies, or history of anaphylaxis. Vaccination within 28 days of the first dose of avelumab and while on trial is prohibited, except for administration of inactivated vaccines (for example, inactivated influenza vaccine). Pregnant or breastfeeding females. Known alcohol or drug abuse. Prisoners or subjects who are involuntarily incarcerated. Known psychiatric condition, social circumstance, or other medical condition reasonably judged by the patient's study physician to unacceptably increase the risk of study participation; or to prohibit the understanding or rendering of informed consent or anticipated compliance with scheduled visits, treatment schedule, laboratory tests and other study requirements.</criteria>
