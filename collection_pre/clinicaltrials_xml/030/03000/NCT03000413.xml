	<brief_summary>Despite few scientific evidence that could support the use of ketamine in adult patients undergoing acute bronchospasm requiring mechanical ventilation (MV), ketamine is largely employed in this setting. The aim of this study is therefore assess more definitively the real benefit of using ketamine in patients with severe bronchospasm, requiring ICU stay and need for MV in order to establish or refute the use of this drug as "standard therapy" in these cases.</brief_summary>
