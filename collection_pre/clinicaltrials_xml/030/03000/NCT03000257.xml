	<brief_summary>This is an open-label, Phase I, dose-escalation study to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RPTD), maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of ABBV-181. The study will consist of 2 parts: ABBV-181 dose escalation and ABBV-181 dose expansion.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of ABBV-181 in Participants With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Participant must have an advanced solid tumor and must not be a candidate for surgical resection or other approved therapeutic regimen known to provide clinical benefit. For dose escalation, the participant may have been previously treated with a programmed cell death 1 (PDI) targeting agent. For dose expansion, the participant must be PDI/PDL1 targeting agent na√Øve. Participant has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 0 to 2. Participants have adequate bone marrow, renal, hepatic and coagulation function. Participants must have measurable or evaluable disease per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 in the dose escalation portion of the trial. Participants in the expansion cohort must have measurable disease per RECIST version 1.1 or disease evaluable by assessment of tumor antigens. Participant has received anticancer therapy including chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiation therapy, biologic, herbal therapy, or any investigational therapy within a period of 21 days, prior to the first dose of ABBV181. Participant has unresolved adverse events greater than or equal to grade 1 from prior anticancer therapy except for alopecia. Current or prior use of immunosuppressive medication within 14 days prior to the first dose (with certain exceptions). History of primary immunodeficiency, bone marrow transplantation, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, solid organ transplantation, or previous clinical diagnosis of tuberculosis. Confirmed positive test results for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), or participants with chronic or active hepatitis B or C. Participant has known history or inflammatory bowel disease, pneumonitis, or known uncontrolled metastases to the central nervous system (CNS) (with certain exceptions).</criteria>
