	<brief_summary>This study evaluates the safety and clinical benefits of a therapeutics approach of conditioning regimen Cyclophosphamide (Cy) + Thymoglobulin r (ATG) + Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor (G-CSF) followed by autologous Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantaion (HSCT) rescue in therapy refractory Crohn's disease. It will be counted adverse events, clinical and endoscopic condition at various short and long-term time points.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Autologous Unselected Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation for Refractory Crohn's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic, refractory inflammatory bowel disease that affects the entire digestive tract associated with intestinal and extra intestinal manifestations or other autoimmune diseases. Conventional therapy to Crohn's disease isolated or combination of anti-inflammatory, immunosuppressant and or biologic drugs/corticosteroids. This treatment beneffit the majority of patients. However, a proportion of patients fail to achieve complete and long term disease control and often require multiple intestinal surgeries with a risk of developing short bowel syndrome. Has been proposed Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT) to proportionate a lymphoablation and reset of the immune system as an alternative strategy to induce long term disease control in this high risk population. In this study, it´s accepted Crohn's patients not responsive to conventional therapy. First of all, will be evaluated safety, and the clinical outcome. The selected patients will be admmited at Bone Marrow Transplant (BMT) unit to mobilizing regimen were submitted to Cyclophosphamide (Cy) 60mg/kg and G-CSF 10mcg/kg day in the 5th day after Cy until harvest progenitor cells from peripheral blood by leukapheresis. After seven days of rest the conditioning regimen consists Cyclophosphamide 200mg/kg total dose for 4 days and globulin anti thymocyte rabbit 6,5mg/kg total dose for 4 days and methylprednisolone 500mg each day. The clinical course of patients with refractory Crohn´s disease will be evaluated to determine the efficacy of HSCT as a therapeutic tool, the adverse aspects of the procedure and clinical outcome and quality of life.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Age between 14 and 50 years (patients aged 50 70 can participate up to the principal investigators discretion). 2. Confirmed diagnosis of active Crohn's disease: Diagnosis of Crohn's disease based on typical radiological appearances and or typical histology at least 6 months prior to screening. Active disease at the time of registration to the trial, defined as *Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) &gt; 150, and ii)Two of the following: Harvey Bradshaw Index &gt; 4 Endoscopic evidence of active disease confirmed by histology Clear evidence of active small bowel Crohn's disease on Computed tomography (CT) or Magnetic Resonance (MR) enterography. 3. Unsatisfactory course despite immunosuppressive agents (usually azathioprine, methotrexate and two biologic agents ( usually infliximab, adalimumab and/or certolizumab) in addition to corticosteroids. Patients should have relapsing and refractory disease despite thiopurines, methotrexate and/or infliximab/adalimumab/certolizumab maintenance therapy or clear demonstration of intolerance / toxicity to these drugs. 4. Current problems unsuitable for surgery or patient at risk for developing short bowel syndrome. 5.
