	<brief_title>Prevention of Postoperative Pancreatic Fistulaby Somatostatin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prevention of pancreatic fistula remains a major challenge for surgeons, and various technical and pharmacological intervention have been investigated, with conflicting results. Despite several prospective studies, and metaanalyses, the prophylactic role on pancreatic fistula of octreotide, remains controversial, even if recommended for routine use in patients undergoing pancreatic resection. In view of recent result, the investigators can hypothesize that higher affinity for somatostatin-receptor lead to stronger pancreatic exocrine secretion inhibition, and better pancreatic fistula prevention. Consequently, continuous intravenous infusion of somatostatin-14, the natural peptide hormone, associated with 10 to 50 time stronger affinity with all somatostatin receptor, will be associated with a improved pancreatic fistula prevention compared to octreotide.</detailed_description>
