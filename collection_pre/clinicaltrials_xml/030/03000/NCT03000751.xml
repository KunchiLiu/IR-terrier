	<brief_summary>To explore variation in doses used for diagnostic CT by pooling radiation dose data across diverse healthcare delivery systems. To identify the barriers and facilitators to implementing successful dose optimization strategies and standardizing practice.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CT DOSE Collaboratory</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators are collecting radiation dose information on CT from across all collaborating health care facilities, and leading several different interventions to optimize dose across facilities. In addition to collecting the CT radiation dose data, and using these results to provide feedback to the collaborating health care facilities, they will be conducting surveys of several individuals at each site, including key informants, such as lead radiologists, technologists, and medical physicist, and radiology administrators.</detailed_description>
