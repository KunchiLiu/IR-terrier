	<brief_summary>Corneal abrasion (TCA) is the most common ophthalmic emergency disease, accounting for about 10% of the American ophthalmic emergency, accounting for 22% of the ophthalmic emergency in Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center. Clinical emergency treatment of TCA is relatively simple and effective, corneal epithelial damage can be recovered within 48 hours. However, about 25% TCA would be developed to the recurrence of exfoliation. Once the recurrence of TCA, the treatment would be more difficult and even cause blindness. Therefore, it is of great practical significance to prevent the recurrence of TCA. However, there is no effective methods to prevent recurrence of TCA. 0.3% sodium hyaluronate eye drops can effectively supplement the shortage of tear and promote repair of corneal epithelium. On this basis, the investigators hypotheses that 0.3% sodium hyaluronate eye drops can prevent the recurrence of TCA. So, investigators intend to test effectiveness of 0.3% sodium hyaluronate drops to prevent the recurrence of TCA by a prospective, single center, randomized, controlled pilot study. In this study, 60 patients with TCA were randomly divided into control group and sodium hyaluronate treatment group and observed one year.</brief_summary>
