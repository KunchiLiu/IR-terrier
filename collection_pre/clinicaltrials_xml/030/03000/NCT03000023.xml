	<brief_title>Anticipated and Perceived Benefits Following Hepatitis C Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study employs a mixed methods (qualitative and quantitative) pre-post study design utilizing in-depth qualitative interviews and patient reported outcome surveys. Pre-treatment surveys and interviews will be conducted before HCV therapy commences to understand all potential psychological, social, physical and medical consequences perceived to be related to HCV and the patients' anticipation (hope for) of improvements in these factors after viral eradication. Post-treatment surveys and interviews will occur 4 to 8 months after treatment ends to examine long-term treatment benefits, i.e., changes in HCV-related factors, such as symptoms, functioning, and health status.</detailed_description>
