	<detailed_description>To evaluate the effectiveness of Lingual Ring Splint For Management of Anterior Disc Displacement With Reduction. PICO P- Patient with symptomatic anterior disc displacement with reduction . I- use of Michigan splint C- use of anterior repositioning splint (ARS) . O- Clinical outcome. Pain relief and improvement of mouth opening , lateral excursion and protrusion Outcome: - 1ry outcome: Patients' subjective pain experience. Each patient will be asked to rate his or her current and worst pain intensity on numerical rating scale (NRS) of 0-10 with zero being no pain and ten corresponds to the worst pain that the patient ever had. - 2ry outcome: 1. Maximum mouth opening (MMO). Assessment of MMO will be performed by measuring the distance in mm between the incisal edges of the upper and lower central incisors using a ruler. 2. lateral excursion . Assessment of lateral excursion will be performed by measuring the distance in mm between midline of upper and lower jaws 3. protrusion. The distance in mm from the incisal edge of the maxillary central incisor to the incisor edge of the mandibular incisor will measured in the maximum protruded position.</detailed_description>
