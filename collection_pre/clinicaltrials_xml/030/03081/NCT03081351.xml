	<brief_title>Extended Retroperitoneal Lymphadenectomy and Nerve Plexus Clearance Versus Standard Lymphadenectomy in Pancreaticoduodenectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this clinical trial is for assessing the survival benefit of extended lymphadenectomy and nerve clearance versus standard lymphadenectomy in pancreaticoduodenectomy of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. And we will focus on the R0 resection using LEEPP(Leeds Pathology Protocol) methods to check whether the tumor is eradicated or not.</detailed_description>
