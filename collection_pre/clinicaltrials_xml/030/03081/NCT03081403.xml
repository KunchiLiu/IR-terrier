	<brief_summary>Sensitive skin is a common problem, with 50% of women and 30% of men in Europe feel they have sensitive skin. The Quantitative sensory testing (QST) is a physico-psychic method that uses gradients stimuli of different modalities to measure a subjective somatosensory response. This allows to characterize sensory dysfunction by assessing the participation of small and large nerve fibers. The aim of this project is to characterize the presence or absence of a neurological disorder in patients with sensitive skin. This discovery would be a decisive argument to reinforce the suspicion that sensitive skins is linked to a small fiber neuropathy.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Sensitive skin is a common problem, with 50% of women and 30% of men in Europe feel they have sensitive skin.
