	<brief_title>NBI Does Not Increase ADR Compared to HD White Light Colonoscopy in Screening and Surveillance Colonoscopies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: Despite recent advances in endoscopic technology adenoma miss rate still is up to 20% and contributes to the occurrence of interval cancers. Therefore, improved imaging modalities have been introduced to increase adenoma detection rate (ADR) during screening and surveillance colonoscopies. Recently, narrow band imaging (NBI; Exera II series, Olympus Corporation) was not significantly better than high definition white light colonoscopy (WLC) for the detection of patients with colorectal polyps, or colorectal adenomas1. However, Olympus' current Exera III series is characterized by better illumination of the bowel lumen and may be associated with a higher ADR than high definition WLC. Methods: Investigators performed a prospective evaluation in patients referred to the Department of Interdisciplinary Endoscopy at Jena University Hospital for screening or surveillance colonoscopy between January and November 2015 in daily clinical practice. Colonoscopy was performed by use of HD-WLC or HD-NBI upon withdrawal of the colonoscope (Exera III series, Olympus Corporation).</detailed_description>
