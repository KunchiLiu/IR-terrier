	<brief_summary>This is an international, multi-center, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical study evaluating the efficacy and safety of ribociclib with endocrine therapy as an adjuvant treatment in patients with hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative, intermediate risk breast cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Adjuvant Ribociclib With Endocrine Therapy in Hormone Receptor+/HER2- Intermediate Risk Early Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>While adjuvant endocrine therapy (ET) is effective in reducing risk of recurrence in patients with hormone receptor (HR)-positive early breast cancer (EBC), recurrences are still common, especially in patients with unfavorable clinical, pathological and/or molecular features. Ribociclib, a CDK4/6 inhibitor, demonstrated clinical efficacy with tolerable toxicity when added to ET in patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of addition of ribociclib to standard adjuvant ET on invasive disease-free survival in patients with HR+, HER2- intermediate-risk EBC.</detailed_description>
