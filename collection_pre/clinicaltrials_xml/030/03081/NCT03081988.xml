Prospective case-control study: RNA sequencing &amp; miRNA microarray - naive esophageal cancer patients who have a plan to receive concomitant chemo-radiotherapy - acquirement of tissue, blood, clinical information - isolation of RNA, DNA, serum database of clinical &amp; demographic information ***Analysis of mRNA sequencing / miRNA sequencing**** first analysis of RNA sequencing: bioinformatician second analysis of RNA sequencing: principle investigator 3. Experimental set for qPCR (esophageal tissue) study group 4. TMA for screened exon gene 5. validation set for qPCR (esophageal tissue) 6. follow-up of circulating miRNA in blood (baseline blood &amp; post-CCRT blood 3M, 6M, 12M) 7. Prediction model for CCRT response in esophageal Cancer based on clinical and molecular factors 8. Validate the prediction model.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1. Retrospective review of old patients - Analysis of prediction factors for concomitant chemo-radiotherapy in locally advanced and advanced esophageal cancer from 2005 to 2015 Study Group 1. non responder 2. CR but recurrence 3. CR and survival loner than 2 years 2. Prospective case-control study: RNA sequencing &amp; miRNA microarray : naive esophageal cancer patients who have a plan to receive concomitant chemo-radiotherapy - acquirement of tissue, blood, clinical information - isolation of RNA, DNA, serum database of clinical &amp; demographic information study group 1. non-responder (N=14) 2. Complete Remission (N=14) For considering the drop rate, 2-fold screening ***Analysis of mRNA sequencing / miRNA sequencing**** first analysis of RNA sequencing: bioinformatician second analysis of RNA sequencing: principle investigator 3) Experimental set for qPCR (esophageal tissue) study group 1. non-responder (N=40) 2. complete remission (N=40) 4) TMA for screened exon gene 5) validation set for qPCR (esophageal tissue) new esophageal cancer set 1. non-responder (N=30) 2. complete remission (N=30) 6) follow-up of circulating miRNA in blood (baseline blood &amp; post-CCRT blood 3M, 6M, 12M) 7) Prediction model for CCRT response in esophageal Cancer based on clinical and molecular factors Test several combination models 1) gene + gene combination, 2) gene + clinical information combination, 3) gene + gene + clinical information combination 8) Validate the prediction model.</detailed_description>
