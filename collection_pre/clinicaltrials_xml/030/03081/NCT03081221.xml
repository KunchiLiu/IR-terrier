	<brief_title>Verification of Endotracheal Tube Placement With Ultrasonography (USG)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to verification of Endotracheal Tube Placement with Ultrasonography (USG). In this study, using of USG during verification will be compared with traditional method. In traditional methods, after intubation, verification of endotracheal tube placement is done via to monitoring of thorax movement, checking of tube fogging, auscultation of lung and stomach, capnography and radiography. In USG method, after intubation, verification of endotracheal tube placement is done via to using linear transducer. The probe will be placed transversely and longitudinally on the neck and in front of cricoid cartilage. So, collected all data from two method will be compared.</detailed_description>
