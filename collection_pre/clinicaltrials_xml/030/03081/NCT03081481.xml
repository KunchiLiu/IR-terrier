	<brief_title>Intraprostatic PRX302 Injection to Treat Localised Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A multi-centre, open label, phase IIb study, evaluating the safety, tolerability and efficacy of a targeted intraprostatic focal administration in development. The study will treat approximately 40 men who meet the eligibility criteria, and give written consent. Safety and tolerability will be assessed post-treatment over 26 weeks. Efficacy will be assessed by biopsy and imaging (mpMRI) at 24 weeks.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Life expectancy ≥ 10 years. Serum prostatespecific antigen (PSA) ≤ 15ng/mL. A histologically proven, clinically significant lesion visible on mpMRI (magnetic resonance imaging) that is accessible to PRX302 transperineal injection. Radiological stage T1T2 N0 Mx/M0 disease. Targeted prostate biopsy within 6 months prior to dosing, with a clinically significant lesion correlating with an mpMRI visible lesion. Previous radiation therapy to the pelvis. Androgen suppression or antiandrogen therapy within the 12 months prior to dosing, for prostate cancer. Use of 5alpha reductase inhibitor within the 3 months prior to dosing. Evidence of metastatic disease or nodal disease outside the prostate on bone scan or crosssectional imaging. Inability to tolerate transrectal ultrasound (TRUS). Known allergy to latex or gadolinium (Gd). Prior rectal surgery preventing insertion of the TRUS probe. Any previous ablative procedures performed on the prostate, e.g., electroporation, radiofrequency ablation, highintensity focused ultrasound (HIFU), cryosurgery, photochemical, thermal or microwave therapy to treat cancer of the prostate. Unable to have pelvic MRI scanning (severe claustrophobia, permanent cardiac pacemaker, metallic implant, etc., likely to contribute significant artifact to images).</criteria>
