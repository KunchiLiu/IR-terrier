	<brief_summary>The risk of recurrence after hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is very high. Having a predictive marker of early recurrence (ER) would be desirable to personalize the follow-up and possibly develop new targeted therapy. The aim of this study was to test the expression of Filamin A (FLNA) in a cohort of patients operated for HCC.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>FLNA in HCC Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A consecutive cohort of resected HCC patients will be analyzed. Several different prognostic factors, including FLNA expression, will be tested against the risk of ER. FLNA expression will be analyzed with immunohistochemistry in the intra-tumoral and extra-tumoral tissue compartments using a dedicated tissue microarray.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The inclusion criteria were represented by the histological positivity for HCC with complete clinical, surgical, pathological, and followup data. Patients preoperatively treated with chemotherapy or transarterial therapy were excluded. Similarly, patients operated for recurrent HCC or with nonradical surgery or with missing data were excluded.</criteria>
