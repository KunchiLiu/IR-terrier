	<brief_summary>The task of caring for an individual with Alzheimer's disease is often carried out by elderly caregivers who, due to their motor and psychosocial alterations due to the aging process, may also be exposed to the development of the frailty syndrome. Therefore, it is necessary to promote the engagement and adherence of these caregivers in physical activities. In this sense, circle dances have received attention, either as a modality of physical activity or therapy, and, although little studied, seem to be an appropriate type of intervention for the elderly caregivers. Thus, this study aims to evaluate the effect of 12 weeks of circle dances on cognitive, psychological, physical and frailty-related variables in elderly caregivers of Alzheimer's patients. It is expected that the practice of circle dances will be able to reduce stress levels and depressive symptoms of elderly caregivers; Reduce and / or maintain the perception of care overload and improve some functional components such as: mobility; balance; muscle strength of legs; walking speed; fatigue and level of physical activity.</brief_summary>
