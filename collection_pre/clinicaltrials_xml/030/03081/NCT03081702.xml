	<brief_summary>This is a phase I/II study to find the highest dose of hydroxychloroquine that can be given safely with itraconazole in patients with advanced platinum-resistant epithelial ovarian cancer. The study will also determine the safety, tolerability, and initially determine whether the combination is useful in the treatment of patients with advanced platinum-resistant epithelial ovarian cancer.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Aged 18 years or older. Histologically or cytologically confirmed epithelial ovarian cancer. Platinumresistant or refractory disease defined as a radiological or clinical progression less than six months after having finished platinumbased chemotherapy. ECOG performance status equal to or less than 1. Have clinically or radiographically documented measurable disease. All systemic therapy must have been completed 4 weeks or greater prior to enrollment with radiologic evidence of radiological disease progression. Life expectancy should be more than 3 months. Receiving any medications or substances that are inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 are ineligible. Acceptable laboratory requirements within 7 days prior to enrollment Treated and asymptomatic brain metastases are eligible. Patients that received palliative radiation (for brain metastases) are eligible if they have been asymptomatic for at least 2 weeks with use of maintenance steroid therapy, and last received radiation at least 4 weeks prior to start of therapy. Have the ability to understand and willing to sign a written informed consent document. Have not recovered (grade 1 or less) from adverse events related to previous treatments are excluded with the exception of alopecia and lymphopenia. Peripheral sensory neuropathy must be at grade 2 or less. Have any other prior malignancy from which the patient has been disease free for less than 3 years, with the exception of adequately treated and cured basal or squamous cell skin cancer, superficial bladder cancer, carcinoma in situ of any site or any other cancer. History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to itraconazole or hydroxychloroquine. Known G6PD deficiency due to the risk of hemolytic anemia with the use of hydroxychloroquine. Known retinopathy due to the risk of worsening retinopathy with hydroxychloroquine. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic or asymptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements. Chronic Hepatitis B or hepatitis C infections should be excluded because of potential effects on hepatic function and/ or drug interactions. Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection. Already have a clinical indication for treatment with itraconazole (e.g. chronic candidiasis or other fungal infection) or hydroxychloroquine (e.g. lupus).</criteria>
