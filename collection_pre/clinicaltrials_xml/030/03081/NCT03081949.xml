	<brief_summary>Peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) is a global disease with significant morbidity and mortality, and Nigeria probably has the highest burden of the disease in the world. Unfortunately, much about the disease including its aetiology, epidemiology and treatment is not yet well described. This will be a prospective, national, multicenter cohort study, conducted in centres in Nigeria. It is expected that approximately 500 patients with PPCM and 500 apparently healthy pregnant women will be recruited over a 6-month period with follow‐up at 3-monthly intervals for 18 months.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) is a global disease with significant morbidity and mortality, and Nigeria probably has the highest burden of the disease in the world. Unfortunately, much about the disease including its aetiology, epidemiology and treatment is not yet well described. This will be a prospective, national, multicenter cohort study, conducted in centres in Nigeria. It is expected that approximately 500 patients with PPCM and 500 apparently healthy pregnant women will be recruited over a 6-month period with follow‐up at 3-monthly intervals for 18 months. The objectives of the study are: i. To describe the burden and demographic, social and clinical characteristics of PPCM in Nigeria. ii. To describe the ventricular remodelling and outcomes (rehospitalisation rate, cardio-embolic events and survival) of PPCM in Nigeria. Sub-study: iii. To study the relationship between selenium deficiency, oxidative stress and PPCM in Nigeria. iv. To describe the prevalence of selenium deficiency and its relationship with cardiac function in apparently healthy pregnant women in Nigeria. v. To study the impact of sodium selenite supplementation on cardiac function among selenium deficient PPCM patients who have not recovered left ventricular function at 6 months after the diagnosis. This will be the largest systematic evaluation of PPCM in Nigeria, and it is hoped that the information will assist in developing locally applicable treatment guidelines, policies and interventions for this seemingly deadly disease.</detailed_description>
