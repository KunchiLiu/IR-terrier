	<brief_summary>Patients eligible for this study have a type of blood cancer called T-cell leukemia or lymphoma (lymph gland cancer). The body has different ways of fighting infection and disease. No one way seems perfect for fighting cancers. This research study combines two different ways of fighting disease, antibodies and T cells, hoping that they will work together. Antibodies are types of proteins that protect the body from bacterial and other diseases. T cells, also called T lymphocytes, are special infection-fighting blood cells that can kill other cells including tumor cells. Both antibodies and T cells have been used to treat patients with cancers; they have shown promise, but have not been strong enough to cure most patients. T lymphocytes can kill tumor cells but there normally are not enough of them to kill all the tumor cells. Some researchers have taken T cells from a person's blood, grown more of them in the laboratory and then given them back to the person. The antibody used in this study is called anti-CD5. It first came from mice that have developed immunity to human leukemia. This antibody sticks to T-cell leukemia or lymphoma cells because of a substance on the outside of these cells called CD5. CD5 antibodies have been used to treat people with T-cell leukemia and lymphoma. For this study, anti-CD5 has been changed so that instead of floating free in the blood it is now joined to the T cells. When an antibody is joined to a T cell in this way it is called a chimeric receptor. In the laboratory, the investigators have also found that T cells work better if proteins that stimulate T cells are also added, such as one called CD28. Adding the CD28 makes the cells grow better and last longer in the body, thus giving the cells a better chance of killing the leukemia or lymphoma cells. In this study investigators are going to attach the CD5 chimeric receptor with CD28 added to it to the patient's T cells. The investigators will then test how long the cells last. These CD5 chimeric receptor T cells with CD28 are investigational products not approved by the Food and Drug Administration .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>To make the T cells the investigators will take the patient's blood and stimulate it with growth factors to make the T cells grow. To get the CD5 antibody and CD28 to attach to the surface of the T cell, investigators insert the antibody gene into the T cell. This is done with a virus called a retrovirus that has been made for this study and will carry the antibody gene into the T cell. This virus also helps investigators find the T cells in the patient's blood after they are injected. Because the patient will have received cells with a new gene in them the patient will be followed for a total of 15 years to see if there are any long term side effects of gene transfer. When the patient is enrolled on this study, they will be assigned a dose of CD5 chimeric receptor-T cells. Several studies suggest that the infused T cells need room to be able to proliferate (grow) and accomplish their functions and that this may not happen if there are too many other T cells in circulation . Because of that, the patient will receive two chemotherapy medications prior to receiving the CD5 chimeric receptor-T cells. One medication is called cyclophosphamide and the other fludarabine. The patient will receive 3 daily doses of each drug, ending at least one day before the patient receives the chimeric receptor-T cells. These drugs will decrease the numbers of the patient's own T cells before the CD5 chimeric receptor T cells are infused and also will help decrease the number of other cells that may interfere with the chimeric receptor-T cells working well. Although we do not expect any effect on the patient's tumor with the doses that the patient will receive, these drugs are part of many regimens that are used to treat leukemia or lymphoma. The patient will be given an injection of cells into the vein through an IV at the assigned dose. The injection will take from 1 to 10 minutes. Before the patient receives the injection, they may be given a dose of Benadryl and Tylenol. The treatment will be given by the Center for Cell and Gene Therapy at Texas Children 's Hospital or Houston Methodist Hospital. The patient will be followed in the clinic after the injection for up to 3 hours, and the patient will have to remain locally for at least 3 weeks after the infusion. If the patient experiences any side effects, they may have to be hospitalized for evaluation and management. If after a 4-6 week evaluation period after the infusion, the patient has achieved a complete response (measured by bone marrow or radiology scans), the patient's primary oncology doctors may decide the patient should proceed to bone marrow transplant, at which time the patient will be removed from the treatment portion of the study. If after a 4-6 week evaluation period after the infusion, the patient seems to be experiencing a benefit (confirmed by radiological and/or bone marrow studies, physical exam and/or symptoms) but has not achieved a complete response (and are therefore not suitable to proceed to bone marrow transplant), the patient may be able to receive up to three additional doses of the T cells if the patient wishes, and if the patient has not experienced any serious side effects from the cells. These additional infusions would be at least 4-6 weeks apart and at the same dose level the patient received the first time or a lower dose. The patient may receive cyclophosphamide and fludarabine with the additional doses of T cells . Before being treated, the patient will receive a series of standard medical tests: Physical exam and History; Blood tests to measure blood cells, kidney and liver function; Pregnancy test for female patients who are of child bearing potential; Measurements of the patient's tumor by scans and/or bone marrow studies The patient will also receive standard medical tests when they are getting the infusions and after: Physical exams and History; Blood tests to measure blood cells, kidney and liver function; Measurements of the patient's tumor by scans and/or bone marrow studies 6 weeks after the infusion To learn more about the way the CD5 chimeric receptor-T cells are working and how long they last in the body, extra blood will be drawn. The total amount on any day is about 10 teaspoons (50 mL) or no more than 3 mL per 2.2 pounds body weight in children. This volume is considered safe but may be decreased if the patient is anemic. This blood may be drawn from a central line if the patient has one. Blood will be taken before the chemotherapy drugs, several hours after the T cell infusion, at 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks (optional), 4 weeks, 6 weeks and 8 weeks (optional) after the infusion, at 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, at 1 year, every 6 months for 4 years, then yearly for a total of 15 years.</detailed_description>
