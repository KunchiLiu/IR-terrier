	<brief_title>PD-1 Knockout Engineered T Cells for Advanced Esophageal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a phase â…¡ clinical study of ex-vivo knocked-out, expanded, and selected PD-1 knockout-T cells from autologous origin. 21 advanced esophageal cancer patients are planned to receive two cycles of PD-1 knockout engineered T cells treatment. Biomarkers and immunological markers are collected and analyzed as well.</detailed_description>
