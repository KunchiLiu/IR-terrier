	<brief_summary>This is a Phase I open-label dose escalation study of a single infusion of FATE-NK100 and a short course of subcutaneous interleukin-2 (IL-2) administered after lymphodepleting chemotherapy (CY/FLU) in subjects with refractory or relapsed acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). FATE-NK100 is a natural killer (NK) cell product that is enriched for NK cells with an "adaptive", or human cytomegalovirus (CMV)-induced, phenotype. The NK cell product is comprised of peripheral blood (PB) leukocytes sourced from a related donor (HLA-haploidentical or better but not fully HLA-matched) that is seropositive for cytomegalovirus (CMV+), and enriched for adaptive NK cells by depletion of CD3+ (T-lymphocytes) and CD19+ (B-lymphocytes) cells followed by ex-vivo culture expansion.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>≥18 but ≤ 70 years of age Diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and meets one of the following disease criteria: Primary induction failure: De Novo AML: no CR after 2, 3 or 4 induction attempts with high dose chemotherapy Secondary AML (from MDS or treatment related): no CR after 1, 2 or 3 cycles of high dose chemotherapy Relapsed: Not in CR after 1 or 2 cycles of standard reinduction therapy *** For patients &gt; 60 years of age, the minimum of 1 cycle of standard chemotherapy is not required. Available HLAmatched or better but not fully HLAmatched (2/4 or 3/4 antigens) related donor (aged 12 to 75 years) with donor/recipient match based on a minimum of intermediate resolution DNA based Class I typing of the A and B locus who is CMV seropositive. Karnofsky Performance Status ≥ 60% Adequate organ function within 14 days of study registration (28 days for pulmonary and cardiac) defined as: Creatinine: Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 50 mL/min/1.73m^2 per current institutional calculation formula Hepatic: AST and ALT ≤ 3 x upper limit of institutional normal Pulmonary Function: oxygen saturation ≥ 90% on room air; PFT's required only if symptomatic or prior known impairment must have pulmonary function &gt;50% corrected DLCO and FEV1 Cardiac Function: LVEF ≥ 40% by echocardiography or MUGA, no uncontrolled angina, severe uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmias, or electrocardiographic evidence of acute ischemia or active conduction system abnormalities Able to be off prednisone or other immunosuppressive medications for at least 3 days prior to FATENK100 cell infusion (excluding preparative regimen premedications) Sexually active females of child bearing potential and males with partners of child bearing potential must agree to use effective contraception during therapy and for 4 months after completion of therapy Voluntary written consent prior to the performance of any research related procedures Prior hematopoietic stem cell transplant for AM Myocardial Infraction (MI) within the previous 6 months Acute leukemias of ambiguous lineage Pregnant or breastfeeding The agents used in this study include those that fall under Pregnancy Category D have known teratogenic potential. Women of child bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test at screening History of or known active CNS involvement with AML Active autoimmune disease requiring systemic immunosuppressive therapy History of severe asthma and currently on chronic systemic medications (mild asthma requiring inhaled steroids only is eligible) New or progressive pulmonary infiltrates on screening chest Xray or chest CT scan unless cleared for study by Pulmonary. Infiltrates attributed to infection must be stable/improving (with associated clinical improvement) after 1 week of appropriate therapy (4 weeks for presumed or documented fungal infections). Uncontrolled bacterial, fungal or viral infections including HIV1/2 or active hepatitis C/B chronic asymptomatic viral hepatitis is allowed Received any investigational agent within the 14 days before the start of study treatment (1st dose of fludarabine)</criteria>
