	<brief_summary>This is a small observational study aimed at observing differences in platelet function in HIV patients on abacavir versus tenofovir based anti-HIV drugs. There is some correlation between platelet activation and cardiovascular disease- this study will act as a pilot to see if platelet activation among abacavir users may explain the correlation between abacavir and cardiovascular disease in HIV positive patients. This study will enroll 44 participants total; 22 on abacavir-based treatment, 22 on tenofovir-based treatment. There is only one study visit which includes a blood draw, physical assessment, and review of medical history.</brief_summary>
