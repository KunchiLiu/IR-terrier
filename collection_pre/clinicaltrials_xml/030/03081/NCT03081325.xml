	<brief_summary>Recurrent spontaneous abortion(RSA) and repeated implantation failure (RIF) during IVF-ET severely affects IVF live birth rate and patient's health.The specific etiology contains chromosomal abnormalities, reproductive anatomical abnormalities, endocrine disorders, reproductive system infections, autoimmune and environmental factors. However there are still 50% to 60% RSA which don't have a clear cause, called unexplained recurrent spontaneous abortion (URSA), mainly related to immune factors.Among various treatments,lymphocytes active immunotherapy is the most common treatment method, and its clinical efficacy is widely recognized although its action mechanism is not clear so far.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Preliminary Study About Recurrent Spontaneous Abortion and Repeated Implantation Failure IVF-ET Patients Treated by Active Immunotherapy With Small Amount of Lymphocytes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The main mechanism of active immunotherapy includes upregulating Th2-type cytokines, downregulating Th1-type cytokines, making Th1 / Th2 shift to Th2, inducing maternal serum IL-6 and sIL6R, PIBF, EGF; inducing the expression of Fas / Fasl on lymphocyte surface; increasing the proportion of CD8 + cells, Th2-type cells and CD + CD25 + Treg cells, decreasing the activity of CD56 + CD16 + NK cell and so on.The purpose of this study is to observe the treatment effects of active immunotherapy on RSA and RIF patients. What's more,we will used flow cytometry, and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) methods to characterize Th1/Th2 and Th17/Treg cell populations after immunotherapy,ecpecting to find out the exact molecule mechanism of immunotherapy with paternal or third party lymphocytes.</detailed_description>
