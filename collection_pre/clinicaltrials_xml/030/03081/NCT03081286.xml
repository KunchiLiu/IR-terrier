	<brief_title>Treatment of Postmastectomy Pain Syndrome With Fat Grafting</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Several studies have suggested that fat grafting can alleviate pain in post mastectomy pain syndrome. These studies however have either been in the form of case series or unblinded studies with great risk of bias. It is believed that fat grafting with its content of adipose-derived stem cells can modulate the scar tissue upon grafting and hereby decrease pain. In this study patients will be randomized to either fat grafting or a sham procedure where they undergo the same liposuction but no fat grafting, only injection of saline instead of fat.</detailed_description>
