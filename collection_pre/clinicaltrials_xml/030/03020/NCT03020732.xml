	<brief_summary>Platelet concentrates(PC) are used in the field of periodontology and implantology for the content necessary key cells and growth factors to accelerate healing and to provide regeneration. Concentrated Growth Factors(CGF) is defined as an innovative method or a new generation PC. The purpose of this clinical study was to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of Concentrated Growth Factor(CGF) membrane with coronally advanced flap(CAF) procedure's and subepithelial connective tissue graft(SCTG) with CAF in the treatment of multiple Miller class I gingival recessions (GR).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gingival Recession Treatment With Concentrated Growth Factor(CGF)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CGF is defined as an innovative method to produce platelet rich fibrin(PRF) or a new generation platelet concentrate(PC).The rotational speed of the centrifuge machine used in CGF, varies between 2400-3000 rpm. The variability of the rotation speed during centrifugation allows a fibrin matrix that larger, more intensive and includes more growth factors than PRF. Some studies have been reported that CGF have an inducing effect on periodontal ligament stem cells for osteogenic differentiation and clinically provides new bone formation for the sinus augmentation. In literature, there is only one clinical research associated with multiple gingival recession defects treatment. It showed that CGF with CAF surgery increases keratinized gingiva weight and thickness and it maybe prevents post-operative relapse for CAF. PC has also been mentioned to be effective in to increase the width of keratinized tissue with providing root coverage and it may reduce early post-surgical complications, and accelerate wound healing in systematic review. In the treatment of isolated or multiple gingival recession, PRF and SCTG with CAF procedures have been reported to similar root coverage. PRF can be used as an alternative method for SCTG .CGF and PRF have similar composition. However higher resistance and viscosity of CGF may protect growth factors from proteolysis better than PRF. There is any comparative study for CGF and SCTG in literature in terms of clinically or patient related parameters. Therefore, the purpose of this clinical study is to evaluate the clinical efficacy of CGF in combination with CAF in the treatment multiple gingival recession's defects, and to compare SCTG in combination with CAF. It is also aimed to asses and compare postoperative pain and soft tissue healing.</detailed_description>
