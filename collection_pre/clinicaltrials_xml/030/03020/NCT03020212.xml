	<detailed_description>A clinical, prospective, randomized controlled trial to determine the effect of prescribing oxygen in a group of COPD patients with PaO2 ≥50 and ≤55 mmHg who do not have erythrocytosis or pulmonary hypertension on echocardiogram (which are considered manifestations of chronic hypoxia). It will be included 220 patients of the Fundación Neumológica Colombiana living in Bogotá who accept their participation by signing an informed consent. The subjects will be randomly assigned to receive or not LTOT and they will be followed for 30 months. At baseline and then at 10, 20 and 30 months, they will be clinically evaluated with arterial blood gases, pulse oximetry, echocardiography, spirometry with bronchodilator, diffusion capacity, quality of life (SGRQ), neurocognitive performance (MMSE) and six minutes walk test. The primary outcome will evaluate the ratio of occurrence of erythrocytosis or pulmonary hypertension. Secondary outcomes will be evaluated quality of life, lung function, neurocognitive performance and exercise tolerance by comparing the groups with and without LTOT.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Men and women 40 years or more. Diagnosis of COPD defined by FEV1 / FVC &lt;LLN (Lower limit of normal value) and significant exposure to cigarette ≥ 10 packs / year or woodsmoke ≥ 10 years. PaO2 ≥50 and ≤55 mmHg. No clinical signs of cor pulmonale Clinically stable COPD defined as no exacerbations in the last three months. Signature of informed consent. Paraclinical findings of chronic hypoxemia and pulmonary hypertension: Hematocrit ≥ 55%. Pulmonary hypertension (PH) defined by transthoracic echocardiography systolic pulmonary artery pressure &gt; 40 mmHg or indirect signs of PH. Use of oxygen&gt; 12 hours a day for more than three months in the last year. Comorbidities not controlled or deemed medically that can contribute to mortality during the study followup. Plan of transfer of residence outside of Bogota Medical, psychiatric, social and administrative conditions that define high probability of poor adherence to therapy with oxygen.
