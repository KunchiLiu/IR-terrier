	<brief_summary>Invasive hemodynamic monitoring in advanced heart failure patients is a relative new option. In order to investigate the impact of remote telemonitoring of pulmonary artery pressures on mortality and morbidity in a routine clinical setting in germany, the investigators initiated this Frankfurt registry.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of Longterm Outcome of New York Heart Association Class III Heart Failure Patients Receiving Telemonitoring Using a Pulmonary Artery Pressure Sensor System (CardioMEMS)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All patients who receive invasive hemodynamic monitoring using a pulmonary artery pressure sensor (CardioMEMS device) are offered participation in the registry. Routine heart-failure parameters, lab values, medication and QoL as obtained on the regular outpatients visits in the department are entered into a registry-specific database. The investigators plan to asses the impact of telemonitoring on mortality, morbidity and QoL as well as on Guideline-recommended heart failure medication. In addition, it is planned to quantify the input in person time for telemonitoring.</detailed_description>
