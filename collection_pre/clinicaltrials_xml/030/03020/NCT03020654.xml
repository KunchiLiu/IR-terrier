	<brief_summary>This study investigates the use of virtual environments presented on a head mounted display for the rehabilitation of those suffering with visual vertigo. The control group and treatment groups will be presented with two different sets of environments and be given the same head and eye exercises to complete within the environment. They will also be provided with at home exercises to complete.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Use of Virtual Reality for the Treatment of Visual Vertigo.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Visual vertigo occurs after the balance system suffers damage (e.g after a viral infection such as labyrinthitis). This causes an over-reliance on the eyes to maintain balance which causes disorientation in busy environments such as the supermarket. The treatment involves trying to desensitise the individual to visually stimulating situations. Further head and eye exercises are completed alongside the exposure to overcome the damage done to the balance system.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Those who have been diagnosed with visual vertigo and have scored a significant level on the Situational Characteristic Questionnaire (over 0.74 as per Pavlou et al., 2006). Those with or under investigation for epilepsy. Those who have been determined to have no or limited balance function in both ears. Those with reduced visual acuity that will leave them unable to view the 3D effects of the head mounted display. Those with severe mental health disorders e.g. psychosis, paranoid disorders, bipolar disorder or a history of substance abuse. Severe neck pain/ restricted movement. Previous treatment for visual vertigo. Those with an fluctuating vestibular disorder such as Ménière's disease or vestibular migraine. Those with untreated Benign Paroxymal Positional Vertigo (BPPV). Those with a significant brain injury, or head injury that results in a central vestibular disorder. Those with an arrhythmia.</criteria>
