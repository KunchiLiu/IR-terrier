	<brief_summary>Malignant ascites is a severe complication of many types of human cancer. Animal and clinical analyses have shown that angiogenesis plays a critical role in the formation of malignant ascites. Therefore, drugs such as apatinib that target angiogenesis may control the development of malignant ascites. The study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of apatinib in patients with refractory malignant ascites.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Clinical Trial With Apatinib for Subjects With Refractory Malignant Ascites</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of apatinib in patients with refractory malignant ascites. Patients with performance status 0 or 1 were assigned to 850mg group and patients with performance status 2 were assigned to 500mg group continually until disease progression or intolerable toxicity or patients withdrawal of consent, and the sample size is 120 individuals.</detailed_description>
