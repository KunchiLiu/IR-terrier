	<brief_title>Comparison of Blood Loss in Using vs Not Using Placental Cord Drainage After Spontaneous Vaginal Delivery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The patients will prospectively randomized equally into two groups (100 each in the study and control groups). Group-A (Study group)—Placental blood was drained. Group-B (Control group)—Placental blood was not drained. In all the patients detailed medical and obstetric history will taken. In each patient, the pre-delivery pulse rate, blood pressure, and Hb gm% will noted. Immediately after vaginal delivery, after clamping and cutting the cord—the cord will unclamped and the blood will drained until the flow ceased. In the control group, the clamped cord will not released. Blood lost in the third stage of labour will measured by collecting the blood measuring bag.</detailed_description>
