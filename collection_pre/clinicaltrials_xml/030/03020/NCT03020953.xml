	<brief_summary>Purpose: to study the effect of estrogen replacement on muscle hypertrophy in response to 12 weeks resistance training in postmenopausal women Hypothesis: Transdermal administration of 17-β estradiol enhance the anabolic effect of resistance training on muscle mass, strength in postmenopausal women Primary outcome: Muscle hypertrophy (muscle CSA, muscle fiber type specific CSA) Secondary outcome: Messenger RiboNucleic Acid (mRNA)(real-time PCR), protein (western blotting), satellite cell proliferation and activation, Strength, functional test, muscle protein synthese. Design: Two groups of healthy postmenopausal women (½-5 years after menopause) who have not performed regular resistance exercise (&lt;1 times per week) the last two years. Randomized, controlled intervention study +/- transdermal administration of estrogen (17-β estradiol). Both groups perform 12 weeks of supervised progressive resistance training (3/week) aiming to induce muscle hypertrophy in the legs.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Postmenopausal women, more than 6 months, but less than 5 years since last menstruation. Less than 2 hours exercise with moderate to high intensity per week the last year, no regular resistance exercise the last 2 years (less than 5 exercise bouts during the last year) No previous or present lower limb injuries which may hinder participation in strength training No use of medicine which may influence the adaptation to strength training such as regular use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs and use of statins, no muscle Joint or metabolic diseases or other chronic diseases that would affect the results of the investigation, high blood pressure (&gt;140/90), smoking</criteria>
