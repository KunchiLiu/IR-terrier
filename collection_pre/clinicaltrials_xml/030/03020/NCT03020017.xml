	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the safety of NU-0129 SNA gold nanoparticle infusion in patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme or gliosarcoma. This is a first-in-human trial to determine the safety of NU-0129. The study drug is composed of a small gold nanoparticle that has spherical nucleic acid attached to it. This small particle allows NU-0129 to cross the blood brain barrier (a filtering mechanism that carry blood to the brain). Once within the tumor, the nucleic acid component is able to target a gene called Bcl2L12 that is present in glioblastoma multiforme, and is associated with tumor growth. This gene prevents tumor cells from apoptosis, which is the process of programmed cell death, thus promoting tumor growth. Researchers think that targeting the Bcl2L12 gene with NU-0129 will help stop cancer cells from growing.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the safety of intravenous NU-0129 in patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) or gliosarcoma (GS). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To analyze drug concentration in serum at specific time points after drug administration. II. To demonstrate intratumoral penetration of NU-0129. III. To assess the feasibility of giving NU-0129 as a standard treatment for recurrent GBM or GS. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To analyze tumor tissue for Bcl2L12 expression levels after NU-0129 administration. II. Preliminary response (progression free survival [PFS] and overall survival [OS] at 6 months; overall response rate [ORR]). OUTLINE: Patients receive NU-0129 intravenously (IV) over 20-50 minutes and undergo standard of care tumor resection within 8-48 hours. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 7, 14, 21, and 28 days and then every 84 days for up to 2 years.</detailed_description>
