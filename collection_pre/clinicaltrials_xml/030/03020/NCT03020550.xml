	<brief_summary>This is a pilot study measuring physiologic and behavioral correlates of symptom severity in adult patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Correlates of GERD Symptom Severity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects will complete questionnaires regarding their GERD-related symptoms and have a visit with a study clinician regarding their symptoms. We will measure heart rate variability and galvanic skin response in patients during the visits and video record the visits. Subjects will complete a daily GERD symptom diary for 2 weeks and then return to the study center to complete additional questionnaires and an exit interview.</detailed_description>
