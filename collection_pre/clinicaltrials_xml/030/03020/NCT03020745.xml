	<brief_summary>GSK3389404 is being developed for the treatment of CHB virus infection. The development goal for GSK3389404 is the establishment of a finite duration treatment that results in sustained suppression of hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication and viral antigen production after cessation of all treatments for CHB due to the restoration of a functional immune response in the absence of high antigen levels. This study is a multicenter, randomized double-Blind (sponsor un-blinded in Part 1), Placebo-controlled Study which will evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, and PD profile of GSK3389404 in subjects with CHB and aim to establish proof-of-mechanism. The study will be conducted in two parts. Part 1 will be conducted as a single ascending dose (SAD) study with 5 planned cohorts ranging from 30 milligram (mg) to a maximum of 240 mg GSK3389404. Within each cohort, subjects will be randomized to receive either GSK3389404 or placebo in a 3:1 ratio. Cohorts A, B, C, C1, and D will be conducted in a sequential fashion; Cohort C1 may be dosed after Cohort C or in parallel with Cohort D. Part 2 will be conducted as a multiple-dose, dose-ranging study. Subjects will be randomized to different parallel dose levels and regimens or placebo. The dose levels of Part 2 will be selected after a review of Part 1 safety but will not exceed a total monthly dose of 480 mg. However, the total monthly subcutaneous (SC) dose of 480 mg will only be explored in a once weekly or bi-weekly (every 2 weeks) dosing regimen. The total study duration for part 1 including screening, treatment, and post-treatment follow-up, will not be expected to exceed 13 weeks for each subject and for part 2, including screening, treatment and post-treatment follow-up, will not be expected to exceed 29 weeks for each subject.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subject is able to understand and is capable of giving written informed consent, is willing to comply with protocol requirements, instructions and protocolstated restrictions, and is likely to complete the study as planned. Between 18 and 70 years of age, inclusive, at the time of signing the informed consent form. A body mass index (BMI) between 18 to 30 kilogram (Kg)/meter (m^2), inclusive. Male or female if they satisfy the following: Females of reproductive potential are not permitted. Eligible females must meet the following criteria: Nonpregnant (as confirmed by a negative serum Human Chorionic Gonadotropin [hCG] test); AND Nonlactating at screening and prior to dosing; AND Nonreproductive potential as defined by at least one of the following conditions: Premenopausal females without reproductive potential defined by Documented salpingectomy, Hysterectomy or Documented bilateral oophorectomy. Postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea. A blood sample for simultaneous FollicleStimulating Hormone (FSH) and estradiol levels may be collected at the discretion of the investigator or site to confirm nonreproductive potential. Male subjects with a female partner of childbearing potential must agree to meet one of the contraception requirements from the time of first dose of study treatment until the final Followup visit. Vasectomy. Male condom plus partner's use of one of the contraceptive options below that meets the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) effectiveness criteria including a &lt;1 percent rate of failure per year, as stated in the product label: Contraceptive subdermal implant, Intrauterine device or intrauterine system, Combined estrogen and progestogen oral contraceptive, Injectable progestogen, Contraceptive vaginal ring, or Percutaneous contraceptive patches. These allowed methods of contraception are only effective when used consistently, correctly and in accordance with the product label. The investigator is responsible for ensuring that subjects understand how to properly use these methods of contraception. Documented chronic HBV infection, defined as positive serum HBsAg &gt;=6 months prior to screening. Subjects with HBV treatment history as follows: Part 1: Treatment naive or have had prior treatment with interferon (pegylated or non pegylated) that must have ended at least 12 months prior to the Baseline visit (Day 1 predose) and/or nucleos(t)ide analogue therapy that must have ended at least 6 months prior to the Baseline visit. Part 2: Subjects with CHB receiving stable nucleos(t)ide analogue therapy, defined as no changes to their nucleos(t)ide regimen from at least 6 months prior to screening and with no planned changes to the stable regimen over the duration of the study. Plasma HBV DNA concentration: Phase I: &gt;=20,000 international units (IU)/mL for HBeAgpositive subject. &gt;=2000 IU/mL for HBeAgnegative subjects. Part 2: HBV DNA must be adequately suppressed, defined as plasma or serum HBV DNA &lt; lower limit of quantification (LLOQ). Serum HBsAg concentration &gt;50 IU/mL. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) concentration: Part 1: ALT &lt; 5 X Upper Limit of Normal (ULN). Part 2: ALT &lt;=ULN. Medical history: History of or active diagnosis of liver disease other than CHB, such as autoimmune hepatitis, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease/non alcoholic steatohepatitis, hemochromatosis, or liver failure. History or other clinical evidence of hypertension, significant or unstable cardiac disease (e.g., prolonged QT syndrome [torsade de pointes], angina, congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, diastolic dysfunction, significant arrhythmia, coronary heart disease and/or clinically significant ECG abnormalities). Uncontrolled or history of difficult to control hypertension. History of, or active diagnosis of, primary or secondary renal disease (e.g., renal disease secondary to diabetes, hypertension, vascular disease, etc.). History of extrahepatic disorders possibly related to HBV immune complexes (e.g., glomerulonephritis and polyarteritis nodosa). History of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy. History of or suspected presence of vasculitis. History of Gilbert's Syndrome. History of malignancy within the past 5 years with the exception of specific cancers that are cured by surgical resection (e.g., skin cancer), subjects under evaluation for possible malignancy are not eligible. History of/sensitivity to GSK3389404 or components thereof or a history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or medical monitor, contraindicates their participation. Confirmed or suspected hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) as evidenced by: Alphafetoprotein concentration &gt;=200 nanogram (ng)/mL. If the screening alphafetoprotein concentration is &gt;=50 ng/mL and &lt;200 ng/mL, the absence of liver mass must be documented by imaging within 6 months before randomization.

Fibroscan &gt;12 kilopascals (kPa) within 12 months of screening. ASTPlatelet Index (APRI) &gt;2 and FibroSure result &gt;0.7 within 12 months of screening. For subjects without a test for cirrhosis in the above timeframes, APRI and FibroSure should be performed during the screening period to rule out cirrhosis.

In the event of an ACR above this threshold, eligibility may be confirmed by a second measurement. Positive test for blood in urine. In the event of a positive test, the test may be repeated once, and if repeat is negative or if urine microscopy reveals &lt;5 RBC per HighPower Field (HPF), the subject is considered eligible.
