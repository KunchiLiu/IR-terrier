	<brief_title>Induction Chemotherapy in Young Patients With Locoregionally Advanced Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase II trial is studying how well radiation therapy and chemotherapy work in treating young patients with newly diagnosed nasopharyngeal cancer. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin and fluorouracil and paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.</detailed_description>
