	<brief_title>Evaluating Effective Methods for Referral for Smoking Cessation Counseling and High Blood Pressure Follow-up</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Smoking and hypertension are two modifiable risk factors that are linked to highly prevalent chronic diseases such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The ophthalmology waiting room has the potential to be an effective point of intervention to provide referral to primary care in addition to health education on preventive health topics. The investigators therefore, conducted a clinic-based study to determine the magnitude of uncontrolled hypertension and current smoking in eye doctor's offices and to determine if referral to care results in actions taken by the patient. The investigators determined the proportion of patients who have elevated blood pressure. Patients were referred appropriately and the proportion of participants who followed the recommendation to meet with their primary care doctor for elevated blood pressure at 4-6 weeks and 8-10 weeks was determined. In addition, those who consented to be in the study and admitted to smoking cigarettes were offered smoking cessation assistance through a quit line. Investigators also followed up on cigarette smoking at 4-6 weeks and 8-10 weeks.</detailed_description>
