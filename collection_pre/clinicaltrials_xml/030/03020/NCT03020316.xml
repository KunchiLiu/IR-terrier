	<brief_summary>This study will be a pilot prospective randomized study of using a peer mentor with or without transcendental meditation as compared to usual care for women with newly diagnosed heart disease (coronary artery disease or CAD). The study is designed to explore the effect of these interventions on medication adherence and a number of additional outcomes. The results of this pilot study will be used in the design of larger future trials. The targeted population is for adult women with a new diagnosis of CAD made on the basis of a myocardial infarction or a coronary revascularization procedure requiring inpatient hospitalization at the New York-Presbyterian Hospital. The overall hypothesis of this proposal is that the addition of a peer mentor to usual care will improve self-reported medication adherence for women with newly diagnosed CAD as compared with usual care. The further addition of meditation sessions will provide further incremental benefit to medication adherence.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This pilot study will be a prospective randomized study to evaluate the effects of peer-mentor intervention with or without transcendental meditation on medication adherence and other health behaviors on women with newly diagnosed CAD. Patients and mentors will be periodically surveyed about quality of life, health behaviors, medication adherence, medical knowledge, hospital admission and quality of the peer mentor-subject relationship. Subjects will have serial measurement of noninvasive biometrics (blood pressure, BMI) and routine serum markers (lipids). The overall hypothesis of this proposal is that the addition of a peer mentor will improve self-reported medication adherence for women with newly diagnosed CAD as compared with usual care. The addition of transcendental meditation sessions will further improve adherence. Arm 1 - Standard Of Care (SOC) Arm 2 - SOC and subjects will be matched with a peer mentor Arm 3 - SOC, subjects will be matched with a peer mentor, and will be trained in transcendental meditation Subjects will be assessed at baseline, 1 month, 6 months, and 12 months with surveys and assessments</detailed_description>
