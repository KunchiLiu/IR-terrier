	<brief_title>Kinetics of B-Cell Responses to Live, Attenuated Influenza Vaccine (LAIV) in Young Children Two Years of Age</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an exploratory study to determine the peripheral antibody secreting cell response during Days 5-13 after immunization with live, attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV). Investigators hoped to enroll 27 healthy children, 2 years of age who had not had any prior LAIV or trivalent inactivated vaccine (TIV) within the past 2 years. Due to low enrollment, the study was halted. Due to the limited number of samples, no analysis was performed.</detailed_description>

Use of antiviral agents against Influenza A and/or B (such as Tamiflu, Relenza, Flumodine, Symmetrel) less than 48 hours before and/or less than two weeks after administration of FluMist. 15. History of blood dyscrasias, renal disease, or hemoglobinopathies requiring regular medical followup or hospitalization during the preceding year. 16. Use of investigational agents within 30 days prior to study 17. Receipt of blood products or immunoglobulin in the past 6 months 18. Donation of the equivalent of a unit of blood within 6 weeks prior to enrollment 19. Acute febrile illness on the day of vaccination 20. Known allergies to any component of the vaccine, including eggs or egg products, gentamicin, gelatin,or arginine, or known lifethreatening reactions to previous influenza vaccinations. 21. Concurrent participation in other investigational protocols or receipt of an investigational product within the previous 30 days or planned receipt of an investigational product within 28 days following the last immunization dose. 22. Any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, might interfere with study objectives</criteria>
