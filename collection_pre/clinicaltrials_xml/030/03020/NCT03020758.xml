	<brief_summary>This is a 2-period randomized crossover study with free-living subjects on self-selected diets. The objective of this study is to compare the effects of ¾ cup of a blend of dried plums, figs, dates and raisins (DPFDR) with an isocaloric and macronutrient matched snack food on blood pressure, vascular health and lipids and lipoproteins in 50 participants who are representative of the U.S. population and at risk for cardiovascular disease (overweight/obese, elevated LDL-cholesterol, prehypertension, and/or prediabetes). The investigators hypothesize that the inclusion of DPFDR in the diet will decrease blood pressure and LDL-cholesterol, and improve artery function (assessed by standard blood pressure measure, 24 hr ambulatory blood pressure, central blood pressure and arterial stiffness) compared to the control group and baseline.</brief_summary>
