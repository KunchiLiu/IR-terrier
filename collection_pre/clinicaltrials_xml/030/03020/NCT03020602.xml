	<brief_summary>This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of ubidecarenone injectable nanosuspension (BPM31510) in treating patients with glioblastoma or gliosarcoma that has come back and have been previously treated with bevacizumab. BPM31510 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the safety and tolerability of BPM31510 plus vitamin K in subjects with glioblastoma (GB) that has recurred on a bevacizumab (BEV)-containing regimen. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate plasma pharmacokinetics (PK) when BPM31510 plus vitamin K is given to subjects with GB recurrent on a BEV-containing regimen. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. Estimate the overall survival in subjects with GB recurrent on a BEV-containing regimen from the 1st day of infusion of BPM31510 plus vitamin K to death. II. To evaluate the effects of BPM31510 plus vitamin K on shifting GB metabolism to aerobic respiration by positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. III. To evaluate the effects of BPM1510 plus vitamin K on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) imaging by Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria (specifically progression-free survival [PFS] and response rate [RR]). IV. To evaluate plasma pharmacodynamics (PD) when BPM31510 plus vitamin K is given to subjects with GB recurrent on a BEV-containing regimen. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive ubidecarenone injectable nanosuspension intravenously (IV) over 72 hours twice weekly. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 12 weeks.</detailed_description>
