Investigators hypothesize that short-term CGMS use with feedback (and/or lack thereof) and patients' sense of self-efficacy</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Sixty adolescents, ages 13-19 years, with type 1 diabetes and an HbA1c &gt; = 8 % who are also naive to CGMS use will be recruited from the diabetes outpatient population followed at Bellevue Hospital, Lutheran Hospital, Woodhull Hospital, and the NYU Fink Pediatric Ambulatory Care Center. Forty subjects will be randomly assigned to the CGMS group and 20 subjects will be assigned to the control group.</detailed_description>
