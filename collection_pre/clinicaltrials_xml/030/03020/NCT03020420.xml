	<brief_title>Clinical Trial To Study The Anti-scarring Effect Of Cicatricell</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>At 1st post operative follow up visit, surgical incision(s) will be assessed for healing, after the sutures/staples/steri-strips are removed. To be included in the study the incision must be 5cm or greater. And bilateral incisions as in bilateral mastectomy can be included. The incisions will be divided into two sections, using an imaginary line between top and bottom, or left and right. One side of the imaginary line will have cicatricell cream applied 2 times a day for a minimum of 8 weeks and a maximum 6months. The other side of the imaginary line will remain untreated. In the case of a bilateral incision, as in bilateral breast mastectomy or AAA incisions in the groins, the cream will be applied to one entire incision and the 2nd incision will be untreated. The incision(s) will be its own control group. At the end of the treatment phase the incision(s) will be assessed again to compare the healing.</detailed_description>
