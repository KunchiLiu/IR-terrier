	<brief_title>The Role of Oral Glutathione on Growth Parameters in Children With Cystic Fibrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>a prospective, multi-center, randomized, placebocontrolled, double-blind, Phase II clinical trial. Approximately sixty pancreatic insufficient (PI) subjects with CF who are ≥ 2 and &lt; 11 years of age, will be enrolled to receive either L-Glutathione Reduced (GSH) or placebo given orally (tid) for 24 weeks. Each subject will be seen for four study visits: Visit 1 (Screening), Visit 2 (Baseline/Randomization, Day 0), Visit 3 (Week 12) and Visit 4 (Week 24). At Visit 2, subjects will be randomized to receive either active treatment or placebo. Visit 1 and 2 may be combined if subject meets eligibility requirements and a fecal specimen is collected prior to dosing. Safety and clinical outcomes will be assessed throughout the study. Assessment of inflammatory and other bio-markers in blood and fecal specimens will be performed at Visits 2 and 4</detailed_description>
