	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to learn more about new noninvasive ways of detecting lung disease in US Military personnel and people who worked as contractors during military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. This study is looking at conducting a type of breathing test called the lung clearance index (LCI) test which is being investigated as a potential noninvasive way to detect the type of lung disease that may be seen in symptomatic deployers retuning from Iraq and Afghanistan.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The healthy control group will comprise 20 volunteers who are at least 18 years of age, have no history of pre-existing lung disease, and report no respiratory illness in the four weeks preceding enrollment. The symptomatic deployers who have undergone lung biopsy and meet case definition for deployment-related lung disease. A case of deployment-related lung disease is defined as the presence of unexplained chest symptoms in a deployer who, on a surgical lung biopsy, is found to have bronchiolitis or granulomatous pneumonitis without other known cause.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>For the deployer group: presence of respiratory symptoms (cough, chest tightness, wheezing, shortness of breath or decreased exercise tolerance) following deployment history of deployment for Operation Iraqi Freedom, Operation Enduring Freedom or Operation New Dawn for greater than or equal to 6 weeks as either military personnel or a civilian contractor prior VATS biopsyproven histologic abnormalities of small airways disease. For the control group: no history of preexisting lung disease no respiratory illness in the four weeks preceding enrollment For the deployer group: If on clinical evaluation they were found to have asthma, vocal cord dysfunction or other explanations for their respiratory symptoms and did not need to undergo surgical lung biopsy for diagnosis. unable to provide informed consent pregnant subjects For the control group: preexisting lung disease unable to provide informed consent pregnant subjects</criteria>
