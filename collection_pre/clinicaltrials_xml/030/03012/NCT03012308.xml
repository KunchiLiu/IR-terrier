	<brief_summary>The ultrasound evaluation of left ventricular filling pressures (LVRP) is well validated in a population of cardiac patients and medical resuscitation (...) This evaluation has a major interest in the management, notably haemodynamic but also respiratory, of resuscitation patients. No studies have evaluated the relevance of these markers in the postoperative context of cardiac surgery. Left atrium pressure (POG) directly reflects LVRPs and is measured in surgical resuscitation by a surgically placed catheter as part of routine institutional care and will serve as gold-standard. In order to study the clinical repercussions of these estimated ultrasound POG and PRVG values, we will study their correlation with clinical signs and ultrasound of OAP.</brief_summary>
