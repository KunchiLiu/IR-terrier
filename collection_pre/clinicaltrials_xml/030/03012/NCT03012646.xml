	<criteria>1. Diagnosis of WHO Group 3 PH associated with COPD 2. Subjects are required to have a right heart catheterization (RHC) within one year prior to the first dose of study drug with the following parameters: 1. Pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) ≥ 4 Wood Units (WU) and 2. A left ventricular end diastolic pressure (LVEDP) or pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) of ≤ 12 mmHg if PVR ≥ 4 WU to &lt; 6.25 WU or ≤ 15 mmHg if PVR ≥ 6.25 WU and 3. A mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) of ≥ 30 mmHg 3. Clinical Diagnosis of COPD will be made using accepted Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) diagnostic criteria, including Baseline spirometry with the following documented parameters: 1. FEV1 &lt; 65% predicted, and 2. FEV1/ FVC &lt; 70 4. Baseline 6MWD ≥ 100 meters Exclusion criteria: 1. The subject has a diagnosis of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) or PH for reasons other than COPD as outlined in inclusion criterion 3. This would include, but is not limited to, the concomitant presence of thromboembolic disease (acute or chronic), untreated or inadequately treated obstructive sleep apnea, connective tissue disease (including but not limited to systemic sclerosis/scleroderma, or systemic lupus erythematosus), sarcoidosis, interstitial lung disease,human immunodeficiency virus1 infection, and other conditions under WHO Group 1, 2, 4, and 5 classifications. 2. The subject has received any Food and Drug Administration (FDA)approved medication for the treatment of PAH (ie, prostacyclin, prostacyclin receptor agonist, endothelin receptor antagonist [ERA], phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor [PDE5I],or soluble guanylate cyclase [sGC] stimulator) within 60 days of the first dose of study drug, except for acute vasoreactivity testing. 3. The subject has evidence of clinically significant leftsided heart disease as defined by the following criteria per the most recent assessment: 1. Left ventricular end diastolic pressure (LVEDP) or pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) &gt;15 mmHg (or &gt;12 mmHg if pulmonary vascular resistance [PVR] ≥4 to &lt;6.25 WU) 2. Left ventricular ejection fraction &lt;40% as assessed by either angiography or echocardiography.</criteria>
