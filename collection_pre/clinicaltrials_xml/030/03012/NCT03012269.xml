	<brief_summary>This study aims to conduct a contrast study on the characteristics of functional and structural connectivity of neural networks of working memory in patients with acquired brain injury versus normal controls, using resting-state functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging, task-specific functional magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion tensor imaging, combined with cognitive behavioral examinations. Another purpose is to reveal the characteristics of dynamic change of neural networks of working memory pre- and post-intervention in patients with working memory dysfunction.</brief_summary>
