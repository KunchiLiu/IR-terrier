	<brief_title>Comparing Effects of Various Combinations of 6 Hertz(Hz) rTMS &amp; LFrTMS on Motor Recovery Due to Cerebrovascular Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It is the basic principle for functional recovery after cerebrovascular disease to restore the original balance in reciprocal inhibition between affected hemisphere and unaffected hemisphere. repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a noninvasive neuroplastic technique rebalancing interhemispheric competition after stroke. Low frequency rTMS (LFrTMS) on contralesional hemisphere or high frequency rTMS (HFrTMS) on lesional hemisphere might be the basic choice. 6 hertz(Hz) primed LFrTMS on lesional primary motor cortex has the stronger effect than LFrTMS alone does on one hand; the other newly-developed combination, i.e. HFrTMS on lesional primary motor cortex and LFrTMS on contralesional primary motor cortex might also be more effective than they do respectively on the other hand. The main aim of our research is to find out which combination is better by considering both safety and efficiency.</detailed_description>
