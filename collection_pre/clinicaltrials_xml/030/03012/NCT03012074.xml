	<brief_summary>This study will use mobile health technologies to provide everyday data to help patients and their care providers better understand illness dynamics and develop adaptive approaches to improve health outcomes in diabetes. Specifically, the study will identify strategies to help patients adapt using multiple types of self-generated diabetes-related data and help providers guide patients to better self-manage in real-time, when guidance is needed most.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigators will conduct a mixed-methods exploratory designed study and recruit 50 adult patients (age ≥ 18) with type 2 diabetes who will track relevant clinical data over 6 months. Participants will be asked to use a phone-tethered glucose monitor, a cellular body scale, and a wrist-worn accelerometer, and respond to short bi-weekly text message-based surveys on medication adherence for 6 months. Data generated from the devices will be plotted as trajectories that will allow us to conduct trajectory analyses and identify missing data points and trends leading to attrition, in order to assess the feasibility of having patients engage in this type of self-monitoring for 6 months. A subset of 10 patients will be interviewed monthly via telephone to discuss their adaptive challenges and successes over the study period. The investigators will present the trajectories of their data during patient interviews using a visual that we will e-mail or postal mail, depending on patient preference. This will facilitate discussion of the challenges participants face in self-management and adaptive practices participants use. Following the 6 months of self-monitoring, we will conduct focus groups with providers in which the investigators will present the data trajectories and explore ways to achieve continual communication and address real-time challenges with diabetes self-management.</detailed_description>
