	<brief_summary>This is a Phase 2, non-randomised, open-label, multicentric study to investigate the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab monotherapy in 6 cohorts of patients with specific rare cancers who have unresectable locally advanced or metastatic disease, which is resistant or refractory to standard therapy, or for which standard therapy does not exist, or is not considered appropriate, and for which no other experimental treatment options are available, in order to identify subsets of patients that may benefit from treatment</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study plans to enrol up to 300 patients in total with between 20 and 50 patients assigned to each cohort according to indication, as follows: - Cohort 1: Rare sarcoma - Cohort 2: Rare ovarian cancer - Cohort 3: Primary central nervous system lymphomas - Cohort 4: Rare thyroid cancer - Cohort 5: Rare malignant neuroendocrine cancer - Cohort 6: Germ-cell cancer The study will use a two-stage Bayesian enrichment design. The first stage treats all patients from the different cohorts with the investigational product and identifies possibly sensitive indications. The second stage will compare outcomes among subsets of patients in the identified cohorts to distinguish between subpopulations of patients who may benefit from the treatment and patients for whom there is no evidence of efficacy.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Patient information sheet and written informed consent form signed. 2. Histologically confirmed diagnosis of a pathology corresponding to one of the following selected cancer types: Rare sarcoma: Alveolar soft part sarcoma, Chordoma, Dedifferentiated chondrosarcoma, epithelioid sarcoma, sarcoma with loss of INI1, malignant rhabdoid tumours, myxoid liposarcoma, angiosarcoma of the scalp, radiation induced sarcomas. Rare ovarian cancer: recurrent or relapsed; sex cord tumour, germ cell tumour (immature teratoma, non seminomatous germ cell &amp; dysgerminoma), lowgrade serous carcinoma, mucinous carcinoma, clear cell adenocarcinoma, small cell carcinoma, and carcinosarcoma with histological confirmation following review by members of the Tumeurs Malignes Rares Gynécologiques (TMRG) network (French rare gynaecological tumour group) Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL): refractory primary intraocular and CNS lymphoma. Rare thyroid cancer: differentiated thyroid carcinoma (Papillary, follicular, Hurthle cell (oncocytic), poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma), medullary thyroid carcinoma, anaplastic thyroid carcinoma. Rare malignant neuroendocrine tumour: poorly differentiated tumours refractory after 2 lines of chemotherapy, well differentiated tumours refractory after 4 lines of treatment, carcinoid tumours after 2 lines of treatment. Germcell cancer progressing after standard therapy. 3. Metastatic disease or unresectable locally advanced malignancy that is resistant or refractory to standard therapy or for which standard therapy does not exist or is not considered appropriate by the Investigator. 4. Aged ≥ 18 years old. 5. Measurable disease according to RECIST v1.1 guidelines for solid tumours (Eisenhauer, 2009); or IPCG response criteria (Abrey, 2005) for patients in the PCNSL cohort. For patients with germcell cancer measurable disease is defined as measurable according to RECIST v1.1 and / or abnormal levels of AFP, hCG and LDH. 6. Able to provide a Formalinfixed/paraffinembedded (FFPE) biopsy sample of a metastatic site or primitive tumour tissue. Note: Patients for whom suitable archived biopsy material is not available must be willing to undergo a biopsy of a tumour lesion prior to study entry, unless this is medically contraindicated (e.g. site inaccessible or patient safety concerns). 7. Patients must have a mandatory treatmentfree interval of at least 21 days following previous systemic anticancer treatments. 8. Patients who have received previous systemic anticancer treatment and/or radiotherapy should have recovered from any treatment related toxicity, to a level of ≤ grade 1 (according to NCICTCAE criteria, v 4.0) with the exception of Grade 2 alopecia. 9. Adequate hematologic function (absolute neutrophil count [ANC] ≥ 1.0 x109/L, platelets ≥ 100 x109/L, haemoglobin ≥ 9 g/L) measured within 14 days of treatment initiation. 10. Adequate renal function (creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min using the MDRD or CKI EPI method) measured within 14 days of treatment initiation. 11. Adequate hepatic function (serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x the reference upper limit of normal (ULN) unless due to Gilbert's syndrome; ASAT and ALAT ≤ 2,5 xULN) measured within 14 days of treatment initiation. For patients with documented liver metastasis ASAT/ALAT ≤ 5x ULN is acceptable. 12. Strictly normal blood levels of calcium and magnesium, measured within 14 days of treatment initiation. 13. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of ≤ 1 (Oken, 1982). 14. Estimated life expectancy ≥ 90 days. 15. Patients who are sexually active must agree to use a medically accepted method of contraception (e.g. implants, injectables, combined oral contraceptives, some intrauterine devices or vasectomized partner, for participating women; condoms for participating men) or practice complete abstinence, beginning 14 days before the first administration of the investigational product (IP), while on treatment and for at least 5 months after the last administration of IP for female patients, and 7 months after the last administration of IP for male patients. 16. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative urine or serum pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to the first administration of IP. If urine test results are positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required. 17. Women who are breastfeeding should discontinue nursing prior to the first administration of IP and for at least 120 days after the last administration of IP. 18. Patients must be affiliated to a Social Security System or equivalent. 1. Prior treatment with an antiPD1 or antiPDL1 antibody 2. Eligible, and willing, to participate in a clinical trial of an alternative anticancer therapy targeting their disease which is open to accrual in France. 3. Concurrent steroid medication at a dose greater than prednisone 10 mg/day or equivalent. For patients with PCNSL or germcell cancer, concurrent steroid medication at a dose greater than prednisone 20 mg/day or equivalent. 4. Has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy (eg., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment. 5. History of (noninfectious) pneumonitis that required steroids, or current pneumonitis. 6. History of severe hypersensitivity reaction to any monoclonal antibody therapy 7. Radiotherapy (except for brain and extremities) within 21 days prior to the first administration of IP. 8. Treatment with other investigational drugs or participation in another clinical trial within 21 days prior to the first administration of IP or concomitantly with the trial. 9. Has known symptomatic central nervous system (CNS) metastases. Patients with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they are stable (without evidence of progression by imaging for at least four weeks prior to the first dose of trial treatment and any neurologic symptoms have returned to baseline), have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases, and are not using steroids for at least 7 days prior to trial treatment. 10. Has known carcinomatous meningitis or a history of leptomeningeal disease, except for patients with primary CNS lymphoma. 11. Serum creatinine &gt; 1.5 xULN or glomerular filtration rate (GFR) &lt; 50 ml/min. 12. Lymphocytes count below 1,000/mm3 and CD4+ count below 500/mm3 as assessed by routine blood phenotyping. 13. Other malignancies within the past 5 years other than basal cell skin cancer or in situ carcinoma of the cervix. 14.
