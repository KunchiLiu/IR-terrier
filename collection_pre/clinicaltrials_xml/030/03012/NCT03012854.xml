	<brief_title>Different Surgical Procedures of Peroral Endoscopic Myotomy for Esophageal Achalasia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Esophageal achalasia is an esophageal motor disorder, which is characterized by the absence of esophageal peristalsis combined with a defective relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). The major symptoms of esophageal achalasia are dysphagia, chest pain, and regurgitation of undigested food. Currently, treatment options mainly focus on relief of the symptoms by reducing the LES pressure. Pneumatic dilation is the main endoscopic therapies for esophageal achalasia. However, the patients need repeat treatment to maintain therapeutic success and there is a risk of perforation (1%-3%). For surgery approaches, the laparoscopic Heller's myotomy (LHM) combined with Dor's antireflux procedure has gained considerable interest. The LHM can sustain therapeutic effects for long-term in approximately 80% of patients. Recently, Inoue et al. succeeded in treating achalasia endoscopically with a method called peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) and achieved promising results in short-term. Technically, POEM derived from natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) and endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD), in which a submucosal tunnel is created after submucosal injection, and then an endoscopic myotomy was made at the gastroesophageal junction. However, the clinical efficacy of safety of circular myotomy and full-thickness myotomy guided by peroral endoscopic in treatment of incision length of ≤7cm and of ≥7cm in achalasia patients were not determined, and there was no prospective study that compared different surgical procedures of POEM for esophageal achalasia. Therefore, we aim to compare the clinical efficacy of safety of circular myotomy and full-thickness myotomy guided by peroral endoscopic in treatment of incision length of ≤7cm and of ≥7cm in achalasia patients.</detailed_description>
