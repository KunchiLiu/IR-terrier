	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial studies how well multi-epitope folate receptor alpha peptide vaccine, sargramostim, and cyclophosphamide work in treating patients with triple negative breast cancer. Vaccines made from a person's white blood cells mixed with tumor proteins may help the body build an effective immune response to kill tumor cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving multi-epitope folate receptor alpha peptide vaccine, sargramostim, and cyclophosphamide may work better in treating patients with triple negative breast cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Multi-epitope Folate Receptor Alpha Peptide Vaccine, Sargramostim, and Cyclophosphamide in Treating Patients With Triple Negative Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To show that multi-epitope folate receptor alpha peptide vaccine (folate receptor [FR]alpha peptide vaccine) with sargramostim (GM-CSF) adjuvant will prolong the disease-free survival (DFS) compared to GM-CSF adjuvant treatment in patients with triple negative breast cancer. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To compare the safety and tolerability of metronomic cyclophosphamide followed by FRalpha peptide vaccine with GM-CSF versus GM-CSF alone. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine whether high level of antibody and cellular immune response toward the FRalpha measured at baseline is a prognostic factor for vaccine immune response and/or cancer relapse. II. To determine whether the level of tumor expression of FRalpha at baseline is a prognosis factor for vaccine immune response and/or cancer relapse. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms. ARM I: Patients receive cyclophosphamide orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-7 and 15-21 of course 1 only. Starting course 2, patients receive multi-epitope folate receptor alpha peptide vaccine with sargramostim intradermally (ID) on day 1. Treatment repeats every 28 days for courses 2-7 and every 6 months for courses 8-14 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. ARM II: Patients receive cyclophosphamide as in Arm I. Starting course 2, patients receive multi-epitope folate receptor alpha peptide vaccine with placebo ID on day 1. Treatment repeats every 28 days for courses 2-7 and every 6 months for courses 8-14 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for 3 years.</detailed_description>
