	<brief_title>Using m-Health Tools to Reduce the Misuse of Opioid Pain Relievers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multi-site, randomized trial will evaluate an m-health program designed to aid the patient in making an informed decision about their pain treatment. Patients reporting to the ED with an injury-related chief complaint who agree to participate are randomized to receive the intervention program, My Healthy Choices, or an attention-matched control. My Healthy Choices pairs tailored education with a patient decision aid to describe what opioid and non-opioid pain medications are, assess the patient's risk factors for opioid-related adverse effects, and produce a tailored report that patients are encouraged to share with their doctor. Data are collected through surveys at three time points during the ED encounter (baseline, immediately after the intervention, and just before discharge), and at a 6-week follow-up survey. The primary outcomes are whether the patient prefers an opioid pain reliever (OPR) and whether the patient takes an OPR. The investigators hope this program will facilitate patient-provider communication, as well as reduce the number of prescriptions written for OPRs and thus the number of patients exposed to prescription opioids and the associated risks of addiction and overdose.</detailed_description>
