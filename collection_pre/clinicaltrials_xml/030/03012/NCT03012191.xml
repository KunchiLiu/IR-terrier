	<brief_summary>Recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB) is an incurable, devastating, inherited skin disease caused by mutations in the COL7A1 gene that encodes for type VII collagen (C7), the major component of anchoring fibrils (AFs), structures that mediate epidermal-dermal adherence. Thirty percent of RDEB patients have nonsense mutations. The investigators recently demonstrated in 5 such patients that intradermal and topical gentamicin induced "read-through" of their nonsense mutations and created robust and sustained new C7 and AFs at the dermal-epidermal junction (DEJ) of their skin and also stimulated wound closure and reduced new blister formation. No untoward side effects occurred. Herein, the investigators propose evaluating the safety and efficacy of intravenous gentamicin in these patients. In theory, this intravenous administration has the possibility of treating simultaneously all of the patients' skin wounds. The investigators also propose optimizing the concentration and manner of delivery of topical gentamicin. The unambiguous milestones will be increased C7 and AFs in the patients' DEJ, improved EB Disease Activity Scores, and absence of significant gentamicin side effects.</brief_summary>
