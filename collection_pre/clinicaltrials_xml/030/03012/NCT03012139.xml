Current use of vitamin D analogs Fasting plasma glucose ≥126 mg/dL Renal failure (serum creatinine &gt; 1.5mg/dl) Chronic active liver disease (Bilirubin &gt; 17mmol/L, AST&gt;144IU/L, or ALT&gt;165IU/L) Contraindications to MRI (e.g., pacemaker, ferrous materials within body). Active coronary artery disease or history of unstable macrovascular disease (unstable angina, myocardial infarction, stroke, and revascularization of coronary, peripheral or carotid artery within 3 months of recruitment) Renal insufficiency/failure (serum creatinine &gt; 1.5mg/dl) Oral warfarin group medications or history of blood clotting disorders. People who have taken Bevacizumab Platelet count &lt;100,000 per uL Pregnancy or breastfeeding Alcohol consumption greater than 2 glasses/day or other substance abuse Untreated or uncontrolled thyroid disorders Debilitating chronic disease (at the discretion of the investigators) Previous injury/trauma/surgery to the region being measured without full recovery Pain in the area to be assessed Any medical condition affecting the ability to execute a maximal muscle contraction The presence of infections, highly communicable diseases (AIDS, active tuberculosis, veneral disease, hepatitis) or metastatic bone disease that may interfere with safely executing maximal effort. Significant neurological or musculoskeletal disorders or disease that may interfere with safely executing maximal contraction Any congenital, developmental, or other bone disease or previous surgeries that may interfere with successful testing</criteria>
