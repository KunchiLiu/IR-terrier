	<brief_summary>This will be a randomized, single dose, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Latin-square design with 5-period (full) crossover study with subjects randomized to treatment sequences. Subjects will complete all 5 Periods. During each Period, subjects will come to the clinical research unit (CRU) and remain overnight before being dosed with a single dose of either lasmiditan, alprazolam, or placebo in the morning. Cognitive testing and driving simulation will be conducted post dosing. Subjects will have a washout of at least 5 days between each Period. This study is designed to test non-inferiority of lasmiditan doses relative to placebo, with an alprazolam test versus placebo to confirm the sensitivity of the simulator to detect treatment effects.</brief_summary>
