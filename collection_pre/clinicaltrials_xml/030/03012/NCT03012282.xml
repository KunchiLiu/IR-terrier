	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial studies how well computed tomography (CT) perfusion images work in assessing treatment response in patients with pancreatic cancer. Analyzing specific measurements on the CT perfusion images may help doctors better determine how a tumor responds to chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy and may help guide treatment for patients with pancreatic cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CT Perfusion Images in Assessing Treatment Response in Patients With Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To develop, test, and refine a CT perfusion protocol for its feasibility, reproducibility, and quality with a limited number of patients with a pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA). II. To analyze preliminary date regarding perfusion parameters that improve accuracy in predicting response and resectability for a subset of patients with locally advanced (LA) and borderline resectable (BR) PDA treated with neoadjuvant therapy. OUTLINE: Patients undergo CT perfusion sequence over 30 seconds during the baseline standard of care CT scan and during follow-up CT scans at 2 and possibly 4 months after chemotherapy, at 4-6 weeks after radiation therapy, or prior to definitive surgery. After completion of the study, patients are followed up periodically for 2 years.</detailed_description>
