	<brief_title>Pathologic Assessment of Rectal Prolapse in the Young</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Full clinical assessment of the patients will be conducted by history taking querying the type and duration of symptoms, associated medical conditions, history of previous surgery for rectal prolapse, and presence of fecal incontinence which will be graded by Wexner continence score. In addition, patients will undergo thorough general and local examination to determine the type of rectal prolapse (internal or external) and the condition of the anal sphincters and pelvic floor muscles. Functional assessment of the anorectal region will be done by anal manometry to measure the resting and squeeze anal pressures, rectal sensation and compliance; endorectal ultrasonography to assess the integrity of the anal sphincters; and pudendal nerve terminal motor latency (PNTML) to exclude pudendal neuropathy. Random biopsies (2-4 in number) will be taken from the pelvic floor muscles, external anal sphincter, and the lateral supportive ligaments of the rectum during surgical treatment of rectal prolapse whether via the abdominal or perineal approach. Tissue samples will be preserved in formalin solution and will be sent for histopathological examination. Tissue samples will be subjected to immunohistochemistry to calculate the ratio between collagen type I and type III, and to reveal any myopathic or degenerative changes. Additionally, schistosomal affection of the pelvic floor muscles will be detected by immunohistochemistry examination for the ova of schistosomal mansoni.</detailed_description>
