	<brief_summary>This proposal will test the hypothesis that chronic treatment with sildenafil with and without the use of nitric oxide substrate, L-arginine, protects against fatty acid induced impairment of endothelial function, improves insulin-stimulated microvascular recruitment, insulin sensitivity and glucose uptake in CD36 rs3211938 G-allele carriers.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CD36 in Nutrient Delivery and Its Dysfunction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects carrying the G-allele of CD36 coding SNP rs3211938 that results in 50% reduction of CD36 levels in ~25% of African Americans have endothelial dysfunction. Endothelial dysfunction results in impairment of insulin's vascular actions and eventually reduced insulin sensitivity. Insulin induces microvascular recruitment via stimulation of nitric oxide(NO)-cGMP pathway, which facilitates nutrient flux, e.g., glucose to skeletal muscle. Elevated fatty acids impair insulin-stimulated microvascular recruitment and reduce insulin sensitivity. Chronic treatment with sildenafil increases vascularity and muscle glucose uptake in high fat fed mice. In humans, Drs. Shibao (PI) recently reported that a 3-month treatment with sildenafil improves insulin sensitivity in patients with impaired glucose tolerance. More relevant to this project, endothelial dysfunction improved after 4-week treatment with sildenafil in G-allele carriers. This proposal will test the hypothesis that chronic treatment with sildenafil with and without the use of NO substrate, L-arginine, protects against fatty acids induced impairment of endothelial function, improves insulin-stimulated microvascular recruitment, insulin sensitivity and glucose uptake in CD36 rs3211938 G-allele carriers.</detailed_description>
