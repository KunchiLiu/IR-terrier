	<brief_summary>Antimicrobial treatment could be beneficial in patients with ventilator-associated tracheobronchitis (VAT). The hypothesis of this study is that antibiotic treatment for VAT (3 or 7 days), compared with no antibiotic treatment, would reduce the incidence of transition from VAT to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Antimicrobial Treatment in Patients With Ventilator-associated Tracheobronchitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The main objective of this randomized controlled multicenter double-blind trial is to assess the efficiency of two durations (3 or 7 days) of antibiotic treatment for VAT, compared with no antibiotic treatment, in reducing the incidence of transition from VAT to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Secondary objectives are to determine the impact of two durations (3 or 7 days) of antibiotic treatment for VAT, compared with no antibiotic treatment, on: - duration of mechanical-ventilation free days - duration of antibiotic free days - length of ICU stay - mortality at day 28 and day 90 - incidence of ICU-acquired colonization related to multidrug resistant (MDR) bacteria - incidence of ICU-acquired infection related to MDR bacteria - incidence of ventilator-associated events After informed consent, patients will be randomized (1:1:1) to receive 0 (control group), 3 or 7 days (experimental groups) of antibiotic treatment for VAT Antibiotic treatment is standardized, based on the time of onset of VAT, and presence of risk factors for MDR bacteria: - patients with early-onset VAT with no risk factor for MDR bacteria will receive ceftriaxone (2 g iv every 24h). - patients with late-onset VAT (after day 4 of mechanical ventilation), or with at least one risk factor for MDR bacteria will receive imipenem (1 g iv every 8h), and ciprofloxacin (400 mg iv every 8h) as empirical treatment. When methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus is suspected, linezolid (600 mg iv every 12h) will be added to empirical treatment. Patients randomized in control group will receive 7 days of placebo, and those randomized in the first experimental arm (3 days of antibiotics) will receive 4 days of placebo.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>All adult patients hospitalized in the ICU with a first episode of VAT diagnosed &gt;48 hours after starting invasive mechanical ventilation are eligible for this study. VAT is defined using the following criteria: 1. absence of new infiltrate on chest X ray 2. two of the three following conditions: fever &gt; 38.5 °C or &lt;36.5, leucocyte count &gt; than 12 000 cells per μL or &lt;than 4000 cells per μL purulent tracheal secretions 3. and positive tracheal aspirate (≥105 cfu/mL) longterm tracheostomy at ICU admission modified Clinical Pulmonary Infection Score (CPIS) ≥6 at the day of randomization patients who develop VAP before VAT patients already receiving antibiotics active against all the microorganisms responsible for VAT severe immunosuppression pregnancy or breastfeeding patients &lt;18 years patients already included in another study, with potential interaction with the primary objective of the current study known resistance to imipenem and ciprofloxacin of bacteria responsible for VAT treatment limitation decisions moribund patients (likely to die within 24 h) allergy to any of study drugs: hypersensitivity to any carbapenem, severe hypersensitivity (for example anaphylactic reaction or severe cutaneous reaction) to any other antibiotic form betalactam group (such as penicillin or cephalosporin), severe hypersensitivity (for example anaphylactic reaction) to any other antibiotic from betalactam group (penicillin, monobactam or carbapenem), hypersensitivity to quinolones</criteria>
