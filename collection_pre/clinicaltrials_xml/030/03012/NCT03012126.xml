	<brief_summary>This project seeks to build on innovative strategies to optimize the care of low-income children with a BMI â‰¥ 85th percentile. To accomplish this goal, investigators will implement a new clinical-community intervention, theoretically grounded in the Integrated Clinical and Community Systems of Care Model, to address obesity through optimized screening and management known to be effective, e-Referrals, Healthy Weight Clinics, and the YMCA's Healthy Weight and Your Child weight management program (originally known as MEND). The study will examine outcomes for children that matter most to a broad group of stakeholders including parents, clinicians, and public health practitioners as well as inform the care of &gt;7 million children with obesity covered by the Children's Health Insurance Program or Medicaid.</brief_summary>
