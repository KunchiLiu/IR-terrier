	<detailed_description>This phase I pilot study tests the feasibility, credibility, and acceptability of the prototype version of Social Skills Coach in terms of its use among mental health consumers and clinicians. The intervention aims to improve social and daily living skills and community functioning among people diagnosed with schizophrenia spectrum disorder.

Qualitative data collection will occur at the end of the study and will include the use of semi-structured interviews to capture experiential information. Study participants will be randomly assigned to either a social skills training course (control group) or to a study arm using the Social Skills Coach program (treatment group).
