	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to perform a prospective, randomised study investigating the safety and efficacy of cryoballoon catheter ablation compared with radiofrequency ablation(contact force), in the treatment of persistent AF.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Comparing Pulmonary Vein Isolation With the Cryoballoon and Radiofrequency Energy(Contact Force) in the Treatment of Persistent Atrial Fibrillation (AF) (Cryo Vs CF in PerAF)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The hypotheses for this study is that cryothermal energy is as effective and safe as using radiofrequency energy in the treatment of persistent AF and is associated with a better long term outcome.</detailed_description>
