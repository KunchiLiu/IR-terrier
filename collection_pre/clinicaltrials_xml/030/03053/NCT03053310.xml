	<brief_summary>Background Approximately half of head and neck cancer patients are 65 years or older at diagnosis. Treatment decisions in this older HNCA population are challenging, because of the lack of evidence-based guidelines. Surgery is often the treatment of choice in a HNCA setting where curative treatment is intended. Though chronological age per se has not been reported as a contraindication for surgery, data are limited and often the result of retrospective studies. Measurement of functional age, through a comprehensive geriatric assessment, has been suggested by several international cancer organizations to be a better prognostic indicator. At the divisions of maxillofacial surgery and otorhinolaryngology, a geriatric assessment is part of routine preoperative staging for patients of 70 years old or older. Objectives The investigators aim to determine the value of G8 to predict 30-day postoperative comorbidity in an older HNCA population undergoing elective curative surgery. Moreover, they aim to examine the vulnerability profile of patients undergoing elective head and neck surgery for an oncology diagnosis. Study design All patients of 70 years and older, presenting at the divisions of maxillofacial surgery and otorhinolaryngology for curative surgery of a solid head and neck tumour undergo a geriatric consult as part of routine preoperative staging. The presence of postoperative morbidity and mortality within the first 30 days after surgery will be collected as a primary endpoint. At 30±10 days postoperative, all patients will be re-evaluated with the G8 and the CGA. Patient' quality of life will also be re-examined within 30 days postoperative and again at 6 and 12 months postoperative. Conclusion There is still no consensus whether older HNCA patients should receive a different treatment compared to younger patients. Data related to the vulnerability profile of older patients requiring HN surgery, and the predictive value of geriatric screening for postoperative morbidity could enable better patient selection in the future.</brief_summary>
