	<brief_summary>The FLEX Registry will be implemented to operate as a large-scale, population based, prospective registry. All patients with stage I to III breast cancer who receive MammaPrint® and BluePrint testing on a primary breast tumor are eligible for entry into the FLEX Registry, which is intended to enable additional study arms at low incremental effort and cost. FLEX Registry will utilize an adaptive design, where additional targeted substudies and arms can be added after the initial study is opened.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MammaPrint, BluePrint, and Full-genome Data Linked With Clinical Data to Evaluate New Gene EXpression Profiles</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The FLEX Registry will include all patients with stage I-III breast cancer who have received MammaPrint and BluePrint testing in any clinical setting. Study arm appendices will specify treatment arm, inclusion criteria, and number of patients needed. Approximately 2000 patients from 70-75 US based institutions will be enrolled. Treatment is at the discretion of the physician adhering to NCCN approved regimens of a recognized alternative. Clinical data will be collected and entered online at the time points listed: patient enrollment, time of treatment, 1 year post-treatment, and 2, 5, and 10 years post diagnosis. Objectives: - Create a large scale, population-based registry of full genome expression data and clinical data to investigate new gene associations with prognostic and/or predictive value - Utilize shared registry infrastructure to examine smaller groups of interest - Generate hypotheses for targeted subset analyses and trials based on full genome data</detailed_description>
