	<detailed_description>The study is a randomized trial comparing 4 different methods of follow-up training in IPT. Following initial 2-day training, participant therapists will be randomized to either individual supervision, group supervision, an internet-based training program, or autodidactic training. Participants will be followed for a year to determine their use of IPT, outcomes with patients, and adherence and quality of IPT in 4 case portfolios. The adherence measure for IPT developed in Phase I of the project is being used as the gold standard measure of IPT fidelity.</detailed_description>
