	<brief_summary>The IRECT trial is a non-interventional, prospective clinical trial using modern immune monitoring techniques over the course of the standard of care for HNSCC. The dynamics of host/tumor immune interactions during the conventional standard treatment will be analyzed to find the most promising target antigen and to develop a strategy how and when specific immunotherapy should be added to the current treatment schedule. The results from this trial will help to understand how state of the art treatment can be complemented using cancer-testis antigen specific vaccines and immune-modulating drugs to improve the outcome of head and neck cancer patients.</brief_summary>
