	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study will be to evaluate and compare patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty (TKA) with sensor guidance versus that of a standard technique. Each patient will be assessed for the difference between passive, soft tissue controlled, pressure balance and muscle activated pressure balance.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of PRO After TKA Under Spinal Anesthesia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized prospective study looking at the impact sensor guidance has on the outcome of patients and comparing to that of patients with a standard technique. The study is also designed to evaluate the difference between passive, soft tissue controlled, pressure balance and muscle activated pressure balance. Prior to the randomized study, there will be an observational pilot of 25 patients. These patients will not be randomized and will receive standard of care anesthesia. The reason for the 25 pilot patients is to perfect the sensor guidance so all subsequent study patients will have a streamlined, consistent measurement.</detailed_description>
