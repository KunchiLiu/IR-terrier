	<brief_summary>Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which includes ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), are chronic relapsing inflammatory conditions of the gastrointestinal tract. IBD is thought to result from a complex interaction between genetic, immune, microbial and environmental factors. There is emerging data suggesting Vitamin D may not only play a role in bone health but may also be involved in gut health as well. While there are guidelines regarding the recommending doses of Vitamin D for supplementation and maintenance in bone health, these strategies are unknown in those with inflammatory bowel disease. The investigators seek to determine a dosing strategy for this population using doses within the recommended guidelines for bone health.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which includes ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), are chronic relapsing inflammatory conditions of the gastrointestinal tract. IBD is thought to result from a complex interaction between genetic, immune, microbial and environmental factors. The role of vitamin D in bone health and calcium homeostasis is well documented. However, emerging data suggests that vitamin D may also regulate immune responses, which may play a role in the pathogenesis and disease activity of IBD. The investigators seek to identify CD or UC patients with mild disease or in clinical remission who have vitamin D levels &lt;30 ng/ml and not on any type of vitamin repletion therapy. The investigators will randomize the participants into one of four arms: (1) Oral 50,000 vitamin D IU every week for 12 weeks (2) Oral 50,000 vitamin D weekly for 12 weeks than oral 800 vitamin D IU/d (3) Oral 50,000 vitamin D IU weekly for 12 weeks then 5,000 vitamin D IU/d (4) Oral 5,000 vitamin D IU/d and check vitamin D levels and inflammatory markers as part of standard of care follow- up every 3 months for nine months. Every participant will receive dietary counseling throughout the study duration. Our aim is to identify an optimal dosing strategy for repletion and maintenance of vitamin D levels in the subset of IBD patients. Based on clinical experience, doses higher than the recommended doses for bone health are needed to achieve and maintain optimal levels of Vitamin D in IBD patients, even patients are in remission or do not have small bowel (malabsorption) involvement.</detailed_description>
