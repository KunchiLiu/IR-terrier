	<brief_summary>The Hearing Resources and Outcomes in the Emergency Department Pilot (HERO-ED Pilot), gathers preliminary data and hones procedures and measures, prior to undertaking HERO-ED. Since the HERO-ED Pilot does not involve random assignment (no control group), it will not test device effectiveness. However, the HERO-ED Pilot will test device acceptability and use. It will also provide preliminary data on, and allow us to fine-tune, the measures of effectiveness that we plan to use in HERO-ED</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hearing Resources and Outcomes in the Emergency Department (HERO-ED)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objectives are: 1. Measure the feasibility of in-ED hearing screening using HHIE-S and a handheld audiometer, among low-acuity11 ED patients age â‰¥75 years, by quantifying the proportion of eligible patients who complete hearing screening. 2. Test whether low-acuity older ED patients who screen positive for significant hearing loss (&gt; 40 dB HL bilaterally and HHIE-S &gt; 24) and are provided a hearing assistance device (HAD) use that device during the ED visit. 3. Test whether patients who are given a hearing assistance device will report ability as opposed to disability in hearing and understanding, using a six-item questionnaire adapted from a study by Cox et al. 4. Test whether those who are given a hearing assistance device will report being prepared for post-discharge care, using an adapted subset of the Care Transitions Measures (CTM). 5. Assess patient understanding of the HAD survey items within the post-use survey.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>low acuity clinical presentation (Emergency Severity Index11 triage criteria of 4 or 5, which indicates a high likelihood of being discharged home from the Emergency Department). Patients using hearing aids will not be excluded. Lack of capacity to consent, as defined by the patient's ability to satisfactorily answer the questions outlined in the Evaluation to Sign Consent form (ESC) mentioned in the protocol. A legal representative/family member will not be able to consent for the patient in this study.</criteria>
