	<brief_summary>One-third to one-half of patients with AML relapse and in general relapsed AML patients have a poor prognosis. The treatment of relapsed AML consists of induction chemotherapy followed by Allogenic Stem Cell Transplant (ASCT). However, at present there is no standard salvage chemotherapy regimen for relapsed AML, as no study has shown any one regimen to be significantly superior. Anthracyclines, Fludarabine, Etoposide and cytarabineare active agents in AMLand have been used as monotherapy and in combination in refractory and relapsed AML patients. According to previous studies the present CR rate of different regimens ranges from 50-70%. A retrospective analysis (unpublished) conducted at IRCH, AIIMS on relapsed AML patients treated with ADE (Cytarabine, Daunorubicin and Etoposide) chemotherapy showed the CR rates of approximately 70%. Therefore, we have planned this study to test the efficacy and toxicity of ADE induction chemotherapy in relapsed AML patients in a prospective manner.</brief_summary>
