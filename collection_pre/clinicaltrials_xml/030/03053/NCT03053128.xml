	<brief_summary>Coronary heart disease (CHD) is a public health care challenge. There are three types of treatment for CHD, medication, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and coronary artery bypass graft (CABG). However, some end-stage CHD patients lost the chance to get those treatment. Cardiac shock wave therapy (CSWT) is a new developed therapy for these patients, which is used in tens of countries all over the world. Safety, invasiveness, effectiveness is its advantage. Ischemia condition can be improved after CSWT. There are only three cities in China run the program of CSWT, which are Kunming, Beijing and Shanghai. The investigators designed a randomized double-blind study to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of CSWT.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Coronary heart disease (CHD) is a public health care challenge, which lead to 3.5 millions of people died in China every year. There are three types of treatment for CHD, medication, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and coronary artery bypass graft (CABG). However, some end-stage CHD patients with severe cardiac ischemia lost the chance to get those treatment. Their quality of life is influenced by recurrent angina. Cardiac shock wave therapy (CSWT) is a new developed therapy for these patients, which is used in tens of countries all over the world. German and Japan are the countries earliest used CSWT. Safety, invasiveness, effectiveness is its advantage. Ischemia condition can be improved after CSWT by objective examination. New small vessels generation on ischemia area was found on mice and pig model. There are only three cities in China run the program of CSWT, that are Kunming, Beijing and Shanghai. Beijing hospital has the only CSWT machine in Beijing. The investigators designed a randomized double-blind study to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of CSWT.</detailed_description>
