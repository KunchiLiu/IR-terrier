	<criteria>Subjects 18 years or older at the time of signing informed consent Subjects who have provided written informed consent or their informed consent has been provided by legal guardian Subjects who meet the clinical diagnosis criteria for hospitalacquired bacterial pneumonia (HABP),ventilatorassociated bacterial pneumonia (VABP), or healthcareassociated bacterial pneumonia (HCABP) 1. HABP is defined as an acute bacterial pneumonia in a subject hospitalized for more than 48 hours or developing within 7 days after discharge from a hospital. Subjects may experience acute respiratory failure and require mechanical ventilation for HABP (ventilatedHABP). 2. VABP is defined as an acute bacterial pneumonia in a subject receiving mechanical ventilation via an endotracheal tube for a minimum of 48 hours. 3. HCABP is defined as an acute bacterial pneumonia in a subject who was hospitalized in an acute care hospital for 2 or more days within 90 days of the infection; has been residing in a nursing home or longterm care facility; received intravenous antibiotic therapy, chemotherapy, or wound care or attended a hospital clinic or hemodialysis clinic within the past 30 days of the current infection. All subjects must fulfill at least 1 of the following clinical criteria at screening: 1. New onset or worsening of pulmonary symptoms or signs, such as cough, dyspnea, tachypnea (eg, respiratory rate greater than 25 breaths/minute), expectorated sputum production, or requirement for mechanical ventilation 2. Hypoxemia (eg, a partial pressure of oxygen [PaO2] less than 60 mm Hg while the subject is breathing room air, as determined by arterial blood gas [ABG], or worsening of the ratio of the PaO2 to the fraction of inspired oxygen [PaO2/FiO2]) 3. Need for acute changes in the ventilator support system to enhance oxygenation, as determined by worsening oxygenation (ABG or PaO2/FiO2) or needed changes in the amount of positive endexpiratory pressure 4. New onset of or increase in (quantity or characteristics) suctioned respiratory secretions, demonstrating evidence of inflammation and absence of contamination All subjects must have at least 1 of the following signs: 1. Documented fever (eg, core body temperature [tympanic, rectal, esophageal] greater than or equal to 38°C [100.4°F]) 2. Hypothermia (eg, core body temperature [tympanic, rectal, esophageal] less than or equal to 35°C [95.0°F]) 3. Leukocytosis with total peripheral white blood cell (WBC) count greater than or equal to 10,000 cells/mm³ 4. Leukopenia with total peripheral WBC count less than or equal to 4500 cells/mm³ 5. Greater than 15% immature neutrophils (bands) noted on peripheral blood smear All subjects must have a chest radiograph during screening showing the presence of new or progressive infiltrate(s) suggestive of bacterial pneumonia. A computed tomography (CT) scan in the same time window showing the same findings could also be acceptable All subjects must have evidence of a Gramnegative bacterial infection involving the lower respiratory tract Subjects who have a known or suspected communityacquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP), atypical pneumonia, viral pneumonia, or chemical pneumonia (including aspiration of gastric contents, inhalation injury) Other exclusions based on the prescribing information of meropenem or linezolid, prior antibiotic usage, age, and pregnancy.</criteria>
