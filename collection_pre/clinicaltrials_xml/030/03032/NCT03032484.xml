	<brief_title>TVB- 2640 in Combination With Bevacizumab in Patients With First Relapse of High Grade Astrocytoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Eligible patients will be randomized into 2 separate arms: - Arm number one will receive Bevacizumab every 2 weeks in combination with TVB-2640 from day 1 until day 28 of the first cycle. - Arm number two will receive Bevacizumab alone every 2 weeks, from on days 1 and 15 of the first until day 28 of the first cycle. - MR-Spectroscopy will be obtained on all patients (both arms) at day 28 of first cycle. - Starting on cycle 2 day 1, all patients will converge to a single arm and will continue to receive bevacizumab every 2 weeks in combination with TVB-2640. Every cycle will last 28 days.</detailed_description>
