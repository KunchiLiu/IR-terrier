	<detailed_description>In addition to the trial vaccine (IPV-Al SSI or IPV SSI), the trial subjects will receive vaccinations with the Philippine national childhood vaccination programme. The trial vaccine (IPV-Al SSI or IPV SSI) is administered in the RIGHT thigh, where other injectable childhood vaccines are administered in the opposite (LEFT) thigh. There are 6 trial visits: Visit 1 (screening, 1st vaccination and blood sampling visit): written informed consent is obtained. Information on medical history, demographics and concomitant medication is collected, a physical examination is performed and the subject's eligibility is assessed according to the pre-specified in-/exclusion criteria. A pre-vaccination blood sample is taken for polio antibody measurements, and the subject is randomly allocated into one of the 2 groups and vaccinated. If it is not possible to draw a blood sample on Visit 1 the child cannot continue in the trial. The subject is observed for immediate AEs Â½ an hour after all vaccinations. A diary, a ruler and a thermometer are handed out to the parents to record daily the temperature and injection site reactions, during the first 3 days after the vaccinations until resolved and to record any AEs as instructed by the trial staff. 2 days after Visit 1 the trial staff will make a telephone call to the parent(s)/guardian(s) to clarify any questions regarding the AE recording in the diary. Visit 2 (2nd vaccination visit), 28-42 days after Visit 1: contraindications are reviewed, the 2nd vaccination is given, the diary is collected and AEs and concomitant medications (CMs) are recorded. A new diary is handed out. 2 days after Visit 2 the trial staff will make a telephone call to the parent(s)/guardian(s) to clarify any questions regarding the AE recording in the diary. Visit 3 (3rd vaccination visit), 28-42 days after Visit 2: contraindications are reviewed, the 3rd vaccination is given, the diary is collected and AEs and CMs are recorded. A new diary is handed out. 2 days after Visit 3 the trial staff will make a telephone call to the parent(s)/guardian(s) to clarify any questions regarding the AE recording in the diary. Visit 4 (blood sample visit), 28-42 days after Visit 3: a blood sample for polio antibody measurements is taken, the diary is collected, and AEs and CMs are recorded. Visit 5 (4th vaccination and blood sample visit), at 9 months of age (+14 days): a blood sample is taken for polio antibody measurements, contraindications are reviewed, the 4th vaccination is given, and AEs and CMs are recorded. A new diary is handed out. 2 days after Visit 5 the trial staff will make a telephone call to the parent(s)/guardian(s) to clarify any questions regarding the AE recording in the diary. Visit 6 (blood sample and end of trial visit), 28-42 days after Visit 5: a blood sample for polio antibody measurements is taken, the diary is collected, and AEs and CMs are recorded. The end of trial form is completed.</detailed_description>
