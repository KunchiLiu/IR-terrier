	<brief_title>Project IMPACT in Schools to Prevent Asthma Symptoms</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Project IMPACT in schools is a 7 month randomized control intervention pilot trial. Sixty students, ages 6 to 16 years, with moderate to severe asthma, or who utilize acute care facilities frequently for their asthma, will be recruited from 3 urban SBHCs in the fall of 2017. All students will receive NHLBI guideline-based asthma assessments to determine eligibility and proper dosing of preventive medication. The asthma assessment will include spirometry testing. All enrolled students and parents will receive asthma education at the time of enrollment. Eligible students will be randomized to an intervention or usual care group using permuted block randomization stratified by SBHCs. In collaboration with the student's PCP, the SBHCs' mid-level providers will prescribe the preventive medication to the students in the intervention group. These students will receive the morning dose of their preventive medication from the school nurse each school day for the remainder of the school year. Students and their parents will be responsible to administer the evening and non-school day doses. Students randomized to the usual care group will be referred back to their PCP for further asthma management. All participants will be re-evaluated at 1, 3 and 7 months after enrollment, and medication dose adjustments will be made in the intervention group as needed.</detailed_description>
