	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if additional ablation during the first procedure as the result of the ability to medically induce quiet atrial arrhythmias will improve clinical outcome in patients with atrial fibrillation thus decreasing the need for additional ablation procedures.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Adenosine to Assess Complete Conduction Block During Catheter Ablation of Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypothesis: 1. Adenosine reveals incomplete conduction block due to partial tissue injury/stunning during catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation. 2. Identification of incomplete conduction block by adenosine improves clinical outcomes including an increase in efficacy and a decrease in need for repeat procedures after catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation. Objectives: 1. In patients with paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation (AF), the prevalence of Pulmonary Vein (PV) reconnection during adenosine infusion after complete PV isolation using conventional techniques will be determined. 2. Patients will be randomized to further ablation to achieve complete isolation during adenosine infusion vs to no further ablation. 3. Primary endpoint of the study will be freedom from any atrial arrhythmias 6 months after a single ablation procedure in the absence of antiarrhythmic drug therapy. 4. Secondary endpoints will include number of repeat ablation procedures because of documented recurrence of symptomatic AF or atrial flutter/tachycardia, outcome after 2 ablation procedures; Proportion of patients with AF or atrial flutter/tachycardia occuring during the first three months post ablation, prevalence of recovery of conduction into PVs during repeat ablation procedures in both groups, procedure duration, and incidence of peri-procedural complications including stroke, PV stenosis, cardiac perforation, atrio-esophageal fistulae, and death.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Patients &gt;18 and &lt;75 who are able to give informed consent undergoing atrial fibrillation ablation procedure. 2. Paroxysmal Atrial fibrillation lasting = 7 days which is selfterminating. It is considered recurrent if two or more episodes occur. 3. Failure or unwilling to take class I or III antiarrhythmic drugs 1. History of asthma 2. Patients with severe coronary artery disease, stable/unstable angina, or ongoing myocardial ischemia 3. Previous cardiac surgery ( excluding CABG and mitral valve surgery) 4. Symptomatic congestive heart failure including but not limited to NYHA III/IV and/or documented ejection fraction &lt;40% measured by acceptable cardiac testing, 5. Left atrial diameter &gt;55mm 6. Moderate to severe mitral or aortic valve disease 7. Myocardial infarction within three months of enrollment 8. Congenital heart disease where it increases the risk of an ablative procedure 9. Prior ASD/PFO closure with a device using a percutaneous approach 10. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (LV wall thickness &gt;1.5mm) 11. Pulmonary Hypertension (mean or systolic PA pressure&gt; 50mmHg on Doppler echocardiography 12. Any prior ablation of atrial fibrillation 13. Enrollment in any other arrhythmia protocol 14. Any ventricular arrhythmia being treated where the arrhythmia or management may interfere with this study 15. Active infection or sepsis 16. Any history of cerebrovascular disease including stroke or TIAs 17. Pregnancy or lactation 18. Left atrial thrombus at the time of ablation 19. Untreatable allergy to contrast media 20. Any diagnosis of atrial fibrillation secondary to electrolyte disturbance, thyroid disease, or any other reversible or noncardiovascular causes 21. History of blood clotting(bleeding or thrombotic) abnormalities 22. Known sensitivities to heparin or warfarin 23. Severe COPD (defined as FEV1 &lt;1) 24. Severe comorbidity or poor general physical/mental health that, in opinion of the investigator, will not allow the patient to be a good study candidate (i.e. other disease processes, mental capacity, substance abuse, shortened life expectancy)</criteria>
