	<brief_title>Efficacy of Pethidine, Ketorolac And Xylocaine Gel As Analgesics For Pain Control In Shockwave Lithotripsy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pain perception during shockwave lithotripsy (SWL) is affected by patient-related factors like age, gender, and body habitus moreover, young female patients, anxious and depressed patients or thin patients experience more pain during SWL. Several physical variables influencing treatment-related pain have been identified: the type of the shockwave source, size, and site of stone burden, peak pressure of the shockwaves, diameter of the focal zone, and size of the aperture of the shockwave source reflecting the area of shockwave entry at the skin. Pain relief during SWL is vital, not only to maintain patient comfort and satisfaction, but also to facilitate stone imaging and targeting by reducing patients' movements during successive shock wave impacts. Reduced patient movement enables increase fragmentation efficiency and reduce the risk of procedure-related morbidity. So, a relaxed, cooperative patient during treatment is paramount in maintaining stone targeting for optimal fragmentation. Across 21 centers in the United Kingdom (UK), 17 distinct analgesia regimens were reported in SWL analgesia practice. In 2016 European Association of Urology (EUA) guidelines for SWL Pain control stated that pain control during SWL is necessary to limit pain induced movements and excessive respiratory excursions, However no recommendation for proper analgesia in contrast to clear recommendation for Pain relief in patients with an acute stone episode. The investigators will try in this trial to identify the best efficacious type of analgesia for patient during SWL in this study.</detailed_description>
