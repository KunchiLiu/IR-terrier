	<brief_summary>Many healthy lifestyle interventions have been developed to help people change their activity and diet, lose weight and thus reduce their risk of developing type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and cardiovascular disorders (CVD). However, these interventions often fail to engage their target audience, which undermines their effectiveness in changing behaviour and health outcomes. The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy of a self-directed, website-based intervention to promote physical activity and healthy dietary behaviours. The intervention frames health information from a novel perspective, which our previous work has indicated can help to promote interest in the health information and improve attitudes, self-efficacy and motivation towards physical activity and healthy dietary behaviours. The intervention comprises a website of information resources and personal recording areas to set goals and monitor activity and diet, weekly emails and pedometers. In this trial we aim to see whether the intervention has any impact on people's physical activity and diet, as well as their risk of developing CVD and T2DM. The intervention will be compared with a control condition in which participants will be shown standard resources available on NHS websites. Overweight/obese (BMI 25 - 39.5) males and females aged 35-74 years will be recruited from the community. The active intervention will last 6 weeks (during this period participants will receive weekly emails from the research team) and there will be a 6-week follow-up phase (in which participants will still have access to the website but contact from the research team). Activity, diet, disease risk markers and psychological antecedents of behaviour will be assessed at baseline, post-intervention (6-weeks) and post follow-up (12- weeks).</brief_summary>
