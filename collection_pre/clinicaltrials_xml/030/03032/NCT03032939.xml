	<brief_summary>Intraoperative stress responses (vasoconstriction and changes in heart rate) and postoperative pain can be monitored using photoplethysmography (PPG). PPG measures changes in tissue volume noninvasively. Therefore it can measure acute changes in arterial diameter (vasoconstriction). PPG signal has two components, AC and DC. Effects of noxious stimuli-induced stress responses (vasoconstriction) have not been studied on the DC component of PPG. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a known noxious stimulus (endotracheal intubation) on both the AC and DC components of PPG.</brief_summary>
