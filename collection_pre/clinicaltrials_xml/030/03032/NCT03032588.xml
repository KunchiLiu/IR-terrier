	<criteria>Declared healthy by the investigator on the basis of physical examination, medical history, vital signs and clinical laboratory tests performed at screening. If the results of the serum chemistry panel or hematology are outside the normal reference ranges, the participant may be included only if the investigator judges the abnormalities or deviations from normal to be not clinically significant. This determination must be recorded in the participant's source documents and initialed by the investigator Heterosexual male participants must not engage in intercourse with a female partner of childbearing potential who is not using a highly effective contraceptive method All female participants of childbearing potential must have a negative urine betahuman chorionic gonadotropin (betahCG) pregnancy test at screening and immediately prior to study vaccine administration Willing and able to adhere to the prohibitions and restrictions specified in this protocol Agrees not to donate blood until the Week 4 visit Clinically significant neuropsychiatric, cardiovascular, pulmonary, liver or renal insufficiency (estimated creatinine clearance below 60 milliliter per minute (mL/min) using the CockcroftGault Equation); metabolic, gastrointestinal, urologic, or endocrine disease that is in the opinion of the investigator uncontrolled Any history of malignancy (exceptions are squamous and basal cell carcinomas of the skin and carcinoma in situ of the cervix, or malignancy, which is considered cured with minimal risk of recurrence) Previous severe allergic reaction after vaccination with polio vaccine Known allergies, hypersensitivity, or intolerance to one of the excipients of JNJ64152348, inactivated poliovirus vaccine produced from Sabin poliovirus strains on PER.C6 cells (sIPV) or conventional inactivated poliovirus vaccine produced from Salk poliovirus strains (cIPV) Received any polio vaccine within 6 months before study inclusion</criteria>
