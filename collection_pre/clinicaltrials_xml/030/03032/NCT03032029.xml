	<brief_summary>The European ASV Registry (short name) will investigate the use of Adaptive Servo-Ventilation in non-heart failure conditions. The purpose is to examine the effects of ASV on quality of life, daytime symptoms and sleep, to describe usage patterns of ASV with regards to patient characteristics and to document adverse events related to therapy for a therapy safety analysis. A pilot phase will enrol at least 200 patients to test the feasibility of the registry. After the pilot phase will be completed and an intermediate data analysis had been performed, the registry will be expanded over several countries across Europe with the goal of enrolling up to 1000 patients over a period of 5 years.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>European Registry on Adaptive Servo-Ventilation (ASV) in Sleep-Disordered Breathing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The collection of data will be performed during the course of clinical routine. In regular clinical practice, a first control visit (i.e. Follow-up number one) should occur during the first 6 months. Further follow-up visits are only indicated when the patient is reporting problems during the course of therapy. We recommend FU visit at least once year (after the first routine FU visit). Each patient will be included for 6 months, the total duration of phase 1 of the registry.</detailed_description>
