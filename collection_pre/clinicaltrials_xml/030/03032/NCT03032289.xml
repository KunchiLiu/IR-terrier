	<brief_title>Association Between Active Transport and Acute Myocardial Infarction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a cross sectional ecological study using aggregated data from the existing Myocardial Ischaemia National Audit Project between 2010 and 2013. Data on active transport according to local authority was obtained from the UK 2001 and 2011 census, whilst important confounders including deprivation levels, prevalence of obesity and population smoking estimates were obtained from Public Health England. In addition to investigating the association between active transport and AMI, we also studied the extent to which the components of active transport, cycling and walking, were associated with AMI, and investigated whether any associations were contingent on a time lag effect between the dates of exposure to active transport and indecent AMI.</detailed_description>
