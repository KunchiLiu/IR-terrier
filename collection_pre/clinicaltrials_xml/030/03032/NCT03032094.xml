	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to test if the thickness of the graft taken from the roof of the mouth, has a significant effect on the amount of attached tissue and the amount of root coverage that are attained when treating a single tooth with gingival recession.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Connective Tissue Grafting for Single Tooth Recession &amp; the Impact of the Thickness of the Palatal Harvest Tissue</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal of the study is to determine if the thickness of a tissue graft taken from the roof of the mouth, used to cover the exposed root of a tooth, affects the overall outcome of the root coverage, the health of the resulting tissue, as well as postoperative pain as reported by the patient. Connective tissue grafts will be harvested in different thicknesses, and results of the procedures will be compared. Qualified subjects will undergo a root coverage procedure, after random assignment to one of the groups. Regular recall visits to monitor healing at intervals of 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month, and 3 months will be scheduled. Subjects will be asked to fill out patient response forms regarding pain and other symptoms at these visits. Photographs will be taken.</detailed_description>
