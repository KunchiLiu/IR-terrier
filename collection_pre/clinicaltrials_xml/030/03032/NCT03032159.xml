	<brief_summary>Text2Breathe (T2B) is a randomized controlled trial aimed at improving communication between parents and their children's' primary care providers about asthma. The overarching goal of this study is to reduce disparities among a population with high rates of pediatric asthma morbidity. The investigators are testing the efficacy of a short message service (SMS)-enhanced health communication (HC) intervention ("Text2Breathe") designed to equip urban, low-income parents with tools for communicating effectively with their children's primary care provider (PCP).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Potentially eligible participants are approached and screened in person during an admission of their child to the emergency department for asthma care. Those participants randomized to the intervention will receive additional education on effective communication with their child's primary care provider (PCP). These participants will also receive educational text messages for three months after their initial visit. Text messages will include education on effectively communicating with their child's provider and general asthma information. Both the control group and intervention group will receive text message reminders to schedule regular follow up visits with their PCP and get an annual flu shot. Both groups will be contacted for follow up phone interviews at 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months.</detailed_description>
