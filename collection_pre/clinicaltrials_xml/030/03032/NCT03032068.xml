	<brief_summary>Home monitoring technologies have recently emerged in many different areas of healthcare. These technologies are being used to provide rehabilitation to patients, and to prevent, identify, and manage complications. The investigators are proposing a method to monitor and communicate with patients during the first 12 weeks after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) using an electronic home-based patient monitoring system with unique connectivity capabilities and prescriptive controls. The investigators will prospectively, electronically capture range of motion and gait parameters at specified intervals using Bluetooth sensors worn by the patient. The unique in-home patient monitoring platform will be utilized by 10 TKA patients once they return home following surgery. The investigators hypothesize that the use of an internet based home patient monitoring technology platform will reliably provide information related to the patients' pain and function and enhance patient feedback and communication after TKA. The hypothesis will be tested with the following aim: 1) To test the reliability of all technology utilized within the patient's home including but not limited to the sensors, the communication controller, the patient interface (Android tablet) and the internet by prospectively comparing between data collected through the home monitoring technology and traditional clinical measurements taken during physical therapy and surgical follow-up visits.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Home Monitoring After Primary Total Knee Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Over one million primary total hip and total knee arthroplasty (TKA) surgeries are being performed annually in the U.S. and this number is expected to increase over the next seven years, along with a simultaneously projected shortage of trained orthopaedic surgeons to care for these patients. This proposal addresses the optimization of the surgeons' clinical time through utilization of innovative home based technologies to monitor and communicate with patients during the first 12 weeks after total knee arthroplasty. This will be accomplished by establishing home monitoring connectivity with novel technology and measure validated patient-reported outcomes, knee ROM and gait parameters in a postoperative TKA patient's native living environment. It will allow the investigators to prospectively, electronically capture clinically relevant TKA outcomes at the patient's home and provide insight into postoperative rehabilitation progress, predictors of suboptimal clinical outcomes, and guide future randomized controlled trial development to improve outcomes.</detailed_description>
