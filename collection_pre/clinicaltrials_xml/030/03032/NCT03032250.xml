	<brief_title>Prepare to Care, A Supported Self-Management Intervention for Head and Neck Cancer CaregiversHead and Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess feasibility (accrual, participation, and retention) and acceptability of a supported self-management intervention for psycho-education and stress management skills building designed for informal caregivers (n=20) of head and neck cancer (HNC) patients undergoing radiotherapy (RT). II. To obtain preliminary data on caregiver intermediate (self-efficacy for [a] coping with cancer and [b] abbreviated progressive muscle relaxation) and outcome variables (burden, psychological distress, quality of life) before and after the intervention. III. To refine intervention procedures and materials for future studies by examining qualitative data from caregivers and interventionist notes. IV. To refine intervention procedures and materials for future studies by examining quantitative data regarding module utilization. OUTLINE: Caregivers watch introduction video on a digital video disc (DVD) over 10 minutes at baseline. Caregivers receive Prepare to Care kit including 8 workbook modules and complete at least 1 module over 30-45 minutes each week. Caregivers also attend interventionist session over 10-30 minutes weekly.</detailed_description>
