	<brief_summary>This study implements an extended (post marked) examination of the efficacy of a proactive auto-CPAP algorithm, which is based on the forced oscillation technique (FOT) in a sample of patients with predominantly obstructive sleep apnea. The auto-CPAP algorithm examined in this study is implemented in the medical devices prisma20A and prismaLAB (LÃ¶wenstein Medical Technology).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Extended Evaluation of the Efficacy of a Proactive FOT-based Auto-CPAP Algorithm</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea and who comply with inclusion criteria of the study will be informed about the possibility of participation. Following informed and written consent, participants will undergo a PSG-diagnostic night according to clinical routine, followed by an auto-CPAP treatment night with a prismaLINE device (prismaLAB or prisma20A). The device settings applied in the treatment night are defined by the study protocol (see interventions). Following the auto-CPAP treatment night, study participation is completed. Any following treatment and patient care is administered according to clinical routine. Primary and secondary outcome measures of sleep stage and respiratory event indices are evaluated at diagnostic night and auto-CPAP treatment night. The enrollment consists of two phases. During phase 1 (training phase) 10 participants are enrolled and complete the study protocol. Phase 1 serves as a training phase to establish a common standard of data quality and acquisition. Data of the training phase are not included in the statistical analysis. Following the training phase the efficacy of the auto-CPAP algorithm is evaluated in a sample of 54 participants.</detailed_description>
