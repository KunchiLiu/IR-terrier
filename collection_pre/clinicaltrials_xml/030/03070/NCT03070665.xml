	<brief_summary>Endoscopic submucosal dissection(ESD) is a prominent minimally invasive operation technique for treating early gastrointestinal tumor. But promoting ESD is uneasy because of its complications such as postoperative bleeding, perforation and so on. So if we decrease the rate of postoperative bleeding, ESD might be better popularized. Some study indicated that hypertension was the independent risk factor of postoperative bleeding. Endoscopic center of Fudan University Zhongshan Hospital is a rich experienced medical unit in doing ESD operation in China. Referring to our experience, if we can use some special methods to find the potential bleeding spot which is not obvious during ESD operation and we coagulate it precisely, then we may control the risk of postoperative bleeding. Based on the above hypothesis, our team designed this study to examine whether increasing blood pressure during gastric ESD could help to control the risk of postoperative bleeding.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>A. The indications for ESD for gastric neoplasms, such as intramucosal gastric cancer and adenoma, include intramucosal differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma of any size without ulceration or signs of submucosal invasion and intramucosal differentiatedtype adenocarcinoma of less than 3 cm with an ulcer scar. The histology, tumor location, and depth of invasion fulfilled the criteria of the Japanese Research Society for Gastric Cancer. B. The eligible patients' blood coagulation function should be normal without any associated medicine influenced. A. Previously treated by radical gastrectomy. B. Pregnant or on breast feeding. C. Patients who are unwilling or unable to provide informed consent, such as those with psychiatric problem, drug abuse or alcoholism. D. Coagulopathy: liver cirrhosis, thrombocytopenia. E. Antiplatelet agents. Allergic to PPI or norepinephrine. F. Patients with sever hypertension(systolic pressureï¼ž180mmHg), or the hypotensor cann't control blood pressure suitably. G. Patients with cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events within 6 months.</criteria>
