	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of enfortumab vedotin (ASG-22CE) when administered intravenously to Japanese subjects with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma. This study will also assess the immunogenicity as defined by the incidence of anti-drug antibody (ADA) and anti-tumor activity of enfortumab vedotin (ASG-22CE) when administered intravenously to Japanese subjects with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of Enfortumab Vedotin in Japanese Subjects With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Urothelial Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All subjects will receive a single 30 minute intravenous (IV) infusion of enfortumab vedotin (ASG-22CE) once weekly for 3 weeks of every 4 weeks (i.e., on Days 1, 8, and 15). A cycle is 28 days.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subject must have histologically confirmed, locally advanced (TNM classification T3b and any N; or T and N23) or metastatic Transitional Cell Carcinoma of the Urothelium (TCCU) (i.e., cancer of the bladder, renal pelvis, ureter, or urethra). Subjects with Urothelial Carcinoma with squamous differentiation or mixed cell types are eligible. Subject must be able to submit a tumor tissue samples for Nectin4 expression analysis at central laboratory. Subject must have failed at least one prior chemotherapy regimen for advanced disease. Urothelial and bladder cancer subjects are not required to have failed prior chemotherapy regimen if considered unfit for cisplatinbased chemotherapy. Subject must have measurable disease according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor (RECIST) (version 1.1). Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1. Preexisting sensory neuropathy Grade ≥ 2. Preexisting motor neuropathy Grade ≥ 2. Uncontrolled central nervous system metastasis that requires active treatment. Any anticancer therapy within 14 days prior to the first dose of study drug. Subjects with preexisting immunotherapyrelated adverse events requiring high doses of systemic steroids are not eligible.</criteria>
