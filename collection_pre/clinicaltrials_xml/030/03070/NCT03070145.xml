	<brief_title>Exercise Intervention Among Men With Prostate Cancer Initiating Androgen Deprivation Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is a key treatment of prostate cancer. While this therapy improves prostate cancer outcomes, ADT also has a variety of short- and long-term adverse effects, including increased body weight, loss of lean muscle mass, reductions in quality of life, and increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Studies have shown that among men with prostate cancer, physical activity is associated with improved outcomes, including a reduced risk of mortality, from prostate cancer and other causes. Our hypothesis is that physical activity will improve some of the physical and emotional side effects associated with ADT. Physical activity, such as brisk walking and moderate strength training, offers a lifestyle factor that may improve some of the side effects, and is low-cost and easy to do. The investigators are conducting this study to evaluate the impact and feasibility of a 12-week moderate-intensity aerobic and strength training exercise intervention, including a virtual component. The intervention includes brisk walking and moderate strength training, and involves home-based exercises, in-person sessions with an oncology-trained exercise physiologist, optional group training sessions, and weekly training goals. Participants will have access to a personalized web-based platform called Postwire, which will include videos of training sessions, and will allow participants to easily communicate with the study staff and with other study participants.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Written informed consent prior to any studyrelated procedures History of histologically confirmed prostate cancer Initiating or within 30 days of initiating ADT ECOG performance status of 0 or 1 At least 18 years old and no older than 80 years Physically able to exercise and have physician consent from their treating physician to start a physical activity program English speaking and able to read English Have access to and are able to use the internet at a minimum of once per week Sufficient proficiency and confidence to use the internet and follow videobased instructions, as determined by the eligibility questionnaire to be completed by the participant Willingness to be randomized Selfreported inability to walk 2 blocks (at any pace) Currently physically active (&gt; 90 minutes of moderate or vigorous physical activity per week) as determined by Leisure Score Index of Godin LeisureTime Exercise Questionnaire [LSI]) Previously on ADT Radiologic evidence of distant disease Cardiovascular, respiratory or musculoskeletal disease or joint problems that preclude moderate physical activity. Examples would include unstable angina, recent myocardial infarction, oxygendependent pulmonary disease, and osteoarthritis requiring imminent joint replacement. Moderate arthritis that does not preclude physical activity is not a reason for ineligibility. Psychiatric disorders or conditions that would preclude participation in the study intervention (e.g., untreated major depression or psychosis, substance abuse, severe personality disorder)</criteria>
