	<brief_summary>This will be a 3 year randomized, double blind, placebo controlled trial of 7 days of oral prednisone in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients receiving intravenous (IV) antibiotic treatment for a pulmonary exacerbation at the Hospital for Sick Children, St Michael's Hospital, St Paul's Hospital, British Columbia Children's Hospital, Hotel Dieu Hospital and Ste Justine Hospital, Canada. The intervention will be oral prednisone 2 mg/kg/day (max 60 mg) divided twice daily for 7 days as an adjunctive therapy for pulmonary exacerbations in CF patients who have not recovered their baseline forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) after 7 days of IV antibiotic treatment. The primary outcome will be the proportion of subjects who achieve &gt;90% of their baseline FEV1 % predicted at day 14 of IV antibiotic treatment for a pulmonary exacerbation in each treatment arm.</brief_summary>
