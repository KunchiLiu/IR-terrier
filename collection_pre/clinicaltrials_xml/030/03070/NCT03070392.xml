	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy of IMCgp100 Versus Investigator Choice in Advanced Uveal Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase II study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of IMCgp100 compared with Investigator's Choice (dacarbazine, ipilimumab or pembrolizumab) in HLA-A*0201 positive adult patients with advanced UM treated in the first line setting with no prior systemic or liver-directed chemo-, radio- or immune-therapy administered in the advanced setting (prior surgical resection of liver metastases and adjuvant systemic therapy are acceptable). Comparison of the IMCgp100 efficacy results in this Phase II study will be made with the concurrently randomized arm (Investigator's Choice) with a primary endpoint of overall survival (OS) and secondary efficacy endpoints of progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR), duration of response (DOR), and disease control rate (DCR).</detailed_description>
