	<brief_title>Anatomical and Functional Outcomes of Perigee and Apogee Mesh in Total Pelvic Floor Reconstruction Versus Gynecare Prolift</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pelvic organ prolapse is defined as a downward descent of the pelvic organs that results in the protrusion of vagina, uterus, or both. The investigators designed a prospective study in this article to evaluate the efficacy, the life quality and the complications of two different meshes of type I (one is Perigee/Apogee, the other is named Gynecare prolift) versus traditional surgery. The investigators also studied the influence of some surgical procedures on the prognosis. In this study，The investigators divided the patients randomly into three groups :the group A was a total of 91 patients who accepted transvaginal hysterectomy and total pelvic floor reconstruction combined Perigee and Apogee polypropylene mesh(PA)；the group B was a total of 97 patients who accepted transvaginal hysterectomy and total pelvic floor reconstruction with Gynecare prolift polypropylene mesh；the group C was a total of 70 patients who accepted transvaginal hysterectomy and anterior and posterior vaginal wall repair without any mesh.The investigators did POP-Q measurements and questionnaire preoperatively and postoperatively and recorded volume of bleeding，day of postoperative indwelling catheter and the mesh complications。</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients with stage III ~ IV degree of anterior and posterior vaginal wall prolapse and uterine prolapse (total pelvic floor prolapse) by the Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification System (POPQ) were included Simple anterior or posterior wall prolapse, simple uterine prolapse, combined with stress urinary incontinence, overactive bladder (OAB), pelvic floor repair surgery history and recurrent patients Local or systemic conditions that would preclude surgery or affect healing such as restricted leg motion (inability to conform to the lithotomy position) Vaginal bleeding;coagulation disorders Infection,or uncontrolled hypertension and diabetes mellitus Pelvic cancer and radiation to the pelvic area in the previous 6 months. Also women of reproductive age, and planning of pregnancy were also excluded for mesh usage.</criteria>
