	<criteria>Male or female caucasian patients ≥ 18 years of age Diagnosis of high myopia secondary to an anteriorposterior elongation of the bulbus confirmed by ocular examination in either eye using the following criteria: Ocular ultrasonography or biometry demonstrating anteriorposterior elongation measurement ≥ 26 mm abnormal change in retinal tissue by SDOCT that are attributed to be caused by high myopia as shown in Table 42 of the protocol in the investigator's discretion confirmed by the reading centre Patients with Diabetes mellitus of any grade Patients showing signs of AgeRelated Macular Degeneration (AMD), e.g. drusen, characteristic changes in fundus (with shaping or extension of hemorrhages, fibrosis, exudative areas) in either eye Acute neovascularization (CNV or iris neovascularization) and intra or subretinal fluid in either eye at the time of enrolment. History of inactive CNV in study eye. Inactive CNV of fellow eye is allowed if treatment was performed more than 12 months before enrolment. Any anti vascular endothelial growth factor' (antiVEGF) or Verteporfin treatment in study eye and antiVEGF or Verteporfin treatment less than 12 months before enrolment in fellow eye History of systemic anti vascular endothelial growth factor' (antiVEGF) therapy Cataract that would prevent an accurate measurement of the axial length of the study eye Other protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply</criteria>
