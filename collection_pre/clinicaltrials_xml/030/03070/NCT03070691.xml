	<brief_summary>This 22 week study will assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of LDE225 versus vehicle when applied topically to basal cell carcinoma (BCC) in patients with NBCCS. Patients will treat multiple BCCs for up to 12 weeks. Treatment success is defined as complete clinical clearance and complete histological clearance in BCCs.</brief_summary>
