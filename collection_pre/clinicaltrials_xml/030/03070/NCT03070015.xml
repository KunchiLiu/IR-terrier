	<brief_summary>The primary purpose of this study (Part A) is to assess changes in body weight and body circumference parameters that are achievable after 4 weeks on the Nutrisystem program compared to a self-directed diet (i.e. Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension or DASH). In Part B, subjects on the Nutrisystem program will be given the option to continue the program for another 8 weeks.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effects of a Commercially Available Weight Loss Program on Body Weight in Overweight Men and Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A randomized, controlled, parallel study design with two parts (Part A and Part B). Study visits include Screening, Randomization, and Weeks 1, 2, 3 and 4. Week 4 serves also as the closeout study visit for Part A. Subjects randomized to the intervention group (i.e., Nutrisystem group) will continue the program for an additional 8 weeks, and include additional study visits at week 8 and 12. Eighty-four (N=84) healthy men and women, matched paired for BMI, will be randomized into one of two groups for 28 days (4 weeks): Nutrisystem program or a self-directed Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension ("DASH"). All subjects in the Nutrisystem group who complete Part A will continue on the Nutrisystem program for an additional 8 weeks (Part B). Daily energy intake targets for each group will include a 1000 kcal/day diet for both women and men during the first week. After the first week women will follow a 1200 kcal/day diet and men will follow a 1500 kcal/day diet. Subjects with BMI &gt; 40 will add approximately 200 additional calories to their diet each day. Body weight and body circumference (Waist, Hip, Chest, Arm &amp; Thigh and Sum of the 5) measures were obtained at baseline and weeks 1, 2, 3, 4 (Part A). And at weeks 8 and 12 for the Nutrisystem group (Part B).</detailed_description>

If a premenopausal female, subject has a history of regular menstrual cycles that range in length from 21 to 35 d, where applicable. Judged to be in good health on the basis of medical history and screening laboratory assessments. Subject understands the study procedures and signs forms providing informed consent to participate in the study and authorization for release of relevant protected health information to the study Investigators.

Subject is on thyroid medication at a dose that is not considered stable. Stable is same dose consistently for at least 90 days. Subject has used any prescription weight loss medications within three months prior to Screening Visit, and any dietary supplements or programs intended to alter body weight within the last four weeks.

Subject has an active gastrointestinal disorder such as peptic ulcer disease or malabsorption syndrome (mild lactose intolerance or gastroesophageal reflux diseases are acceptable).
