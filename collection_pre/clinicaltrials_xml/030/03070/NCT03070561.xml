	<brief_title>Evaluating Peanut Immunotherapy Dissolving Film in Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this study, 15 non-peanut allergic children and adults will be enrolled. At three visits, each at least a day apart, the study product (dissolving film) containing approximately 60 mcg of the major peanut allergen (Ara h 2), equivalent to approximately 1000 mcg of peanut protein, will be placed in one of three areas: the sublingual space, affixed to the buccal mucosa, and in the vestibular space. Concentrations of Ara h2 in saliva collected at several locations over several time points in the mouth will be analyzed by ELISA.</detailed_description>
