	<brief_title>The Efficacy and Safety of Caffeic Acid for Esophageal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: More than half of global esophageal cancer cases came from China.80 percentage patients were diagnosed with advanced disease and suffered from the poor outcome.With the development of target therapy among cancers,the overall survival and life quality of patients has been continuous improved recently.However,there had little reports focusing on esophageal cancer target therapy. Caffeic acid as an ordinary drug is used for thrombocytopenia when patient recieved chemotherapy. Newly studies shown caffeic acid can target inhibit GASC1 expression, and GASC1 is confirmed to be a new oncogene in esophageal cancer. Aim: to investigate the efficiency and safety of caffeic acid in chinese advanced esophageal squamous cell cancer. Methods: 300 advanced ESCC patients will be randomized to two arms: CA group (recieving coffeic acid treatment) or placebo group.In CA group, patients will recieve coffeic acid treatment: 300mg, tid, po; in placebo group, the same shape placebo tablets will be deliveried to patients. 1 years follow-up for both groups patients.Patients in both arms can receive any other ways of anti cancer therapy in the same time. Primary endpoints: 3 months PFS; Second endpoints: 1 year OS</detailed_description>
