	<brief_summary>At recent, the number of patients who underwent sedated esophagogastroduodenoscopy has been on the increase. For such patients, whether topical pharyngeal anesthesia is needed remains to be controversial. European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy, European Society of Gastroenterology and Endoscopy Nurses and Associates, and the European Society of Anaesthesiology Guideline for non-anesthesiologist administration of propofol for GI endoscopy have not made any recommendation, because the role of pharyngeal anesthesia during propofol sedation for upper digestive endoscopy has not been assessed. Our study aimed at investigating whether topical lidocaine pharyngeal anesthesia could benefit patients who underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy under propofol sedation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Topical Pharyngeal Anesthesia in Sedated Esophagogastroduodenoscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Propofol sedation has been widely applied in endoscopic examinations. For such patients, whether lidocaine topical pharyngeal anesthesia should be administrated is still in doubt. Considering the fact that lidocaine anesthesia may cause airway narrowing and anaphylaxis, it is important to clarify the role of lidocaine topical pharyngeal anesthesia in esophagogastroduodenoscopy under propofol sedation. Our study could test whether lidocaine topical pharyngeal anesthesia should be performed in sedated esophagogastroduodenoscopy in a randomized controlled trial.</detailed_description>
