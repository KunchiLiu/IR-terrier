	<detailed_description>This is a multicenter, multinational, randomized, 3-arm, double-blind, phase II clinical study with 2400mg Mesalamine, 1200mg Mesalamine or placebo in LS patients for a 2-year treatment. 540 tumor free carriers of a known genetic mutation in a major MMR gene (including patients in which the polyps are endoscopically removed) will be randomized 1:1:1 (180 each) to receive 2400mg Mesalamine, 1200mg Mesalamine or placebo. Patients will be identified through local or national registries and through collaboration with sites. Tumor free patients, assessed by white light high resolution colonoscopy, will be randomized to the study. A serum and stool sample will be taken to identify for Mesalamine compliance and potential biomarkers. Biopsies of the normal tissue of ascending colon and rectum will be taken at the first and the last colonoscopy. The aim of the study is to investigate the effect of regular treatment with Mesalamine on the occurrence of colonic neoplasia, tumor multiplicity (the number of detected adenomas/carcinomas) and tumor progression in LS patients. A 50% reduction of the occurrence of neoplasia in Mesalamine-treated patients is expected. Tumor multiplicity and tumor progression (severity of the neoplastic lesions) will be investigated.</detailed_description>

Patients with history of stage 3 and 4 colorectal cancer (CRC) are excluded Presence of metastatic disease Regular use of aspirin: daily use of â‰¥100mg in more than 3 continuous months within the last year Regular use of NSAIDs or COX2 inhibitors: daily use in more than 3 continuous months within the last year Hypersensitivity to 5ASA Patients after total or subtotal colectomy Colorectal surgery within the previous 6 months Unwillingness to participate or who is considered incompetent to give an informed consent Pregnant or breastfeeding women Participation in another clinical study investigating another IMP within 1 month prior to screening Renal insufficiency (GFR &lt;30ml/min/1.73m2) Severe liver disease or liver failure (elevation of liver enzymes above 3xULN) Current or history of serious psychiatric disorder or alcohol/drug abuse that in the opinion of the investigator may impact the assessment of safety, efficacy or protocol adherence Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or ability to comply with study procedures, IMP administration and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the subject inappropriate for entry into this study.</criteria>
