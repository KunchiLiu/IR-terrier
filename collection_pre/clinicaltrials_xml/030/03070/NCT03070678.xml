	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: To assess the effect of multiple dose mefenamic acid on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of sotagliflozin and its metabolite in healthy male and female subjects. Secondary Objectives: - To assess total 24 hour urinary glucose excretion (UGE) after 400 mg sotagliflozin alone and in combination with mefenamic acid in healthy male and female subjects. - To assess the safety and tolerability of sotagliflozin alone and in combination with mefenamic acid in healthy male and female subjects.</brief_summary>
