	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II/III trial studies docetaxel, antiandrogen therapy, and radiation therapy to see how well it works compared with antiandrogen therapy and radiation therapy alone in treating patients with prostate cancer that has been removed by surgery. Androgen can cause the growth of prostate cells. Antihormone therapy may lessen the amount of androgen made by the body. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as docetaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving antiandrogen therapy and radiation therapy with or without docetaxel after surgery may kill any remaining tumor cells.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Antiandrogen Therapy and Radiation Therapy With or Without Docetaxel in Treating Patients With Prostate Cancer That Has Been Removed by Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the benefit of docetaxel as measured by improvement in freedom from progression (phase II) and subsequently metastasis free survival (phase III) when given in combination with radiation and androgen deprivation in treatment of high risk prostate cancer post-radical prostatectomy. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess overall survival. II. To assess local time to progression. III. To assess undetectable prostate-specific antigen (PSA) with a non-castrate testosterone at 2.5 years post treatment. IV. To assess the utility of genomic profiling in making adjuvant therapy decisions post-prostatectomy. V. To assess toxicity of docetaxel in the post-operative setting when combined with radiation and androgen deprivation therapy. VI. To assess treatment response by genomically defined sub-groups of prostate cancer patients. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms. ARM I: Patients receive androgen deprivation therapy comprising leuprolide acetate, goserelin acetate, bicalutamide, flutamide, or nilutamide for 6 months. Beginning 8 weeks after the start of androgen deprivation therapy, patients receive external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) for 7.5 weeks. ARM II: Patients receive androgen deprivation therapy and EBRT as in Arm I. Within 4-6 weeks after completion of radiation therapy, patients receive docetaxel intravenously (IV) on day 1 of every 21 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unexpected toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years, then every 6 months for 3 years, and then yearly.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients postprostatectomy with baseline Gleason &gt;= 7 (per prostatectomy pathology) and baseline PSA nadir &gt;= 0.2 ng/ml obtained prior to step 1 registration Baseline testosterone level obtained post prostatectomy prior to step 1 registration Pathologically (histologically) proven diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the prostate as confirmed at time of prostatectomy; prostatectomy must have been performed =&lt; 365 days (1 year) prior to step 1 registration Primary treatment with radical prostatectomy Any type of radical prostatectomy is permitted, including retropubic, perineal, laparoscopic or robotically assisted Prior ablative treatment for treatment of benign prostatic hypertrophy or focal highintensity focused ultrasound therapy (HIFU) prior to prostatectomy is allowed Prior androgen deprivation (luteinizing hormonereleasing hormone [LHRH] agonist and/or nonsteroidal antiandrogen) is allowed if discontinued at least 90 days prior to study enrollment and given for =&lt; 90 days duration; finasteride or dutasteride must be stopped before treatment but should not determine eligibility; for patients on prior LHRH analogs, the discontinuation date should be calculated based the expected duration of the sustained release injection, not simply the injection date of the drug Pathologically proven to be lymph node negative by pelvic lymphadenectomy (pN0) or lymph node status pathologically unknown (undissected pelvic lymph nodes [pNx]) Any pTstage based on American Joint Committee on Cancer 7th edition is acceptable for study entry based on the following diagnostic workup: History/physical examination within 60 days prior to step 1 registration No distant metastases, based upon the following minimum diagnostic workup: A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis (with contrast if renal function is acceptable; a CT without contrast is permitted if the patient is not a candidate for contrast) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pelvis within 120 days prior to step 1 registration; lymph nodes will be nonmetastatic unless they measure more than 1.5 cm short axis; Bone scan within 120 days prior to step 1 registration (a sodium fluoride [NaF] positron emission tomography/computed tomography [PET/CT] is an acceptable substitute); if the bone scan is suspicious, a plain xray, CT scan, NaF PET/CT and/or MRI must be obtained to rule out metastasis Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of =&lt;

note that prior chemotherapy for a different cancer is allowable if completed more than two years prior to step 1 registration; prior androgen deprivation is allowed Prior whole gland ablative therapy (i.e. cryoablation or high intensity focused ultrasound [HIFU]) for prostate cancer is allowed; prior focal HIFU or treatment for benign prostatic hypertrophy is allowed Prostatectomy performed greater than 365 days (1 year) prior to step 1 registration Severe and/or active comorbidity defined as follows: History of inflammatory bowel disease History of active hepatitis B or C;
