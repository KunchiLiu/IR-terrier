	<brief_title>Stereotactic Radiotherapy Combined With Chemotherapy or Not for Treatment of Oligometastases in HNSCC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with cancers of aerodigestive tract have metastases limited in their evolution and a pauci-metastatic disease. In these cases, systemic therapy is the standard attitude. However, patients often received chemotherapy in their history and response rates are relatively low. The median survival is between 7 and 11 months with secondary effects and degradation of quality of life. It is a palliative treatment. Data on systemic treatment in the context of a micro-metastatic disease are limited. In contrast, stereotactic irradiation in pauci-metastatic context leads to better local control rates and may sustainedly reduce the progression of metastatic disease. Stereotactic radiotherapy is increasing use in clinical practice for limited metastatic stages (oligo metastatic with 1-3 synchronized metastases). Radiotherapy in this indication has major advantages and a similar efficacy compared with other ablative treatments.</detailed_description>
