	<brief_title>Prospective PuraPlyâ„¢ AM Case Series Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of the case series is to assess the ability of PuraPly AM to meet wound specific treatment goals including management of bioburden, support of granulation tissue formation, and support of wound closure. Patients will undergo clinical assessments and receive the standard of care as determined by the treating physician. The case series is being undertaken to better understand PuraPly AM utilization and subsequent healing outcomes as well as to evaluate the effects of concomitant wound therapy on healing. Patient's participation may involve follow-up for up to 12 weeks following application of PuraPly AM.</detailed_description>
