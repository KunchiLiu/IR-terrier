	<brief_summary>A multicenter clinical randomized controlled trial, comparing of three different regimens of endovenous laser ablation with equal linear endovenous energy density in patients with insufficiency of the great saphenous vein (GSV). The linear endovenous energy density (LEED) is the main value for standardization EVLA. From many studies, it is known the optimum value of the LEED. However, the same LEED may be obtained by varying the ratio between the laser power and the fiber pullback speed. Power decrease can allow to reduce the incidence of adverse effects of endovenous laser ablation, but keep high efficiency.</brief_summary>
