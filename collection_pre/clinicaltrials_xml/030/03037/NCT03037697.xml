	<brief_title>Efficacy of Axial Stability on Improving Gait and Balance Performance in Children With Dyskinetic Cerebral Palsy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of this study will be to evaluate the effect of TheraTogs orthotic undergarment and strapping system on increasing axial stability that will reflect on improving balance and walking performance in children with dyskinetic cerebral palsy. Forty children with dyskinetic CP will be assigned randomly into two groups (A &amp; B). Control group (A) will receive conventional rehabilitation program for postural correction 2 hours/3 sessions weekly/3 successive months. Study group (B) will receive conventional rehabilitation program as in group (A) in addition to wearing Thera Togs soft orthotic undergarment. Patients evaluation will be carried out before and after the intervention programs to assess gait and balance performance using Noraxons myo pressure plate and Biodex balance system.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The levels of gross motor function will be selected between levels I and II according to Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS); have the ability to walk 10 m independently without an orthosis; should be cognitively competent and able to understand and follow instructions; height will be more than 100 cm to fit with the Biodex balance equipment. If participants use an assistive mobility device; GMFCS levels III, IV, and V; fixed contractures of lower limb musculature; hip dislocation; significant spinal deformities.</criteria>
