	<detailed_description>Determine the effect of increased vitamin D supplementation (4000 IU vitamin D3 +prenatal vitamin) on the incidence of gestational diabetes compared to a standard prenatal vitamin among pregnant women at high risk for gestational diabetes. Explore the effect of increased vitamin D supplementation (4000 IU daily + prenatal vitamin), compared to a standard prenatal vitamin, on glycemic control, need for oral hypoglycemic agents and/or insulin, and delivery outcomes among the subset of women who develop gestational diabetes.</detailed_description>
