	<brief_summary>A lot of questions about use of temporary transvenous pacing still remain obscure and there is no effective comparison between use of fluoroscopy versus electrocardiogram/echocardiogram in patients with bradicardias. The aim of the study is to evaluate how long does it take to start the correct cardiac stimulation with transvenous pacing in patients with bradicardias comparing use of fluoroscopy versus electrocardiogram/echocardiogram and compare rates of complications between two methods.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Approximately 150 subjects will be recruited over a planned recruitment period of 18 months. Patients will be submitted to ecchocardiogram using Philips Envisor, and electrocardiogram with Philips Healthcare PageWriter TC30.</detailed_description>
