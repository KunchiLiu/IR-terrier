	<brief_title>Association of Long-term Conditions With Survival Following Heart Attack in England and Wales</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Using observational data from the Myocardial Ischaemia National Audit Project (MINAP) of all hospitalisations for acute myocardial infarction in all acute hospitals in England and Wales, this study aims to determine the extent to which pre-existing long-term conditions are associated with survival following acute myocardial infarction. The study will include an investigation of individual long term conditions for patients with acute myocardial infarction, including chronic heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic renal failure or peripheral vascular disease as well as the combination of such conditions and their resulting impact on long term all-cause mortality (up to 8.4 years). In addition, an investigation of the association of receipt of guideline recommended care for acute myocardial infarction patients with pre-existing long term conditions will be made.</detailed_description>
