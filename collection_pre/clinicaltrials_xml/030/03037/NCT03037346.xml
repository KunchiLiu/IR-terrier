	<brief_summary>The goal of this research study is to learn how well MD Anderson helps patients and their families select and prepare an MPOA. Researchers want to find out if social work counseling and education help to increase the number of patients who complete MPOA documents. They also want to study how counseling and education affects attitudes about medical decision-making, and willingness to take part in these kinds of conversations for patients and their family members and/or caregivers.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patient: If participant agrees to take part in this study, before meeting with the social work counselor, participant will be asked to complete 3 questionnaires about participant's knowledge, attitude, and beliefs about MPOAs. This will take about 15 minutes to complete. Participant will also be asked to complete 8 other surveys that include questions about the following topics: - Demographic information (including participant's name, date of birth, race, religious experience, language of preference, and marital status) - Participant's medical history (including diagnosis and disease status) - Participant's knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs about MPOA - How confident participant is filling out medical forms by participant - Participant's preferences, values, and experience with making medical decisions Some of this information may also be collected from participant's medical record. These questionnaires should take about 23 minutes total to complete. About 3 months later, at a routine clinic visit or by phone, participant will fill out questionnaires about MPOA, participant's values and goals for medical decision making, and participant's willingness to take part in future advanced-care planning discussions. These should take about 17 minutes total to complete. Other Information: Participant should not share participant's answers with participant's family member or caregiver, so that participant's answers do not influence their questionnaire responses. Length of Study: Participation on this study will be over after participant completes the second set of questionnaires at the 3-month follow-up doctor appointment. This is an investigational study. Reviewing participant's medical record and completing a set of surveys at participant's new patient appointment and again 3 months later is the only part of this study that is considered investigational. Up to 180 patient and caregiver pairs will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson. Family/Caregiver: If participant agrees to take part in this study, before meeting with the social work counselor, participant will be asked to complete 7 questionnaires that include questions on the following topics: - Demographic information (such as participant's name, age, race, gender, economic background, and primary language for reading and speaking) - Information about participant's religious faith or belief system - How confident participant is filling out medical forms by participant - Participant's preferences and experience in medical decision-making preferences - Participant's opinion on the patient's values and goals for medical decision-making. These questionnaires should take about 8 minutes total to complete. About 3 months later, participant will fill out the questionnaire about the patient's values and goals for medical decision-making, as well as a questionnaire about participant's willingness to take part in future advanced care planning discussions. These should take about 2 minutes total to complete and can be done at a scheduled clinic visit or by phone. Other Information: Participant should not share participant's answers with the patient, so that participant's answers do not influence their questionnaire responses. Length of Study: Participation on this study will be over after participant completes the second set of questionnaires at the 3-month follow-up doctor appointment. This is an investigational study. Reviewing the patient's medical record and completing a set of surveys at the new patient appointment and again 3 months later is the only part of this study that is considered investigational. Up to 180 patient and caregiver pairs will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>
