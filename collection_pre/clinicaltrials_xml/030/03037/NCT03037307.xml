	<brief_title>A Clinical Bite Force Study of Two Marketed Adhesives Against no Adhesive</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This will be a single centre, randomized, crossover, 3-treatment, 3-period study to compare BF measurements over a 12 hour period of a currently marketed denture adhesive cream based on carbomer technology (test), with a positive control, and a negative/no treatment control. A short questionnaire regarding the flavor and texture characteristics of each denture adhesive after a single use will also be used to generate data for these attributes.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Demonstrates understanding of the study procedures, restrictions and willingness to participate as evidenced by voluntary written informed consent and has received a signed and dated copy of the informed consent form. Aged between 18 to 85 years. Good general and mental health with, in the opinion of the investigator or medically qualified designee: No clinically significant and relevant abnormalities in medical history or upon oral examination; absence of any condition that could affect the participant's safety or wellbeing or their ability to understand and follow study procedures and requirements. Diagnosis: a) Completely edentulous maxillary arch restored with a conventional full acrylic based upper complete denture, b) Dentate, partial or full edentulous mandibular arch. Partial or full edentulous arch may be restored with a stable complete, partial or implant supported denture, c) Maxillary dentures must be considered to be moderately wellfitting at the screening visit (Kapur Index, Olshan Modification: retention score &gt;2, stability score &gt;2) d) Maxillary dentures and mandibular dentures, if present, must be considered to be wellmade based on design and construction criteria specified in the protocol e) The qualifying maxillary incisal BF readings (without adhesive) must be less than or equal to 9 pounds at the Screening Visit and subsequent visit pretreatment baseline bites. f) At least 2 of the 4 qualifying bite readings at the Screening Visit must be reproducible (+2lb). At subsequent visits the bite force readings must be within +2lb for 1 of the 3 practice bites and the pretreatment baseline bite. Understands and is willing, able and likely to comply with all study procedures and restrictions. A woman who is known to be pregnant or who is intending to become pregnant (selfreported) over the duration of the study. A woman who is breastfeeding. a) Implanted with a cardiac pacemaker, b) Daily doses of medication that might interfere with the ability to perform the study according to protocol (as determined by the Investigator), c) Insulin dependent diabetics, d) Taking or have taken a bisphosphonate drug for treatment of osteoporosis, e) A serious chronic disease requiring hospitalization, f) Any condition not previously mentioned that in the Investigator's opinion may impair the study evaluation. Known or suspected intolerance or hypersensitivity to the study materials (or closely related compounds) or any of their stated ingredients. a) Any clinically significant or relevant oral abnormality (e.g. temporomandibular joint [TMJ] problems) that, in the opinion of the investigator, could affect the participant's participation in the study, b) Any participant clinically identified as having an incisal bite relation which could affect the bite force measurements, c) Severe dry mouth that may affect denture retention in the opinion of the Investigator, d) OST examination findings such as stomatitis, open sores, lesions, redness or swelling that, in the opinion of the investigator, could affect the participant's participation in the study. e) A serious chronic disease requiring hospitalization. f) Any condition not previously mentioned that in the Investigator's opinion may impair the study evaluation. Known or suspected intolerance or hypersensitivity to the study materials (or closely related compounds) or any of their stated ingredients. a) Any clinically significant or relevant oral abnormality (e.g. temporomandibular joint [TMJ] problems) that, in the opinion of the investigator, could affect the participant's participation in the study, b) Any participant clinically identified as having an incisal bite relation which could affect the bite force measurements, c) Severe dry mouth that may affect denture retention in the opinion of the Investigator, d) OST examination findings such as stomatitis, open sores, lesions, redness or swelling that, in the opinion of the investigator, could affect the participant's participation in the study. a) Participation in another clinical study (including cosmetic studies) or receipt of an investigational drug within 30 days of the screening visit, b) Previous participation in this study. Recent history (within the last year) of alcohol or other substance abuse. A participant who is unwilling to refrain from smoking, including ecigarettes and the use of chewing tobacco or other tobacco products for the duration of screening and each treatment day (1214 hours).
