	<brief_title>Improving Neurocognitive Deficits and Function in Schizophrenia With Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>High-frequency, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), the dysfunctional brain region most implicated in cognitive deficits in schizophrenia, has recently been shown to improve cognition in non-Veteran samples with schizophrenia. The investigators' goal is to confirm the efficacy of this treatment modality to remediate cognitive deficits and improve functionality in Veterans with schizophrenia, as well as to gain a better understanding of the neural mechanisms responsible for cognitive deficits and their remediation. The investigators propose conducting a small-scale study to generate pilot data supporting the feasibility of conducting rTMS with Veterans and the effectiveness of rTMS in this population. In addition, the investigators will conduct neurophysiologic experiments to test whether certain neural maker of abnormal brain function improves with rTMS.</detailed_description>
