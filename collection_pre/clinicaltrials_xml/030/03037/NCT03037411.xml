	<brief_title>A Real World Evaluation of the ELUVIA Stent in Subjects With Lesions Located in the Femoropopliteal Arteries</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A European, prospective, multi-center Post-Market Clinical Follow-up (PMCF) trial providing additional data including health economics data to support the use of the ELUVIA stent in the treatment of lesions located in the femoropopliteal arteries. The objective of the study is to collect additional data including health economics data to support the use of the ELUVIA Drug-Eluting Vascular Stent System (ELUVIA Stent) for treating Superficial Femoral Artery (SFA) and/or Proximal Popliteal Artery (PPA) lesions.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Subjects age 18 and older 2. Subject is willing and able to provide written consent before any studyspecific test or procedure is performed and agrees to attend all followup visits 3. De novo, restenotic or (re)occluded lesions in the native femoropopliteal arteries, with reference vessel diameter (RVD) ranging from 4.06.0 mm, suitable for endovascular treatment 1. Subject is pregnant or planning to become pregnant during the course of the study 2. Life expectancy of less than 1 year (which is defined as documented life expectancy less than 12 months due to other medical comorbid condition(s) that could limit the subject's ability to participate in the clinical followup, limit the subject's compliance with the standard of care followup, or impact the scientific integrity of the trial) 3. Known allergy to the ELUVIA stent system or any of its components, concomitant medication, contrast agents (that cannot be medically managed) 4. Subject enrolled in an investigational study that has not reached primary endpoint at the time of enrollment or that clinically interferes with the current study assessments (Note: studies requiring extended followup for products that were investigational, but have become commercially available since then are not considered investigational studies)</criteria>
