	<brief_title>Clinical Performance of Restorative Materials in Primary Teeth</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Restorations will be placed on four primary molar teeth with proximal caries, in a split mouth design. 100 patients will be included in the study. The teeth will be randomized into four groups according to the restorative materials. Group 1: Adhesive agent+ Compomer (Dyract AP, Dentsply DeTrey, Konstanz,Germany) Group 2: Primer + Resin modified glass ionomer (Vitremer, 3M ESPE, U.S.) Group 3: Adhesive agent + Giomer (Beautifil II, (Shofu Dental, Tokyo, Japan) Group 4: Amalgam (Permite amalgam, SDI Limited, Bayswater, Australia) The restorations will be evaluated at baseline, 3., 6., 12. months for the first year, and at every 6 months for 5 years. The modified US Public Health Service criteria (secondary caries, marginal integrity, marginal discoloration and retention) will be used for clinical evaluation of restorations. The data will be analysed statistically using Wilcoxon test, chi square test and the Kaplan-Meier survival method will be used to estimate survival percentages.</detailed_description>
