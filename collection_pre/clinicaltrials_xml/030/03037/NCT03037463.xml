	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess whether tear secretion in patients with Parkinson's disease will be altered to exhibit a characteristic or diagnostic biomarker profile, that will be reflected in changes in the protein composition of tear fluid, which can be measured relatively easily, cost-effectively, and non-invasively. Tear fluid samples will be collected from Parkinson's patients, and through biochemical assays, the profile of proteins in tears will be characterized and compared to that from control subjects. The profiles will be analyzed with respect to any differences between Parkinson's patients and control subjects. If differences appear, the levels of these potential biomarkers in Parkinson's patients will be compared to the severity of their disease.</brief_summary>
