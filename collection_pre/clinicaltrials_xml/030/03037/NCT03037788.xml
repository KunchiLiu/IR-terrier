	<criteria>Diagnosis of moderate to severe primary axillary hyperhidrosis whose HDSS score is 2, 3 or 4 At least 50 mg in males or 25 mg in females of spontaneous resting axillary sweat production in one axilla measured gravimetrically at room temperature/humidity (about 25°C / 2050%) over a period of 5 minutes. Male and female subjects in the age of 18 to 65 years at the time of informed consent and a body mass index (BMI) of 1832 kg/m2. Corrected QT (QTc) ≤450 msec, or QTc &lt;480 msec in subjects with bundle branch block. Able to comply with protocol requirements, including overnight stays, blood sample collections as defined in the protocol subjects. Willing and able to provide written informed consent. Known allergy to any of the components in the investigational product. Hypersensitivity against glycopyrrolate Secondary hyperhidrosis, for example, hyperhidrosis that is secondary to other underlying diseases including hyperthyroidism, lymphoma and malaria, climacteric hyperhidrosis. Previous surgical treatment of hyperhidrosis including sympathectomy, surgical debulking of the sweat glands, subcutaneous tissue curettage and ultrasonic surgery. Botulinum toxin treatment in the prior 9 months. Present or history of neuromuscular disease. Angle closure glaucoma or its precipitation (narrow angle). Mycotic, other skin infections and other dermal disorder including infection at anticipated application sites in either axilla. Significant cardiac arrhythmia such as tachycardiac atrial fibrillation and very frequent extrasystoles. Subject with diabetes mellitus. Subjects with ileus, gastrointestinal stenosis, pronounced chronic inflammatory bowel disease, toxic megacolon. Subjects with epilepsy. Use of antiperspirants containing aluminium chloride and deodorants, any oral herbal medicine treatments or any other topical treatments for hyperhidrosis within 7 days prior to study treatment.</criteria>
