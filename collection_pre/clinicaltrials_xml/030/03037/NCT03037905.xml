	<brief_summary>Anxiety prior to surgery is an expected emotion. Research has not been conducted on methods to reduce anxiety in the operating room itself. STERIS Corporation has developed an automated surgical suite environmental system, called SignatureSuite™, that controls the level of lighting, images on OR monitors, and ambient background audio via preset, computerized automation for use before and after anesthesia. This study aims to determine if this new type of operating room environment decreases anxiety, as measured by patient reports, vital signs, and postoperative analgesic use. The proposed study will be a mixed method, two-arm, randomized controlled trial comparing anxiety levels for patients that have thyroid or parathyroid surgery in the SignatureSuite room at Cleveland Clinic Marymount Hospital versus the standard operating room environment. Randomization will occur at the surgeon level. There will be a maximum 100 patients divided equally between the experimental and control arms of the study. Staff perceptions of the room will also be assessed at the conclusion of the study.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Problem: Anxiety prior to surgery is an expected emotion. Research has been conducted on methods to reduce anxiety prior to entering the operating room (OR). These studies have involved some form of distraction, almost all finding that some form of distraction prior to entering the OR decreases both physiologic signs and patient reports of anxiety. Very few of these studies have carried the intervention into the OR itself. Steris Corporation has developed an automated surgical suite environmental system, called SignatureSuite™, that controls the level of lighting, images on OR monitors, and ambient background audio via preset, computerized automation for use before and after anesthesia. The research question is: What is the effect of the SignatureSuite OR environment on patient anxiety, patient outcome, and OR staff satisfaction? Study methods: The proposed study will be a mixed method two arm randomized controlled trial. Randomization will occur at the surgeon level, based on SignatureSuite operating room environment (experimental group) versus a standard Marymount Hospital operating room environment (control group). Data collection: The study will take place in the perioperative department of Cleveland Clinic's Marymount Hospital. Patient anxiety will be measured before and after surgery using an anxiety visual analog scale (VAS). Qualitative patient data will be gathered from written comments. Data about patient characteristics will be retrieved retrospectively by chart review. Data about staff satisfaction will be gathered at the conclusion of the patient data collection period via visual analog scales and qualitative analysis of written comments. The effect of SignatureSuite on OR turnaround time will also be determined at the conclusion of the patient data collection period. Sample characteristics: The patient sample will comprise patients undergoing thyroid and/or parathyroid surgery at Marymount Hospital. Sample size: 40 subjects per group will provide adequate power to detect large effect sizes (0.80) and is feasible at Marymount Hospital within one year.</detailed_description>
