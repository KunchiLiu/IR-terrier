	<brief_summary>Participants will be randomly allocated to either Yakult ingestion or a control group. For the first 20 days, subjects will consume their normal diet (keeping a detailed food diary throughout). On days 21-28 they will switch to a high-fat/high-calorie diet. The investigators hypothesise that consuming a high-fat, high-energy diet for 7 days will alter the composition of the gut microbiota and induce metabolic endotoxaemia / systemic inflammation as well as decreasing whole body insulin sensitivity (as we have shown previously). In contrast, the investigators hypothesise that consuming Yakult for 21 days before and 7 days throughout the high-fat diet will maintain a favourable gut microbiota and prevent metabolic endotoxaemia / systemic inflammation and thus maintain insulin action / insulin sensitivity.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Males and females Aged 1830 Physically active (exercising at least 3 times per week for more than 30 min at a time) Nonsmoker Free from cardiovascular or metabolic disease Weight stable for at least 6 months Normal body mass index (BMI: 18.524.9 kg/m2)* Compliant (i.e. understands and is willing, able and likely to comply with all study requirements) Note: If BMI is &gt;24.9, but body fat % (as measured by bioelectrical impedance analysis) is below 21% in males and 31% in females, then the subject may still be recruited at the PI's discretion. Using probiotic or prebiotic supplements within the previous 3 months Vegetarians and vegans Diagnosis of insulin resistance, prediabetes or full diabetes Underweight (determined as BMI less than 18.5 kg/m2) Overweight or obese (determined as BMI greater than 24.9 kg/m2) Those on a calorie controlled diet or other dietary restrictions that would prevent them from consuming the probiotic treatment and high fat/high calorie diet. Those who are unwilling to restrict their intake of fermented dairy products. Those with known or suspected food intolerances, allergies or hypersensitivity Women who are known to be pregnant or who are intending to become pregnant over the course of the study. Participation in another clinical trial Those who have donated blood within 3 months of the screening visit and participants for whom participation in this study would result in having donated more than 1500 ml of blood in the previous 12 months. Participants who take any form of regular medication that is known to affect either the gut microbiota and/or insulin sensitivity or who have taken any antibiotics in the previous 3 months. Participants who know they would not be available for all the lab visits during the 4week study period.</criteria>
