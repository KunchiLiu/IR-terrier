	<brief_summary>The results of this study will optimize the care for patients with a meniscus root tear. Surgeons will be able to determine if MRR (meniscus root repair) with transtibial pullout technique is an effective treatment and will identify potential risk factors for poor clinical outcomes. In addition, investigators will determine if MRR is successful in delaying the radiographic progression of arthritis in the involved compartment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Outcomes of Meniscus Root Repair Using a Transtibial Pullout Technique</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The loss of attachment at the root of the meniscus impairs the ability to maintain hoop strain when the tibiofemoral joint is loaded. This loss of hoop strain is responsible for the increased pressure on the articular cartilage. This new awareness has prompted surgeons to consider surgical repair for treatment of meniscal root avulsions. Despite this recent focus on results of surgical repair, prospective studies are lacking, and the optimal surgical indications and technique have not been optimized.</detailed_description>
