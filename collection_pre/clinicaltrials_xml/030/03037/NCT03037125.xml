	<brief_summary>Split crest technique is a technique for horizontal bone augmentation used in case of narrow alveolar ridges as an alternative to the more aggressive techniques such as onlay bone grafting, guided bone regeneration (GBR) and distraction osteogenesis The study goal is to evaluate whether if there will be any benefit of using platelet rich fibrin (PRF) with the split crest technique regarding bone width gain and healing response in comparison with split crest technique alone, where PRF is considered an autologous, growth factor containing material which is easy to collect and is of low cost.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Evaluation Of Bone Width Gain Following Split Crest Technique With Or Without Platelet Rich Fibrin( PRF)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>1. Patients with at least one missing tooth in the maxillary region 2. All the selected patients have a buccopalatal width of the edentulous alveolar ridge from 3.55.5mm. 3. All the selected patients have at least 12 mm residual bone height at the edentulous area 4. The recipient site of the implant should be free from any pathological conditions. 5. No diagnosed bone disease or medication known to affect bone metabolism. 6. Patients who are cooperative, motivated, and hygiene conscious. 1. Patients unable to undergo minor oral surgical procedures. 2. Patients with a history of drug abuse or catabolic drugs. 3. Patients with a history of psychiatric disorder. 4. Patients with unrealistic expectations about the esthetic outcome of implant therapy. 5. Patients with insufficient vertical interarch space, upon centric occlusion, to accommodate the available restorative components. 6. Patients in the growth stage with partially erupted teeth. 7. Patients who have any systemic condition that may contraindicate implant therapy. 8. Patients who have any habits that might jeopardize the osseointegration process, such as smoking and alcoholism. 9. Patients with parafunctional habits that produce overload on the implant, such as bruxism and clenching.</criteria>
