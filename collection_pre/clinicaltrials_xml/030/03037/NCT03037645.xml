	<brief_summary>Phase 1b (Dose Escalation) in primarily CLL/SLL patients will evaluate safety and pharmacology of self-administered twice a day oral doses beginning at 25 mg/dose for 4 weeks with succeeding cohorts at escalating doses until establishing dose limiting toxicity or, recommended Phase 2 dose. Patient data will be assessed before authorizing dose escalation cohorts. Phase 2 (Cohort Expansion) will follow in cohorts using the recommended dose to explore clinical activity, safety, pharmacology of SNS-062 as monotherapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety, PK, PD, and Antitumor Activity of SNS-062 in B Lymphoid Cancers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Phase 1b (Dose Escalation) This portion of the study will evaluate the safety and pharmacology of a range of SNS-062 dose levels administered to subjects with previously treated B-lymphoid malignancies, including: chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL), lymphoplasmacytoid lymphoma/Waldenström's macroglobulinemia (LPL/WM), and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). All subjects will self-administer SNS-062 orally BID. The dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) window will be 4 weeks (1 cycle in length). Assessments after the DLT window will be performed in 4-week cycles. Cohorts of 3 to 6 subjects will be sequentially enrolled at progressively higher dose levels of SNS-062 using a standard 3+3 dose-escalation design. Based on the pattern of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) observed in the first cycle (4 weeks), escalation will proceed to define a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or a recommended dose (RD) that may be the MTD or a lower dose. An additional 6 subjects may be accrued at the MTD or the RD to confirm SNS-062 safety and pharmacology as a prelude to further clinical evaluation. Assessments regarding DLTs and dose escalation will be performed by a SRC comprising, but not limited to, the principal investigators, the medical monitor and the study sponsor drug safety representative. Phase 2 (Cohort Expansion) This portion of the study provides cohort expansion to further explore the clinical activity, safety, and pharmacology of SNS-062 monotherapy. Accrual will be by enrollment into each disease and mutation specific cohort. Subjects will self-administer SNS-062 orally at the RD of SNS-062 identified in the Phase 1b portion of the study. Study personnel will meet regularly to assess the efficacy and safety for each cohort.</detailed_description>

Presence of measurable disease through various assessments depending on specific cancer type. Current medical need for therapy of the Blymphoid malignancy due to diseaserelated symptoms. Exclusion Criteria (Key factors listed): Known central nervous system malignancy. History of other malignancies except for some which have been adequately treated (e.g., local cancers of the skin, cervix or breast cancers, noninvasive bladder cancer, prostate or other cancers of stages 1 or 2 in complete remission). Significant cardiovascular disease or electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities Ongoing risk for bleeding due to bleeding diathesis, platelet function disorder, uncontrolled peptic ulcer disease, oral anticoagulation with warfarin. Evidence of ongoing systemic bacterial, fungal or viral infections at the start of drug therapy. Demonstrated intolerance to BTK inhibitor as shown by discontinuation due to adverse effects. Use of a moderate or strong inhibitor or inducer of CYP3A4 within 7 days prior to start of study therapy (e.g., some antibiotics, antifungals, anticonvulsants, grapefruit).</criteria>
