	<brief_summary>Liprotamase powder is a non-porcine, soluble and stable mixture of biotechnology-derived lipase, protease, and amylase digestive enzymes. The purpose of the present study is to to evaluate the non-inferiority of liprotamase compared with porcine-derived, enterically-coated pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT). The primary efficacy endpoint of the study will be comparative efficacy measured as the change from baseline in the coefficient of fat absorption (CFA) in Cystic Fibrosis patients with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI).</brief_summary>
