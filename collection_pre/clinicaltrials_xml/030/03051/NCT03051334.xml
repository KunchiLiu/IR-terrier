	<brief_summary>This study sought to evaluate changes in ascending aorta size after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) in patients with bicuspid aortic valve (BiAV) compared with patients with tricuspid aortic valve (TAV).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ascending Aortic Dilation in BiAV After TAVR</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The growth rate of ascending aorta was calculated as annual growth rate using baseline and the last echocardiography. The difference in ascending aorta growth rates between the two groups (BiAV and TAV) were analyzed by independent t-test.</detailed_description>
