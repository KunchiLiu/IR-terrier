	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is evaluate the effectiveness and safety of a possible new treatment for Essential Tremor (ET) using external wearable sensors, which have the capability of recording acceleration and Electromyography (EMG). This therapy is called Responsive Deep Brain Stimulation (R-DBS). R-DBS systems will communicate with a computer, and apply stimulation when the computer detects patterns associated with tremor. This detection will suppress pathological activity and improve or alleviate the tremor. Currently, DBS is approved for the treatment of ET; however, stimulation is delivered continuously even when tremor or other symptoms are absent. Continuous DBS can lead to unwanted side effects such as stuttering and gait\balance problems. On the other hand, R-DBS will turn on only if activity associated with ET from the external sensors is detected.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The overall purpose of this application is to capture pathological activity related to essential tremor using external wearable sensors to responsively initiate or terminate DBS. To this end, we propose to use the Nexus-D system, which requires a firm ware update to an Activa Implantable Neurostimulator (INS), and it will in a smart way turn DBS on/off in patients. We will recruit subjects with Activa Single Channel (SC) implants during 6 post-operative programming visits. Our research group is already familiar with and is in possession of the Nexus-D system, and we have successfully performed responsive DBS in two patients with Tourette syndrome (TS) and in four patients with Parkinson's disease in acute settings. Our lab is also equipped with wireless wearable sensor and amplifier systems, such as a 16-unit wireless EMG+ acceleration+inertia Trigno Wireless Bio Acquisition System (Delsys Inc, Natick, MA). We aim to combine these signal modalities to capture pathological symptoms and generate commands to initiate or terminate DBS (also record adverse side effects, if any). Our goal is to characterize the clinical efficacy, side effect profile, and battery life of closed-loop DBS in acute settings using wearable sensors in essential tremor patients.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>You provide informed consent. You are over 21 years of age. You are diagnosed with a posturalintention (essential) tremor for at least 3 years and meet strict diagnostic criteria and have been seen and examined by a movement disorders fellowship trained neurologist. You have had a significant disabling medicalrefractory upper extremity tremor with no evidence of supraspinal central nervous system disease or injury (tremor not adequately controlled by medications for at least three (3) months before implant). You have had a postural or kinetic tremor severity score of at least 3 out of 4 in the extremity intended for treatment on the FahnTolosaMarin Clinical Rating Scale for Tremor (CRST). You have had a CRST score of 2 or above in any one of the items 1623 from the Disability subsection of the CRST: speaking, feeding other than liquids, bringing liquids to mouth, hygiene, dressing, writing, working and social activities. Your tremor is refractory adequate with trials of at least two medications, one of which should be either propranolol or primidone. An adequate medication trial is defined as a therapeutic dose of each medication or the development of side effects as the medication dose is titrated. You are available for appropriate followup times for the length of the study. Any previous neurosurgical intervention including deep brain stimulation or ablative brain lesions. Medication related movement disorders. Any suspicion of Parkinsonian tremor, including presence of Parkinsonian features such as bradykinesia, rigidity, or postural instability. Any behaviors consistent with ethanol or substance abuse as defined by the criteria outlined in Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)V. Severe medical comorbidity including cardiovascular disorder, lung disorder, kidney disease, continuous neurological disease, hematological disease, or frailty that impact tolerability of the surgery as judged by the screening physicians. Any known intolerance or allergies to the MRI contrast agent (e.g. Gadolinium or Magnevist) including advanced kidney disease. Abnormal brain MRI including hydrocephalus, stroke, structural lesions, demyelinating lesions, or infectious lesions. Also excluded will be subjects with severe atrophy. Any uncontrolled symptoms or signs of increased intracranial pressure (e.g., headache, nausea, vomiting, lethargy, papilledema). A history of seizures within the past year. A dementia rating scale score (DRS) &lt;130 signifying significant cognitive dysfunction and a potential for inability to cooperate with tasks involved in the study. Any attempt or intent of suicide in the last six months. Presence or history of psychosis. Significant or active mood disorders including depression. For the purpose of this study, we consider a significant mood disorder to include any subject who has: Scores â‰¥ 20 on the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ9). Currently under the care of a psychiatrist Currently participating in cognitivebehavioral therapy Been hospitalized for the treatment of a psychiatric illness within 12 months Ever received transcranial magnetic stimulation Ever received electroconvulsive therapy In addition, patients who are pregnant or plan to become pregnant will be excluded from this study.</criteria>
