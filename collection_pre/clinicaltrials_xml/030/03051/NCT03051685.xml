Fecal occult blood determination negative at screening 1. Females who were pregnant or were lactating 2. Patients who had a history of allergic reactions to nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including patients in whom aspirin or other NSAIDs induce the syndrome of asthma, rhinitis, nasal polyps or Samter's triad 3. Presence of significant gastrointestinal, liver or kidney disease, or any other conditions known to interfere with the absorption, distribution, metabolism or excretion of drugs or known to potentiate or predispose to undesired effects 4. History of significant gastrointestinal, liver or kidney disease that may affect drug bioavailability 5. Presence of significant cardiovascular, pulmonary, hematologic, neurological, psychiatric, endocrine, immunologic or dermatologic disease 6. Suicidal tendency, history of or disposition to seizures, state of confusion, clinically relevant psychiatric diseases, neurological impairment or cognitive dysfunction that, in the opinion of the investigator, would compromise validity of informed consent, study participation and compliance or data collection 7. Presence of outofrange cardiac intervals and/ or morphological changes suggestive of arrhythmias or ischaemic heart disease on the screening electrocardiogram (ECG) or other clinically significant ECG abnormalities 8. History or current hypertension, bleeding disorders, ischaemic heart disease, stroke and/or cerebrovascular disease or renal disease 9. History of asthma, urticaria, or allergictype reactions after taking acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) or other NSAIDs 10.

Use of ASA or NSAIDs, or any product containing ASA or NSAIDs, in the previous 7 days before day 1 of this study 12. Known presence of rare hereditary problems of galactose and /or lactose intolerance, Lapp lactase deficiency or glucosegalactose malabsorption 13. Maintenance therapy with any drug or significant history of drug dependency (including marijuana and medical marijuana) or alcohol abuse (&gt; 3 units of alcohol per day, intake of excessive alcohol, acute or chronic) within 1 year 14. Any clinically significant illness in the previous 28 days before day 1 of this study 15. Any history of tuberculosis and/or prophylaxis for tuberculosis 16. Positive urine screening of alcohol and/or drugs of abuse 17. Positive results to HIV Ag/Ab Combo, Hepatitis B surface Antigen (HBsAG (B)) or anti Hepatitis C Virus (HCV (C)) tests 18. Females who were pregnant according to a positive pregnancy test 19. Volunteers who took an investigational product (in another clinical trial) in the previous 28 days before day 1 of this study or who had already participated in this clinical study 20. Volunteers who donated plasma in the previous 14 days before day 1 of this study 21. Donation of 500 mL or more of blood (American Red Cross, clinical studies, etc.) in the previous 56 days before day 1 of this study</criteria>
