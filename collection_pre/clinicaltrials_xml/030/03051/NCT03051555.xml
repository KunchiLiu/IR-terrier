	<brief_title>18F-FDG PET/CT-based Prognostic Model for Predicting Outcome in Patients With Natural Killer/T-cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this study investigators develop a prognostic model based on 18F-FDG PET/CT and test its ability for prognostic value in patients with DLBCL. PET/ CT scans evaluation using the liver SUVmax as reference. Positive lesions in PET were indicated as SUVmax of residues higher than the threshold or new 18F-FDG avid lesions. 18F-FDG PET/CT-based prognostic model includes PET/CT image, dominant clinical and pathological prognostic factors to predicting disease progression during chemotherapy or survival in NK/T-cell lymphoma.</detailed_description>
