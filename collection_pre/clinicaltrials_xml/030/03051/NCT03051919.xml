	<brief_title>Reinforcement Method in Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator compared non-reinforced stapling with three staple line reinforcement methods (suturing, absorbable buttressing material and fibrin glue) in laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. The resected stomach specimens were treated in the same manner of reinforcement as used in the surgeries of the corresponding patients and then insufflated until a burst occurred. The burst pressures of the resected stomach specimens and postoperative events of the patients were recorded.</detailed_description>
