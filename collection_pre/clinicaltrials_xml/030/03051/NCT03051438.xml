	<brief_summary>Uniportal video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) lobectomy has emerged as a promising and exciting approach for minimally invasive thoracic surgery. However, nearly all reported uniportal VATS lobectomies have been performed via the intercostal route, and chest wall trauma has still occurred. Here,the investigators undertook novel uniportal VATS technique involving a subxiphoid route for pulmonary lobectomies to evaluate the feasibility and advantages.</brief_summary>
