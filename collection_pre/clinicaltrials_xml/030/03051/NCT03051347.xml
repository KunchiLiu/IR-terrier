	<brief_summary>This is designated to validate patient-reported outcomes (PRO) measures in itch-specific pediatric skin conditions, such as atopic dermatitis, and examine the ability of a modified stigma instrument to assess the severity and type of stigma experienced in atopic dermatitis and other potentially stigmatizing conditions.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Asthma and Atopic Dermatitis Validation of PROMIS Pediatric Instruments</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study involves a series of research and development projects targeted at two of the most common chronic diseases affecting children: asthma and atopic dermatitis (AD, or eczema). The Investigators propose to directly validate patient-reported outcomes (PRO) measures in a large cohort of itch-specific pediatric skin conditions, with a primary focus on AD. The Investigators propose to examine the ability of PROMIS (Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information Systems) instruments to detect meaningful and clinically significant change in disease status, as well as to create a pediatric itch item pool and PRO model for signs and symptoms of skin disease. The Investigators will also examine the ability of a modified Neuro-QOL stigma instrument to assess the severity and type of stigma experienced in AD and across various dermatologic or other potentially stigmatizing conditions. Lurie Children's Hospital will only be involved in the AD and stigma portions of this project</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Affected children must have moderate to severe AD or another skin condition that causes itch, experience itch, understand English, and be able to complete an Englishbased survey Any child with a potentially disfiguring skin condition or change in appearance related to disease/intervention will be considered eligible. Parents of children with such conditions will also be asked to participate. Children and parents must also understand English and be able to complete an Englishbased survey</criteria>
