	<brief_summary>Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) pose a pool clinical outcome to men and women whom treatment was delayed. However, repercussion time was limited in previous studies. To evaluate the system delay and clinical outcomes among China patients with AMI,12,000 consecutive inpatient case prospectively collected from 2004 to 2016. Basic data and innovative evidence will accelerate evidence-based clinical practice and policy making, and improve AMI patients outcomes finally.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>System Delay and Clinical Outcome Among Chinese Patients With AMI Treated With Reperfusion Therapy (MOODY Study)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>AMI is one of the leading causes of mortality and morbidity in public health globally, as well as in China. Remarkable variations of repercussion time and clinical outcome have been noted, however little information is available about how shortened D2B time is incorporated appropriately into routine clinical practice in China. In addition, basic data and evidence about effectiveness of treatment for AMI during long-term recovery is limited. Practical and applied knowledge from large unselected population is needed to guide practice for improvement. This study will enroll patients with a confirmed diagnosis of AMI consecutively in 10 tertiary hospitals and 20 secondary hospitals in China. At study entry, participants will be interviewed during their index hospitalization, to collect information about symptoms, functioning, quality of life, and medical care. Demographic characteristics, medical history, clinical features, diagnostic tests, medications, procedures, and in-hospital outcomes of patients will be abstracted from medical records by well trained professional abstractors. At 1 month, and 12 month after discharge, participants will return to the clinic for follow up visits. This study will examine system delay that may affect patients recovery after a heart attack. Effective clinic path system, and risk model for AMI patients will be established based on the findings, to improve patients outcomes in future finally.</detailed_description>
