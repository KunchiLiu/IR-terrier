	<brief_title>Immune Benefits of Consumption of Dairy Yogurt in Elderly</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A randomized, open-labelled, placebo-controlled study was conducted on 200 nondiabetic, nonobese and elderly (≥60 years) subjects. Over a twelve-week period, the test group consumed one bottle (120 mL) of dairy yogurt each day, whereas the placebo group consumed same volume of low fat milk daily. NK cell activity (%) was measured based on the ratios of effector cells (E; peripheral blood mononuclear cells, PBMCs) from each participant to target cells (T; K562 cells) at E:T= 10:1, 5:1, 2.5:1, 1.25:1 or 0.625:1. In addition, cytokines and immunoglobulin levels measured using commercial kits as manufacturer's instruction.</detailed_description>
