	<brief_summary>This study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose(MTD), dose limiting toxicity(DLT), safety and pharmacokinetics(PK) profile of a single agent CKD-581 injection in Combination with Bortezomib and Dexamethasone in patients with Previously Treated Multiple Myeloma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CKD-581 + Bortezomib + Dexamethasone in Patients With Previously Treated Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open label, dose escalation study. Cohort of 3~6 patients receive escalation doses of CKD-516 until the maximum toleated dose(MTD) is determined. The MTD is defiend as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicity.</detailed_description>
