	<brief_summary>The optimal antithrombotic treatment for Coronary Heart disease (CHD) patients combined with Atrial Fibrillation (AF) is the hotspot at present. Although the European and American guidelines have given a hand for us, there is absence of solid evidence-based data on the safety of antithrombotic therapy in Asian populations. Only a few clinical trials and registries are available to guide difficult clinical decision making in patients with combined AF and CHD，the investigators highlight the need for the rapid development of clinical trials to close the large gaps in evidence. This research aims to know the real-world use of antithrombotic treatment and clinical prognosis in Coronary Heart Disease patients complicated with Atrial Fibrillation.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1. Our study is an observational, retrospective Study. 2. Key date elements and definition of each variable were in line with the American Heart Association(AHA)/European Society of Cardiology(ECS） recommendation on AF and CHD. To reflect the contemporary antithrombotic management of AF and CHD in the past five years, the following data were collected: basic socio-demographic information, symptoms and signs relating to AF, medical history, results of physical examination and laboratory test. 3. Follow-up time is at least 12 months. The patients will be asked about their medications and clinical outcomes by telephone interview or outpatient clinic. Then we will analyze the relative safety and efficacy of the various antithrombotic regimens. 4. Based on the largest retrospective study by Karjalainen addressing this issue, we anticipate an 30% incidence of composite outcome in the triple therapy arm. To achieve a precision of 10% with an α=0.05 and the rate of defaulters is 10%. The final sample size was estimated at 986. 5. Henan institute of cardiology epidemiology is responsible for design, date quality control and statistical analysis.</detailed_description>
