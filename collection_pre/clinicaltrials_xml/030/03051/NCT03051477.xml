	<brief_title>Dose Escalating Trial of Mistletoe Extract in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a Phase I study that consists of two phases: a dose escalation phase and an expansion phase. The dose escalation phase will be used to evaluate the safety and toxicity of Helixor® M (mistletoe extract). An accelerated titration design (ATD) will be utilized to determine the MTD. The expansion phase will be used to obtain preliminary efficacy data about Helixor® M.</detailed_description>
