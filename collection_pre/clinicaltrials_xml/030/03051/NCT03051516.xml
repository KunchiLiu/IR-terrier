	<brief_summary>This randomized phase IV trial studies how well human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine therapy works in interrupting progression in patients with high-grade vulvar or anal lesions. Vaccines made from HPV peptides or antigens may help the body build an effective immune response to kill tumor cells and decrease the chance of vulvar or anal lesions to progress or come back.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>HPV Vaccine Therapy in Interrupting Progression in Patients With High-Grade Vulvar or Anal Lesions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Test if the recombinant human papillomavirus nonavalent vaccine (9vHPV vaccine) delivered after treatment for high grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) reduces the risk of histologically confirmed recurrent neoplastic lesions (HSIL) by 50% in the vaccinated versus (vs.) placebo arms. II. Evaluate safety of the HPV vaccine in HSIL participants. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms. ARM I: Patients receive recombinant human papillomavirus nonavalent vaccine intramuscularly (IM) at baseline, 2, and 6 months. ARM II: Patients receive placebo IM at baseline, 2, and 6 months. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at months 7, 12, 18, 24, 36, and 42.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically confirmed diagnosis of anal or vulvar highgrade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) (anal intraepithelial neoplasia [AIN]2/3vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia [VIN]2/3); HSIL (AIN2/VIN2) must be confirmed as p16 positive lesions by the study pathologist &gt;= 2 months since last therapy for HSIL, diagnosed on or after 3/1/2015 No clinical evidence of HSIL on screening examination; if HSIL is suspected, a biopsy will be done to exclude HSIL; patients whose screening visit reveals HSIL on biopsy, may be rescreened one time, 46 months after initial screen Resident in the area and willing to attend up to 7 clinic visits for a 36month period at the Virology Research Clinic (VRC) Sexually active women of childbearing potential must be willing to use effective contraception through month 7 of the study If human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive, receipt of antiretroviral therapy for at least 6 months and plasma HIV1 ribonucleic acid (RNA) levels &lt; 400 copies/mL prior to enrollment Ability to give informed consent Willingness to sign medical records release form and tissue release form Currently pregnant Chemotherapy (current, within the last month, or anticipated in the next 7 months) Significant medical condition (e.g., another malignancy requiring treatment, malignant hypertension, poorly controlled diabetes, another cancer except for fully excised nonmelanoma skin cancer) Prior HPV vaccination Known allergy or intolerance to silver nitrate or lidocaine On chronic anticoagulation other than aspirin that cannot be safely interrupted for procedures</criteria>
