	<brief_summary>This study is being done to see if daratumumab is safe and effective in the treatment of proliferative glomerulonephritis with monoclonal immune deposits (PGNMID) and C3 glomerulopathy associated with monoclonal gammopathy (C3GN). This is an inflammatory disease in the kidney due to the production of abnormal proteins. There are no known standard effective treatments for patients with PGNMID and C3GN secondary to monoclonal gammopathy. These diseases are caused by abnormal production of proteins (monoclonals) by abnormal clones. Daratumamb has been shown to be effective in treating patients with multiple myeloma a disease which also caused by over production of monoclonal proteins from abnormal clones. Everyone in this study will receive daratumumab.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Daratumumab in Treatment of PGNIMD and C3 GN</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is an open-label phase 2 trial of the safety and efficacy of daratumumab, in the treatment of PGNMID and C3GN associated with monoclonal gammopathy. Subjects will be screened at outpatient Nephrology Clinic visit appointments and interested qualified subjects will be consented and offered participation in this trial. Once consent has been obtained baseline values will be established and subjects will begin treatment and follow-up for the next 12 months. Daratumumab will be administered once weekly for 8 weeks and then once every 2 weeks for 8 additional doses. Patients will be followed for a total of 12 months (6 months after the last infusion). A final visit for evaluation and collection of lab samples will be conducted at the end of the study.</detailed_description>
