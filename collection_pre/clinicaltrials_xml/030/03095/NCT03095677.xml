	<brief_summary>The inclusion of short periods of apnea (several seconds) during exercise (i.e. dynamic apnea) induces a significant decrease in blood oxygenation and muscle tissue. To date, the immediate effects ("acute apnea") of this decrease in the quantity of oxygen available at the muscle and brain level are poorly understood. Moreover, a physical training during which these short periods of apnea ("chronic apnea") would be included could lead to physiological adaptations and to improvement in physical performance similar to those obtained during altitude training. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of acute dynamic apnea on metabolism.</brief_summary>
