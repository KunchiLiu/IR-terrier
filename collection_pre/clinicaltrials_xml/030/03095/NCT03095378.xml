	<brief_summary>The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of two root-conditioning agents used in conjunction with subepithelial connective graft technique on root coverage outcomes. One is citric acid plus tetracycline and the other is antimicrobial photodynamic therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of Root Coverage by Connective Graft and Different Root Conditioning Methods</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Citric acid plus tetracycline has properties of root surface decontamination, surface demineralization and exposure of collagen fibers. Antimicrobial photodynamic therapy has been widely used in Periodontics to obtain reduction of periodontopathogenic bacteria with absence of systemic side effects and minimal bacterial resistance. Also, it has properties of root demineralization and exposure of collagen fibers. These properties may enhance root coverage in procedures of subepithelial connective graft.</detailed_description>
