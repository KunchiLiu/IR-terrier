	<brief_title>Ischemic Conditioning as an Intervention to Improve Motor Function in Chronic Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will study ischemic conditioning (IC) as an intervention to improve motor function post-stroke. IC is a well studied, well tolerated intervention which has been shown to improve regional blood flow, motor neuron excitability and muscle function in multiple patient groups and in young, healthy subjects. Because IC targets three physiological systems which are all affected by stroke, the investigators hypothesize that repeated bouts of IC will result in improved motor function of the paretic leg.</detailed_description>
