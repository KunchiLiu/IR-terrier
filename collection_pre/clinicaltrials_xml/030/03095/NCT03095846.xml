	<brief_summary>This study investigates cold-induced brown fat activation in winter swimmers and not-winter swimmers by skin temperature measures assessed with infra red thermography imaging and skin temperatures. Winter swimmers and not-winter swimmers will participate in an acute cooling intervention and thermoneutral intervention for comparison of energy expenditure and skin temperatures at the supraclavicular area.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cold Induced Activation of Brown Adipose Tissue in Winter Swimmers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The field of human brown adipose tissue (BAT) research is focused on activation of BAT as a means of manipulating energy expenditure and potentially anti-obesity and anti-diabetic properties of the tissue. This is well established in rodent studies and explained as due to the specific brown fat uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1). Despite increasing evidence that indicates a metabolic regulatory role of BAT in humans, BAT activation/recruitment is not fully understood. Cold induced brown fat activity will be measured by skin temperature measures by means of infra-red thermography imaging and skin temperature. 20 healthy male winter swimmers and 15 healthy male non-winter swimmers (controls) will be included in the study.</detailed_description>
