	<brief_summary>Well-differentiated gastroenteropancreatic and lung neuroendocrine tumors are generally malignancies with a prolonged natural history. However, clinical behavior is heterogeneous and when tumor progression is observed, treatment options are limited. The most used therapy for neuroendocrine tumors management are somatostatin analogs. However, even the use in lung carcinoids is quite usual, no antitumoral activity has been demonstrated. Tremelimumab and Durvalumab combination could be more efficient drugs to improve immune system activation and could obtain a significantly higher clinical benefit in these patients. Tremelimumab and Durvalumab would be the first immune combination agents showing efficacy in neuroendocrine neoplasms of different origins.</brief_summary>

Subjects must have histologically confirmed diagnosis of one of the following advanced/metastatic neuroendocrine tumor types: 1. Cohort 1: Wellmoderately differentiated neuroendocrine tumors of the lung ( mitotic count ≤10 mitoses x 10 HPF), also known as typical and atypical lung carcinoids, that have progressed to prior somatostatin analog therapy and/or one prior targeted therapy or chemotherapy (only one prior systemic therapy, with the exception of patients that have been treated with somatostatin analogues and other systemic treatment, when two prior treatments are allowed). 2.

Prior therapies with interferon alpha2b or radionucleotide therapy are allowed. 3. Cohort 3: Wellmoderately differentiated neuroendocrine tumors G1/G2 (WHO grade 1 and 2) from pancreatic origin after progression to standard therapies (chemotherapy, somatostatin analogs and target therapy); patients must be treated with at least two prior systemic treatment lines and a maximum of four previous treatment lines. 4. Cohort 4: Neuroendocrine neoplasms (WHO grade 3) of gastroenteropancreatic origin of unknown primary site (excluding lung primary tumors) after progression to firstline chemotherapy with a platinum based regimen. 4.

If there is only one target lesion and it is a nonlymph node, it should have a longest diameter of ≥ 1.5 cm. 2. Lesions that have had external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) or locoregional therapies such as radiofrequency (RF) ablation or liver embolization must show evidence of progressive disease based on RECIST 1.1 to be deemed a target lesion. 3.

Serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN). This will not apply to subjects with confirmed Gilbert's syndrome (persistent or recurrent hyperbilirubinemia that is predominantly unconjugated in the absence of hemolysis or hepatic pathology), who will be allowed only in consultation with their physician. 11. AST (SGOT)/ALT (SGPT) ≤ 2.5 x institutional upper limit of normal unless liver metastases are present, in which case it must be ≤ 5x ULN. 12.

Subject is willing and able to comply with the protocol for the duration of the study including undergoing treatment and scheduled visits and examinations including follow up. 1.
