	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to investigate whether pre-operative dysregulated systemic lipid mediator pathways are associated with increased risk for the development of persistent post surgical pain. In addition we will investigate whether treatment with an over the counter dietary supplement containing a fractionated marine lipid derivative from anchovy and sardine oil prevents the development of chronic pain after surgery.</brief_summary>
