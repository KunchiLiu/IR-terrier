	<brief_title>Exploring the Safety and Efficacy of Low-dose Ketamine Infusions for Pain Control in Acute Burn Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Aim will identify the safest and most optimal dosing strategy for low-dose ketamine infusions. While the hourly rate for low-dose ketamine infusions used for adjunctive analgesia appears to be well-established both in the medical literature and our institutional protocols, there is no information available for this specific population of patients (adult acute burn injury) to know whether the infusions should be utilized for discrete periods of time or should be given continuously. Findings from this study will help provide preliminary data on the optimal dosing strategy of this medication for adjunctive analgesia in this population.</detailed_description>
