	<brief_summary>Idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD) is the second most frequent neurodegenerative disease. Its association with osteroporosis and fragility fracture is now clearly demonstrated, but the determinants of this osteoporosis are yet to be explained. Our aim was to study factors associated with volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD) and bone microstructure at the tibia and radius in IPD.</brief_summary>
