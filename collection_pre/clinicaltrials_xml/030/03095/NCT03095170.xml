	<brief_summary>Behavioral interventions currently provide the most useful approach to addressing the behavioral and social needs of those with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer's or other diseases. This randomized, multisite, 3-arm study will investigate the impact of computerized brain fitness vs yoga vs an active control group (wellness education) on changes in cognitive function, daily functioning and quality of life in persons with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and their partner. In addition, in vivo neuroimaging measures of plasticity during the pre- and post-intervention periods will be measured and compared between the three different treatment groups. These neuroimaging measures of plasticity will be investigated in their relationship to the cognitive outcomes within each group.</brief_summary>
