	<brief_summary>Background: Malignant peritoneal adhesion is a common complication and prognostic factor of ovarian cancer and other primary abdominal tumors. The incidence of peritoneal adhesion in advanced primary peritoneal tumor is 32-56%, which has increased by more than 10 times in the recent decade. Malignant peritoneal adhesion is closely associated with the morbidity and mortality of malignant intestinal obstruction. The peritoneal adhesion may aggravates the abdominal symptoms and reduce quality of life. Further, the peritoneal adhesion may impede treatment of primary tumor, such as operation or chemotherapy, lead to a poor prognosis. Objective: This study aims to treat malignant peritoneal adhesion with the combination of antiangiogenic agent and chemotherapy, evaluate the efficacy and safety of intraperitoneal antiangiogenic agent plus chemotherapy. As explosive endpoints, we will examination the expression of VEGF-A in peritoneal cavity during the treatment.</brief_summary>
