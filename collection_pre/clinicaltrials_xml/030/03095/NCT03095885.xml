	<brief_title>A Pilot Study of Oxalate Absorption in Secondary Hyperoxaluria</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective uncontrolled study in subjects with secondary hyperoxaluria. Subjects will visit the research center three times for outpatient visits (Screening, Test Day 3, Day 4). Subjects will perform three 24-hour urine collections during Screening, Baseline Day 2, and Test Day 3. Test Day 3 includes the oxalate-rich test meal and the subject will collect a 24-hour urine separated into 4 urine collection intervals that are timed in relation to the oxalate-rich test meal (Pre-test meal, 4-hr and 6-hr post test meal and remaining time to 24-hours).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Males or nonpregnant and nonlactating females History of hyperoxaluria secondary to a known underlying enteric disease (e.g., Crohn's disease, bariatric surgery, and others) or without a known underlying cause (idiopathic), and kidney stones. Urinary oxalate â‰¥ 40 mg of oxalate/24hr at screening. If taking drugs for the prevention of stone disease, including pyridoxine, thiazides (chlorthalidone, hydrochlorothiazide, and indapamide), citrate supplements, and allopurinol, there must have been no changes in these medications for at least one month prior to screening and no changes are anticipated for the duration of the study. Able to understand and provide written informed consent. Under or overcollection on screening 24hour urine collection (mg creatinine/kg body weight outside of genderspecific range). Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &lt;40 mL/minute/1.73 m2 or acute renal failure. Primary hyperoxaluria. Allergy, intolerance, or any other factors limiting ability to consume the study foods or adhere to the study meal schedule. Positive pregnancy test during Screening. Clinically significant findings (including acute renal colic), an ongoing clinically significant illness requiring changes in management, or any planned medical/surgical procedure during the study. Malignancy undergoing active therapy; patients in remission on chronic suppressive or maintenance therapies are not excluded. Investigational compound within 30 days prior to screening.</criteria>
