	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to measure the negative cognitive consequences of the ventilation under pathological or experimental cortical drive to breath.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cognitive Consequences of an Activation of the Cortical Drive to Breath (VENTIPSY)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cognitive capacities are measured on healthy subject submitted to inspiratory threshold loading, patients treated by chronic mechanical ventilation due to suffering Ondine syndrome or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The spontaneous breathing is compared to NIV breathing or inspiratory threshold loading.</detailed_description>
