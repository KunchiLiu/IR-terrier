	<brief_title>Effect of a Lifestyle Intervention on Nutritional Status and Prognosis of Endometrial Cancer Survivors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Endometrial cancer (EC) is the fifth most commonly diagnosed malignant neoplasm among women worldwide. The incidence of EC is higher in high-income countries, but it has been increasing in low- and middle-income countries. For example, in Brazil EC is considered the sixth most frequent tumor among women, with 6,950 new cases estimated to occur in 2016. EC is classified into two subtypes of tumor (Type I and Type II), each of them with different clinicopathological features and prognosis. Type I, or endometrioid endometrial carcinoma (EEC), is the most frequent subtype and is often associated with characteristics related to good prognosis, such as low-grade, superficial myometrial invasion and early stage of the disease. The main risk factors for EC include the presence of comorbidities, such as diabetes mellitus and hypertension, as well as conditions associated with prolonged exposure to estrogens. These conditions are: chronic anovulation, hormone replacement therapy, early menarche and / or late menopause, nulliparity, and obesity. Obesity is recognized as a major risk factor for many cancers, including endometrial adenocarcinoma. Multiple mechanisms related to obesity are probably involved in the carcinogenesis of endometrial tumor. Among obese women in the postmenopausal period, there is an increase of bioavailable circulating estrogens. These estrogens come from the aromatization of androgens in adipose tissue and from increased circulating estrogens secondary to the reduced synthesis of sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) in the liver. Insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, increased secretion of adipocytokines and pro-inflammatory cytokines may also play a role in the carcinogenesis of EC. To date, most of the studies were designed to evaluate the association between obesity and the risk for endometrial cancer, without a focus on outcomes (e.g., overall survival and disease-free survival). A recent systematic review showed controversial findings of obesity as a prognostic factor for endometrial cancer patients. The included studies in this review did not investigate the outcomes classified according to histopathology. This fact may have biased the final results of these studies because obesity is specifically associated with the risk of development of EC Type I (ECC). Although the incidence of EC is remarkable, insufficient data has addressed the impact of obesity on EC outcomes. Since about 70% of women diagnosed with EEC are obese, the consequences of obesity-related diseases should be taken into account in order to implement strategies to improve survival outcomes among these women. Sedentary lifestyle and physical inactivity also seem to be relevant, and have been identified as predictors of poor prognosis in patients with different types of cancer. Additionally, cancer survivors who remain physically active usually have better control of body weight and their comorbidities. Consequently, these patients have a higher quality of life than those with a sedentary lifestyle. However, the role of lifestyle (including eating and social habits and physical activity) on endometrial cancer prognosis has not been assessed prospectively yet. Studies assessing nutritional status and lifestyle before and after EC diagnosis may elucidate whether and when these factors influence clinical outcomes, including long-term survival.</detailed_description>
