	<brief_title>Effect of Food on BIA 6-512 (Trans-resveratrol)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Single-centre, open-label, randomised, two-way crossover study in 24 healthy male and female subjects. The study consisted of 2 single-dose periods separated by a washout of 7 days or more. Eligible subjects were admitted to the UFH on the day (Day 0) prior to receiving the dose of study medication (Day 1). On the morning of the next day (Day 1), a BIA 6-512 400 mg dose was administered following either a standard breakfast (Test) or at least 8 hours of fasting (Reference). Subjects remained confined in the UFH from admission (Day 0) until at least 24 h post dose (Day 2); then, they were discharged and returned for the second treatment period or a follow-up visit.</detailed_description>
