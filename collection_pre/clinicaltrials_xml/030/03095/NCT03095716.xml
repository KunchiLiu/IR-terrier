	<brief_title>Laparoscopic Surgery in Elderly Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Previous randomized clinical trial (NCT01887028) showed that the combined use of a low intraperitoneal pressure and a warmed, humidified CO2 gas resulted in better clinical outcomes (better quality of post-operative recovery and less post-operative pain) in patients aged 45-75 years, who underwent laparoscopic surgery for uterine prolapse. Quality of post-operative recovery is very important in elderly patients. Investigators hypothesize that the combined use of a low intraperitoneal pressure and a warmed, humidified CO2 gas may also result in better clinical outcomes. In this observational clinical trial, quality of post-operative recovery by QoR-40, post-operative pain by Visual Analog Scale, intra or postoperative complications and intraoperative core temperature are evaluated in elderly patients (more than 75 years old) who undergo laparoscopic surgery for uterine prolapse. Investigators use a low intraperitoneal pressure (6 mmHg) and a warmed, humidified CO2 gas during laparoscopy. These outcomes will be compared with those of previous randomized clinical trial.</detailed_description>
