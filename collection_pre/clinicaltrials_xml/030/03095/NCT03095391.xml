	<detailed_description>For Cohorts 1 and 2, administration of the study drug will occur within 21 days of screening. Eligible subjects/patients will be admitted to the clinical research unit (CRU) on Day -1, at which time assessments will be performed, and results from both screening and Day -1 (inclusion/exclusion criteria, body weight, height [screening only], body mass index [BMI], medical and surgical history, physical examination, vital signs and pulse oximetry, 12 lead ECG, clinical laboratory tests, renal function assessment, follicle-stimulating hormone [FSH; screening only] and pregnancy test [females only], and urine drugs of abuse and alcohol screen) will be reviewed to confirm eligibility. For Cohorts 3 and 4, administration of the study drug will occur within 21 days of screening. Eligible subjects/patients will be admitted to the CRU on Day 1, at which time assessments will be performed and results from both screening and predose administration testing (inclusion/exclusion criteria, body weight, height [screening only], BMI, medical and surgical history, physical examination, vital signs and pulse oximetry, 12 lead ECG, clinical laboratory tests, renal function assessment, FSH and pregnancy test [screening only], and urine drugs of abuse and alcohol screen) will be reviewed to confirm eligibility. Cohort 1: Eligible subjects will receive a single dose of VFI followed 130 minutes later by a 350 mL infusion of 5% albumin up to maximum volume of 7 mL/kg over 30 minutes on Day 1. Subjects will remain resident in the CRU for at least 24 hours after VFI administration for safety, PK, and PD assessments. Subjects will return to the CRU for an end-of-study (EOS) visit on Day 21 (± 1 day). Cohort 2: Eligible subjects will receive a dose of VFI followed 160 minutes later by a single dose of Iohexol on Day 1 and a second dose of VFI 24 hours following the initial dose of VFI. Subjects will remain resident in the CRU for at least 24 hours after the second VFI administration for safety, PK, and PD assessments. Subjects will return to the CRU for follow-up visits on Days 5 (± 1 day), 9 (± 1 day), and 16 (± 1 day) and an EOS visit on Day 22 (± 1 day). Cohorts 3 and 4: Eligible patients will receive a single dose of VFI followed 160 minutes later by a single dose of Iohexol on Day 1. Patients will remain in the CRU through the 12-hour sample collection after VFI administration for safety, PK, and PD assessments. . Patients will stay at a local hotel near the CRU and will return to the CRU on Day 2 for the 24-hour sample collection. Patients will return to the CRU for follow-up visits on Days 4 (± 1 day), 8 (± 1 day), and 15 (± 1 day) and an EOS visit on Day 21 (± 1 day).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>All Subjects/Patients: 1. Males or females ≥ 18 and ≤ 75 years of age. 2. Females must be of nonchildbearing potential (eg, postmenopausal [defined as cessation of regular menstrual periods for at least 1 year confirmed by folliclestimulating hormone (FSH) test] or surgically sterile by hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or tubal ligation [documentation required] or be using a medically acceptable form of birth control [eg, a barrier method, intrauterine device, or hormonal contraception]) from screening until 30 days after last dose. 3. Males who are sexually active and whose partners are females of childbearing potential must agree to practice abstinence or use condoms from screening through 90 days after administration of the last dose of study drug, and their partners must be willing to use a medically acceptable method of contraception (a barrier method, intrauterine device, or hormonal contraception) from screening through 90 days after administration of the last dose of study drug. 4. Males must agree to not donate sperm from screening through 90 days after administration of the last dose of study drug. 5. Subjects must be able to communicate effectively with the study personnel. 6. Subjects must be informed of the nature and risks of the study and give written informed consent prior to screening. 7. Body mass index ≥ 18.0 and ≤ 40.0 kg/m2, and body weight ≥ 40 kg at screening and CRU admission. BMI = weight (kg)/(height [m])2 Subjects with Normal Renal Function (Cohorts 1 and 2): 8. Subjects must have an eGFR (calculated using the CKDEPI Equation) ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 consistent with the National Kidney Foundation stages 1 and 2 of CKD. 9. Subjects must be otherwise healthy and without clinically significant abnormalities as assessed by review of medical and surgical history, physical examination, vital signs measurement, pulse oximetry, ECG, and clinical laboratory evaluations conducted at screening and CRU admission. A single repeat measurement/test may be performed, at the discretion of the physician, to confirm vital signs, pulse oximetry, ECG, and clinical laboratory tests abnormalities (ie, to confirm that a subject is eligible). Patients with Renal Impairment (Cohorts 3 and 4): 10. Patients in Cohort 3 must have an eGFR (calculated using the CKDEPI Equation) ≥ 30 and &lt; 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 consistent with the National Kidney Foundation stages 3a and 3b of CKD. 11. Patients in Cohort 4 must have an eGFR (calculated using the CKDEPI Equation) ≥ 15 and &lt; 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 consistent with the National Kidney Foundation stage 4 of CKD. 12. Patients may have clinical, ECG, and clinical laboratory findings consistent with their degree of renal dysfunction as assessed by review of medical and surgical history, physical examination, vital signs measurement, pulse oximetry, ECG, and clinical laboratory evaluations conducted at screening and CRU admission. A single repeat measurement/test may be performed, at the discretion of the physician, to confirm vital signs, pulse oximetry, ECG, and clinical laboratory tests abnormalities (ie, to confirm that a subject is eligible). All Subjects/Patients: 1. Female subject/patient is pregnant or breastfeeding. 2.
