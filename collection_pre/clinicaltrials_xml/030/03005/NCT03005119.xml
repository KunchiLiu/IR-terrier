	<brief_summary>A Phase II, double-blind, randomized, placebocontrolled, parallel-group study. Sixty (60) MS patients will be enrolled. PTL201 doses will be titrated over a one-week period until reaching MTD for each participant. The MTD will be administered for three weeks thereafter. Participants demonstrating response to treatment will continue self administering daily PTL201 treatment or placebo, for an additional four weeks. Participants will fill a daily diary.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of the Safety, Tolerability, and Efficacy of Orally Administered PTL201 in MS Patients With Spasticity-related Symptoms</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A Phase II, double-blind, randomized, placebocontrolled, parallel-group study. Spasticity is one of the most common and most disabling symptoms of MS, Cannabinoids reduce pain and spasticity in MS patients. PTL201 capsules contain 5 mg THC and 5 mg cannabidiol (CBD). PTL201 doses will be titrated over a one-week period until reaching maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for each participant (participants will be told they may receive placebo or active treatment, although all treatments will be active). The MTD will be self administered for three weeks thereafter. Participants demonstrating response to treatment will continue self administering daily PTL201 treatment or placebo, for an additional four weeks. Participants will keep a daily diary.</detailed_description>

Definite diagnosis of MS, according to McDonald 2010 criteria, at least six months prior to enrollment, with MS associated spasticity for at least 3 months prior to enrollment 1. Patients suffer from moderate tosevere MSassociated spasticity (≥4 sNRS), with no adequate response to traditional antispastic medications 2. EDSS score: 4 ≤ EDSS ≤ 6; functional motor score ≥3.0 Safety, tolerability and efficacy of PTL201 in reducing multiple sclerosisassociated spasticityrelated symptoms 3. Moderate to severe spasticity in at least two districts of upper and/or lower limbs 3. Antispasticity agent(s) and/or diseasemodifying medications maintained at a stable dose for 30 days prior to and throughout the study 4. Patients able to selfscore spasticity 5. Absence of clinical or neuroradiological relapses from at least three months prior to study entry 6. Willingness and ability to provide written informed consent 7. Willingness and ability to comply with all study requirements 8. Inclusion criteria for placebocontrolled treatment phase: No major protocol violations were recorded for the patient in the responder phase and at least 20% improvement in sNRS 1. Concomitant disease or disorder with spasticitylike symptoms or that may influence the subject's level of spasticity, or medical history suggesting that relapse/remission is likely to recur during the study or expected to influence spasticity 2. Currently using or used cannabis or cannabinoidbased medications within 30 days of study entry and is unwilling to abstain from using them for the duration of the study. 3. Concurrent significant psychiatric, renal, hepatic,cardiovascular or convulsive disorders 4. History or immediate family history of schizophrenia, other psychotic illness, severe personality disorder, or other significant psychiatric disorder other than depression related to MS/MSassociated spasticity. 5. Any known or suspected history of substance abuse/dependence disorder (including opiate abuse),current heavy alcohol consumption, current use of illicit drug, or current nonprescribed use of any prescription drug. 6. Poorly controlled epilepsy or recurrent seizures (i.e., one or more seizures in the past year). 7. Known or suspected hypersensitivity to cannabinoids or to any of the excipients of the study drugs. 8. Myocardial infarction or clinically significant cardiac dysfunction within 12 months of study entry or a cardiac disorder that, in the opinion of the investigator, would put the patient at risk of a clinically significant arrhythmia or myocardial infarction 9. Female patients of childbearing potential and male patients whose partner is of childbearing potential, unless willing to ensure that they or their partner use effective contraception throughout the study and for three months thereafter 10. Female patient who is pregnant, lactating, or planning pregnancy during the course of the study or within the 3 months thereafter. 11. Any other significant diseases or disorder, which, in the opinion of the investigator, participation in the study may either put the patient at risk or may influence the result of the study, or the patient's ability to participate in the study. 12. Travel outside the country planned during the study. 13. Unwilling to abstain from donating blood during the study. 14. Patients previously randomized into a cannabinoidbased clinical trial for MS pain and spasticity within 6 months of study entry.</criteria>
