	<brief_summary>Fungal infections have increased over the last two decades, largely because of the increasing size of the population at risk, including patients who are immunocompromised, broad-spectrum antibiotics and intravascular catheter users. Essential oils and other extracts of plants have evoked interest as sources of natural products. They have been shown to possess antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, insecticidal and antioxidant properties. To the best of our knowledge, no study has examined the efficacy of cumin seed extract on relieving vulvovaginal candidiasis in vivo.</brief_summary>
