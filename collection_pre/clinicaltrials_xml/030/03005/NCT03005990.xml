	<brief_title>The Effects of Exercise Training in Community-dwelling Elderly With Sleep Disturbances With Follow-up</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This project will be conducted in three years: In the first year,investigators will explore the correlation of sleep parameters, dietary behavior and body composition in community-dwelling elders. Two hundred elders will be recruited to receive the actigraph accelerometer recording, sleep quality questionnaire, bio-electrical impedance analysis, heart rate variability analysis, cognitive and depression evaluation. Secondly, the study will evaluate the efficacy and possible mechanisms of a 24-week exercise training for sleep disturbances patients. Sixty patients with sleep disturbances elders will be randomized to exercise group or control group. Participants in the exercise group will receive aerobic and resistance exercise 3 times per week for 24 weeks. The controls will receive sleep hygiene education and consultation. All measurements will be performed as described before. Finally, all the 260 elders participating in this study will receive 12-month follow-up assessments to explore the longitudinal impact of sleep disturbances on cardiorespiratory function, body composition and metabolic function, and long-term effect of exercise training on sleep disturbances patients. Investigators expect elders with poor sleep quality have lower level of health-related fitness and metabolic function; exercise training is effective to improve sleep quality, metabolic function and general health in the elders with sleep disturbances, and the effect can be sustained for a long period.</detailed_description>
