	<detailed_description>This study will assess the clinical utility of pharmacogenomics testing in the clinical management of children with refractory GERD, despite adequate therapy and the role of pharmacogenomics in selecting the right acid suppressive therapy based on each patient's symptoms and pharmacogenomics results.</detailed_description>
