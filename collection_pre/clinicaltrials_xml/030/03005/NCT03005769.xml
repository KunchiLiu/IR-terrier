Data from each patient will be collected after informed consent is signed (inclusion visit), and will include retrospective information from the start of aripiprazole once-monthly treatment initiation (index date) until the follow-up/inclusion visit (minimum of 6 months after the index date). Data will be retrospectively collected from all visits occurring as per clinical practice (usually once monthly).</brief_summary>
