	<criteria>Men and women â‰¥18 years of age Dose escalation cohorts: Patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of malignancy (including lymphoma) with demonstrated progression of a tumor for whom there is no available therapy likely to convey clinical benefit AND who have not been previously treated with a PD1/PDL1 inhibitor. These patients do not require measurable disease Dose expansion cohorts: Patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of 1 of specified tumors with measurable disease per RECIST 1.1 or Lugano criteria. Some patients may have been previously treated with a PD1 or PDL1 inhibitor Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1 Adequate organ and bone marrow function Prior treatment with any LAG3 targeting biologic or small molecule Radiation therapy within 2 weeks prior to randomization and not recovered to baseline from any AE due to radiation Untreated or active central nervous system metastases Ongoing or recent (within 5 years) evidence of significant autoimmune disease Corticosteroid therapy (&gt;10 mg prednisone/day or equivalent) within 1 week prior to the first dose of study drug Myocardial infarction within 6 months Documented allergic or acute hypersensitivity reaction attributed to antibody treatments</criteria>
