	<brief_title>Transition From Adolescents to Adulthood for Patients With Congenital Heart Diseases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The number of adults with congenital heart diseases (CHD) is increasing. However, many young adults are lost to follow-up even in experienced tertiary care centers. American and European guidelines recommend to improve the management of young adults with CHD. Structured therapeutic education programs are therefore needed to optimize the transfer to adult healthcare. Our tertiary care CHD center recently implemented a transition program and simultaneously we decided to measure its impact. Indeed we need data from randomized trials in this filed. After previous controlled quality of life studies among children and adults with CHD, we chose to use the health-related quality of life (HR-QoL) as primary endpoint in this randomized study to focus on patient related outcomes. We assume that patients who participate in our program will improve their quality of life compared to controls. If we demonstrate the benefit of our program, it will have important consequences for patients with CHD and eventually for patients with other chronic medical conditions.</detailed_description>
