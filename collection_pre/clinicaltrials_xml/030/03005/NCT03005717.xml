	<brief_summary>Study LIPO-202-CL-31 is a multi center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of two different doses of LIPO-202 versus placebo on submental bulging due to subcutaneous fat. Approximately 150 participants of either gender who have a "Moderate Bulge" or "Large Bulge" in the submental fat (on Patient-Reported Submental Bulging Scale [PR-SBS] and Clinician-Reported Submental Bulging Scale [CR-SBS]) will be recruited for this study.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of LIPO-202 for the Reduction of Submental Subcutaneous Fat</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Potential subjects will present and complete the Screening Visit. All qualifying subjects will be randomized to one of three treatment groups and treated with up to 30 subcutaneous injections of the assigned study drug into submental fat, once a week for 8 weeks. Upon completion of treatment visits, subject will return to the clinic for a follow-up visit and end of study visit, one and four weeks after the last treatment. The number and pattern of injections will be based on the area (cm x cm) of submental fat at baseline. At each visit the subjects will also undergo an examination of the treatment area, collection of vital signs and questioning about possible adverse events (AEs). The study consists of 11 visits: a Screening Visit, eight Treatment Visits, a Follow up Visit and an End of Study Visit.</detailed_description>
