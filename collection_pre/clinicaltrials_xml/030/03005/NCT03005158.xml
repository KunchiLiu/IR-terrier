	<brief_summary>Patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome account for a tenth of all presentations to the Emergency Department and up to 40 per cent of unplanned hospital admissions. The majority of patients do not have a heart attack (myocardial infarction), and may be safely discharged from the Emergency Department. The investigators propose to evaluate whether the use of the HighSTEACS pathway in patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome reduces length of stay and allows more patients to be safely discharged from the Emergency Department. This pathways utilizes high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I testing and will rule out myocardial infarction if troponin concentrations are &lt;5 ng/L on presentation, with further testing indicated at 3 hours only in those presenting early or with troponin concentrations between 5 ng/L and the 99th centile. In six secondary and tertiary centres across Scotland, the investigators will introduce the pathway as part of a stepped wedge cluster randomized controlled trial. Sequential hypothesis testing will evaluate the efficacy and safety of the pathway. The primary efficacy end-point will be length of stay from time of presentation until final hospital discharge and the primary safety end-point will be survival free from type 1 or 4b myocardial infarction or cardiac death from discharge to 30 days. The study population will consist of those patients with cardiac troponin concentrations within the normal reference range (&lt;99th centile) at presentation.</brief_summary>
