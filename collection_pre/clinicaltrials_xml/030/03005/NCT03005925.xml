	<brief_summary>Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is the most common inflammatory rheumatism in adults, affecting nearly 0.4% of the general population. It is a real public health issue. International guidelines recommend strict control (remission or low disease activity) of the disease, to avoid joint destruction in order to reduce the functional impact of the disease in the long term and to improve the quality of life of the patients. This care is based on a close follow-up requiring regular visits with the specialist which represents an additional cost (transport, visits). In this context, tele-medicine is often proposed as a complementary approach in the management of these chronic patients. Thus, the investigators propose to study the interest of a connected device by comparing a group of patients using this Smartphone application, coupled with a hand dynamometer during the 6 months following initiation of a new DMARD.</brief_summary>
