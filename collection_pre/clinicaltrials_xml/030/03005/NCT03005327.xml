	<brief_title>A Trial of X4P-001 in Patients With WHIM Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective of Phase 2 is to determine the safety, tolerability, and dose selection of X4P‑001 for Phase 3 in patients with WHIM syndrome. The primary objective of Phase 3 is to demonstrate that X4P-001 is an effective treatment for patients with WHIM syndrome, as demonstrated by sustained increases in circulating neutrophils and lymphocytes that are associated with improvements in clinical manifestations of WHIM syndrome.</detailed_description>

Has, at screening, laboratory tests meeting one or more of the following criteria: A positive or indeterminate screening test for antibody to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 or 2. A positive antibody test for hepatitis C virus (HCV), unless documented to have no detectable viral load on two independent samples. A positive test for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). 4. Has, at screening, safety laboratory tests meeting one or more of the following criteria: Hemoglobin &lt;8.0 g/dL Platelets &lt;75,000/μL Creatinine &gt;2.0 x the upper limit of normal (ULN) Serum aspartate transaminase (AST) &gt;2.5x ULN Serum alanine transaminase (ALT) &gt;2.5x ULN Total bilirubin &gt;1.5x ULN (unless due to Gilbert's Syndrome) International normalized ratio (INR) &gt;1.5x ULN 5. Has, within 6 months prior to Day 1, received Plerixafor (openlabel or blinded) as treatment of WHIM Syndrome. 6. Has, within the 4 weeks prior to Day 1, had surgery requiring general anesthesia. 7. Has, within 2 weeks prior to Day 1, received any of the following treatments: GCSF or granulocytemacrophage colonystimulating factor (GMCSF) Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) Corticosteroids (&gt;10 mg prednisone equivalent per day) Investigational therapies should be discussed with the Medical Monitor 8. Has, within 2 weeks prior to Day 1, received a medication prohibited based on Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) and/or Pglycoprotein 1 (P‑gp) interaction. 9. Has, at the planned initiation of study drug, an uncontrolled and active infection (excluding warts). 10. Has any other medical or personal condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, may potentially compromise the safety or compliance of the patient, or may preclude the patient's successful completion of the clinical study.</criteria>
