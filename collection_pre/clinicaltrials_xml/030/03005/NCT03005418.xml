	<brief_summary>This study evaluates the use of the Human Acellular Vessel (HAV) in adults with arterial trauma in the lower limb who are undergoing vascular reconstructive surgery. All subjects will be implanted with a HAV as an interposition vessel or bypass using standard vascular surgical techniques. There is no control arm.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Humacyte Human Acellular Vessel (HAV) in Patients With Limb-threatening Peripheral Arterial Trauma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, multicenter, single arm, non-randomized phase 2 study in up to 20 adult patients with limb-threatening damage to the superficial femoral or popliteal artery who require surgical repair. Subjects will be implanted with a Humacyte Human Acellular Vessel (HAV) as an interposition vessel or bypass using standard vascular surgical techniques. There is no control arm. The active study duration for each study participant will be 12 months from HAV implantation or until HAV failure/ removal/ death if earlier. Additional follow up at 6 month intervals until 36 months will involve the capture of information on assessments performed at "standard of care" routine clinic visits or by telephone follow up with the patient or his/her physician. There are no study specific visits or procedures after 12 months. The total expected duration of the clinical study is 24 months (12 months of enrollment and 12 months of study specific visits) plus 2 years additional follow up at routine clinical visits or via telephone contact with the subject and/or the physician designated to continue long term care of the subject.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Patients with lower limb vascular trauma which threatens the viability of the leg and who require reconstruction of the superficial femoral or popliteal artery 2. Preoperative ultrasound or angiography or CT angiography or clinical examination indicates damage to the superficial femoral artery (SFA) or popliteal artery requiring reconstruction with an interposition bypass vessel AND required bypass length of â‰¤ 38cm 3. Proximal anastomosis is expected to be to the common femoral artery below the inguinal ligament or to the superficial femoral artery or popliteal artery 4. Distal anastomosis is expected to be to the SFA, popliteal artery or the tibioperoneal trunk 5. Autologous vein graft is either not feasible in the judgment of the treating surgeon (e.g. because of lack of availability of suitable conduit, presence of severe venous insufficiency) or is not desirable because of the urgency of revascularization 6. Aged 18 to 85 years old, inclusive 7. Able to communicate meaningfully with investigative staff and able to comply with study procedures. If the patient is unconscious then information from a reliable witness indicates that the patient would normally be able to understand and comply with study procedures 8. Patient or legal representative is able, willing and competent to give informed consent 9. Life expectancy of at least 1 year 1. Limb at high risk of amputation despite vascular reconstruction e.g., because of crush injury 2. Life threatening head, chest, or abdominal injuries that make survival unlikely 3. Distal anastomosis planned to a tibial or pedal artery 4. Pregnant women 5. Known medical condition which would preclude long term dual antiplatelet therapy after resolution of acute injuries 6. Any other condition which in the judgment of the investigator would preclude adequate evaluation of the safety and efficacy of the Humacyte Human Acellular Vessel (HAV) 7. Previous enrollment in this study 8. Employees of the sponsor or patients who are employees or relatives of the investigator</criteria>
