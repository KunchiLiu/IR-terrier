	<brief_summary>In the present study we aim at validating the computation of FFRangio values from the angiogram by comparing them to measured wire-based FFR values, in a larger scale and in a completely blinded manner. Investigation of a wide range of users in various conditions may strengthen the reliability of the FFRAngio measurements.</brief_summary>
