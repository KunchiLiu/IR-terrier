	<brief_summary>Cognitive impairment is also a major risk factor for development of dementia later in life. Findings from recent studies suggest that the there are many nutrients contained in foods that may be important in cognitive function in the elderly. This study evaluates long-term intervention with almonds and snack mix as a treatment strategy for age-related cognitive impairment which could possibly prevent the onset of dementia. The proposed study is designed as a randomized, placebo controlled trial that tests the effects of 6 month supplementation with 1.5 or 3 ounces of almonds or 3 ounces of shortbread containing coconut oil on cognitive function in older adults. Secondary outcomes include plasma biomarkers of oxidative stress and inflammation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect of Consumption of Almonds and Snack Mix Daily for 6 Months on Cognitive Function in Older Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study is designed as a controlled trial that tests the effects of 6 month supplementation with 1.5 or 3 ounces of almonds or 3 ounces of snack mix a day on cognitive function in older adults. Subjects will be randomly assigned to one of the three groups. Secondary outcomes include plasma biomarkers of oxidative stress and inflammation. Participants will be recruited from community-dwelling men and women aged greater than of equal to 50 yr and less than or equal to 75 years and potential participants will be screened to meet cognitive and functional criteria. Participants will be pre-screened by telephone; those who appear to meet criteria will undergo further screening.</detailed_description>
