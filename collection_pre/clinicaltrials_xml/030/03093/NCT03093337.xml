	<brief_summary>Our current reflexion is that sensory dys-stimulations, including vestibule-proprioceptive disorders and unbalanced between brain and brainstem maturation of the neonatal period involve an early deviant development for immature infants that will be cascaded through the brain scaffolding and later development. The primary purpose is to determine whether the Early Psychomotor Therapy Intervention Program improves development and behavior in very preterm infants (VPI) at 24-month corrected age (CA).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Psychomotor Therapy for Very Premature Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>VPI &lt; 30 week of amenorrhea were randomized, in a simple blind controlled trial. The psychomotor development was evaluated according to the Bayley Scales of Infant Development-III (BSID-III) at 2 years CA. An intermediate point was provided at 9 months CA. Pediatric standardized assessments and psychologist semi-directive interviews were conducted. Parents also completed a self-administering questionnaire relating to the post-traumatic stress. The intervention consisted on 20 therapy sessions between 2 and 9 months CA, in order to support infants' development, and parent-infant interactions and adjustment. Extended description of the protocol, including more technical information (as compared to the Brief Summary) if desired. Do not include the entire protocol; do not duplicate information recorded in other data elements, such as eligibility criteria or outcome measures.</detailed_description>
