	<brief_summary>Clinically significant anxiety affects up to 20% of preschool-aged children and often fails to respond to currently available treatments. Emerging science suggests that increasing brain capacity for "effortful control" (EC) may help anxious children to regulate emotion and behavior to improve outcomes. Thus, in the proposed study, children will be trained on EC tasks (including selective attention, response inhibition, etc.) to increase capacity for effortful control (EC) over fear behaviors. To determine whether EC training improves brain capacity to regulate fear, investigators will assess neurophysiological and behavioral indices of effortful control and fear reactivity before and after this training.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This experiment will randomize child participants with clinical to subclinical anxiety across two conditions to test the effects of a piloted effortful control (EC) training intervention. Up to 40 preschool age girls (4-6.99 years) with clinical to subclinical anxiety symptoms will complete either a weeklong, camp-like EC training (n=20) or a waitlist control (n=20). Before and after the active and control conditions (time 1 and time 2, respectively), an EEG-based measure, the error-related negativity (ERN), will be collected while children play a simple computer game. The ERN indexes neural mechanisms underlying EC. Other measures to be collected before and after the EC training include a blink reflex known as the fear potentiated startle (FPS); laboratory-assessed EC and fear behaviors; and, clinically assessed anxiety symptoms. The EC intervention or "EC camp" will occur over 4 mornings (Saturday and Sunday over two consecutive weekends) from 9AM to 12PM. These times were chosen to maximize child focus and energy as well as convenience for families. EC camp is comprised of short, game-like exercises that teach effortful control skills (e.g., response inhibition, selective attention, set shifting skills). Of the 40 participants enrolled in the study, 20 will be randomized to receive the EC training intervention and 20 to wait list control. Wait list participants will be given a set of written materials (adapted from the EC camp protocol) to complete at home with their caregivers after the post-wait list assessment. Primary analyses will test for group mean differences in ERN and FPS changes (i.e. from time 1 to time 2) among children assigned to EC training compared to those in the control condition. Secondary analyses will test relationship of changes in neurophysiological targets with change in EC and Fear behaviors and change in anxiety severity. This study hopes to examine the mechanistic plausibility of a precise, neuroscientifically-derived treatment for childhood anxiety, promoting developmental trajectories towards health and away from chronic illness.</detailed_description>
