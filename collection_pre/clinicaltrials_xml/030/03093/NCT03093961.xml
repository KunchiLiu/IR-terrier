	<brief_summary>The objective of this pilot study is to evaluate the safety and performance of implanting the IASD® System II in Heart Failure patients with reduced ejection fraction and elevated left sided filling pressures, who remain symptomatic despite Guideline Directed Medical Therapy (GDMT).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Reduce LAP-HFREF TRIAL</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The intended clinical indication of the IASD System II is the reduction of elevated LAP in patients with symptomatic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, despite appropriate medical management. The implant is designed with a center barrel opening that, in the setting of elevated LAP, allows left to right flow. Since many of the symptoms these patients experience are believed to be due to elevated LAP, the IASD System II has the potential to significantly reduce symptoms and improve the quality of life in patients with otherwise limited treatment options. The study design is a prospective, non-randomized, single-arm feasibility trial. This study will implant up to 10 subjects. The population will include heart failure patients with reduced ejection fraction, and elevated left sided filling pressures, who remain symptomatic despite GDMT, including optimal doses of recommended pharmaceutical treatments, surgical, and device intervention(s) (CRT, AICD, reduction of MRI). After analysis of the 1 month results (including baseline and 1 month Core laboratory echocardiographic and hemodynamic data) of the first 5 implanted patients, a decision will be made to implant an additional 5 patients,</detailed_description>
