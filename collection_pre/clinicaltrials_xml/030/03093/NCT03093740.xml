	<brief_title>Direct-acting Antiviral Therapy to Prevent HCV Infection for HCV Positive Donor to HCV Negative Recipient Kidney Transplant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study objective is to determine if the administration of direct acting antivirals for 12-16 weeks after kidney transplantation prevents the spread of HCV infection from donor kidney with known HCV infection (all genotypes) to an HCV negative recipient as evidenced by a negative HCV viral RNA at 12 weeks post treatment.</detailed_description>
