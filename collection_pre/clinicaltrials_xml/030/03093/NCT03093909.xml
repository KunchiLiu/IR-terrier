	<brief_summary>The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of gemcitabine that can be given by inhalation (breathing it as a mist) to patients with solid tumors that have spread to the lungs from other parts of the body.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Aerosol Gemcitabine in Patients With Solid Tumors and Pulmonary Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration: If found to be eligible to take part in this study, participants will be assigned to a dose level of gemcitabine based on when participants join this study. Up to 6 dose levels of gemcitabine will be tested. Up to 3 participants will be enrolled at each dose level. The first group of participants will receive the lowest dose level. Each new group will receive a higher dose than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects are seen. This will continue until the highest tolerable dose of gemcitabine is found. Each study cycle is 28 days. Participants will visit the clinic before the start of every cycle to receive their doses of the study drug for the next cycle. Participants will be provided with a machine called a nebulizer to make the gemcitabine mist. To take the study drug, participant will breathe the drug mist through the mouthpiece of the nebulizer. Participant will take gemcitabine by mist 2 times each week for 4 weeks (28 days). The study staff will tell participant which days to take the study drug. If the doctor thinks it is in participant's best interest, participant may continue to receive the study drug for up to 12 cycles. Length of Study: Participant may continue taking the study drug for up to 12 cycles. Participant will no longer be able to take the study drug if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if participant is unable to follow study directions. If participant has developed a tumor outside of the lungs either before or while participant is on study, and the doctor thinks it is in participant's best interest, participant may have a local control procedure (such as radiation or surgery), that may help to control the disease while continuing to receive the study drug. Participant would sign a separate consent form explaining these procedures and their risks. Participation on the study will be over after participant's last follow-up phone call. Study Visits: Within 3 days before Day 1 of every cycle: - Participant will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 4 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to check participant's liver function. - Participant will have PFTs. - Participant will have participant's blood oxygen level measured by pulse oximeter. - If participant can become pregnant, urine will be collected for a pregnancy test. On Day 8 of Cycle 1: - Participant will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 4 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to check participant's liver function. Participant will have a CT scan at any time during Cycles 2, 4, and 6, and then every 3 cycles after that. The study doctor will tell participant when participant will have these scans. To avoid having to come to the study clinic too often, participant may have all blood draws done by participant's personal doctor. Participant may be called by the study staff and asked about how participant is doing and about any side effects about 1 day after participant's first 2 doses of the study drug, at the end of Cycle 1, and 1 time every 3 months after that until participant leaves the study or the study ends. These calls should last about 15-20 minutes each time. This is an investigational study. Gemcitabine is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of pancreatic and lung cancer, and other solid tumors. Its administration by inhalation is investigational. The study doctor can explain how the study drug is designed to work. Up to 44 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Patients with diagnosis of solid tumor with lung metastases and patient's current disease state must be one for which there is no known curative therapy or therapy proven to prolong survival with an acceptable quality of life. 2. Willing to comply with protocol therapy and required safety monitoring (selfreport, pulse oximetry, remote spirometry, labs). 3. Adequate organ function as defined by: peripheral absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1,000/mm3, platelet count ≥ 100,000/mm3 (transfusion independent defined as not receiving platelet transfusions within a 7 day period prior to enrollment), hemoglobin ≥ 8.0g/dl (may receive RBC transfusions), renalcreatinine ≤ 2 x ULN; hepatic bilirubin and AST ≤ 5x ULN; pulmonary: FVC ≥50% predicted, Oxyhemoglobin saturation at rest ≥95% (off supplemental oxygen). 4. Patient age ≥ 12 years and ≤ 50 years. 5. Performance Status: ECOG ≤ 2 for patients ≥ 16 years old or Lansky play ≥ 60% for patients ≤15 years old. 6. Patients must have resolution of all acute toxic effects (excluding alopecia) of any prior anticancer therapy to NCI CTCAE Grade ≤ 1 or to the baseline laboratory values as defined in the inclusion criteria. 7. No radiotherapy within 2 weeks. 8. Subjects who received GCB systemically previously are eligible for participation. 1. Currently being treated with bronchodilators or corticosteroids or known to have active asthma. This will not include patients who suffered from asthma as a child and outgrew it. 2. Pregnant or breastfeeding women will not be entered into this study due to risks of fetal and teratogenic adverse events as seen in animal studies. Pregnancy tests must be obtained in females who are postmenarchal and of childbearing potential (e.g. female that has not been amenorrheic for at least 12 consecutive months or surgically sterilized). Males or females of reproductive potential will not participate unless they have agreed to use effective contraception for the entire period in which they are receiving protocol therapy and for at least one month after treatment ends. Effective contraception is defined as intrauterine device (IUD), hormonal (birth control pill, injections, implants, patch), tubal ligation and partner's vasectomy. Abstinence is an acceptable method of birth control. 3. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, bradycardia, related to cardiac disease, bundle branch block, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements. 4. Subjects with baseline symptoms of fever and/or cough and/or shortness of breath and/or wheezing and/or fatigue grade ≥ 2 (CTCAE v4.0). 5. Patients receiving other concurrent cancer therapy including chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or biologic therapy. 6. Unresolved toxicities from prior anticancer therapy, defined as having not resolved to NCI CTCAE Grade ≤1 with the exception of alopecia and laboratory values listed per the inclusion criteria. Subjects with irreversible toxicity that is not reasonably expected to be exacerbated by the investigational product may be included (eg, hearing loss).</criteria>
