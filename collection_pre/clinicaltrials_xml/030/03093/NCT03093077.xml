	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate and compare implant kinematics of conventional mechanically aligned and anatomically aligned total knee arthroplasties (TKA) at 1 year post-operatively.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Kinematics After Total Knee Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants will be randomized to receive a primary TKA using either an anatomic alignment or a conventional mechanical alignment technique. Participants will undergo a kinematic analysis of a deep knee bend using single-plane fluoroscopy at 1 year post-operatively. The primary outcome will be based on the 6 degree of freedom kinematics and associated joint component proximity during the knee bend task. Secondary outcomes include the Knee Society Score, the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, and the Forgotten Knee Score.</detailed_description>
