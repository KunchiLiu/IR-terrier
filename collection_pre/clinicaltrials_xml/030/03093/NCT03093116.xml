	<criteria>Key 1. Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of locally advanced or metastatic solid tumor (including nonHodgkin Lymphoma) (Stage IV, AJCC v.7) that harbors an ALK, ROS1, NTRK1, NTRK2, or NTRK3 gene rearrangement by protocol specified tests. 2. ECOG PS 01. 3. Age ≥18 (or age ≥ 20 of age as required by local regulation). 4. At least 1 measurable target lesion according to RECIST version 1.1. CNSonly measurable disease as defined by RECIST version 1.1 is allowed. 5. Prior cytotoxic chemotherapy is allowed. 6. Prior immunotherapy is allowed. 7. Resolution of all acute toxic effects (excluding alopecia) of any prior anticancer therapy to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version 4.03 Grade less than or equal to 1. 8. Patients with asymptomatic CNS involvement are allowed. 9. Life expectancy ≥ 3 months. Key 1. Concurrent participation in another therapeutic clinical trial. 2. Symptomatic CNS involvement. 3. Any of the following cardiovascular history in the past 6 months: myocardial infarction, unstable angina, coronary/ peripheral artery bypass graft, symptomatic congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular accident or transient ischemic attack, pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, symptomatic bradycardia, requirement for antiarrhythmic medication. 4. History of prolonged QTc interval. 5. Known active infections (bacterial, fungal, viral including HIV positivity). 6. Gastrointestinal disease (e.g., Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, or short gut syndrome) or other malabsorption syndromes that would impact drug absorption. 7. Peripheral neuropathy ≥ Grade 2. 8. Known interstitial lung disease, interstitial fibrosis, or history of tyrosine kinase inhibitorinduced pneumonitis. Patients with a history of prior radiation pneumonitis are not excluded.</criteria>
