	<brief_summary>The purpose of the trial is to investigate if the use of inhaled colistimethate sodium administered twice daily for 12 months delays the time to the first pulmonary exacerbation compared to placebo in subjects with non-cystic fibrosis (CF) bronchiectasis chronically infected with P. aeruginosa</brief_summary>

	<criteria>signed informed consent ; aged 18 years or older of either genders; diagnosed with nonCF bronchiectasis by computerised tomography (or high resolution CT); had at least 2 pulmonary exacerbations requiring oral antibiotics or 1 pulmonary exacerbation requiring intravenous antibiotics in the 12 months preceding the Screening Visit; had 1 positive sputum culture for P. aeruginosa in the 12 months preceding the Screening Visit; are clinically stable and have not required a change in pulmonary treatment for at least 30 days before the Screening Visit; have prebronchodilator Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1) ≥30% of predicted; had a positive sputum culture for P. aeruginosa at the Screening Visit. cystic fibrosis (CF) or focal endobronchial lesion or otherwise curable causes (e.g. foreign body aspiration); known history of hypogammaglobulinaemia requiring treatment with immunoglobulin, inflammatory bowel disease, primary ciliary dyskinesia, myasthenia gravis, porphyria or myeloproliferative disease, severe cardiovascular disease; receiving treatment for allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA); massive haemoptysis (greater than or equal to 300 mL or requiring blood transfusion) predominant lung condition being chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma or interstitial lung disease in the opinion of the Investigator; History of any of the following: listed for transplantation; any other significant active illness likely to affect the patient's survival within 12 months; receiving longterm domiciliary oxygen therapy or noninvasive ventilation for the management of respiratory failure; current active malignancy, except for basal cell carcinoma of the skin without metastases, history of solid organ or bone marrow transplant; taking immunosuppressive medications such as azathioprine, methotrexate, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus, mycophenolate, anti cytokine medications, rituximab; current diagnosis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection; positive cultures for Mycobacterium abscessus complex, or Mycobacterium avium complex, or Mycobacterium xenopi, or Mycobacterium kansasii, or Mycobacterium malmoense or Mycobacterium simiae in the year preceding the Screening Visit ; current treatment for nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) pulmonary infection or be under consideration for NTM treatment in the next 12 months; current smokers or exsmokers less than 6 months prior to Screening Visit; evidence of bronchial hyperreactivity that may, in the opinion of the Investigator, indicate such subjects will not be able to tolerate colistimethate sodium; therapy with long term (≥ 30 days) prednisone at stable dose greater than 15 mg a day (or equivalent dose of any other corticosteroid) prior to Screening Visit 1 ; new maintenance treatment with oral macrolides (azithromycin or erythromycin) started within 30 days of the Screening Visit ;</criteria>
