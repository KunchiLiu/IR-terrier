	<criteria>Histologically confirmed locally advanced (T4b, any N; any T, N23), or metastatic (M1) urothelial carcinoma of the bladder, ureter, urethra, or renal pelvis by the enrolling institution. Patients with mixed histologies are required to have a predominant urothelial component as reviewed by the pathologist at the enrolling institution. Age ≥18 years Life expectancy ≥ 12 weeks The patient must have at least two sites of measurable disease (per RECIST v1.1; see Appendix 2). Additionally, one of these sites must be amenable to biopsy and, in the opinion of the investigator and/or interventional radiologist, likely to yield acceptable tumor sample for a core biopsy per the below pathology criteria. Lesions that are biopsied may not be considered target lesions per RECIST v1.1. Subject must agree to undergo two researchdirected biopsies during treatment. Patients must have adequate tumor tissue available for PDL1 testing. Adequate tumor tissue is defined as: For coreneedle biopsy specimens, at least three cores should be submitted for evaluation. Acceptable samples include coreneedle biopsies for deep tumor tissue (minimum of three cores) or excisional, incisional, punch, or forceps biopsies for cutaneous, subcutaneous, or mucosal lesions. Samples collected from fineneedle aspiration, brushing, cell pellet from pleural effusion, bone metastases without a soft tissue component, and lavage are not acceptable. For pretreatment archival tissue, representative urothelial carcinoma FFPE tumor specimens (tumor blocks or 30 unstained slides) must be provided. Patients with &lt; 30 slides may be enrolled after discussion with the MSK Principal Investigator. Primary or metastatic specimens (with the exception of bone because it is not evaluable for PDL1 expression) may be submitted.
