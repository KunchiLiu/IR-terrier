	<brief_summary>To investigate the tolerability and safety of four multiple-dose regimens of BIA 6-512 (25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg, and 150 mg 6 times daily) in healthy volunteers and to characterise the steady-state pharmacokinetic profiles of BIA 6-512 (25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg, and 150 mg 6 times daily) in healthy volunteers.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Single-centre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled study of four multiple-rising doses in four sequential groups of 10 healthy volunteers each. Eligible subjects were admitted to the UFH on the day (Day 0) prior to receiving the first dose of study medication. On the morning of the next day (Day 1), subjects started receiving BIA 6-512/Placebo at 4 h intervals (6 times/day) for 48 h (13 investigational product administrations, in total). Subjects remained confined in the UFH from admission (Day 0) until at least 24 h post last dose (Day 4); then, they were discharged and were requested to return for the follow-up visit. At given time-points, subjects were submitted to vital signs recording, brief neurological examination, and 12-lead ECG. Blood samples for plasma drug assays were taken at the following times: Dose 1: pre-dose and ¼, ½, ¾, 1, 1½, 2, and 3 hours post-dose; Doses 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11: pre-dose; Dose 13: pre-dose and ¼, ½, ¾, 1, 1½, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16 and 24 hours post-dose.</detailed_description>
