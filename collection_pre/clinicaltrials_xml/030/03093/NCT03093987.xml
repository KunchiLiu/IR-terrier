	<brief_summary>Objective To investigate whether critical care ultrasound oriented shock management in shock patients in intensive care unit(ICU) can improve outcome. Methods Randomized controlled research. Patients were randomly allocated to two groups. In the critical care ultrasound oriented shock management group (CUSS group), treatment was oriented by the findings of critical care ultrasound in each shock phase, while in the control group the decisions about the monitoring and management were made by the clinical team. The goal of treatments in both groups were decreasing lactate by 20% or more per 2 hours for the Optimization phase in shock management, and no increase lactate level when removing the fluid in de-escalation phase. The primary outcome measure were hospital mortality and 28-day mortality, the secondary outcome measure were the length of ventilation and the length of ICU stay.</brief_summary>
