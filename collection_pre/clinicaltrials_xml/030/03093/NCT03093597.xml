	<brief_title>Skin Barrier Biophysical Properties and Clinical Appearance After Moisturizer in Dry Skin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal of this study is to compare how the appearance of dry skin changes before and after the use of following moisturizers: white petrolatum, coconut oil, jojoba oil and almond oil). Up to 40 subjects from Banner-University Medical Center/University of Arizona dermatology clinics and University of California, Davis dermatology clinics (up to 20 subjects per site) who have dry skin will be enrolled in this study and randomized to receive the four moisturizers on four locations on their forearms.There will be a total of 3 study sessions: baseline, and approximately 1 and 2 weeks for follow up assessment. At each visit, dry skin severity will be evaluated by a trained observer using a validated Dry Skin Score, skin barrier biophysical properties (transepidermal water loss and hydration) will be measured, and digital photos of the test sites will be taken for image analysis.</detailed_description>
