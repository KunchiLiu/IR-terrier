	<brief_title>Safety and Effectiveness Study of Pre-operative Artesunate in Stage II/III Colorectal Cancer (NeoART-V)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer worldwide and represents a significant health care burden with an incidence of one million new cases per year. In Vietnam, Colorectal cancer is the third most common cause of cancer deaths in men and fourth in women. Artesunate is a safe and effective antimalarial with evidence of anticancer properties across a range of cancer cell lines. Results from a pilot feasibility study in colorectal cancer patients in the UK showed that artesunate was safe and well tolerated. These findings provided the basis for a Phase II clinical trial investigating the effects of neoadjuvant artesunate on progression free survival and overall survival in Stage II/III Colorectal Cancer in Vietnamese Patients. Artesunate given orally as a dose of 200 mg once a day for 14 days to patients with histologically confirmed Stage II/III colorectal cancer (CRC) awaiting surgical treatment with curative intent.</detailed_description>
