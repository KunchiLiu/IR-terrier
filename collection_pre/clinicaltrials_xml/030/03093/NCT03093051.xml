	<brief_title>Termination Therapy for Ventricular Tachyarrhythmias</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This non-blinded, single-arm open-label, non-significant risk, phase 1 pilot, acute research feasibility trial aims to demonstrate that the safety and effectiveness of Unpinning Termination (UPT) electrotherapy observed in the canine can be translated to humans and to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of UPT electrotherapy in the human population most likely to benefit from this therapy. This observation study evaluates the safety and effectiveness of UPT therapy in subjects during either an indicated ventricular tachycardia (VT) catheter ablation or an indicated initial implant or device replacement of an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD).</detailed_description>
