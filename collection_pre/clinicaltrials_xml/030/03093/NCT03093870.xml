	<brief_summary>This protocol for Varlitinib is developed for the treatment of Biliary Tract Cancer. Varlitinib (also known as ASLAN001) is a small-molecule, adenosine triphosphate competitive inhibitor of the tyrosine kinases - epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER)2, and HER4. Varlitinib may be beneficial to subjects with cancer by simultaneous inhibition of these receptors. The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of Varlitinib in combination with capecitabine for the treatment of Biliary Tract Cancer. Treatment groups are Varlitinib+capecitabine and Placebo + capecitabine</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subjects will be eligible for the study if they: 1. Are of or older than the legal age in the respective countries at the time when written informed consent is obtained 2. Have histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced (unresectable) or metastatic biliary tract cancer, including intrahepatic or extrahepatic CCA, gallbladder cancer and carcinoma of Ampulla of Vater 3. Have received and failed one and only one prior line of systemic treatment for advanced or metastatic disease with clear evidence of disease progression. This prior line of systemic treatment must also contain gemcitabine. 4. Have radiographically measurable disease based on RECIST v1.1 5. Have no evidence of biliary duct obstruction, unless obstruction is controlled by local treatment or, in whom the biliary tree can be decompressed by endoscopic or percutaneous stenting with subsequent reduction in bilirubin to below 1.5 x upper level of normal (ULN) 6. Have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1 7. Have an estimated life expectancy of more than 3 months 8. Are able to understand and willing to sign the informed consent form 9. Have adequate organ and hematological function: 1. Hematological function, as follows: Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 x 109/L Platelet count ≥ 100 x 109/L 2. Renal functions, as follows: eGFR or CrCl &gt; 60 mL/min/1.73m2 3. Hepatic function, as follows: Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN Aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase ≤ 5 x ULN Subjects will be ineligible for the study if they: 1. Are currently on or have received anticancer therapy within the past 4 weeks 2. Are currently on or have received radiation or local treatment within the past 4 weeks for the target lesion(s) 3. Have had major surgical procedures within 14 days prior to study entry 4. Have a metastatic brain lesion(s), including asymptomatic and well controlled lesion(s) 5. Have malabsorption syndrome, diseases significantly affecting gastrointestinal function, resection of the stomach or small bowel, or difficulty in swallowing and retaining oral medications 6. Have uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, diabetes, hypertension, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements 7. Have any history of other malignancy unless in remission for more than 1 year (nonmelanoma skin carcinoma and carcinomainsite of uterine cervix treated with curative intent is not exclusionary) 8. Are female subjects who are pregnant or breast feeding 9. Have been previously treated with varlitinib or capecitabine 10. Have received any investigational drug (or have used an investigational device) within the last 14 days before receiving the first dose of study medication 11. Have unresolved or unstable serious toxicity ( ≥ CTCAE 4.03 Grade 2) from prior administration of another investigational drug and/or prior cancer treatment 12. Have a known positive test for human immunodeficiency virus, active hepatitis C, hepatitis B infection with hepatitis B virus DNA exceeding 2000 IU/mL 13. Have a known history of drug addiction within last 1 year 14. Need continuous treatment with proton pump inhibitors during the study period 15. Have a history of (noninfectious) pneumonitis that required steroids or current pneumonitis, or have a history of interstitial lung disease or current interstitial lung disease 16. Have any history or presence of clinically significant cardiovascular, respiratory, hepatic, renal, hematologic, gastrointestinal, endocrine, immunologic, dermatologic, neurologic or psychiatric disease or any other condition which in the opinion of the Investigator could jeopardize the safety of the subject or the validity of the study results. Have a baseline QTcF &gt; 450ms. And for safety leadin: subjects with known long QT syndrome, family history of sudden death, torsade de pointes, symptomatic ventricular tachycardia, an unstable cardiac syndrome in the past 3 months before screening visit, &gt; class 2 NYHA heart failure, or &gt; class 2 angina pectoris.</criteria>
