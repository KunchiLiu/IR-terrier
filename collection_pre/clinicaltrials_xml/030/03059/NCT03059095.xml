	<brief_summary>The study rationale is to analyze the extent to which adult U.S. or non U.S. veterans or active duty military personnel who participate in the Yoga for Men (YfM) online Yoga and meditation classes report changes in symptoms of psychological trauma, depression, anxiety, stress, sleep quality, and pain. The serial measurement of symptom status over a 12-month period will provide information on the trajectory of change in symptom status, as well as insight into the extent to which this program may be an effective modality for veterans and service members who are experiencing symptoms of psychological trauma, depression, anxiety, stress, sleep quality, and pain. The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether the existing YfM online program is helpful to study qualifying veterans with symptoms of PTSD and related conditions.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Yoga and Mindfulness for Psychological and Physical Wellness</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Yoga is an ancient Indian science and way of life that includes the practice of specific postures, regulated breathing, and meditation. It is designed to bring balance and health to the physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual dimensions of the individual. A recent systematic review of 17 studies published between the years 2011-2013 reported that most studies of yoga demonstrated positive changes in psychological or physiological outcomes related to stress. In addition, the practice of yoga also seems to be associated with moderate improvements in cognitive function , which in turn, may be expected to positively impact overall psychological well-being. These selected results provide a strong rationale to examine the effects of yoga for a range of health conditions, in addition to across various setting and by use of different delivery methods. Much of the research on mindfulness has been in the area of anxiety and depression. Evidence suggests that mindfulness-based stress reduction, an intervention that teaches individuals to attend to the present moment in a nonjudgmental, accepting manner , can result in reduced symptoms of depression and anxiety .</detailed_description>
