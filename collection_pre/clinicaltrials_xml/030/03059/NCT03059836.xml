	<brief_summary>This study will examine the influence of n3 PUFA supplementation on the rate of muscle atrophy in women undergoing 2 weeks of unilateral limb immobilization. Assessments in skeletal muscle strength and skeletal muscle volume will also me made before, after and in recovery from immobilization.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>n3 PUFA and Muscle-disuse Atrophy in Young Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Biological aging is associated with the loss of skeletal muscle mass and strength resulting in compromised metabolic function and mobility. Throughout life, individuals will also experience periods of reduced physical activity/muscle disuse that independently lower muscle mass and strength accelerating the aging process. The losses in muscle mass with aging and disuse are underpinned by feeding-induced declines in rates of muscle protein synthesis. Thus, strategies to enhance muscle protein synthesis could have clinical implications for those who wish to maintain metabolic health and function during times of muscle disuse. Supplementation with n3 PUFA-enriched fish oil has been shown to potentiate rates of muscle protein synthesis in response to simulated feeding in both younger and older adults. Fish oil supplementation also has been efficacious in enhancing skeletal muscle strength during a period of resistance exercise training. However, no study has examined the impact of fish oil supplementation to enhance muscle protein synthesis and offset declines in muscle mass/strength during a period of immobilization.</detailed_description>
