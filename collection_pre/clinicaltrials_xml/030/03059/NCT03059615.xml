	<brief_summary>This is a Phase 2a, Open-label, one arm study in which the eligible patients will be treated with IV Nerofe, three times a week in 28 days cycles (up to 12 cycles). Evaluation will include safety procedures, blood level of study drug in certain time points, immune system response and tests checking the mechanism of the drug action.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Males and females &gt;18 years of age 2. Either: AML patients, who are not candidates for aggressive therapy and/or stem cell transplant (usually the elderly patients) , or Intermediate2 and high prognostic risk MDS patients (according to the IPSS classification), resistant or relapsing following at least 1 course of hypomethylation therapy 3. Antitumor (in this case the antiMDS or antileukemic) effect can be measured according to the IWG criteria 4. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of ≤ 2 5. Acceptable clinical laboratory values at screening 6. Pretreatment baseline measures of cytopenias are averages of at least 2 measurements (not influenced by transfusions, i.e., no RBC transfusions for at least 1 week and no platelet transfusions for at least 3 days) over at least 1 week prior to therapy 7. Negative serum β hCG test in women of childbearing potential (defined as women ≤ 50 years of age or history of amenorrhea for ≤ 12 months prior to study entry) 8. Willing and able to provide written Informed Consent and comply with the requirements of the study 9. Willing and able to provide written acceptance that during the follow up period, bone marrow examination should be performed, with cytogenetics. Bone marrow examination will be performed at initiation, following 2, 3, 6, and 12 months 1. Any chemotherapy, immunomodulatory drug therapy, antineoplastic hormonal therapy (unless dose has been stable for 3 months prior to Baseline and remains stable during the trial), immunosuppressive therapy, prednisone &gt; 20 mg/day or any equivalent corticosteroids, or erythropoietin within 14 days prior to initiation of study drug 2. Erythroid stimulating agents are allowed within the 8 weeks prior to the study initiation 3. Presence of an acute toxicity of prior chemotherapy, with the exception of alopecia or peripheral neuropathy, that has not resolved to ≤ Grade 1, as determined by NCI CTCAE v 4.0 4. Receipt of &gt;1 prior regimen of genotoxic therapy 5. Receipt of &gt;1 blood transfusion per month 6. Life expectancy &lt;12 weeks 7. Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or acquired immunodeficiency syndromerelated illness 8. Known active hepatitis B or C or other active liver disease (other than malignancy) 9. Active infection requiring systemic therapy 10. Insulinrequiring diabetes mellitus 11. History of any of the following within 12 months prior to initiation of study drug: Uncontrolled congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association Classification 3 or 4), unstable angina, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, coronary/peripheral artery bypass graft surgery, transient ischemic attack, or pulmonary embolism 12. Uncontrolled arterial hypertension, or antihypertensive drugs whose type or dose has been changed within 3 months prior to screening or whose dose is anticipated to change within cycle 1 13. Uncontrolled or decompensated cardiac dysrhythmias requiring active treatment, or persistent prolongation of the QTc (Fridericia) interval to &gt; 450 msec for males or &gt; 470 msec for females 14. Malignancies can be a reason for exclusion only if active during the last year or requiring any antitumor treatment. Skin nonmelanomatous tumors and thyroid carcinomas can be included 15. Use of any investigational agents within a minimum of 3 weeks or 5 halflives of initiation of study drug 16. Pregnant or lactating female 17. Women of childbearing potential, unless they agree to use dual contraceptive methods which, in the opinion of the Principal Investigator, are effective and adequate for that patient's circumstances while on study drug and for 3 months afterward 18. Men who partner with a woman of childbearing potential, unless they agree to use effective, dual contraceptive methods (i.e., a condom, with female partner using oral, injectable, or barrier method) while on study drug and for 3 months afterward 19. Any severe, acute, or chronic medical or psychiatric condition, or laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or study drug administration, may interfere with the informed consent process and/or with compliance with the requirements of the study, or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the investigator's opinion, would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study</criteria>
