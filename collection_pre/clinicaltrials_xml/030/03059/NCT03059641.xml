	<brief_summary>To evaluate the concordance of sensitizing mutations detected between paired plasma and tissue samples; the correlation between the clonal status of sensitizing mutations and targeted therapy response; and the prognostic impact of the relative abundance of sensitizing / resistance mutations.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Therapeutic ResistAnce and Clonal Evolution Assessed With Liquid Biopsy of NSCLC Patients in China</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In the study, 500 advanced NSCLC patients will be recruited. All the patients will receive biopsy genotype assay and circultating tumor DNA (ctDNA) liquid biopsy. Patients who carry actionable EGFR mutation, ROS1 fusion, ALK fusion or MET exon 14 skipping mutation will receive TKI treatment according to guidelines. During the TKI treatment, every patients will take liquid biopsy assay to monitor the mutation status. The study will be ended when all the patients had a progressive disease (PD) in their targeted lesion.</detailed_description>
