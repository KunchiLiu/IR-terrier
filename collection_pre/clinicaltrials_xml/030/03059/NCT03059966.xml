	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study was the evaluation of inflammatory and healing profile after root coverage using of Enamel Matrix Derivative. 16 volunteers were selected and submitted to root coverage surgery with subepithelial connective tissue graft, with and without enamel matrix derivative. The patient screening was based in the following inclusion criteria: bilateral recessions in maxillary anterior homologous teeth with aesthetical complaining ou hypersensitivity, non-smokers, healthy and no use of any medication that compromises periodontal health or healing. The split-mouth randomized model was followed in relation to test and control sites. The following clinical parameters were analyzed at baseline and 6-month post-surgery: recession height, recession width, width of keratinized tissue, probing depth, clinical attachment level, and gingival thickness. In addition to the surgical analysis, evaluations of the following inflammatory markers were performed: IL-1β, IL -1RA, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-9, IL-10, IL12, IL-13, IL-15, IL-17, EOTAXIN, FGF, GCSF, GMCSF, IFN-y, IP-10, MCP-1, MIP 1a, PDGF-bb, MIP 1b, RANTES, TNF-α e VEGF. These evaluations were performed at baseline, 7 and 14 days after surgery.</brief_summary>
