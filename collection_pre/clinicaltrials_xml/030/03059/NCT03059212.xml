	<brief_summary>Ten sessions of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation yield ability to upregulate the function of primary motor cortex and prefrontal cortex that play key roles in motor and frontal memory processing is hypothesized in this study.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Role of Primary Motor Cortex for Facilitation of Working Memory in PD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Excitatory (&gt;3Hz) rTMS could facilitate the brain cortex and neuroplasticity that benefits motor control and working memory when the coil is applied over primary motor cortex or dorsolateral prefrontal gyrus.</detailed_description>
