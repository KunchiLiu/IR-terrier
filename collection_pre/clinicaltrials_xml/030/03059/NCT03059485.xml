	<brief_summary>This research study is studying a cancer vaccine called Dendritic Cell/AML Fusion vaccine (DC/AML vaccine) as a possible treatment for Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML). The interventions involved in this study are: - Dendritic Cell/AML Fusion vaccine (DC/AML vaccine) - Durvalumab</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>DC/AML Fusion Cell Vaccine vs DC/AML Fusion Cell Vaccine Plus Durvalumab vs Observation in Patients Who Achieve a Chemotherapy-induced Remission</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works in treating a specific disease. "Investigational" means that the intervention is being studied. The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved the DC/AML vaccine as a treatment for any disease. The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved durvalumab as a treatment for AML. In this research study, the investigators are determining if the DC/AML vaccine can be used safely in subjects with acute leukemia after finishing chemotherapy, and whether the DC/AML vaccine is capable of producing immune responses against leukemia alone and in combination with Durvalumab. Cancer cells are foreign to the body and have unique markers that distinguish them from normal cells. These markers can potentially serve as targets for the immune system. An immune response is any reaction by the immune system; a complex system that is responsible for distinguishing us from everything foreign to us, and for protecting us against infections and foreign substances. The Dendritic Cell Fusion Vaccine is an investigational agent that tries to help the immune system to recognize and fight against cancer cells. Unlike a standard vaccine that is used to prevent infections, cancer vaccines are being studied to see if they can fight cancers that are already in the body. Laboratory studies have shown that when dendritic cells and tumor cells are brought together, the dendritic cells can stimulate immune responses against the tumor and, in some cases, cause the tumor to shrink. Durvalumab is a check point inhibitor which is being combined here to further amplify the immune activity of the vaccine. It is a monoclonal antibody, which is known to take the brakes off the immune system to restore immunity. In this study, the investigators will add Durvalumab in combination with the vaccine with the hope of improving immunity even further.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Step 1: Eligibility Criteria for Tumor Collection Inclusion Criteria Patients must have AML at initial diagnosis or at first relapse Patients must be ≥ 55 years old ECOG performance status ≤2 (Appendix A) Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below: total bilirubin ≤ 2.0 mg/dL AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) ≤3 × institutional upper limit of normal creatinine ≤ 2.0 mg/dl The effects of DC/AML fusion cells and Durvalumab on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason, women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document. Exclusion Criteria Active or prior documented autoimmune or inflammatory disorders including but not limited to the following: GI Disorders: (including inflammatory bowel disease [eg, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease], diverticulitis (with the exception of a prior episode that has resolved), celiac disease, or other serious gastrointestinal chronic conditions associated with diarrhea. Systemic lupus erythematosus Wegener's syndrome [granulomatosis with polyangiitis] Myasthenia gravis Graves' disease Rheumatoid arthritis Hypophysitis Uveitis The following are exceptions to this criterion: subjects with vitiligo or alopecia; subjects with hypothyroidism (eg, following Hashimoto syndrome) stable on hormone replacement; or subjects with psoriasis not requiring systemic treatment.. Because of compromised cellular immunity, patients who have a Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) or evidence of active hepatitis B virus (HBV). Patients must not have significant cardiac disease characterized by symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, clinically significant cardiac arrhythmia Patients must not be pregnant. All premenopausal patients will undergo pregnancy testing. Men will agree to not father a child while on protocol treatment. Men and women will practice effective birth control while receiving protocol treatment. Individuals with a history of a different malignancy are ineligible except for the following circumstances. Individuals with a history of other malignancies are eligible if they have been diseasefree for at least 5 years and are deemed by the investigator to be at low risk for recurrence of that malignancy. Individuals with the following cancers are eligible if diagnosed and treated within the past 5 years: noninvasive cancer (such as, any in situ cancers) and basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. Step 2: Eligibility Criteria Prior to Randomization Inclusion Criteria Patients must have obtained a complete remission with chemotherapy defined by the absence of circulating blasts, and less than 5% blasts on bone marrow examination following hematopoietic recovery Resolution of all chemotherapy related grade IIIIV toxicity as per CTC criteria 4.0 Laboratories: Absolute Neutrophil Count &gt;1,000/uL Platelets &gt; 50,000/uL Bilirubin &lt; 2.0 mg/dL Creatinine &lt;2.0 mg/dL AST/ALT &lt; 3.0 x ULN For patients with evidence of minimal residual disease prior to vaccination, assessment of minimal residual disease status by cytogenetics or FISH will be followed post vaccination. Exclusion Criteria Patients must not have serious intercurrent illness such as infection requiring IV antibiotics, or significant cardiac disease characterized by significant arrhythmia, ischemic coronary disease or congestive heart failure Patients who, with their treating physician, choose to proceed with an allogeneic transplant at the time of remission will not be eligible for randomization Active or prior documented autoimmune or inflammatory disorders including but not limited to the following: GI Disorders: (including inflammatory bowel disease [eg, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease], diverticulitis (with the exception of a prior episode that has resolved), celiac disease, or other serious gastrointestinal chronic conditions associated with diarrhea.
