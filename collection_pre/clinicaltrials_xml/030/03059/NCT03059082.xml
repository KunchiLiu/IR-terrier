	<brief_summary>Excessive alcohol consumption is common in patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Among patients who survive an ICU admission, excessive alcohol consumption is associated with a higher risk of being admitted the hospital. In this study, the Investigators will compare an intervention designed to address excessive drinking in ICU survivors to usual care. This intervention combines motivational interviewing (MI) and shared decision making (SDM). MI and SDM share several core components including the development of a therapeutic alliance and promotion of autonomy. MI can be employed in the context of motivating a patient to change their drinking. Once this decision has been made, SDM can be employed to help a patient decide amongst multiple reasonable treatment options. The Investigators long-term goal is to test whether MI-SDM is better than usual care and whether multiple sessions of MI-SDM are better than a single session. This pilot clinical trial will demonstrate the feasibility of conducting a larger efficacy study to test these hypotheses.</brief_summary>
