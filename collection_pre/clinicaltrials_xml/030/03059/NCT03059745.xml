	<brief_title>Use of Robotics for Cholecystectomy; Retrospective Review of Outcomes, Set Up and Learning Curves</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a restrospective review of charts, including operating room notes as well as operating room documentation of procedures. Currently there are numerous methods considered to be the Standard of Care in the surgical treatment of Cholecystitis, or Cholelithiasis, including Open Surgery, Laparoscopic, and Robotic Assisted Laparoscopic Surgery. This study retrospectively reviews the intraoperative and post operative clinical outcomes of Laparoscopic and Robotic Assisted Surgery at U.C. Davis Medical Center to: 1) establish the role of robotics in laparoscopic surgery, and 2) to assess the learning curve by surgeons.</detailed_description>
