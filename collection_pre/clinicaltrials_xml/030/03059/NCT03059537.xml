	<brief_summary>This study aims to validate a possible diagnostic test for bile acid diarrhoea prospectively compared to the SeHCAT scintigraphy. Fasting participants are given a standard meal and 1,250 mg chenodeoxycholic acid. The investigators measure fasting FGF19, bile acids species including 7-alpha-CHO and serial blood samples after the stimulation.</brief_summary>
