Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate characteristics of patients with gastric adenocarcinoma and factors associated with different outcome in Thailand and Japan to find a clue to improve patients' survival in low prevalence country such as Thailand. This is a retrospective cohort study. It was conducted at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Thailand and Osaka Medical Center for Cancer and Cardiovascular Disease, Japan.
