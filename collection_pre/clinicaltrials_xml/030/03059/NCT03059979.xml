	<brief_summary>This is a 12 week double-blind randomized placebo controlled trial in which 30 patients with very early SSc, fulfilling the Very Early Diagnosis Of Systemic Sclerosis (VEDOSS) criteria (9) will be randomized in a 2:1 fashion to receive intravenous methylprednisolone or placebo. Three-day treatment courses are given at week 0, week 4 and week 8. The final assessment is at week 12, and patients will be followed up to one year after baseline</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect of High Dose Methylprednisolone on Nailfold in Early Systemic Sclerosis ( SSc )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Systemic sclerosis is a disease with a high burden caused by morbidity and increased mortality. To date a cure for SSc is not available. In this trial, patients are treated very early in the disease which could change the long term outcome of SSc in these patients. In daily practice, patients so early in the disease course are not treated although they might be at risk for early escalation and internal organ involvement, reducing their prognosis. A trial to investigate the efficacy of a relative save, inexpensive and easy accessible treatment will provide us with the opportunity to change the disease course and reducing the disease burden of a portion of the SSc patients</detailed_description>
