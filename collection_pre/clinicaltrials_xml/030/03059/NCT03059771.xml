	<brief_summary>Motivation deficits are a strong determinant of poor functional outcomes in people with schizophrenia. Mobile interventions are a promising approach to improving these deficits, as they can provide frequent cues and reinforcements that support goal-directed behavior. The primary aims of this study are to conduct a pilot study using a randomized design to 1) Test the feasibility and acceptability of a personalized mobile text message intervention, Mobile Enhancement of Motivation in Schizophrenia (MEMS) and to 2) Test the preliminary effectiveness of MEMS compared to a control condition.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objectives: Motivation deficits are one of the strongest determinants of poor functional outcomes in people with schizophrenia. Mobile interventions are a promising approach to improving these deficits, as they can provide frequent cues and reinforcements that support goal-directed behavior. The objective of this study is to conduct a pilot study using a randomized design to 1) Test the feasibility and acceptability of a personalized mobile text message intervention, Mobile Enhancement of Motivation in Schizophrenia (MEMS) and to 2) Test the preliminary effectiveness of MEMS compared to a control condition. Methods: Up to forty outpatients with a schizophrenia-spectrum disorder will be recruited. All participants will set individualized recovery goals to complete over an eight-week period; those randomized to receive MEMS will also receive three sets of personalized, interactive text messages each weekday to reinforce and cue goal completion. Before and after the eight-week period, participants in both groups will complete validated measures of motivation. Both groups will also report their goal attainment after eight weeks. Results: It is anticipated that those in the MEMS group will demonstrate greater goal attainment and improvements in motivation compared to the control group. Discussion: This project will test the initial feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of a novel intervention for improving one of the most debilitating aspects of schizophrenia.</detailed_description>
