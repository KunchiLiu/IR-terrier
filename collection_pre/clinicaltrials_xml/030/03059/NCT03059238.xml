	<brief_title>Parecoxib Versus Celecoxib Versus Oxycodone in Pain Control for Transcatheter Chemoembolization Procedure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Studies reported that almost 75% of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma undergoing transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) experienced severe pain (in a three-grade mild, moderate, and severe classification), and 93% of patients required opioid treatment during the first 12 hours after TACE. Opioids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are most commonly used analgesic medications in the control of postoperative surgical pain. Previous studies has indicated that both controlled-release oxycodone, which is an oral semisynthetic opioid µ and κ agonist, and parecoxib sodium, a parenteral COX-2 selective inhibitor, were effective and safe on peri- and post-procedural pain in HCC patients undergoing TACE. To the investigators's knowledge, no studies have been developed on comparing differences of efficacy and feasibility of analgesics with different action mechanism (opioids vs. NSAIDs) and administration route (oral path vs. injective path) on pain control for patients undergone TACE. In this phase III, randomized, prospective clinical study, the investigators aimed to compare the analgesic effects of celecoxib (oral NSAIDs), parecoxib (injective NSAIDs), and controlled-release oxycodone (oral opioids) in patients with inoperable hepatic carcinoma undergoing TACE procedure in postoperative pain control.</detailed_description>
