	<brief_title>The Effect of Gliatamin (Chonline Alphoscerate) on Depressive Mood in Type 2 Diabetes Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The prevalence of depressive disorder is higher in individuals with chronic diseases, and the screening and management of depression is emphasized. Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a class of chronic disease and the incidence of DM has been increasing. According to previous study, 31.1% of patients with DM accompanied with depressive disorders which was higher than that of subjects without DM. Furthermore, DM as well as depression is known for risk factor for dementia. The choline metabolism involves in neuropathology of depressive disorders and individuals with depressive disorders showed the lower level of choline concentration. Choline alphoscerate is cholinergic precursor and showed the favorable clinical results in dementia management. As pseudodementia can be presented as depressive disorder and choline alphoscerate would be an option for these cases. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate the effect of Gliatamin (chonline alphoscerate) on depressive mood in type 2 diabetes patients and demonstrate the impact of improved depressive mood could be influence the patient's quality of life and glycemic control.</detailed_description>
