	<brief_summary>The purpose of this investigator-initiated study is to compare new bone formation through histomorphometric analysis following maxillary sinus augmentation using two different bone graft materials. A total of twenty, sinus augmentation via a lateral approach will be performed for subjects requiring sinus augmentation for implant placement and randomly divided into 2 groups. These subjects will receive one of two different bone graft materials: 1) Anorganic bovine bone matrix- InterOss (Group A), 2) Anorganic bovine bone matrix- Bio-oss (Group B). At the time of implant placement (eight months after the sinus augmentation procedure), two bone biopsies will be collected from augmented site for the histomorphometric analysis. The percentage of vital bone will be measured and analyzed statistically, also the following will be measured: percentage of non-vital bone, percentage of non-bone material (xenograft), and the percentage of connective tissue.</brief_summary>
