	<brief_summary>This pilot research study is being done to see if the drug abatacept (Orencia Â®) will be helpful in treating patients with myasthenia gravis (MG) who do not respond satisfactorily to other drugs that are used to suppress the immune system. Abatacept has been successful in treating experimental MG in laboratory animals, and this study is to determine its effectiveness in patients with MG.</brief_summary>
