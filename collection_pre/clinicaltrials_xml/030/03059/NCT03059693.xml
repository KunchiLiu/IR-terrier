	<brief_summary>Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease characterized by a disturbance of epidermal-barrier function that results in intensely pruritic subacute and chronic eczematous plaques. As the most common cause of chronic inflammatory skin diseases, AD is a major cause of morbidity and suffering, affecting upto 30% of children, and increasing in prevalence throughout the world. It is estimated that the direct cost of AD in the US alone ranged from $0.9 billion to $3.8 billion every year. The current therapy of AD is reactive, where the flares are treated through symptomatic management with topical corticosteroids and calcineurin inhibitors. Given that these medications have long-term side-effects, and given the chronically relapsing immunopathogenic nature of AD, there is an imperative need for safer anti-inflammatory medications. Haus Bioceuticals (Haus) has developed a topical treatment for eczema/atopic dermatitis (AD) denoted HAT1, and have demonstrated that HAT1 is safe and profoundly effective in the treatment of AD, controlling signs and symptoms in 85% of patients with AD. This study is aimed to further evaluate the potential of developing HAT1 as an integral part of AD therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy and Tolerability of HAT1 in Patients With Moderate to Severe Atopic Dermatitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a 17 week (119 days) randomized, double-blind, in home use study among 48 male and female subjects with moderate to severe active atopic dermatitis (AD). The study will include subjects with ages 12 - 65 years old inclusive. Group assignments will be balanced by disease severity, age, and body location of AD lesions (listed in order of importance). The study will consist of a 1 week washout period, 12 week treatment phase and a 4 week regression phase. During the treatment phase, subject will be provided one of the two test products to use twice daily on all lesions and non-lesional areas as instructed. No additional creams, lotions or soaps other than provided test products will be allowed throughout the duration of the study. Measurements, expert visual assessments and self-assessments will be taken as described below. Safety and tolerability will be evaluated by incidence of AE's (defined per CTCAE), exacerbations, application site reactions/infections, and lab evals. There will also be consumption/compliance checks and dermatological evaluations at each visit.</detailed_description>
