	<brief_summary>The trial is designed as a consecutive enrollment prospective one-center study. A minimum of 30 patients will be included in the study. At implant installation, the implant will be randomized to one of the groups (Control: conventional loading, 8 weeks; Test: early loading, 4 weeks). Samples of peri-implant crevicular fluid (PICF) and intrasulcular plaque will be collected at -14, 0 (Baseline: prosthesis delivery), 7 days and 1, 3, 6, 12 months. Prosthesis will be fabricated and delivered as usual, i.e., approximately two weeks after the impressions are taken.</brief_summary>
