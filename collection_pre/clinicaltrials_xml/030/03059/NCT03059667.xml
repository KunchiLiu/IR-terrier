	<brief_summary>Chemotherapy still constitutes the backbone of small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) therapy, particularly in the extensive disease (ED) stage (ED-SCLC). Despite the fact that a substantial complete response rate could be achieved in SCLC patients receiving etoposide - cisplatin doublet, cure remains the exception. Overall survival in patients receiving this combination is 10 months and progression free survival 6.3 months. At time of progression two options are hitherto accepted: reinduction of carboplatin - etoposide doublet or, for patients unfit for reinduction, topotecan single-drug regimen. However, in both clinical cases, median survival hardly achieves 33 weeks. Consistent data using anti - PDL1 (Programmed death-ligand 1) or anti PD1 (programmed cell death 1) antibodies suggest that they are active as single drug regimens in many malignant diseases. Taking into account the rich tumor infiltrating lymphocyte in pathological specimens of SCLC, we can hypothesize that experimental use of ATEZOLIZUMAB (MPDL3280A) in patients is ethical pending that it demonstrates activity in the second line setting.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Histologically confirmed smallcell lung cancer. 2. Extensive or limited disease according to the criteria of the Veteran's Administration Lung Cancer Group: (disease extended is defined as a disease beyond hemi thorax and supraclavicular lymph node areas. Tumor pleural effusion will be considered as extended disease). 3. Targetable tumor lesions according to RECIST 1.1. Tumor involvement encompassed into a radiotherapy field is eligible as target pending that progression is documented. 4. Tumor sample sent to IFCT for PDL1 immunohistochemistry 5. Previous platinum etoposide treatment for at least 2 cycles. 6. Demonstrated progression of the disease other than brain metastasis or carcinomatous meningitis. For the patient relapsing more than one year after the end of the previous treatment, a new histological confirmation is required before randomization. 7. Age over 18 years. 8. Weight loss ≤ 10% during the last three months. 9. Patients with brain metastases at diagnosis will be eligible pending that they have achieved brain response during the first line therapy (including brain radiotherapy is required) and remain in brain tumor response during the two months prior to randomization. 10. Performance Status 02 11. Creatinine clearance &gt; 40 mL/min. 12. Neutrophils ≥ 2,000 µL1 and platelets ≥ 100,000 µL1. 13. Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x normal. 14. Transaminases, alkaline phosphatases ≤ 2.5 x ULN except in case of liver metastases (5 x ULN). 15. Electrocardiogram without sign of progressive coronaropathy. 16. No approved or investigational anticancer therapy concurrently or in the 5 years prior to start of study drug except the first line of treatment of the SCLC, including tumor embolization, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, immunotherapy, hormone therapy, biologic therapy, or anti angiogenic therapy (e.g., inhibitors of VEGF or VEGFR (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor). 17. Signed informed consent 18. A female is eligible to enter and participate in this study if she is of: Nonchildbearing potential (i.e., physiologically incapable of becoming pregnant), including any female who has undergone: Hysterectomy. Bilateral oophorectomy (ovariectomy). Bilateral tubal ligation. Or who is postmenopausal: Patients not using hormone replacement therapy (HRT) must have experienced total cessation of menses for ≥1 year and be greater than 45 years in age, OR, in questionable cases, have a follicle stimulating hormone value &gt;40 mIU/mL and an estradiol value &lt;40 pg/mL (&lt;140 pmol/L). Subject using HRT must have experienced total cessation of menses for ≥ 1 year and be greater than 45 years of age OR have had documented evidence of menopause based on FSH (Follicle Stimulating Hormone) and estradiol concentrations prior to initiation of HRT (Hormone Replacement Therapy). Childbearing potential, including any female who has had a negative serum pregnancy test within 1 week prior to the first dose of study treatment, preferably as close to the first dose as possible, and agrees to use adequate contraception. Contraceptive methods acceptable to the IFCT, when used consistently and in accordance with both the product label and the instructions of the physician, are as follow: An intrauterine device with a documented failure rate of less than 1% per year. Male partner sterilization (vasectomy with documentation of azoospermia) prior to the female subject's entry and is the sole sexual partner for that female. Complete abstinence from sexual intercourse for 14 days before exposure to investigational product, through the dosing period, and for at least 21 days after the last dose of investigational product. Doublebarrier contraception: condom and an occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with a vaginal spermicidal agent (foam/gel/film/cream/suppository) Oral contraceptive, either combined or progestogen alone Injectable progestogen Implant of levonorgestrel Estrogenic vaginal ring Percutaneous contraceptive patches The contraceptive methods must be used during all the time of the treatment and must be maintained during 5 months after the end of the treatment in the Atezolizumab arm and 30 days for women, 90 days for men, after the end of the treatment in the chemotherapy arm. Female patients who are lactating should discontinue nursing prior to the first dose of study drug and should refrain from nursing throughout the treatment period and for 15 days following the last dose of study drug.
