	<brief_title>Intravitreal Alfibercept for Center Involved DME Previously Managed With Intravitreal Ranibizumab</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a phase 4 prospective, nonrandomized, open label, interventional clinical trial to determine the efficacy of intravitreal aflibercept (IAI) administered in a treat and extend fashion in eyes that have persistent centered involved diabetic macular edema despite at least 4 intravitreal injections of ranibizumab 0.3mg over 24 weeks prior to enrollment. Patients will receive intravitreal injections of aflibercept (2mg/0.05cc) at baseline and monthly until an eye has reached stability defined as: &lt; 10% change in the Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography (SD OCT) central retinal thickness (CRT) reading from the previous 2 visits (can include baseline) and less than a 5 letter decrease in Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) from best BCVA from prior visits. Once an eye has reached stability criteria, a treat and extend protocol will be used and treatment will be rendered on every visit. The duration between treatments will be extended by 2 weeks from the last visit if SD OCT extension criteria are met: &lt; 10% change in CRT over 2 consecutive visits and &lt; 5 letter decrease in BCVA from baseline If at any return visit subretinal and/or intraretinal fluid recurs that causes the CRT to increase by &gt; 10 % from its lowest level in the previous 2 consecutive visits, or CRT increases by &lt; 10% due to subretinal and/or intraretinal fluid but is associated with a decrease of BCVA of &gt; 5 letters from baseline then the eye will receive IAI and the treatment interval will be decreased by 1 week. If the eye has not improved or worsened for at least 2 consecutive visits and the SD OCT central subfield thickness is ≥ 300 microns or visual acuity is worse than 20/20, the following will be done: Prior to the 24-week visit, an injection will be given. At and after the 24-week visit, an injection will be given and modified grid laser can be given at the discretion of the investigator within 7 days of IAI based on rescue criteria</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age ≥18 years with type 1 or type 2 diabetes Best Corrected Visual Acuity (by ETDRS) letter score in study eye ≤ 85 and ≥24 (approximate Snellen equivalent 20/20 to 20/320) Central retinal thickness on SD OCT at baseline visit of &gt; 300 microns using Heidelberg Spectralis with definite evidence of intraretinal or subretinal fluid due to diabetic retinopathy in the CSF.
