	<brief_summary>This study is to compare the safety and efficacy of UCMSCs and BMMSCs administered intravenously in patients to evaluate cytokine suppression in patients with chronic inflammation. Cells administered via intravenous infusion (IV) and will be tested in 37 patients in two phases (Pilot and Randomized).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intravenous Infusion of Umbilical Cord Tissue (UC) Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) Versus Bone Marrow (BM) Derived MSCs to Evaluate Cytokine Suppression in Patients With Chronic Inflammation Due to Metabolic Syndrome.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this Study, cells administered via intravenous infusion (IV) will be tested in 37 patients in two phases (Pilot and Randomized): The pilot phase will consist of 12 subjects and the randomized phase will consist of 25 subjects. Subjects in each pilot phase group (Group 1, 2, 3 and 4) will not be treated less than 5 days apart and will each undergo full evaluation post infusion to demonstrate there is no evidence of treatment emergent SAE's prior to proceeding with the treatment of further subjects. For subjects randomized to Group 3, 4, C and D (BMMSCs); the cells will be derived from a sample of the subject's bone marrow (obtained by iliac crest aspiration) approximately 4-6 weeks prior to infusion. Duration of Study Participation will be 12 months (Follow-up will be at 2 weeks, 1 Month, 3, 6, and 12 months.)</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Provide written informed consent Subjects age &gt;21 and &lt;85 years at the time of signing the Informed Consent Form. Show signs of cytokine suppression Each subject must have endothelial dysfunction. At the time of enrollment, each subject must meet at least 3 out of the 5 criteria under the harmonized definition of the metabolic syndrome, consisting of the following: Hypertension Elevated triglycerides Reduced highdensity lipoprotein (HDL) levels Elevated fasting glucose Apple shaped adiposity Be a female who is pregnant, nursing, or of childbearing potential while not practicing effective contraceptive methods. Female subjects must undergo a blood or urine pregnancy test at screening and within 36 hours prior to infusion. Inability to perform any of the assessments required for endpoint analysis. Active listing (or expected future listing) for transplant of any organ. Clinically important abnormal screening laboratory values, as determined by the P.I. Serious comorbid illness or any other condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, may compromise the safety or compliance of the subject or preclude successful completion of the study. Hypersensitivity to dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Be an organ transplant recipient. Have a clinical history of malignancy within 3 years (i.e., subjects with prior malignancy must be disease free for 3 years), except curatively treated basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, melanoma in situ or cervical carcinoma, if recurrence occurs. Have a nonpulmonary condition that limits lifespan to &lt; 1 year. Have a history of drug or alcohol abuse within the past 24 months. Be serum positive for HIV, hepatitis BsAg or Viremic hepatitis C. Be currently participating (or participated within the previous 30 days) in an investigational therapeutic or device trial.</criteria>
