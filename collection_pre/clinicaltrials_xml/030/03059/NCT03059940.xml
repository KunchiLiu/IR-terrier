	<brief_summary>The goal of this clinical research study is to offer lung cancer screenings to smokers who want to change their smoking behaviors. All eligible participants will receive counseling and be offered at least one form of smoking cessation drug. The different forms of counseling and treatment will be compared.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Smoking Cessation Intervention During Low Dose CT (LDCT) Screening for Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Groups: If participant is found to be eligible to take part in this study, participant will have a CT scan of participant's chest to look for signs of lung cancer. Participant will receive the results 1-4 days after the scan. If there are any abnormal areas, participant will be referred to participant's regular doctor for follow-up. No matter what the results are, participant will be advised to quit smoking. Participant will have a decision-making conversation with the CT scan provider. Participant will discuss the risks and benefits of smoking cessation, as well as what participant expects out of such treatment. Participant will watch a short (about 9 minutes) video about lung cancer, CT scans, and smoking cessation. This conversation will last about 15 minutes. Participant will then receive a referral for intervention and counseling to quit smoking. Participant will be prescribed an anti-smoking drug. This may be either nicotine replacement therapy (such as a patch, gum, or lozenge) or an oral drug (such as varenicline or buproprion). The study doctor will tell participant when and how much of participant's anti-smoking drug participant should take each time. Participant will also then have about 5 smoking cessation counseling sessions over the next 12 weeks. Each session will last about 30 minutes, in which participant will set a quit date, prepare for participant's quit date, and discuss coping skills for dealing with smoking "triggers" after participant's quit date. Participant will also discuss challenges participant may have with quitting. Study Visits: Participant will have 3 additional study visits, at 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and 6 months after the CT scan. At all study visits: - Participant will complete questionnaires about several topics, including depression, suicide, and participant's smoking behavior. These questionnaires should take about 30-45 minutes in total to complete. - Urine and/or saliva will be collected for a routine test to check participant's cotinine, nicotine, and/or anabasine levels. Cotinine is a chemical released in participant's body when it breaks down nicotine and will show whether and how much participant has recently smoked. Anabasine is a chemical that shows if nicotine is found in the blood due to a nicotine replacement therapy or from tobacco use. - Participant's CO level will be measured. This is an investigational study. All smoking cessation drugs being used in this study are FDA approved and commercially available. It is investigational to compare them. The study doctor can describe how they are designed to work. Up to 1260 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>
