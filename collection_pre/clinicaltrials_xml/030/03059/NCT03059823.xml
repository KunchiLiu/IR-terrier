	<brief_summary>The primary goal of this Phase 1 study is to characterize the safety and tolerability of MGA012 and establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of MGA012 administered on either every two week or every four schedules of administration among patients with solid tumors. Pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and the anti-tumor activity of MGA012 will also be assessed.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase 1 Study of MGA012 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label, multi-center, Phase 1 dose-escalation and dose expansion study to define a MTD, describe preliminary safety, and to assess PK, immunogenicity, and potential anti-tumor activity of MGA012 administered on either every two week or every four week schedules in patients with relapsed/ refractory or unresectable locally/ advanced or metastatic solid tumors. In the initial phase of the study, two dose schedules will be assessed in dose escalation, once every two weeks and once every four weeks administration of single agent MGA012. Following the establishment of an MTD, additional patients will enroll in dose expansion cohorts of specific tumor types.</detailed_description>

For Cohort Expansion, patients who have previously received an immune checkpoint inhibitor (e.g., antiPDL1, antiPD1, antiCTLA4) are not eligible for this study. Patients with any history of known or suspected autoimmune disease with the specific exceptions of vitiligo, resolved childhood atopic dermatitis, psoriasis not requiring systemic treatment (within the past 2 years), and patients with a history of Grave's disease that are now euthyroid clinically and by laboratory testing. Treatment with any systemic antineoplastic therapy, or investigational therapy within the 4 weeks prior to the initiation of study drug administration. Treatment with radiation therapy within 2 weeks prior to the initiation of study drug administration. Clinically significant cardiovascular disease Clinically significant pulmonary compromise, including a requirement for supplemental oxygen use to maintain adequate oxygenation. Presence of active pneumonitis or history of noninfectious pneumonitis. Clinically significant gastrointestinal disorders Evidence of active viral, bacterial, or systemic fungal infection requiring parenteral treatment within 7 days prior to the initiation of study drug. Patients requiring any systemic antiviral, antifungal, or antibacterial therapy for active infection must have completed treatment no less than one week prior to the initiation of study drug Known history of positive testing for human immunodeficiency virus or history of acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Known history of hepatitis B or hepatitis C infection or known positive test for hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis B core antigen, or hepatitis C polymerase chain reaction (PCR) Vaccination with any live virus vaccine within 4 weeks prior to the initiation of study drug administration.
