	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the relative bioavailability of single-dose Simeprevir (SMV), Odalasvir (ODV), and AL-335 when administered as an fixed-dose combination (FDC) compared with the single agents when administered together, and to assess the effect of multiple-dose lansoprazole and omeprazole on the single-dose pharmacokinetics (PK) of SMV, ODV, and AL-335 when administered as an FDC.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Participant must have a body mass index (BMI: weight in kg divided by the square of height in meters) of 18.0 to 32.0 kilogram per meter (kg/m^2), extremes included, and a body weight not less than 50.0 kg Participant must have a blood pressure (supine after at least 5 minutes rest) between 90 and 140 millimeter of mercury (mmHg) systolic, inclusive, and no higher than 90 mmHg diastolic. If blood pressure is out of range, up to 2 repeated assessments are permitted. Participants with a normal value at retest may be included Participant must have a normal 12lead Electrocardiogram [ECG] (based on the mean value of triplicate ECG parameters) consistent with normal cardiac conduction and function at screening, including:a) normal sinus rhythm (heart rate (HR) between 60 and 90 beats per minute [bpm], extremes included); b) QT interval corrected for heart rate according to Fridericia's formula (QTcF) less than or equal to &lt;=450 milliseconds (ms) for male participants and &lt;=470 ms for female participants; c) QRS interval &lt;=110 ms; d) PR interval &lt;=200 ms; e) Electrocardiogram (ECG) morphology consistent with healthy cardiac conduction and function. Any evidence of heart block is exclusionary. Any evidence of left or right bundle branch block is exclusionary Female participant, except if postmenopausal, must have a negative serum (betahuman chorionic gonadotropin) pregnancy test at screening Female participant must have a negative highly sensitive urine or serum pregnancy test at Day 1 Participant with a past history of: a) Heart arrhythmias (example, extrasystolic rhythms or tachycardia at rest). Isolated extrasystolic beats are not exclusionary; b) Risk factors associated with Torsade de Pointes such as hypokalemia; c) Family history of short/long QT syndrome; d) Sudden unexplained death (including sudden infant death syndrome) in a first degree relative (that is, sibling, offspring, or biological parent) Participant has known allergies, hypersensitivity, or intolerance to odalasvir (ODV), AL335, simeprevir (SMV), lansoprazole, or omeprazole, or their excipients Participant has a history of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or hepatitis C antibody (antiHCV) positive, or other clinically active liver disease, or tests positive for HBsAg or antiHCV at screening Participant has a history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV1) or 2 infection positive, or tests positive for HIV1 or 2 at screening Participant has previously been dosed with SMV, ODV, or AL335 in more than 3 singledose studies or in a multiple dose study with SMV, ODV, or AL335</criteria>
