	<brief_summary>This trial is conducted globally. The aim of the trial is to investigate the efficacy and safety of oral semaglutide versus placebo in subjects with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus treated with insulin. All subjects should continue their pre-trial insulin therapy (basal, basal-bolus or premixed regimen including combinations of soluble insulins) throughout the trial. Subjects treated with metformin in addition to insulin treatment must continue their metformin treatment throughout the entire trial.</brief_summary>
