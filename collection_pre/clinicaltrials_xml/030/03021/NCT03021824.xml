	<brief_title>Severe ARDS: Generating Evidence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately one-quarter of ARDS patients develop severe hypoxemia, which has been associated with mortality rates approximating 40-50%. The majority have been described to present with severe disease at baseline, suggesting an opportunity for early intervention. In addition, use of evidence-based practices in severe ARDS is highly variable and inconsistent; use of unproven treatment modalities is also frequently seen. Given the variability in treatment practices in severe ARDS, an understanding of the patient-level and institutional-level factors contributing to differences in therapeutic approach is needed in order to improve the quality and consistency of care given to these high-risk patients. SAGE is a multicenter, observational cohort study examining the patient-level and institutional characteristics associated with variability in management of patients with moderate to severe ARDS, factors associated with survival or need for adjuvant therapy, and variability in ventilator management of patients on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Findings from this observational study can subsequently be used to inform future interventional trial development.</detailed_description>
