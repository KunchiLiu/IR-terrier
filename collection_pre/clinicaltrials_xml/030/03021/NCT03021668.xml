	<brief_summary>Although outcomes of pancreaticoduodenectomy have improved, it remains a procedure with a high perioperative complication rate. Surgical site infection is one of the most common complications after pancreaticoduodenectomy. In a retrospective review of all patients who underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy at Johns Hopkins between 9/2011 and 8/2014, a total of 679 patients, 30-day surgical site infection was observed in 16.7%. By univariate analysis, perioperative blood transfusion, operative time greater than 7 hours, preoperative chemotherapy and/or radiation, bile stent, absence of a superficial wound vacuum closure device, and vascular resection were associated with surgical site infection (all, p&lt;0.05). On multivariable analysis, pre-operative bile stent/drain and neoadjuvant chemotherapy were independent predictors of surgical site infection (all, p&lt;0.001). Studies in colorectal patients have found an estimated cost of up to $1400 per patient secondary to prolonged hospitalization, wound care, and wound complications in patients with procedures complicated by a surgical site infection. Furthermore, in another study of 1144 patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy between 1995 and 2011 at Johns Hopkins Hospital, post-operative complications delayed time to adjuvant therapy, decreased median survival. The hypothesis of the investigator(s) is that placement of Prevena Peel &amp; Place Dressing using the standard Acelity vacuum dressing after suture on patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy at highest risk of infection will result in a significant decrease in surgical site infection rate. The investigator(s) plan to perform a randomized control trial where the patients who have had pre-operative bile stent/drain placement and/or neoadjuvant chemotherapy will undergo closure with Prevena Peel &amp; Place Dressing using the standard Acelity vacuum dressing after suture versus standard closure. The investigator(s) will then follow the participant(s) for 30 days postoperatively to determine surgical site infection and other perioperative complication rate.</brief_summary>
