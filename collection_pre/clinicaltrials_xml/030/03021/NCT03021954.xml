	<brief_summary>This study aims to see if platelet rich plasma (PRP) have beneficial effect on the repair of pelvic floor muscle damage in primipara. Therefore, this double blinded randomized clinical trial compares the pelvic floor muscle repair in primipara following labor between the interventional group who received intramuscular PRP injection in levator ani muscle and the control group, as assessed by ultrasonography, perineometry, and biomarker assessments.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study aims to see if platelet rich plasma (PRP) has beneficial effect on the repair of pelvic floor muscle damage in primipara. Therefore, this double blinded randomized clinical trial compares the pelvic floor muscle repair in primipara following labor between the interventional group who received intramuscular PRP injection in levator ani muscle and the control group, as assessed by ultrasonography, perineometry, and biomarker assessments. The ultrasonography outcome measures include lower hiatal area during contraction and during valsava. Menawhile, the biomarker assessments include Creatine Kinae, MyoD, and IGF-1. The assessments are performed at multiple time points, which are before labor, 24-48 hours post labor, 7 days post labor, 40 days post labor and 3 months post labor.</detailed_description>
