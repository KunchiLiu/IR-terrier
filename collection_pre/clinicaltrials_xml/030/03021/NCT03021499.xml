	<brief_title>Aurinia Renal Response in Active Lupus With Orelvo (Voclosporin)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of the current study is to investigate whether Orelvo, added to the standard of care treatment in active lupus nephritis (LN), is able to reduce disease activity over a treatment period of 24 weeks. The background therapy will be MMF and initial treatment with IV methylprednisolone, followed by a reducing course of oral corticosteroids. Subjects with active, flaring LN will be eligible to enter the study. They are required to have a diagnosis of LN according to established diagnostic criteria and clinical and biopsy features suggestive of active nephritis. Efficacy will be assessed by the ability of the drug combination to reduce the level of proteinuria (as measured by urine protein/creatinine ratio (UPCR) while demonstrating an acceptable safety profile.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Key Subjects with evidence of active nephritis, defined as follows: Kidney biopsy result within 2 years prior to screening indicating Class III, IVS or IVG (alone or in combination with Class V) LN with a doubling or greater increase of UPCR within the last 6 months to a minimum of ≥1.5 mg/mg at screening. OR Kidney biopsy result within 6 months prior to screening indicating Class III, IVS or IVG (alone or in combination with Class V) LN with a UPCR of ≥1.5 mg/mg at screening. OR Kidney biopsy result within 6 months prior to screening indicating Class V LN and a UPCR of ≥2 mg/mg at screening. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test at screening and a negative urine pregnancy test at baseline. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of ≤45 mL/minute at screening. Current or medical history of: Congenital or acquired immunodeficiency. In the opinion of the Investigator, clinically significant drug or alcohol abuse within 2 years prior to screening. Malignancy within 5 years of screening, with the exception of basal and squamous cell carcinomas treated by complete excision. Lymphoproliferative disease or previous total lymphoid irradiation. Severe viral infection or known HIV infection. Active tuberculosis (TB), or known history of TB/evidence of old TB if not taking prophylaxis with isoniazid. Other known clinically significant active medical conditions, such as: Severe cardiovascular disease, liver dysfunction or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma requiring oral steroids or any other overlapping autoimmune condition for which the condition or the treatment of the condition may affect the study assessments or outcomes.</criteria>
