	<brief_title>A Study of Multiple Intravitreal Injection TK001 in Patients With Neovascular Age-related Macular Degeneration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multicenter, open-label study to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity, and preliminary efficacy of multiple intravitreal injection TK001 in patients with AMD. It consists of core study (12 weeks) and extension study (40 weeks). In the core study, patients will receive their assigned dose in a 50-μL solution administered as an intravitreal injection every 4 weeks. In the extension study, they will be evaluated every 4 weeks and administrated PRN (pro re nata) with their assigned dose. The safety, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity, and preliminary efficacy of TK001 will be evaluated in the core study, and will also be assessed in the extension study except pharmacokinetics.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Signed written informed consent Aged 45 80 years, male or female Diagnosed with neovascular AMD and with active lesions Best corrected VA for the studied eye≤20/40 With stable blood pressure, SBP＜140 mmHg and DBP＜90 mmHg Limitation of eye diseases With vitreous hemorrhage in studied eyes within two months preceding screening With geographic atrophy, epiretinal membrane or intensive subfoveal hard exudates which involved the foveal in studied eyes With opacity of refractive media(e.g. apparent cataract) or contraction of pupils which significantly interfered the visual test or assessment of anterior segment and fundus in studied eyes With pseudoexfoliation syndrome, intraocular hemorrhage resulting in decreased vision, rhegmatogenous retinal detachment, macular hole or choroidal neovascularization (CNV) for any reason except for AMD (such as fundus angioid streaks, ocular histoplasmosis, pathologic myopia, trauma) in studied eyes With apparent afferent pupillary defect(APD) in studied eyes With Polypoidal Choroidal Vasculopathy (PCV) or Retinal Angiomatous Proliferation (PAP) in studied eyes With intraocular pressure higher than 25mmHg despite treatment With VA for the fellow eyes&lt;20/200 With active inflammation in any eye, such as conjunctivitis, keratitis, scleritis, blepharitis, endophthalmitis and uveitis The treatment of the eye The studied eye received topical or grid photocoagulation more than twice or within 3 months preceding screening The studied eye received the following intraocular surgery or laser treatment in macular (such as macular translocation surgery, glaucoma filtering surgery, transpupillary thermotherapy, macular photocoagulation, vitreous cutting surgery, optic nerve dissection, optic nerve sheath membrane dissection). But patients who received verteporfin photodynamic therapy, cataract surgery or YAG posterior capsular dissection more than 3 months before screening will not be excluded. Any eye received antiangiogenic drugs within 2 months preceding screening or patients received systemic antiangiogenic drugs within 3 months preceding screening (such as pegaptanib, aflibercept, ranibizumab, bevacizumab or conbercept) Any eye received intraocular injection of corticosteroid drugs (such as triamcinolone acetonide) within 3 months preceding screening, or periocular injection of corticosteroid drugs within 1 month before screening Systemic diseases, treatment and other conditions With a history of allergy to sodium fluorescein and indocyanine green PLT≤100×109/L, BUN or Cr＞1.5×ULN(Upper Limit of Normal), TT(thrombin time) or PT(prothrombin time) ＞1.0×ULN(Upper Limit of Normal), take antiplatelet aggregation drugs or anticoagulants within 1 month before screening With surgery within 1 month before screening, or with unhealed wound, ulcer, fracture at present Diabetic patients without the control of glucose or accompanied by diabetic retinopathy With a history of myocardial infarction within 6 months before screening With activity disseminated intravascular coagulation and a tendency of significant bleeding before screening Systemic autoimmune disease Any uncontrolled diseases (such as severe systemic diseases of mental, neurological, cardiovascular, respiratory and malignancies) Pregnant and lactating women or patients who cannot take contraceptive measures Poor compliance Patients who participated other clinical trials within 30 days before screening or was taking other clinical trials at present Patients who is considered unsuitable for enrollment by investigator</criteria>
