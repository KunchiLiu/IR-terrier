	<brief_summary>This is a prospective, non-blinded, non-randomized, non-interventional study of the Oxygen Reserve Index (ORI) in a clinical setting. It is designed to evaluate the potential clinical utility of the ORI as an early warning of impending arterial oxygen desaturation and collect additional data characterizing the correlations with arterial blood oxygen content.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>ORI is designed to supplement standard arterial hemoglobin saturation monitoring by giving advanced warning of impending arterial hemoglobin desaturation through the use of pulse CO-oximeter devices and its sensors.</detailed_description>
