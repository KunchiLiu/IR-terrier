	<brief_summary>Vitamin D deficiency is known to be significantly associated with high myopia. This study investigated the vitamin D status in patients with high myopia and primary open-angle glaucoma, in order to understand the relationship between high myopia and the development of primary open-angle glaucoma.110 primary open-angle glaucoma patients, 110 high myopia patients and 110 age-matched people in the Han population were enrolled. Serum levels of 1a, 25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 were measured by an enzyme-linked immuno-absorbent assay.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>primary openangle glaucoma (1) intraocular pressure above 21 mmHg or more in each eye without therapy; (2) wide anterior chamber angle; (3)glaucomatous optic neuropathy (Glaucomatous optic nerve damage was defined as cuptodisc ratio higher than 0.7 or focal loss of the nerve fiber layer (notch) associated with a consistent glaucomatous visual field defect in at least one eye;(4) visual field loss consistent with optic nerve damage and visual fields were performed by using standard automated perimetry in at least one eye. c(with refractive error &gt;6D) were recruited. the presence of any secondary glaucoma with an exfoliation syndrome or a history of ocular trauma, high myopia, macular degeneration, other ocular diseases, and also a known history of systemic diseases and administration of vitamin D3 or other analog. High myopia patients with ocular disease such as glaucoma, a history of administration of vitamin D3 or other analog or a history of retinopathy or connective tissue disorders associated with myopia, such as Stickler or Marfan syndromes, were not included.</criteria>
