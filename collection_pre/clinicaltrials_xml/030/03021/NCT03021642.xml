	<brief_summary>This is a Phase I, open label, randomized, crossover trial to investigate the relative bioavailability of tepotinib in healthy volunteers. Twenty-four volunteers will be randomized to one of the two treatment sequences: Sequence A: test, reference, Sequence B: reference, test. The reference treatment refers to the current Phase II film-coated tablet (5 * 100 milligram (mg) tepotinib film-coated tablets) and the test treatment to the new Phase III film-coated tablet (1 * 500 mg film-coated tepotinib tablet).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Healthy male and nonfertile, healthy female volunteers, 18 to 60 years of age (both inclusive) at the time of informed consent. Written informed consent given before any trial related activities are performed. Body weight greater than 50 kg and a body mass index (BMI) above 18 kilogram per meter square (kg/m^2) and below 30 kg/m^2 (BMI = weight [kg]/height [m^2]) at screening. Has vital signs in the following normal range: Oral body temperature: 35.5 to 37.5 degree celsius (°C) Blood pressure (BP) and pulse rate after at least 5 minutes of rest, measured in the supine position: Systolic blood pressure: 90 to 150 millimeter of mercury (mm Hg); Diastolic blood pressure: 40 to 90 mm Hg Pulse rate: 35 to 110 beats per minute (bpm) Nonsmoker (= 0 cigarettes, pipes, cigars, ecigarettes, or others) for at least 6 months prior to screening Women must be postmenopausal for at least 2 years, as confirmed by luteinizing hormone (LH) and folliclestimulating hormone (FSH) assessments performed at screening, or surgically sterile (that is, hysterectomy, oophorectomy). Pregnancy assessments will also be performed on female volunteers at screening and at admission. Males must agree to use and to have their female partners use highly effective medically acceptable methods of contraception during the period of participation in the trial and for at least 3 months after the last treatment administration. Men must refrain from donating sperm up to 3 months after the last treatment administration. Ability to understand the full nature and purpose of the trial, including possible risks and adverse effects; ability to cooperate with the Investigator and to comply with the requirements of the entire trial, including dietary restrictions. Any condition, including findings in the medical history, physical examination or in pretrial assessments that in the opinion of the Investigator, constitutes a risk or a contraindication for the participation of the volunteer in the trial or that could interfere with the trial objectives, conduct or evaluation. Any clinically relevant abnormality in the results of the screening safety laboratory parameters. Specifically Alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total bilirubin, Alkaline phosphatase (ALP), amylase, and lipase must not exceed the upper limit of the normal range. Any clinically relevant abnormality on the 12lead electrocardiogram recording. Positive result from virology tests for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis C virus antibody (antiHCV), or human immunodeficiency virus antibody (antiHIV 1 and 2) at screening. History of clinically relevant renal, cardiovascular, and pulmonary disease, or endocrinology disorder. History of clinically relevant gastrointestinal disease, in particular pancreatic disease, cholecystitis, liver diseases or hepatic dysfunction. History of psychiatric or neurological disorders (depression, epilepsy etc.). Known hypersensitivity to tepotinib or its excipients. Presence or history of any serious allergy (requiring hospitalization or prolonged systemic treatment). Presence of drug or alcohol abuse, confirmed by positive test results for drugs of abuse or alcohol or history of drug and alcohol abuse in the past 3 years. Volunteers who consume more than 14 (female volunteers) or 21 (male volunteers) units of alcohol a week (unit = 1 glass of wine (125 milliliter [mL]) = 1 measure of spirits = ½ pint of beer). Loss or donation of more than 400 mL of blood within 12 weeks prior to entry into the trial. Participation in another clinical trial within the past 60 days. Any prescription or over the counter medication intake within 2 weeks prior to the first administration of tepotinib, including multivitamins and herbal products (St. John's wort), with the exception of acetaminophen and ibuprofen. Consumption of enzyme inducing or inhibiting herbal drugs, fruit juices and beverages (eg, grapefruit, grapefruit juice, Seville orange, quinine [tonic water], star fruit), and consumption of poppy seed within 3 days prior to the first administration of the investigational medicinal product. Excessive consumption of beverages containing xanthine (more than (&gt;) 5 cups of coffee a day or equivalent) or inability to stop caffeine consumption while resident in the trial site. Continued use of caffeine (less than or equal to (=&lt;)3 cups/day) or caffeine containing drinks or food, eg, coffee, tea, chocolate, Red Bull, or cola (1 caffeine unit is contained in the following items: 1 [6 ounces (oz)] cup of coffee, 2 [12 oz] cans of cola, 1 [12 oz] cup of tea, ½ [4 oz] cup of energy drink [eg, Red Bull], or 3 oz of chocolate). Legal incapacity or limited legal capacity. Unlikely to comply with the protocol requirements, instructions and trial related restrictions; eg, uncooperative attitude, inability to return for followup visits, and improbability of completing the trial. Volunteer is the Investigator or SubInvestigator, research assistant, pharmacist, trial coordinator, other staff or relative thereof directly involved in the conduct of the trial.
