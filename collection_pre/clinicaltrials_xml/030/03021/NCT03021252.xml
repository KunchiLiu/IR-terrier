	<brief_summary>Clinical randomized clinical trial to assess the effectiveness of incorporating inspiratory and expiratory muscle training (IEMT) in the rehabilitation of stroke patients with dysphagia in terms of functional outcomes, comorbidities, survival and quality of life. This project also incorporates a longitudinal study to assess the clinical impact of dysphagia on body composition and nutritional status in stroke patients.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Stroke is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Stroke can lead to varying degrees of oropharyngeal dysphagia (25-85% of patients) and respiratory muscle dysfunction associated with an increase in medical complications such as bronchoaspiration, malnutrition and death. Dysphagia is present in a significant proportion of patients admitted to Rehabilitation (up to 85% depending on series) in stroke. Standard swallow therapy consists of educational intervention aimed to improve self-management of dysphagia and protect the airway, oral exercises to improve lingual praxis, and compensatory techniques based on videofluoroscopic findings. Recent studies suggest that IEMT can improve swallowing efficacy and reduce eventual bronchoaspirative events. Nutritional status appears in 9-67% of patients with acute and subacute stroke and has an impact on functional outcomes and provides information about the risk of hospitalization and death. Stroke patients are at risk of developing malnutrition because of neurologic impairments related to feeding (chewing, deglutition and self-feeding) that can result in a poor food intake. To date, there is only few studies on prevalence and influence of malnutrition in stroke.</detailed_description>
