	<brief_summary>L-carnitine is synthesized from lysine and methionine. Postmortem concentrations of carnitine in liver, muscle, heart, kidney, and brain averaged only one-fourth to one-third those in corresponding tissues of eight normally nourished non-hepatic patients who died after an acute illness of a 1-3-day duration. In the recent years, it has been reported that sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) is protective against acute kidney injury (AKI) and suggest that enhancing SIRT3 to improve mitochondrial dynamics has potential as a strategy for improving outcomes of renal injury. In the current study, it is the first clinical interventional research whether L-carnitine corrects ammonia metabolism associated with liver injury in hepatectomized patients.</brief_summary>
