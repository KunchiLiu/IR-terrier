	<brief_title>A Pilot Randomized Control Trial to Help Youth Smokers to Quit Smoking:</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Depression and stress are obstacles of youth smokers to quit smoking, youth smokers who have positive thinking and less depression exhibited smoking abstinence at last. Adventure-based training could enhance participants' self-efficacy, self-esteem and also improve mental health of children and youth by doing physical activity. On the other hand, previous mobile phone-based studies (e.g. short messaging services or Apps) showed that the mental health of youth had been improved by providing instant response to the subjects when they felt depressed. A paper published recently proved that WhatsApp group could prevent relapse among the quitters. Thus, adventure-based training and social support in WhatsApp group would predict to reduce depression and stress so as to quit smoking in youth.</detailed_description>
