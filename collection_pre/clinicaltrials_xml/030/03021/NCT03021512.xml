	<brief_summary>Patients who underwent bilateral bifocal or trifocal lenses implantation for presbyopia correction with monofocal intraocular lenses implantation are supposed to have sufficient uncorrected vision capacity for activities of daily living (ADLs) that require: a) distant vision (DV), (ie. driving), b) intermediate vision (IV), (ie. computer word processing), c) near vision (NV), (ie. book reading). Primary objective of the study is the comparison in a series of ADLs of two cohorts of patients (group 1: subjects with bilateral bifocal lenses implantation, group 2: subjects with bilateral trifocal lenses implantation)</brief_summary>
