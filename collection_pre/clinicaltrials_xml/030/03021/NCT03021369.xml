	<brief_summary>The digital pleural drainage system Topaz+ by Medela is compared to the analogue system Atrium OCEAN by Maquet in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. The study is prospectively randomized with an all-comer setup. The patients are randomly selected for one of the systems. The surgery is performed in the standard fashion and chest tubes are placed routinely by the surgeon depending on the type of surgery. A retrosternal 32 French drain is placed in every patient and pericardial and/or pleural drains are optional. The postoperative course does not vary from the clinical standard and the chest tubes are removed according to institutional standard. The clinical data about fluid amount, time of removal, air leaks, tamponade are routinely collected in a digital patient documentation system.</brief_summary>
