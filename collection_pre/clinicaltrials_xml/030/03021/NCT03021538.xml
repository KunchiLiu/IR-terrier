	<brief_summary>This study seeks to determine if ECMO compared to cardiopulmonary bypass during lung transplantation has a beneficial effect on short-term outcomes after lung transplantation. We hypothesize that ECMO will have decreased transfusion requirements, intubation time, lesser primary graft dysfunction with no increase in major adverse events.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>1. The study population will be all patients requiring cardiopulmonary support while undergoing lung transplantation at our institution. 1. Patients undergoing concomitant cardiac operations with indication for obligate use of cardiopulmonary bypass 2. Patient with specific anatomy that require full cardiac decompression such as severe pulmonary hypertension or large heart that are shifted severely into the left chest 3. Patients with high likelihood of significant pleural bleeding that will require returning the blood back into the cardiotomy reservoir 4. Patients bridged to transplant with ECMO 5. Cystic fibrosis/bronchiectasis/resistant infection patients where surgeon will need to remove both lungs prior to implantation 6. Patients who the surgeon feels would be better served with CPB rather than ECMO These patients will be entered into a registry and followed.</criteria>
