	<brief_title>Trial of Nivolumab as a Novel Neoadjuvant Pre-Surgical Therapy for Locally Advanced Oral Cavity Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OCC patients who are scheduled for surgery will be given Nivolumab prior to surgery to see if there are any changes in surgical outcomes.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Newly diagnosed histologically proven locoregional OCSCC (T stage 24) without evidence of distant metastases. OCSCC includes the subsites of oral tongue, floor of mouth, gingiva, retromolar trigone, and buccal mucosa. Recurrent or persistent histologically proven locoregional OCSCC (recurrent Tstage 24) that was initially treated with surgery alone. To allow sufficient tumor tissue for the immunological analyses, patients with T1 OCSCC will be excluded. Eligibility criteria will also include the following: Greater than or equal to 18 years of age ECOG performance status of 0 or 1 Must meet screening lab criteria outlined in the protocol Women of child bearing potential (WOCBP) must use appropriate method(s) of contraception. WOCBP should use an adequate method to avoid pregnancy for 23 weeks (30 days plus the time required for nivolumab to undergo five halflives) after the last dose of investigational drug. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of HCG) within 24 hours prior to the start of nivolumab. Men who are sexually active with WOCBP must use any contraceptive method with a failure rate of less than 1% per year. Men receiving nivolumab and who are sexually active with WOCBP will be instructed to adhere to contraception for a period of 31 weeks after the last dose of investigational product. Women who are not of childbearing potential (ie, who are postmenopausal or surgically sterile and azoospermic men do not require contraception. Prior immunotherapy or treatment with another anti PD 1 agent. Prior chemotherapy including Cetuximab or radiation therapy. Previous severe hypersensitivity reaction to another monoclonal antibody Women who are pregnant, lactating or expecting to conceive or father children within the research period Known history of HIV or AIDS Positive test for HBV sAg or HCV antibody indicating acute or chronic infection Concomitant malignancies except cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma or basal cell carcinoma Unresectable primary tumor or regional disease or distant metastases. Active, known or suspected autoimmune disease. Note: Subjects are permitted to enroll if they have vitiligo, type I diabetes mellitus, residual hypothyroidism due to autoimmune condition only requiring hormone replacement, psoriasis not requiring systemic treatment, or conditions not expected to recur in the absence of an external trigger Presence of condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (&gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents) or other immunosuppressive medications within 14 days of study drug administration. Inhaled or topical steroids and adrenal replacement doses &gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents are permitted in the absence of active autoimmune disease.</criteria>
