	<brief_summary>This phase II trial studies how well pembrolizumab and ibrutinib work in treating patients with stage III-IV melanoma that cannot be removed by surgery. Monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Ibrutinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving pembrolizumab and ibrutinib may work better in treating patients with melanoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pembrolizumab and Ibrutinib in Treating Patients With Stage III-IV Melanoma That Cannot Be Removed by Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the overall response rate (ORR) in patients with advanced melanoma receiving ibrutinib and pembrolizumab. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the safety and adverse-event profiles of combination of ibrutinib with pembrolizumab in patients with advanced melanoma. II. To evaluate the progression-free-survival (PFS) in patients advanced melanoma receiving ibrutinib and pembrolizumab. III. To evaluate the duration of response, overall survival (OS) in patients with advanced melanoma receiving ibrutinib and pembrolizumab. IV. To assess the effect of treatment with ibrutinib and pembrolizumab on Th1/Th2 immune polarity. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the CD8 T cell response to multiple melanoma-associated antigens, and to correlate CD8 T cell responses with changes in Th1/Th2 immune polarity. II. To assess changes in plasma cytokines induced by treatment with ibrutinib and pembrolizumab. III. To assess the change in potential biomarkers, such as tumor-bound and soluble PD-L1 levels and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, that may correlate with treatment responses. OUTLINE: Patients receive ibrutinib orally (PO) daily on days 1-28 of course 1 and days 1-21 of course 2 and subsequent courses. Patients also receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 8 of course 1 and day 1 of course 2 and subsequent courses. Course 1 continues for 28 days and subsequent courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for 5 years.</detailed_description>
