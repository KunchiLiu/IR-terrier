	<detailed_description>This is a feasibility pilot study to help obtain external funding for a larger study to assess the effects of exercise on chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN), which is a dose-limiting and painful side effect of chemotherapy for which there are no established treatments. The investigators will conduct a two-arm randomized clinical trial in 40 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy where Arm 1 is 12 weeks of exercise during chemotherapy and Arm 2 is 12 weeks of nutrition education (control condition) during chemotherapy. The investigators will acquire data on CIPN via patient reports and clinical assessments as well as general pain and hypothetical mechanistic factors that may help explain how exercise may treat CIPN; these factors include measures of musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, neuropsychological, and immunological function. The primary outcomes are related to the feasibility of identifying, recruiting, and obtaining complete data from research participants.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Have nonmetastatic cancer Be chemotherapy na√Øve Be scheduled to receive CIPNinducing chemotherapy during the study (platinums, vinca alkaloids, taxanes, thalidomide, or bortezomib) for the duration of the intervention (12 weeks) Report symptoms of peripheral neuropathy at baseline (subjectreported severity of numbness and tingling in hands/feet of at least 1 on a 010 scale) Be able to perform the exercise intervention Be able to read English Be at least 18 years old (no upper limit on age) Be consistently righthanded in daily activities for consistency in reporting any lateralized effects from brain imaging Provide written informed consent Receive surgery, radiation, or hormone therapy for their cancer during the study Be in the active or maintenance stage of exercise behavior (i.e., subjects must be sedentary) Have contraindications for MRI scanning (pacemaker, metal implants, pregnancy, etc. note that most portacaths are safe for MRI scanning) Have physical limitations (e.g., cardiorespiratory, orthopedic, central nervous system) that contraindicate participation in maximal physiological fitness testing and a low/moderate intensity homebased walking and progressive resistance exercise program.</criteria>
