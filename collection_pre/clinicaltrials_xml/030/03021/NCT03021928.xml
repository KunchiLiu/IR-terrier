	<brief_summary>Title: Optimal Delay Time to Initiate Anticoagulation after Ischemic Stroke in Atrial Fibrillation (START): a pragmatic, adaptive randomized clinical trial. Primary Objective: • To determine the optimal time to initiate anticoagulation with a Non-Vitamin K Oral Anticoagulant (NOAC) after ischemic stroke in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. Secondary Objectives: - To compare the rates of primary adverse outcomes in a per protocol analysis - To compare 30 day clinical outcomes by the modified Rankin scale among the time-to-treatment groups - To compare 90 day clinical outcomes by the modified Rankin scale among the time-to-treatment groups - To explore the optimal timing in subgroups of age, sex, outcome category, and NOAC choice</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Long-term oral anticoagulation is standard for secondary stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation (AFib). However, there is limited data and no consensus on the timing of when to initiate anticoagulation therapy, and concern that starting too soon risks symptomatic hemorrhagic transformation. These data are derived almost exclusively from heparins and Vitamin K antagonists (e.g.,warfarin). Now that NOACs have become the mainstay of stroke prophylaxis in AFib and have more rapid and consistent anticoagulation and fewer strokes (hemorrhagic especially), the question of optimal timing of NOAC initiation is of increasing importance. The primary aim is to determine the time-to-treatment interval with the lowest associated risk for adverse events in the context of anticoagulation therapy with NOACs for acute stroke patients with non-valvular AFib. The question will be investigated with a prospective, adaptive, randomized, controlled "dose-exploration" trial with the time to treatment with NOAC therapy treated as the incremental "dose". An adaptive, pragmatic trial will be performed that will not deviate from the treating physicians' usual practice except for randomizing the time to start the NOAC. Data collection will be limited to those fields necessary for the planned primary and secondary analyses. The composite primary outcome event will be any of the following within 30 days of the index stroke: Ischemic Events (symptomatic ischemic stroke or systemic embolism), Hemorrhagic Events (symptomatic hemorrhagic transformation of index ischemic stroke, other symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, or major extracranial hemorrhage), or all-cause mortality. Four time-to-treatment intervals, i.e. study arms, between 2 and 14 days will be investigated: 60 hours, 132 hours, 228 hours, and 324 hours. An innovative adaptive design will be used which includes response adaptive randomization and modeling of ischemic and hemorrhagic outcome events. The ischemic and hemorrhagic events within the composite primary endpoint are modeled separately using their known monotonic property that the risk of an event increases (ischemic) or decreases (hemorrhage) as the time-to-treatment interval lengthens. Interim analyses will occur after every 50 subjects are randomized, where the primary outcome will be analyzed and new randomization probabilities will be calculated to favor the arms that have a better risk-profile.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. New ischemic stroke with disabling neurological deficit or lesion diameter on brain imaging &gt; 1.5 cm. 2. Nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (paroxysmal, persistent, or permanent). 3. Not currently anticoagulated (except for DVT prophylaxis). 4. Treating physician plans to anticoagulate with a novel oral anticoagulant (NOAC): apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, or rivaroxaban, or other NOAC. 5. Qualifying brain CT or MRI scan &lt; 48hr from stroke onset (time last known well). If patient has been treated with thrombolytic or endovascular therapy for this stroke, then the qualifying scan is performed 1836 hours after therapy to rule out clinically significant hemorrhagic transformation. This group of patients must have their qualifying NIHSS assessment performed at the time of this scan. 6. Ability to randomize within 60 hours of symptom onset. 1. Primary intracerebral hemorrhage on qualifying neuroimaging. Note: Hemorrhagic transformation of a primarily ischemic stroke may be included as per Investigator`s judgment. Sporadic microbleeds may be included as per Investigator`s judgment. As a general recommendation, a cerebral microbleed is considered to be ≤ 5mm, but sometimes up to 10mm, in greatest diameter on gradient recalled echo (GRE), or T2*, MRI sequences. Any blood visualized on a CT will be classified as a macrobleed 2. Infarct volume (estimated) is greater than 50% of middle cerebral artery territory on qualifying scan. 3. NIHSS &lt; 4 or &gt; 23 prior to enrollment. Note: For patients that had thrombolytic or endovascular therapy, the qualifying NIHSS assessment is that which is obtained concurrently with their qualifying scan 18 36 hours following therapy. 4. Anticipated need for major surgery over the next 30 days that would require delay, discontinuation, or extended suspension of anticoagulant. 5. Symptomatic edema expected from size and location of ischemic stroke. 6. Decreased level of consciousness present or expected. 7. Any intracranial hemorrhage within the previous 6 months. 8. Life expectancy less than 90 days. 9. Followup in person or by telephone for 90 days is not feasible.</criteria>
