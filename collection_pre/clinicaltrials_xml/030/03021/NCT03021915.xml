	<brief_summary>This is a single center, prospective, controlled pilot safety research study. The primary objective of this research study is to assess the safety with the use of the OvaPrime procedure in women who are diagnosed with either primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) or poor ovarian response (POR). A maximum of seventy (70) subjects will be enrolled to achieve the target sample size of 60 Modified Intent-to-Treat (mITT) subjects as the primary analysis population. Each subject shall have one ovary exposed to the EggPC cells while the contralateral ovary is exposed to the EggPC vehicle as a means to have each subject serve as their own control. Results between the treatment and control ovary will be examined for relevant endpoints such as antral follicle counts. The duration of the research study is estimated at approximately 6 years total, for the period spanning enrollment (estimated at approximately six months), eight months to the last hyperstimulation and through completion of 5-year follow-up (main study protocol with one year primary endpoint and LTFU sub-study which extends to 5 additional years).</brief_summary>
