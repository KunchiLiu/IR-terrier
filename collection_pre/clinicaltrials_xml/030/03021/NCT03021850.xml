	<brief_title>Different Therapeutical Modalities Associated to Hamstring Flexibility Training</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Context: In the literature there is a disagreement of results and protocols regarding the use of thermal modalities associated with the training of flexibility of the hamstring muscles. Most studies on the subject, used the heat and cryotherapy prior to stretching these. Therefore, the investigators aimed to conduct an experimental study using the therapeutics term concomitant arrangements to passive static stretching these muscles. Methods: Clinical trial randomized crossover, which will a sample of 42 subjects (healthy young men, aged 20 to 30 years). Were divided into 3 groups (Group 1 passive static stretching hamstrings, Group 2 heat + passive static stretching hamstrings and Group 3 cryotherapy + static stretching hamstrings passive) with 14 subjects each. Where the participants will control themselves, since all carry out the three interventions, only at different times. Each action will be performed every 7 days. Individuals will be subjected to active test of the range of motion of knee extension (goniometer) and hamstring muscle strength (dynamometer).</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Healthy men with knee extension range less than or equal to 160 degrees. Have exercised in the last 48 hours before the intervention session; Previous neurological, muscular or articular disease that influences the performance of the training; Anterior lower limb surgery; Presence of painful symptoms or edema in the lower limbs; Hypersensitivity to ice or heat; Raynaud's syndrome; Loss of local thermal sensitivity; Have metallic implants; Use of cardiac pacemaker; Presence of malignant tumor; Arterial diseases; Deep venous thrombosis or phlebitis; Fever and inflammatory processes; Bleeding processes; Osteomyelitis; Epilepsy; Pulmonary and bone tuberculosis; Kidney or urinary tract infection; Cryoglobulinemia;</criteria>
