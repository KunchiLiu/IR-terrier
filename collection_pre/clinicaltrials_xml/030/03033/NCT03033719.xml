	<brief_title>Colectomy for Cancer in the Elderly by Laparoscopy or Laparotomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The present study is a national, multicenter, open-label randomized, 2-arm superiority trial. Patients aged 75 years or older with uncomplicated colonic cancer or precancerous colonic lesion non-endoscopically resectable, will be randomized to either colectomy by laparoscopy or laparotomy. All patients that might be included will have a comprehensive geriatric assessment performed within the 30 days before randomization with the following scores: MMS (Mini Mental Score), ADL scale (Activities of Daily Living), IADL scale (Instrumental Activities of Daily Living), GDS (Geriatric Depression Scale) and TGUG test ("Timed Get-Up-and-Go" test).</detailed_description>
