	<criteria>1.

Capable of giving informed consent 6. adequate biliary drainage (serum bilirubin &lt; 2.5 ULN) with no evidence of active uncontrolled infection (patients on antibiotics are eligible) 7. Women of childbearing potential with a negative pregnancy test (qualitative serum HCG) prior to study entry and must be using adequate contraception method and continue this for one week after PDT 8. Must be willing and able to travel to study site for screening, treatment and all follow up visits 1. Evidence of metastases other than lung or liver and if lung or liver metastases are present, greater than three lesions, and any lesion greater than 5cm. in diameter 2. Porphyria; Pregnant or breastfeeding 3. Locally advanced disease involving &gt;50% circumference of the duodenum or a major artery (hepatic, gastroduodenal) with in the treatment area 4. ECOG performance status of 3 or 4 5. Previous treatment with curative intent for current disease in the last 12 weeks (i.e. prior resection, radical radiotherapy or chemotherapy) 6. Any psychiatric disease making reliable informed consent impossible 7. A history of documented hemorrhagic diathesis or coagulopathy, currently on therapeutic anticoagulation. History of prior or concomitant other malignancy that will interfere with the response evaluation 8. Any evidence of severe of uncontrolled systemic disease or laboratory finding that in the view of the investigator makes it unsafe for the patient to participate in the study 9.
