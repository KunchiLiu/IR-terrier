	<brief_summary>The investigators conclude that use of the LMA ProSealTM for prolonged procedures is feasible. In principle, it should be safer and more effective than the LMA ClassicTM provided basic guidelines are followed.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prolonged Laryngeal Mask Airway ProSealTM Use</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There is controversy concerning use of the classic laryngeal mask airway (LMA ClassicTM) for prolonged procedures, particularly over 2 hours, as some clinicians consider it unsuitable for positive pressure ventilation (needed to counter the alleged progressive respiratory fatigue with time) and/or unsuitable for airway protection (needed to counter the alleged progressive increase in aspiration risk with time). The LMA ProSealTM is a laryngeal mask device with a modified cuff to facilitate ventilation and a drain tube to provide airway protection. In principle, the LMA ProSealTM should be more suitable than the LMA ClassicTM for prolonged procedures; however, there are only four reports and one case series.</detailed_description>
