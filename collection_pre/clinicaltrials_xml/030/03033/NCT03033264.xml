	<detailed_description>The study is a randomized controlled test in which women with a BMI&gt;30 and women with a BMI&lt;30 will sign an informed consent and then divided to 4 groups depending on the mode of labor induction and BMI value: 1. Dinoprostone in women with a BMI&gt;30. 2. Dinoprostone in women with a BMI&lt;30. 3. Cervical ripening balloon in women with a BMI&gt;30. 4. Cervical ripening balloon in women with a BMI&lt;30. All subjects participating in the study will be induced for obstetrical indications alone. The subjects will be followed until labor, and information regarding the success of induction, mode of delivery and time of delivery will be collected from patients` electronic files. The participants will finish participation in the study after delivery.</detailed_description>
