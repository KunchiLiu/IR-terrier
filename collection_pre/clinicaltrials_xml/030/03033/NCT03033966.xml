	<brief_summary>Cerebral hypoperfusion and hypoxia are the major determinants of neurological outcomes following acute brain injury as proved in Traumatic Brain Injury/Sub Arachnoid Haemhorrhage literature. How the brain injury affects cerebral oxygenation in patients with CVT is not currently known. Some of the factors that can affect cerebral oxygenation in patients with CVT are Hemoglobin, PO2, PCO2, Cerebral Perfusion Pressure (or MAP) and change in Intracranial Pressure after Decompressive Craniectomy. This study is designed to study how these factors affect cerebral oxygenation and impact of Decompressive Craniectomy on the cerebral oxygenation.</brief_summary>
