	<brief_title>Evaluation of Marital and Sexual Satisfaction of Wives to Erectile Dysfunction Males</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Marital satisfaction is a global evaluation of the state of one's marriage or current long-term romantic relationship. This global evaluation can be a reflection of a how happy people are in their marriage in general or a composite of satisfaction with several specific facets of the marital relationship. Sexual health can be described as enjoying and fulfilling sexual desires without harming, physical or psychological, oneself or others. Sexual functioning is an important part of a patient's health and well-being. Patients often seek for treatment late due to embarrassment and commonly with an alternative problem. Sexual and erectile functions are considered important components of men's overall health. The psychosocial impact of ED can lead to depression, loss of self-esteem, and relationship and marital difficulties. Personality is defined as the "distinctive and characteristic patterns of thought, emotion and behavior that define an individual's personal style and influence his or her interaction with the environment".</detailed_description>
