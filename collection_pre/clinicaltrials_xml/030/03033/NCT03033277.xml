	<brief_summary>There is a high incidence of women suffering from Primary Ovarian Insufficiency (POI). One of the most common treatments for POI is hormone replacement therapy (HRT), but HRT doesn't work well, and it has been shown to increase the risk of blood clots in the veins, ovarian cancer, and breast cancer. The ability of MSCs to differentiate into oocyte-like cells has been previously documented. Herein the purpose of this work is to evaluate the therapeutic potential of cell therapy in women suffering from POI.</brief_summary>
