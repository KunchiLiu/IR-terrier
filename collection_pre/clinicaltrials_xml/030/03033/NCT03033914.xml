	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to improve the chance of cure for people with higher risk Hodgkin lymphoma. The purpose of the Phase I study is to test any good and bad effects of the study drug called Nivolumab when combined with ABVD for the front-line treatment of HL.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Cohort A overview: Patients age less than 60 with untreated stage III or IV classical Hodgkin lymphoma will be eligible for cohort A. In phase I, patients may enroll onto cohort A if they have a baseline IPS ≥3 OR if their PET scan after 2 cycles of ABVD is positive (Deauville 4 or 5). Patients enrolled based upon IPS score may enroll at anytime during the first 2 cycles of ABVD. Patients enrolled based upon PET2 positivity may enroll only after the PETscan is obtained. In phase II, only patients with PET2 positivity will be eligible. Cohort B overview: Patients 60 or older with untreated classical Hodgkin lymphoma (regardless of stage) will be eligible for cohort B. The following eligibility criteria applies to both cohort A and B except when stated otherwise: Histologic diagnosis of classical Hodgkin lymphoma FDGavid disease by FDGPET/CT Ann Arbor Stage III or IV disease (Cohort A only) WOCBP must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of HCG) within 24 hours prior to the start of study drug. Women who undergo fertility preservation within 2 weeks of beginning chemotherapy are expected to have falsepositive pregnancy tests and therefore testing may be waived for these patients. WOCBP must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of HCG) within 24 hours prior to the start of study drug. Women who undergo fertility preservation within 2 weeks of beginning chemotherapy are expected to have falsepositive pregnancy tests and therefore testing may be waived for these patients. Women must not be breastfeeding Men who are sexually active with WOCBP must agree to follow instructions for method(s) of contraception for the duration of treatment with study drug plus 5 halflives of study drug plus 90 days (duration of sperm turnover) for a total of 31 weeks posttreatment completion Age ≥ 18 Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x Upper limit of normal (ULN) or creatinine clearance (CrCl) ≥ 40 mL/min (measured using the CockcroftGault formula AST/ALT ≤ 3 x ULN (5x ULN for those with lymphoma involvement of the liver) Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN (except subjects with Gilbert Syndrome, who can have total bilirubin &lt; 3.0 mg/dL) Subjects with active brain metastases or leptomeningeal metastases. Subjects with nodular lymphocytepredominant HL Any serious or uncontrolled medical disorder that, in the opinion of the investigator, may increase the risk associated with study participation or study drug administration, impair the ability of the subject to receive protocol therapy, or interfere with the interpretation of study results. Prior malignancy active within the previous 3 years except for locally curable cancers that have been apparently cured, such as basal or squamous cell skin cancer, superficial bladder cancer, or carcinoma in situ of the prostate, cervix, or breast. Subjects with active, known or suspected autoimmune disease. Subjects with vitiligo, type I diabetes mellitus, residual hypothyroidism due to autoimmune condition only requiring hormone replacement, psoriasis not requiring systemic treatment, or conditions not expected to recur in the absence of an external trigger are permitted to enroll. Subjects with a condition requiring systemic treatment with systemic corticosteroids (equivalent of &gt;10mg/day of prednisone). Patients may receive steroid therapy up to 10 days prior to starting ABVD to control lymphomarelated symptoms. Any of the following cardiovascular conditions or values within 6 months before the first dose of study drug: A leftventricular ejection fraction &lt; 50% Myocardial infarction within 2 years of randomization New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III or IV heart failure Evidence of current uncontrolled cardiovascular conditions, including cardiac arrhythmias, congestive heart failure (CHF), angina, or electrocardiographic evidence of acute ischemia or active conduction system abnormalities Any positive test for hepatitis B virus or hepatitis C virus indicating acute infection. Known history of testing positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or known acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). History of severe hypersensitivity reaction to any monoclonal antibody.
