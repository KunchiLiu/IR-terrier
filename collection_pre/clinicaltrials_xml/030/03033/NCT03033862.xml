	<criteria>1. Subject may be of either sex and of any race, and must be &gt;18 years of age. 2. Subjects undergoing elective PCI due to de novo native coronary artery lesions (length ≤24 mm) with a reference vessel diameter of ≥2.5 mm and ≤3.75 mm. 3. Subject agrees to not participate in any other investigational or invasive clinical study for a period of 3 months following the index procedure. 4. Subject must be willing and able to give appropriate informed consent. 5. The subject is able to read and has signed and dated the informed consent document including authorization permitting release of personal health information approved by the investigator's Institutional Review Board (IRB). Hemodynamically unstable at the time of enrollment. Concurrent or anticipated treatment with warfarin (or derivatives, e.g., phenprocoumon), oral factor Xa inhibitor, or oral direct thrombin inhibitor after enrollment. GPI use prior to or at the time of PCI. History of a bleeding, or evidence of active abnormal bleeding. History at any time of intracranial hemorrhage, intracranial or spinal cord surgery, or a central nervous system tumor or aneurysm. Documented sustained severe hypertension (systolic blood pressure &gt;200 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure &gt;110 mmHg) at enrollment. Severe valvular heart disease, as defined by the American College of Cardiology /American Heart Association. History within 30 days before enrollment of invasive surgeries (other than mentioned above), or is anticipating one during the course of their study participation, or is planning to have one within 1 month post dosing with the study drug. History within 30 days before enrollment of TIA and ischemic (presumed thrombotic) stroke/CVA. Known platelet count &lt;100,000/mm3 within 30 days before enrollment. Known active hepatobiliary disease, or known unexplained persistent increase in serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activity to two times or more the upper limit of the reference range (upper limit of "normal" [↑2xULN]). Any serious medical comorbidity (e.g., active malignancy) such that the subject's life expectancy is &lt;24 months. Known current substance abuse at the time of enrollment. Current participation in any other study of investigational therapy or participation in such a study within the last 30 days. Known hypersensitivity to any component of the current investigational product. Female subject of childbearing potential. Subject is a woman who is breastfeeding. Subject is part of the staff personnel directly involved with this study or is a family member of the investigational staff. LVEF &lt;30% Subject with known renal insufficiency with an estimated GFR &lt;30 ml/min/1.73m or dialysis at the time of screening Subject requiring at least two lesion treatment and more suitable for staged PCI. Moderate or heavy calcification, tortuosity or other conditions are present proximal or within the target segment, reducing the likelihood that the Absorb BVS or XIENCE can be either delivered to or expanded at the lesion. Extreme angulation (≥90°) proximal to or within the target lesion. Excessive tortuosity (≥ two 45° angles) proximal to or within the target lesion. Lesion located within or distal to a diseased arterial graft or SVG. Aortoostial lesion (within 3 mm of the aorta junction). Lesion located in the left main artery. Lesion located within 2 mm of the origin of the LAD or LCX. Lesion involving a bifurcation with a: side branch ≥ 2 mm in diameter, or side branch with either an ostial or nonostial lesion with diameter stenosis &gt; 50%, or side branch requiring dilatation. Target vessel contains thrombus.</criteria>
