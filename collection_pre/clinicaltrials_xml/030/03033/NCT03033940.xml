	<brief_summary>The primary objective is to quantify and compare the three-dimensional kinematics of the cruciate retaining (CR), fixed bearing ATTUNETM TKA to the kinematics of the PFC Sigma Curved CR Fixed Bearing TKA (both DePuy Synthes, Johnson and Johnson) during daily activities. The secondary objective is to describe the kinematics in terms of range of motion, patterns of anterior-posterior motion of the nearest medial and lateral points ("posterior femoral rollback") and tibio-femoral internal/external rotation as well as the kinetics during daily activities, such as level gait, a deep knee bend (only ATTUNETM subjects), sitting down onto a chair, standing up from a chair and stair descent by means of video-fluoroscopy. Furthermore, the encoded data will be handed over to DePuy Synthes (Johnson and Johnson) and to the Center for Orthopaedic Engineering of the University of Denver, where it will be used within a musculoskeletal model with the aim of simulating tibiofemoral contact mechanics and changes in the musculoskeletal system due to the TKA.</brief_summary>
