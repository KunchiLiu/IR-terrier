	<brief_summary>Currently in the UK, TDM is routinely performed for aminoglycosides and glycopeptide antimicrobial agents, given fears over the narrow therapeutic window of these agents and the serious adverse events associated with toxicity. However, in critical care the role of TDM for optimisation of therapy has been demonstrated to help optimise dosing of patients who tend to have variable pharmacokinetic parameters (J. A. Roberts et al,). This is of growing importance given that low concentrations of antimicrobial agents, below a micro-organisms minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) is believed to be a major driver of AMR. The investigators set out to explore whether similar observations in PK-PD target variability are currently being observed across the secondary care setting (outside of critical care) and whether these appear to be impacting on clinical outcomes.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>3.1 STUDY PARTICIPANTS - Drug level sampling will be undertaken within the first 120 hours of commencing antimicrobial therapy once at steady state (after at least 4-5 doses have been administered to those on treatment). - All patients will be consented using the participation information leaflet and consent form provided in appendix 1. 3.2 DRUG LEVEL SAMPLING - An extra 3mls of blood will be collected during the patient's routine daily phlebotomy round following their consent. They will be enrolled for up to 72 hours or two days of routine blood tests (whichever is shorter). Up to 10 samples may be taken during the 2 days the patient is enrolled, depending on the number of routine blood tests the patient receives during that day. No more than 3mls will be taken per each routine blood sample. For example, if the individuals will only have routine blood tests taken at 8am on day 1 and day 2. Then only two extra samples will be taken (3mls on D1 and 3mls on D2). - The time they received their dose of antimicrobials, the length of infusion time, and time the sample was collected will all be recorded. - PK/PD indices for evaluation will be time over minimum inhibitory concentration (T&gt;MIC) 3.3 SAMPLE PREPARTION AND ANLYSIS - All blood samples will be allowed to clot for 15 minutes at room temperature and then centrifuged at 2,400rpm for 10 minutes. Sera from each sample will be separated into three vials and stored at -800C. - Beta-lactam concentrations will be measured using validated high-performance liquid chromatography methods. 3.4 PHARMCOKINETIC-PHARMACODYNAMIC MODELLING - Data will be anonymized and analyzed using Pmetrics in R. - Different pharmacokinetic models will be explored using in built statistical analysis options and visual predictive checks. - Pharmacodynamic models will then be incorporated into the model using evidence identified in the literature for selection of parameters. - Monte Carlo simulation will then be used to for simulation of target attainments and analysis of pharmacodynamic outcomes</detailed_description>
