	<brief_summary>The TURKHEF registry is the one of the first to include a large sample of patients with HF from different regions in Turkey. To describe the demographic, clinical, and echocardiographic characteristics and management of outpatients with Heart Failure (HF) followed by a representative setting of cardiology centres. Scarce data are available in the middle-east populations in general and Turkish patients in particular, who have different etiology, ethnic, cultural backgrounds and risk factors from those patients in the West. The aim of this study was to study Turkish patients with HF, and define their clinical characteristics and the signs and symptoms of heart failure, echocardiographic findings and medications at admission. With this national study, we will evaluate how recommendations of most recent European guidelines regarding pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments are adopted in clinical practice. We will also evaluate the prevalence of the clinical profiles of patients with HF, according to the definitions proposed by the European Society of Cardiology, and to investigate their appropriateness in characterizing patients with different clinical presentations and needs. Assessed outcomes included the causes of decompensation, use of medications, care quality indicators.

	<detailed_description>Purpose: To describe the demographic, clinical, and echocardiographic characteristics and management of outpatients with Heart Failure (HF) followed by a representative setting of cardiology centres. Background: Heart failure is one of the leading causes of mortality in adults in Turkey. However, most of the available data is limited to unicenter registries. The TURKHEF registry is the one of the first to include a large sample of patients with HF from different regions in Turkey. Objective: Several studies have been conducted in western countries differentiating features of epidemiology, treatment, and outcomes among patients with preserved and reduced EF. Scarce data are available in the middle-east populations in general and Turkish patients in particular, who have different etiology, ethnic, cultural backgrounds and risk factors from those patients in the West. The aim of this study was to study Turkish patients with HF, and define their clinical characteristics and the signs and symptoms of heart failure, echocardiographic findings and medications at admission. With this national study, we will evaluate how recommendations of most recent European guidelines regarding pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments are adopted in clinical practice. We will also evaluate the prevalence of the clinical profiles of patients with HF, according to the definitions proposed by the European Society of Cardiology, and to investigate their appropriateness in characterizing patients with different clinical presentations and needs. Methods: We have designed a prospective, multicentre, national, observational study to characterize HF. Patients presented to cardiology outpatient clinics with signs and/or symptoms of HF will be screened. The eligibility criteria included patients older than 18 years with signs and/or symptoms of HF, admitted to public or private hospitals. Assessed outcomes included the causes of decompensation, use of medications, care quality indicators. Data: Clinical data, including the medical history, cardiovascular risk factors, and associate comorbidities, will be collected. The symptoms of patients will be graded according to NYHA(New York Heart Association) classification. Blood samples will be collected for analysis of NT(N terminal)-proBNP and /or BNP(brain natriuretic peptide), and complete laboratory investigations will performed as well. A 12-lead surface ECG will be recorded at 25 mm/s speed. Interpretation will be performed by a skilled investigator, and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) will considered according to Sokolow index. Diastolic function parameters will be measured as follows: peak early diastolic filling (E) and late diastolic filling (A) velocities, E/A ratio, E deceleration time, early diastolic septal mitral annular velocity (e') (averaged from three cardiac cycles), and E/e' as an index of LV filling pressure. Left atrial volume index was calculated from apical four-and two-chamber views, using area - length formula. Diastolic dysfunction will be classified into four grades according to 2009 ASE(American Society of Echocardiography) guidelines. Conclusion: Clinical Characteristics and Management of TURKish Adult Outpatients With HEart Failure (TURKHEF) study aims to characterize baseline characteristics of patients with heart failure in Turkey.</detailed_description>
