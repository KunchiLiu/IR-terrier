	<brief_summary>The goal of this clinical research study is to test 2 types of dosing schedules of tremelimumab and durvalumab to learn if one is more effective in patients with high-grade, platinum-resistant epithelial ovarian, peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer. The safety of the dosing schedules will also be studied.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Durvalumab and Tremelimumab in Combo Versus Sequential</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Groups: If participants are found to be eligible to take part in this study participants will be randomly assigned (as in the flip of a coin) to 1 of 2 study groups (the Combination group or the Sequential group). This is done because no one knows if one study group is better, the same, or worse than the other group. Each study cycle is 4 weeks. Combination Group: If participants are assigned to the Combination Group, participants will receive 4 cycles of tremelimumab and durvalumab together, followed by 9 cycles of durvalumab alone. If participants' disease gets worse at any point participants will begin a standard of care treatment chosen by the study doctor or participants will be given the option to enroll on another study. If participants receive a standard of care treatment, the study doctor will discuss the risks and procedures with participants in detail. If participants choose to enroll on another study, a separate consent form will be provided and participants will be taken off this study. Sequential Group: If participants are assigned to the Sequential Group, participants will receive 4 cycles of tremelimumab alone, and then if the disease gets worse, participants will receive 9 cycles of durvalumab alone. The study doctor will discuss this with them. Study Drug Administration: Each time participants receive tremelimumab or durvalumab, it will be given by vein over about 60 minutes on Day 1 of each cycle. Length of Study: Participants may receive the study drugs for up to 13 cycles. If participants are in the combination group, participants may receive the standard of care treatment after the study drugs for as long as the doctor thinks it is in participants' best interest or until the disease get worse. If participants are in the sequential group and participants complete the full 13 cycles of the study drugs without the disease getting worse, participants will have follow up visits until the disease gets worse or until participants begin receiving treatment on another study. Participants will be taken off study if intolerable side effects occur, if participants are unable to follow study directions, or if the study doctor thinks it is in participants' best interest. Study Visits: Combination Group: All visits will occur on Day 1 of each 28-day cycle. On Day 1 of Cycles 1-13: - Participants will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, immune system testing, and to check the functioning of participants' thyroid during Cycles 1-6 only. If participants are able to become pregnant, the routine blood tests will include a pregnancy test during Cycles 1 and 3. - Urine will be collected for routine tests. - Participants will complete the same questionnaires participants did at screening. Participants will alternate between completing all 7 of the questionnaires and only 4 of the questionnaires each cycle. During Cycle 1 only: - Participants will return to the clinic for blood draws (1 tablespoon each time) for biomarker and immune system testing on Days 8, 15, and 22. - Participants will have an EKG to check participants' heart function. During Cycles 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 only, about 2 weeks after participants receive the study drugs, participants will have an MRI or a CT scan to check the status of the disease. During Cycle 3 only, participants will have a core tumor biopsy for biomarker and immune system testing. If the disease gets worse at any point participants will begin a standard of care treatment chosen by the study doctor or participants will be given the option to enroll on another study. If the disease does not get worse after the 13 cycles of treatment with the study drugs, participants will enter a waiting period. If the disease gets worse during the waiting period, participants will then begin a standard of care treatment chosen by the study doctor or participants will be given the option to enroll on another study. During the waiting period, the following tests and procedures will be performed after 30 days and then at every 2 months until participants begin the standard of care treatment chosen by participants' doctor or participants leave the study: Participants will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to check the functioning of participants' thyroid. - Urine will be collected for routine tests. - Participants will complete the 7 questionnaires from screening. If participants receiving the standard of care treatment, participants will follow the same study visit schedule that participants did while receiving tremelimumab and durvalumab, except participants will not have the blood draws and biopsy for biomarker and immune system testing. Sequential Group: All visits will occur on Day 1 of each 28-day cycle. On Day 1 of Cycles 1-4: - Participants will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, immune system testing, and to check the functioning of participants' thyroid. If participants are able to become pregnant, the routine blood tests will include a pregnancy test during Cycles 1 and 3. - Urine will be collected for routine tests. - Participants will complete the same questionnaires participants did at screening. Participants will alternate between completing all 7 of the questionnaires and only 4 of the questionnaires each cycle. During Cycle 1 only: - Participants will return to the clinic for blood draws (1 tablespoon each time) for biomarker and immune system testing on Days 8, 15, and 22. - Participants will have an EKG to check participants' heart function. During Cycles 2 and 4, only, about 2 weeks after participants receive the study drugs, participants will have an MRI or a CT scan to check the status of the disease. During Cycle 3 only, participants will have a core tumor biopsy for biomarker and immune system testing. After Cycle 4 or if the disease gets worse, whichever occurs first, participants will wait at least 8 weeks to allow the tremelimumab to clear participants' system and then participants will receive up to 9 cycles of durvalumab only (Cycles 5-13). About 1 month into the 8-week waiting period, participants will have a study visit. The following tests and procedures will be performed: - Participants will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to check the functioning of participants' thyroid. - Urine will be collected for routine tests. - Participants will complete the 7 questionnaires from screening. Participants will begin receiving durvalumab on Day 1 of Cycle 5. On Day 1 of Cycles 5-13: - Participants will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests and to check the functioning of participants' thyroid. - Urine will be collected for routine tests. - Participants will complete the same questionnaires participants did at screening. Participants will alternate between completing all 7 of the questionnaires and only 4 of the questionnaires each cycle. During Cycle 5 only, participants will have an EKG to check participants' heart function. During Cycles 5 and 6 only, an additional blood sample (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for immune system testing. During Cycles 6, 8, 10, and 12 only, about 2 weeks after participants receive the study drugs, participants will have an MRI or a CT scan to check the status of the disease. End of Study Visit After participants have received participants' last dose of the study drugs or the standard of care treatment chosen by the study doctor, participants will have an end of study visit. The following tests and procedures will be performed: - Participants will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to check the functioning of participants' thyroid. If participants can become pregnant, part of this sample will be used for a pregnancy test. - Urine will be collected for routine tests. - Participants will complete the 7 questionnaires from screening. Follow-up About 30 days and then every 2 months after participants' last dose of the study drugs or standard of care treatment: - Participants will have a physical exam. - Participants will have an MRI or a CT scan to check the status of the disease. - Participants will complete 7 questionnaires (for the first 2 months only). This is an investigational study. Neither durvalumab nor tremelimumab are FDA approved or commercially available for the types of cancer in this study. Participants are currently being used for research purposes only in these diseases. The study doctor can explain how the study drugs are designed to work. Up to 100 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>
