	<brief_title>Prevalence and Dynamic of Sleep-disordered Breathing in Patients Pre and Post Heart Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sleep-disordered breathing is believed to appear at a high prevalence in end-stage heart failure patients and the presence of sleep-disordered breathing has been associated with increased mortality. This study is designed to investigate prevalence and dynamics of sleep-disordered breathing in end-stage heart failure patients pre and post heart transplantation, as this topic is hardly studied yet and previous reports suggest changes in the entity of sleep-disordered breathing through heart transplantation. The circumstances and the impact of sleep-disordered breathing or residuals in heart transplant patients is not well understood yet and will be subject of this study.</detailed_description>
