	<brief_summary>This is a proof of concept, single center study for the donation of HCV-positive hearts to HCV negative recipient patients, with preemptive, interventional treatment with 12-16 weeks of grazoprevir and elbasvir (with or without ribavirin) to prevent HCV transmission upon transplantation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Preemptive Zepatier Treatment in Donor HCV Positive to Recipient HCV Negative Cardiac Transplant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Phase 1 of this study will be a single case study with only one subject enrolled. Once safety has been demonstrated and HCV infection transmission shown to be prevented by the protocol, the study will expand to 10 additional patients. Patients will be selected based on their diminished likelihood of receiving a heart from the waitlist within a period during which they would be likely to succumb to severe comorbidities. This will be determined in part through use of a patient's listing status (1A, 1B, 2) and clinical judgment, and the Seattle Heart Failure Model.</detailed_description>
