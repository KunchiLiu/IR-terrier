	<brief_summary>Background and significance: Treatment with opioid pain medications (like hydrocodone and morphine) is common for severe pain, but studies show these medications may not always help and can cause serious problems. High daily doses of opioids can be especially unsafe. To help patients with chronic pain have better quality of life and avoid medication toxicity, health care teams need to manage pain while helping patients reduce opioid medication doses to safer levels. Study aims: This study will test which of two pain treatment strategies is better for managing pain and helping patients improve safety of opioid medication. For patients on high opioid doses who want to reduce, this study will also test whether offering an extra option for tapering (buprenorphine-naloxone) helps them succeed. Finally, the study will examine patients' and clinicians' experiences with the interventions. Study description: The study will compare two treatment strategies among patients with pain who are taking long-term opioid pain medications prescribed by VA healthcare facilities across the country. Patients who wish to enter the study will be assigned by chance to telecare collaborative management (TCM) or integrated pain team (IPT). TCM involves a pharmacist and supervising physician working together to find the best medication options for each individual patient. In IPT, a team of clinicians focuses on non-medication pain management options, in addition to pain medication. All participants will be asked to stay in the study for 12 months. Patients for whom it would be unsafe to participate will not be invited to join. With either treatment strategy, TCM or IPT, participants will have individualized pain care tailored to their needs and preferences. Participants on high opioid medication doses who want to reduce their opioid medication dose will be assigned by chance to get either a regular step-wise taper or a choice between a regular taper or switching to a different medication (buprenorphine-naloxone). At the end of the study, the two treatment strategies will be compared to see which worked better to (1) decrease pain severity and (2) reduce opioid medication dose. Other outcomes important to patients will also be tracked. These include quality of life, sleep, fatigue, depression, anxiety, and side effects.</brief_summary>
