	<brief_title>Refining and Testing the Electronic Social Network Assessment Program (eSNAP)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Former Aim 1: Refine eSNAP data-gathering and visualization prototypes based on evaluations of user experience, including usability, satisfaction and applicability. The refining process was completed at the University of Utah. Aim 2: Test the feasibility of implementing eSNAP in a neuro-oncology clinical setting and collect preliminary effectiveness data of eSNAP on Family Caregiver outcomes, including quality of life and stress, and mediators (Family Caregiver social support utilization and burden). The feasibility process will take place at Moffitt Cancer Center. This study will be a 2x2 longitudinal design. Caregivers of primary brain tumor patients will be compared to caregivers of patients with secondary brain tumors (brain metastases) to determine if there is something unique about the cancer-specific duties of primary versus secondary brain tumors that could impact the effectiveness of the eSNAP application. An intervention group will be compared to a control group for both types of caregivers. All caregivers will be followed for 6 weeks and will be asked to complete questionnaires at 3 time points; caregivers in the intervention group will also be asked to use the eSNAP application at time 1, which will be available to them for the duration of the study.</detailed_description>
