	<brief_title>Effect of Therapeutical Paraffin in the Malleability of Burned Skin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The altered biomechanical properties of the skin entail limitation of movement, it have been important the statement of resources aimed at increasing skin suppleness. The objective of the study is to evaluate the effect of therapeutic paraffin in biophysical characteristics of the burned skin with or without scar hypertrophic. For this, 60 volunteers will be evaluated in the age group of 18-60 years, of both sexes, with deep second degree and third degree burns and evaluated areas submitted to therapeutic procedures, divided evenly into scar areas and normal skin. Applications will be set randomly by lot, with cross design (cross-over), and a minimum interval of seven days (wash-out) of the activities. The biophysical and biomechanical parameters of the skin will be assessed noninvasively by Cutometer of the model (MPA) 580, device to measure elasticity of the upper skin layer using negative pressure, and the durometer, measure hardness of the skin, before, immediately after 0, 10, 20 and 30 minutes of intervention with therapeutic paraffin in different procedures (number of layers and thermal insulation). Sociodemographic, clinical and surgical data of the volunteers will be evaluated by SPSS 15 (Statistical Analysis Software). The normality of the data will be verified by the Shapiro-Wilk test, and the effect of therapeutic procedures over time evaluated by the Friedman test (intragroup) and the test Kruskal-Wallis post hoc Dunn for comparisons between different funds (intergroup), p &lt;0.05, will evaluated by software SPSS.</detailed_description>
