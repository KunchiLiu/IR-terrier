	<brief_summary>The investigators aim to evaluate chewing function in children with repaired esophageal atresia-tracheoesophageal fistula (EA-TEF). Patients with repaired EA-TEF will be evaluated for age, sex, type of atresia. Each child will be required to bite and chew a standardized biscuit. Chewing function will be scored with the Karaduman Chewing Performance Scale (KCPS). The International Dysphagia Diet Standardisation Initiative (IDDSI) will be used to determine the tolerated food texture of children.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Chewing in Children With Repaired Esophageal Atresia-tracheoesophageal Fistula</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The diet of children with normal feeding skills includes a combination of liquid, semisolid and/or solid foods. Chewing dysfunction (CD) in children may cause restrictions in solid food intake, thereby may result in insufficient food intake and delay in growth. It is aim to evaluate chewing function in children with repaired esophageal atresia-tracheoesophageal fistula (EA-TEF). Patients with repaired EA-TEF will be evaluated for age, sex, type of atresia. Each child will be required to bite and chew a standardized biscuit. Chewing function will be scored with the Karaduman Chewing Performance Scale (KCPS).
