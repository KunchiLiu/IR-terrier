	<brief_summary>Complications are common during endotracheal intubation of critically ill adults. Manual ventilation between induction and intubation ("bag-valve-mask" ventilation) has been proposed as a means of preventing hypoxemia, the most common complication of intubation outside the operating room. Safety and efficacy data, however, are lacking. PreVent is a randomized trial comparing manual ventilation between induction and laryngoscopy to no manual ventilation between induction an laryngoscopy during endotracheal intubation of critically ill adults. The primary efficacy endpoint will be the lowest arterial oxygen saturation. The primary safety endpoints will be the lowest oxygen saturation, highest fraction of inspired oxygen, and highest positive end-expiratory pressure in the 24 hours after the procedure.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Preventing Hypoxemia With Manual Ventilation During Endotracheal Intubation (PreVent) Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PreVent is a prospective, parallel-group, pragmatic, randomized trial comparing manual ventilation between induction and laryngoscopy to no manual ventilation between induction an laryngoscopy during endotracheal intubation of critically ill adults. The primary aim of the PreVent trial is to compare the effect of manual ventilation between induction and intubation versus no manual ventilation on the lowest arterial oxygen saturation experienced by critically ill adults undergoing endotracheal intubation. The PreVent trial is anticipated to begin enrollment in January 2017 and will enroll adults undergoing endotracheal intubation with sedation and/or neuromuscular blockade in participating units. Patients will be randomized 1:1 to manual ventilation versus no manual ventilation. In the manual ventilation group, manual ventilation using a bag-valve-mask will be provided from the time of induction until the time of endotracheal intubation, except during laryngoscopy. In the no manual ventilation group, no manual ventilation will be provided between induction and endotracheal intubation, except for the treatment of hypoxemia. The primary efficacy endpoint will be the lowest arterial oxygen saturation during the procedure. The primary safety endpoints will be the lowest oxygen saturation, highest fraction of inspired oxygen, and highest positive end expiratory pressure in the 24 hours after intubation. The planned enrollment will be 350 patients. Conduct of the trial will be overseen by a Data Safety Monitoring Board. An interim analysis will be performed after the enrollment of 175 patients. The analysis of the trial will be conducted in accordance with a pre-specified statistical analysis plan made publicly available prior to the conclusion of enrollment.</detailed_description>
