	<brief_summary>In this exploratory study, patients with stage 1-3 adenocarcinoma of the colon with no signs of distant metastases will be treated with short-term immunotherapy + COX2-inhibitors. This treatment will be given during the window period until surgical resection of the tumor. The duration of treatment will be approximately 6 weeks.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In this single-center, open-label, exploratory study, the investigators will enroll 60 patients within two years, including 30 patients with MSS tumors and 30 patients with MSI tumors. Patients with MSS tumors will be randomized to either group 1 or 2. Patients with MSI tumors will all be allocated to group 1. Patients in group 1 will be treated with a single dose of ipilimumab 1mg/kg on day 1 and two cycles of nivolumab 3mg/kg on day 1 and 15, respectively. Patients in group 2 will be treated with a single dose of ipilimumab 1mg/kg on day 1, two cycles of nivolumab 3mg/kg one day 1 and 15 and celecoxib daily until the day before surgery.</detailed_description>
