	<brief_summary>A critical variation in the provision of prenatal care to women with GDM is the need to keep patients engaged with their care between visits by tracking glucose levels using finger sticks and making dietary and other lifestyle modifications to keep these levels at or close to normal. Multiple studies have demonstrated that the use of mobile devices can improve medical outcomes. In order to keep patients engaged between appointments and improve self-care/lifestyle, we will study the use of a glucose monitoring system with nutrition therapy called GlucoseMama(GM). GM is a mobile app on the iOS system that individuals with GDM will use to tract blood sugars and number of carbs consumed. In addition, it will give the user positive feedback and rewards for using the system. This model of group care with mobile phone monitoring and reminders for women with GDM has not been previously studied. A randomized control trial is purposed to determine if this approach improves patient care. The investigators hypothesize that group prenatal care along with inter-session mobile therapy will increase dietary compliance and therefore reduce the number of individuals requiring pharmacologic therapy and improve neonatal outcomes during pregnancy. Group prenatal care (GPC) will provide a community foundation to improve learning and increase the motivation of patients to learn and change. This motivation will be further strengthened by the use of the GlucoseMama monitoring system which will provide each patient with glucose tracking and individualized nutritional support.</brief_summary>
