	<brief_summary>To evaluate the safety and efficacy of ultrasonography (US) -guided radiofrequency ablation for liver tumors, the investigators used preoperative and postoperative US/CEUS(contrast-enhanced ultrasonography)/CT/MRI to assess lesions, and laboratory tests including the tumor markers to evaluate the general condition of patients. Intraoperative US/CEUS/CT would be applied to monitor ablation lesions.</brief_summary>
