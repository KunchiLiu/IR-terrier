	<brief_title>Novel Quadrilateral Surface Plate for Acetabular Fracture</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Stoppa approach was more minimally invasive than ilioinguinal approach for pelvic and acetabular fractures. Then, Stoppa approach was widely used clinically. For the fragments involving quadrilateral surface, the Kocher-Langenbeck approach was added because the fixation of posterior fragments could not be obtained with reconstruction plate through single Stoppa approach. Novel quadrilateral surface plate was used in this study to examine its fixed role for posterior fragments. Functional outcome and complication were recorded to compare with the results treated with reconstruction plate. If good results were obtained for the patients fixed with quadrilateral surface plate, it was meaningful to popularize the fixed method.</detailed_description>
