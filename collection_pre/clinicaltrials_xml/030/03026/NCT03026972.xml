	<brief_summary>There are three populations in Recombinant Mycobacterium tuberculosis Vaccine Freeze-dried (AEC/BC02) phase I clinical research. The clinical study adopt randomized and open research design. Population I have 25 subjects who received Tuberculin purified protein derivative(TB-PPD) skin test and specific gamma-interferon (γ-IFN)detection whose results are both negative ;Population II have 75 subjects who received Tuberculin purified protein derivative(TB-PPD) and ESAT6-CFP10 skin test in different arms , specific gamma-interferon (γ-IFN) detection whose results are all negative.75 subjects whose three kinds of detection results are all positive(specific gamma interferon detection (γ-IFN),TB-PPD and ESAT6-CFP10 ) are named as population III. Three populations are screened at the same time. After filtrating, injecting of population I start firstly.After ensure the safety of the population I population II and population III carry out the implementation at the same time.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Firstly,all participants of the placebo group complete the first needle intramuscular injection. Secondly ,low-dose adjuvant group are injected after being sure of the security of placebo group in two hours. Thirdly, according to the safe results of low-dose adjuvant group in 3 days, the low-dose vaccine group are injected. The population II/ III are randomly divided into placebo group, low-dose adjuvant group, middle- dose adjuvant group, high-dose adjuvant group, low-dose vaccine group, middle-dose vaccine group and high-dose vaccine group, each group has 10 participants, except placebo groups have 15 cases. Each participant immune one type of placebo, adjuvant or vaccination every two weeks, totally six stitches . In the research, each subject receives only one dose of drug and cannot be subjected to experiments about dose escalation. All subjects of the population I are randomly divided into placebo (5 cases)，low-dose adjuvant (10 cases) and low-dose vaccine (10 cases). The population Ⅰ subjects are received 6 needle times of placebo or adjuvant or vaccine by haunch deep intramuscular injection to provide security basis for population Ⅱ and population Ⅲ. The subjects should accept some physical examination during the clinical research. Vital signs (breathing, heart rate, blood pressure, body temperature) of each volunteer before each needle injection and 30min, 3day, 14day after injection; and local reaction of each volunteer at 30min, 3day, 14day after injection; all subjects should accept alcohol detection before each needle injection; routine blood, routine urine, liver and kidney function, and ECG before each injection and 3 days after the first needle injection and 14days after the sixth needle injection; chest X-ray detection before the first injection and 30 days after the sixth needle injection. All subjects should assess the changes of immunological indexes before the first injection, 3 days after the first injection, the fourth time before injection and 30 days after the sixth needle injection. The specific injection orders are as follows: - All the subjects of placebo group(5 cases) and low-dose adjuvant group(10 cases) will be injected on the same day, the adjuvant group subjects should be injected after all the placebo group completed and observed two hours safety; - All the subjects of low-dose vaccine (10 cases) will be injected on the third day if the placebo group and adjuvant group subjects are observed safety. - The clinical study of population Ⅱ and population Ⅲ will be carried out 3 days later if the low-dose vaccine group subjects of the population Ⅰ are observed safety; Each subject inoculates a dose of drug every two weeks, a total of six agents. In conclusion, the result of the Phase I Clinical Study of population I evaluate safety of different dose of Recombinant Mycobacterium tuberculosis Vaccine Freeze-dried(AEC/BCO2) in different population, but also provide a safe basis for the Phase I Clinical Study of population Ⅱ and population Ⅲ. The populationⅠsubjects are injected the first needle injection and observe safety after 3 days and then conducted clinical research population Ⅱ and Ⅲ in Phase I Clinical. The study population Ⅱ/Ⅲ will be injected to a placebo or adjuvant or vaccination and collect any adverse events and serious adverse events to evaluate its safety during the period of clinical research. The 75 subjects of study population Ⅱand 75 subjects of population III who meet the inclusion criteria and do not accord with standard of exclusion are randomly divided into placebo group, low-dose adjuvant group, middle-dose adjuvant group, high-dose adjuvant group, low-dose vaccine group, middle-dose vaccine group and high-dose vaccine group, each group has 10 participants, except placebo group have 15 cases.The subjects should accept some physical examination during the clinical research,and all the items of physical examination are as same as population I. Specific injection orders are as follows: - All the subjects of populationⅡof low-dose placebo group and adjuvant group will be injected on the sixth day, the adjuvant group subjects should be injected after all the placebo group received completed placebo and observed two hours safety; - The subjects of populationⅡof middle dose placebo group and adjuvant group and low doses of vaccine group will be injected after 3 days safety on the ninth day, at the same time, the low dose placebo group and adjuvant group of populationⅢwill be injected too. - The subjects of populationⅡof high dose placebo group and adjuvant group and middle doses of vaccine group will be injected after 4 days safety on the thirteen day, at the same time, the middle dose placebo group and adjuvant group and low doses of vaccine group of populationⅢwill be injected too. - The subjects of populationⅡof high dose vaccine group will be injected after 3 days safety on the16 day, at the same time, the high dose placebo group and adjuvant group and middle dose of vaccine group of populationⅢwill be injected too. ⑤ The subjects of populationⅢ of high dose vaccine group will be injected after 4 days safety on the 20 day. All subjects are vaccinated once every two weeks, a total of six times vaccination.</detailed_description>
