	<brief_summary>Suicidal behavior (SB) is a major public health problem in France, with over 10,000 suicides (6th in the EU28) and 220,000 suicide attempts (SA) per year. These data seem underestimated by 20%. A large percentage of men (6%) and women (9%) in France made at least one lifetime SA. In addition, SBs are common among young people and are the second leading cause of death among 15-44 year-olds. The interaction of multiple factors in SB complicates the creation of predictive models. These are currently imprecise and prevent the development of consensual recommendations for the management of suicidal patients. Most suicide attempters are evaluated in the emergency room where it is imperative to identify people with a high risk of relapse. Risk assessment is generally based on the experience of the practitioner who uses psychometric scales as support for clinical decisions. This assessment could be improved and supplemented by other sources of information. Thus, we aim to develop a short and specific tool that combines: 1. Neurocognitive measures carried out using computer software on domains strongly associated with SB: impulsivity, affective dysregulation, alterations in decision-making (risky choices), selective attention and verbal fluency. 2. Clinical and psychological assessment including the most predictive items of future SA: life events (environment) and personality traits (vulnerability). Suicide attempters will be assessed for SB and suicidal ideation in the emergency department. These measures will be repeated during a 12-month follow-up. We will use the data obtained to provide a more accurate measure of risk.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of the Risk Associated With Impulsivity and Other Neuropsychological Factors on Suicidal Relapse Within Hospital Emergencies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Over 17 months, 5 emergency departments (Montpellier, Nimes, Uzès, Nice, Marseille) will recruit a total of 500 patients who attempted suicide. - First visit: clinical and neuropsychological assessment - Second and third visits at 6 and 12 months: assessment of SBs and suicidal relapse, clinical and neuropsychological assessment.</detailed_description>
