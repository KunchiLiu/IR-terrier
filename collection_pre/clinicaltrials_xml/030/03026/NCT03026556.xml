The first dispensing date of either study drug will be defined as the index date; Patients must be treatment na√Øve from all OAC use prior to the first NOAC prescription, during study period. Patients must have at least 12 months of continuous eligibility prior to the index date; Patients must have at least one diagnosis code of atrial fibrillation, defined as ICD 9CM diagnosis of 427.31 or ICD10CM diagnosis of I48.0, I48.1, I48.2, I48.91 on the index date or during the preindex period. Less than 12 months of continuous eligibility in the preindex period Any claim for OAC drug (oral use only) in the preindex period Diagnosis of hyperthyroidism during the preindex period Having at least one claim for alternative indications; orthopedic procedures, VTE (includes DVT &amp;PE) and the index NOAC prescription at the same time, or, the alternative indication for anticoagulant occurring within 3 months prior to index date in preperiod Having at least one claim with any of the following diagnoses or procedure codes in order to exclude patients with "transient" causes of Afib (3 months prior to index date in preperiod): Cardiac surgery Pericarditis Myocarditis Having at least one medical claim with any of the following diagnoses or procedures codes in order to exclude patients with "valvular" Afib (preperiod): Mitral stenosis Mitral stenosis with insufficiency Mitral valve stenosis and aortic valve stenosis Mitral valve stenosis and aortic valve insufficiency Diseases of other endocardial structures Other and unspecified rheumatic heart diseases Open heart valvuloplasty without replacement Open and other replacement of unspecified heart valve Open and other replacement of aortic valve Open and other replacement of mitral valve Open and other replacement of pulmonary valve Open and other replacement of tricuspid valve Heart valve replaced by transplant Heart valve replaced by a mechanical device/prosthesis Atrioventricular valve repair Aortic valve valvuloplasty Unlisted procedure, cardiac surgery Implantation of catheterdelivered prosthetic aortic heart valve; open thoracic approach Transthoracic cardiac exposure (e.g., sternotomy, thoracotomy, subxiphoid) for catheterdelivered aortic valve replacement; without cardiopulmonary bypass Transthoracic cardiac exposure (e.g., sternotomy, thoracotomy, subxiphoid) for catheterdelivered aortic valve replacement; with cardiopulmonary bypass Replacement, aortic valve, with cardiopulmonary bypass; with prosthetic valve other than homograft or stentless valve Valvuloplasty, mitral valve, with cardiopulmonary bypass Valvuloplasty, mitral valve, with cardiopulmonary bypass; with prosthetic ring Valvuloplasty, mitral valve, with cardiopulmonary bypass; radical reconstruction, with or without ring Replacement, mitral valve, with cardiopulmonary bypass Implantation of catheterdelivered prosthetic pulmonary valve, endovascular approach Replacement, pulmonary valve Valvectomy, tricuspid valve, with cardiopulmonary bypass Valvuloplasty, tricuspid valve; without ring insertion Valvuloplasty, tricuspid valve; with ring insertion Replacement, tricuspid valve, with cardiopulmonary bypass</criteria>
