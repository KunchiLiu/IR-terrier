	<brief_summary>This is a randomized, observer-blind, trial in clinically-stable older adults. Up to 300 eligible older adults 60 through 80 years of age will be enrolled at a 1:1 ratio into multiple dose/formulation treatment arms. Safety and immunogenicity data through Day 56 will be used to select a vaccine candidate to potentially evaluate in a Part 2 study. Proportions of subjects in various strata will not be pre-specified and the goal will be to achieve an approximately equal distribution of subjects with these characteristics across the treatment groups. Serology measures consistent with the study outcomes will be reported.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Males and females 60 through 80 years of age who are ambulatory and live in the community or in an assistedliving facility that provides minimal assistance, such that the subject is primarily responsible for selfcare and activities of daily living. Subjects may have one or more chronic medical diagnoses, but should be clinically stable as assessed by: Absence of changes in medical therapy within one month due to treatment failure or toxicity (dose adjustments of ongoing therapies for optimal effect, or replacements within a class of drugs due to convenience or cost, will be deemed acceptable), Absence of medical events qualifying as SAEs within one month of the planned vaccination on Day 0, and Absence of known, current, and lifelimiting diagnoses which, in the opinion of the investigator, render survival to completion of the protocol unlikely. 2. Willing and able (on both a physical and cognitive basis) to give informed consent prior to study enrollment. To complete the consent process, all qualifying subjects will correctly answer at least 4 out of 5 questions of the informed consent form (ICF) comprehension assessment in no more than 2 attempts. 3. Able to comply with study requirements. As the protocol procedures involve telephone contacts for safety ascertainment, eligible subjects must have a reliable access to a telephone. 1. Received any prior RSV vaccine. 2. Participation in research involving any additional investigational product (drug / biologic / device) within 45 days before planned date of first vaccination. 3. History of a serious reaction to any prior vaccination or a history of GuillainBarré syndrome (GBS) within 6 weeks of any prior influenza immunization. 4. Receipt of inactivated influenza vaccine within 14 days prior to the Day 0 dose of test article or any other vaccine within the 4 weeks prior to the Day 0 dose of test article. 5. Any known or suspected immunosuppressive condition, acquired or congenital, as determined by history and/or physical examination. 6. Chronic administration (defined as more than 14 continuous days) of immunosuppressants or other immunemodifying drugs within 6 months prior to the administration of the study vaccine. An immunosuppressant dose of glucocorticoid will be defined as a systemic dose ≥ 10 mg of prednisone per day or equivalent. The use of topical, inhaled, and nasal glucocorticoids will be permitted. 7. Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the 3 months preceding the administration of the study vaccine or during the study. 8. Acute disease at the time of enrollment (defined as the presence of a moderate or severe illness with or without fever, or an oral temperature ≥ 38.0°C on the planned day of vaccine administration). 9. Known disturbance of coagulation. Potential subjects receiving aspirin, clopidogrel, prasugrel, dipyridamole, dabigatran, apixaban, rivaroxaban, or warfarin under good control for cardiovascular prophylaxis or prophylaxis of thromboembolic disease or stroke in the setting of atrial fibrillation will NOT be excluded. 10. Suspicion or recent history (within one year of planned vaccination) of alcohol or other substance abuse. 11. Any condition that in the opinion of the investigator would pose a health risk to the subject if enrolled or could interfere with evaluation of the vaccine or interpretation of study results (including neurologic, cognitive, or psychiatric conditions deemed likely to impair the quality of study compliance or safety reporting).</criteria>
