	<brief_title>Vessel Injury in Relation With Strut Thickness Assessed by OCT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Thinner struts produce less arterial injury after stent implantation.The objective of the present study is to determine the relation between vascular injury induced by the stent and strut thickness. Vessel injury after stent implantation will be evaluated with optical coherence tomography (OCT). Two stents platforms with different strut thickness (Coroflex ISAR 50 microns and Biomatrix 120 microns) will be compared.</detailed_description>
