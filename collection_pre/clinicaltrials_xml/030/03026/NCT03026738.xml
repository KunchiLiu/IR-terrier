	<brief_summary>Aim of this work is to compare results between Laparoscopic Anterior Mesh Rectopexy and Laparoscopic Posterior Mesh Rectopexy for patients with rectal prolapse by assessment of operative time, intraoperative blood loss , intraoperative organ injury, overall length of hospital stay, recurrence,and improvement of incontinence and constipation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Anterior Versus Posterior Laparoscopic Mesh Rectopexy For Rectal Prolapse; a Randomized Controlled Trial.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rectal prolapse is a disabling condition, which is more common in females and increases in frequency with age. There are two types of rectal prolapse; external and internal. External rectal prolapse is a circumferential protrusion of all layers of the rectum through the anal sphincter. Internal rectal prolapse, also referred to as rectal intussusception. The majority of patients with a RP suffer from symptoms of fecal incontinence and constipation, causing a significant negative impact on quality of life. The aims of the surgical treatment are to correct the anatomical abnormality and to cure the accompanying symptoms of incontinence, constipation and pain, with the lowest rate of complications as possible and an acceptable rate of recurrence. Since the emergence of minimally invasive surgery, laparoscopic techniques for the treatment for RP have been applied in patients of all ages.</detailed_description>
