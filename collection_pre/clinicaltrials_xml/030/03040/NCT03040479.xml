	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetic Single Dose Study of Oral Lasmiditan in Subjects With Normal and Impaired Hepatic Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will enroll up to 24 subjects and will include 2 hepatic impaired subject groups and one group of control subjects with normal hepatic function. Approximately four subjects with mild hepatic impairment will be enrolled first (Group 1). To ensure subject safety, following dosing of these first four subjects, a safety meeting will take place to review the safety data prior to dosing additional subjects. After safety and pharmacokinetic (PK) results from the first four subjects have been reviewed, an additional four subjects with mild hepatic impairment (remainder of Group 1) will be enrolled concurrently with the moderated hepatic impairment group (Group 2). Thereafter, matched subjects with normal hepatic function (Group 3) will be enrolled. All subjects will participate in one treatment period and will receive a single dose of lasmiditan in the fasting state.</detailed_description>
