	<brief_summary>This study will be an open-label, nonrandomized, absorption, metabolism, and excretion study of [14C]-lasmiditan administered as a 200-mg (approximately 100 µCi) oral solution to 8 healthy male and female subjects, following at least a 10 hour fast from food to assess the pharmacokinetics (PK), metabolism, and routes and extent of elimination of a single oral dose of 200 mg (approximately 100 µCi) [14C] lasmiditan in healthy male and female subjects.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>1. males and females, between 18 and 60 years of age, inclusive, at Screening; 2. have a body mass index range of 18.5 to 32.0 kg/m2, inclusive, at Screening; 3. in good health, determined by no clinically significant findings from medical history, 12 lead ECG, and vital signs measurements at Screening or Checkin (Day 1) as determined by the Investigator (or designee); 4. clinical laboratory evaluations (including clinical chemistry panel [fasted at least 10 hours], hematology/complete blood count [CBC], and urinalysis [UA]; within the reference range for the test laboratory at Screening and Checkin, unless deemed not clinically significant by the Investigator (or designee); 5. negative test for selected drugs of abuse at Screening (does not include alcohol) and at Checkin (does include alcohol); 6. negative hepatitis panel (including hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis C virus antibody and negative human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody screens at Screening; 7. females must be nonpregnant, nonlactating, and either postmenopausal (defined as no menstrual period for at least 12 months and confirmed by a serum folliclestimulating hormone [FSH] level of ≥40 mIU/mL), surgically sterile (e.g., bilateral oophorectomy, salpingectomy, and/or hysterectomy) for at least 90 days prior to Screening, or must have undergone bilateral tubal ligation and agree to use effective contraception. For all females, the pregnancy test results must be negative at Screening and Checkin; 8. males will be surgically sterile for at least 90 days prior to Screening or when sexuallyactive with female partners of childbearing potential will agree to use contraception from Checkin until 90 days following Discharge. Male subjects must also be willing to refrain from donating sperm from Checkin until 90 days following Discharge; 9. able to comprehend and willing to sign an informed consent form (ICF); 10. a minimum of 1 to 2 bowel movements per day. 1. significant history or clinical manifestation of any metabolic, allergic, infectious, dermatological, hepatic, renal, hematological, pulmonary, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, neurological, or psychiatric disorder (as determined by the Investigator [or designee]) prior to Checkin. 2. history of significant hypersensitivity, intolerance, or allergy to any drug compound, food, or other substance, unless approved by the Investigator (or designee) prior to Checkin; 3. history of stomach or intestinal surgery or resection that could alter absorption or excretion of orally administered drugs prior to Checkin, except that cholecystectomy, appendectomy, and hernia repair will be allowed if it was not associated with complications; 4. history or presence of an abnormal ECG that, in the Investigator's (or designee's) opinion, is clinically significant at Screening or Checkin; 5. history of orthostatic hypotension with or without syncope; 6. a sustained seated systolic blood pressure &gt;150 mmHg or &lt;90 mmHg or a diastolic blood pressure &gt;90 mmHg or &lt;50 mmHg at Screening or Check in. Blood pressure may be retested twice at intervals of 5 minutes. The out of range blood pressure values will be considered sustained if either the systolic or diastolic blood pressures are outside the stated limits after these 3 assessments; 7. history of alcoholism or drug addiction within 1 year prior to Checkin; 8. use of any tobacco or nicotinecontaining products (including but not limited to cigarettes, ecigarettes, pipes, cigars, chewing tobacco, nicotine patches, nicotine lozenges, or nicotine gum) within 6 months prior to Checkin, or positive cotinine screen at Screening or Checkin; 9. participation in more than 1 other radiolabeled investigational study drug trial within 12 months prior to Checkin. The previous radiolabeled study drug must have been received more than 6 months prior to Checkin for this study and the total exposure from this study and the previous study will be within the recommended levels considered safe, per United States (US) Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 361.1 (e.g., less than 5,000 mrem whole body annual exposure); 10. exposure to significant radiation (e.g., serial xray or computed tomography scans, barium meal, current employment in a job requiring radiation exposure monitoring) within 12 months prior to Checkin; 11. participation in any other investigational study drug trial in which receipt of an investigational study drug occurred within 5 halflives (if known) or 30 days prior to Checkin, whichever is longer; 12. use of any prescription medications/products within 14 days prior to Checkin, unless deemed acceptable by the Investigator (or designee); 13. use of any overthecounter, nonprescription preparations (including vitamins, minerals, and phytotherapeutic/herbal/plantderived preparations) within 7 days prior to Checkin, unless deemed acceptable by the Investigator (or designee); 14. poor peripheral venous access prior to Checkin; 15. donation of whole blood from 56 days prior to Screening through Discharge, inclusive, or of plasma from 30 days prior to Screening through Discharge, inclusive; 16. receipt of blood products within 2 months prior to Checkin; 17. subject is at imminent risk of suicide (positive response to question 4 or 5 on the baseline CSSRS) or had a suicide attempt within 6 months prior to the Screening visit; 18. any acute or chronic condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator (or designee), would limit the subject's ability to complete or participate in this clinical study; 19. any other unspecified reason that, in the opinion of the Investigator (or designee) or Sponsor, makes the subject unsuitable for enrollment.</criteria>
