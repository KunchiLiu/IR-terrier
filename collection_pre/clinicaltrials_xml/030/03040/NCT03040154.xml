	<detailed_description>Data will be obtained using pre and post surveys with self-report instruments and enrollment logs. It is hypothesized that 1) Parents and grandparents in the Intervention Arm will demonstrate greater behavioral outcomes (intention to enroll, actual enrollment, and participation in parenting intervention sessions) than those in the Control Arm. 2) Parents and grandparents in the Intervention Arm will show greater improvements from baseline in parent determinants (knowledge, beliefs, attitudes, benefits, and barriers) compared to the Control Arm. 3) Parents' intention to enroll, actual enrollment, and participation in IY will be predicted by the study arm and parent determinants. This study is expected to have an important impact on the uptake of evidence-based parenting interventions among hard-to-reach populations and holds the promise of eliminating disparities in behavioral health outcomes in this understudied and growing minority population.</detailed_description>
