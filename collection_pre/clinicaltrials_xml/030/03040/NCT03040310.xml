	<brief_summary>The prevalence and disability associated with discogenic low back pain are significant, and there is a general lack of widely accepted conservative treatments for the condition. A majority of previous studies that have assessed the efficacy of self-directed exercise-based rehabilitation programs did not include comprehensive metrics to confirm whether participants actually participated in the exercises prescribed. In this pilot study, the investigators hope to determine whether proxies of compliance with a daily, self-directed rehabilitation program for discogenic low back pain are correlated with participant-reported improvements in pain and function. The feasibility of a mobile interface designed to help patients with chronic low back pain track the daily management of their conditions will also be evaluated.</brief_summary>
