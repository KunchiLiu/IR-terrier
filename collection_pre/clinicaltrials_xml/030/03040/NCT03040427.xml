	<brief_title>The Role of F-18 Florbetapir in the Early Detection of Cardiac Amyloidosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>F-18 florbetapir is currently used for the early detection of brain amyloid (Alzheimer's disease). The hypothesis is that F-18 florbetapir will detect amyloid deposition in myocardium prior to current non-invasive diagnostic measures, particular electrocardiography with strain and technetium pyrophosphate scintigraphy. The investigators intend to use F-18 florbetapir and assess its correlation between standard non-invasive diagnostic modalities.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Patients with extracardiac biopsy proven TTR amyloidosis (i.e. in the carpal tunnel) who have undergone TcPYP scintigraphy within the past 90 days. 2. Patients with light chain MGUS with a light chain ratio of &gt;5 or free light chain difference of &gt;50 who have an abnormal NTproBNP &gt;125 or a detectable troponin T. 1. Contraindication to the tracer or its component. 2. Refusal to participate in the study.</criteria>
