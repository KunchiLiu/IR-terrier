	<detailed_description>This is a phase I clinical trial using a Simon-two stage design to establish the safety of radiotherapy in the treatment of advanced hidradenitis suppurativa (HS). In the first six months, 6 patients will be enrolled, if the patients in the study do not meet the termination criteria, then the study will extend to a second stage. A maximum of 20 patients will be enrolled. Patients will be treated with skin-directed radiotherapy, using a total prescription dose of 7.5 Gy in five fractions of 1.5 Gy over one week. Patients will then be seen in the HS specialty clinic at Montefiore Medial Center for at least three months. Quality of life changes, immunohistochemical changes, and cutaneous discharge will also be evaluated during the study period.</detailed_description>
