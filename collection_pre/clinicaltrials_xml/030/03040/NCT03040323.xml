	<brief_title>Prospective Analysis of Value of Contrast-enhanced Sonography During Biopsies of Focal Liver Masses</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>As a major oncology and hepatology center, we perform about 3-5 guided biopsies for liver tumors weekly. Ultrasound is the preferred modality for imaging biopsies due to its ability to visualize and position the biopsy needle in real time with high accuracy and safety, is nonionizing, and is quicker compared to other techniques, especially CT-guided biopsies. The failure rate of ultrasound guided liver biopsies (including cases where biopsy was declined to be performed due to lack of lesion visibility) is about 10%. By comparison, in our practice genotyping of metastatic tumors, with multiple core biopsies, is often requested for entry into oncology trials, and failure of tumor genotyping after biopsy is estimated to be about 30%. Recently, the first ultrasound contrast agent was FDA-approved for characterization of liver lesions [sulfur hexafluoride lipid-type A microspheres (Lumason, Bracco Diagnostics, Monroe Township, NJ)]. The microbubble agent is deemed safe, including in cardiac failure patients and those with chronic airway obstruction. Injecting microbubbles may allow better visualization of lesions and adjacent vasculature by enhancing the microvasculature and adjacent vessels and potentially reduce incidence of failed biopsy or bleeding complications. In addition, determination of necrotic regions in a lesion may allow better direction of biopsy. Yet there is limited literature on the use of ultrasound contrast agents for improving targeted liver biopsies. We intend to prospectively assess the non-diagnostic biopsy and complication rates in a group of patients who undergo contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) using microbubbles at the time of biopsy. We will then compare the results from this group with the failure and complication rate from a control group of patients undergoing the standard US-guided biopsy procedure. Over 12 months we expect to perform approximately 200 biopsies. Power analysis suggests that 125 patients in both contrast-enhanced sonography and control groups, each, are required. We should be able to enroll sufficient patients in 18 months</detailed_description>
