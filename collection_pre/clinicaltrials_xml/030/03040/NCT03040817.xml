	<brief_summary>Diabetic gastroparesis, postsurgical gastroparesis, idiopathic gastroparesis and primary pyloric stenosis are debilitating gastrointestinal motility disorder. However, there is limited medical therapeutic options for these diseases. Gastric peroral endoscopic pyloromyotomy (G-POEM) is an emerging novel endoscopic technique which is reported as a minimally invasive therapy. But so far, the efficacy and safety of G-POEM on these diseases are rarely explored. So, there is a cooperative group composed of five clinical centers for clinical research in G-POEM.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cooperative Group for Clinical Research in G-POEM (POP), Jiangsu, China</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants are randomly devided into 'G-POEM group' and 'Esomeprazole+Mosapride group'. In G-POEM group, each participant receives G-POEM treatment. In Esomeprazole+Mosapride group, each participant receives Nexium 40mg bid + Mosapride Citrate Tablets 5mg tid. The whole outcome measure time fram is up to two years. Outcome evaluations include: gastric emptying imaging, gastric antrum volume, gastric emptying time, gastroparesis cardinal symptoms index and gastroesophageal reflux disease questionnaire. All the outcomes are assessed at different time points (from baseline to 6 months, 12months and 24months).</detailed_description>
