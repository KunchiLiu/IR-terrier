	<detailed_description>Surgical site infections (SSI) in orthopedic surgery are responsible for reduced quality of life, increased length of hospital stay and costs. The most commonly identified organism is Staphylococcus aureus but risk factors for mono microbial S.aureus SSI are not well-known.The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence rate trend of S. aureus SSI over the years and risk factors of theses infections in a french University Hospital. The knowledge obtained by this study will enable identification of the surgical patients most at risk of developping S. aureus SSI, and who would probably benefit most from new interventions given prophylactically and specifically to prevent S. aureus infections.</detailed_description>
