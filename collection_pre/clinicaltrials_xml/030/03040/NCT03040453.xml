	<brief_summary>Local ablative treatment of Hepatocellular Carcinoma is performed primary on patients not eligible for liver transplant or liver resection. At our Hospital two different methods are used: Microwave ablation, where the tumor cells are heated up and killed, and Irreversible electroporation, where the tumor cells are exposed to an electrical field and nano-pores are formed in the cell membranes and the cells go into apoptosis (programed cell death). Previous studies have shown effects on the immune system after ablative therapies. The purpose of this study is to compare the immunological response after the wo different methods of killing the tumor cells.</brief_summary>
