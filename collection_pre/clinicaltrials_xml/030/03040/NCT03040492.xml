	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to discover whether certain Vitamin D Receptor (VDR) gene polymorphisms are associated with an increased risk of cutaneous basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and/or cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in an Alabama population. Participant demographic information such as physical characteristics (e.g., ethnicity), family history, and cancer diagnosis will be collected in order to determine if there are relationships between the gene polymorphisms, cancer diagnosis, and these characteristics.</brief_summary>
