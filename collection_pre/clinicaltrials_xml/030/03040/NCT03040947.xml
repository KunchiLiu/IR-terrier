	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to develop imaging protocols when using cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) to assess cardiac functions, morphology and tissue characterization. The National Heart Research Institute Singapore (NHRIS) houses two dedicated CMR scanners to support the numerous investigator initiated projects in patients with various cardiac pathologists. By optimizing novel CMR sequences used in these studies, scanning time can be shortened for patients with underlying cardiac diseases.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CMR Sequence and Imaging Protocol Development</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In medical research, there is a continuous need to develop new imaging techniques such as cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging. This will allow us to visualize and study the function and structure of the heart in greater detail so as to improve the diagnosis and treatment of patients with various cardiac conditions. The aim of the study is to optimise new CMR sequences, allowing the development of imaging protocols in future research studies. This study will hence recruit 100 subjects for each of the following sub-studies: 1. Sub-study 1: Normal CMR protocols for assessment of cardiac function and morphology 2. Sub-study 2: Exercise stress protocols with a CMR-compatible supine bike. For the first sub-study, 50 healthy volunteers will be recruited. The testing and optimising of CMR sequence settings are crucial to ensure the accuracy and robustness of the scan before using these tests on patients with cardiac diseases. For the second sub-study, 50 healthy volunteers of different fitness levels will be recruited. An exercise stress protocol will then be developed for future studies in patients with suspected coronary artery diseases. For this protocol, participants will be asked to cycle on a supine exercise bike to assess the effects of exercise and free breathing on the stability of the CMR imaging sequences.</detailed_description>
