	<brief_summary>The study is a randomized controlled trial. Subjects are randomly assigned 1:1 to receive either rapid multiplex qPCR (intervention) prior to standard of care prostate biopsy or standard of care (control) prostate biopsy. The subjects will have a rectal culture swab performed prior to the prostate biopsy. One rectal culture swab will be used for rapid multiplex qPCR and the other swab will be sent to microbiology for a standard culture. The subjects randomized to the intervention group will have the qPCR results shared with the physician to determine if additional standard of care antibiotics are needed at time of standard of care prostate biopsy. The subjects randomized to the control group will not have the qPCR results shared with the physician to determine if additional standard of care antibiotics are needed at time of standard of care prostate biopsy. Approximately, 10 days after the prostate biopsy, the research staff will conduct a chart review and/or telephone call to ask about any prostate biopsy infections and complications.</brief_summary>
