	<brief_summary>The post-operative treatment of pediatric patients operated for the correction of flat foot, sees today the use of preformed leg-foot splint (Walker) as an alternative to the application of plaster casts. The change of the immobilization system has led to the appearance of problems of tolerability in particular in the skin. The problems persist also after placing a polyurethane foam dress at the heel in the immediate postoperative period. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a cotton sock applied inside the leg-foot splint in children operated vs the Elastic Compression Wraps in reducing the incidence of cutaneous lesions.</brief_summary>
