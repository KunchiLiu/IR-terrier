	<brief_title>Randomized Study of a Hospice Video Educational Tool for Patients With Advanced Cancer and Their Caregivers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this research study is to compare two ways to educate patients with cancer and their caregivers about hospice care services - a video educational tool or a verbal narrative. The study will assess the effect of these methods on patients' and caregivers' knowledge about hospice care, as well as their perceptions and preferences for this service. Using this research, the investigators hope to find out the best way to help patients and their loved ones better understand hospice care. The educational methods used in this study (the video educational tool or verbal narrative) are meant to serve as an introduction to hospice care. Further details about hospice should be discussed directly with your care team. This study will enroll 150 patients with advanced cancer and up to 150 of their caregivers in this randomized clinical trial. The study will use questionnaires to measure the participant and the caregivers' knowledge of hospice care, as well as your perceptions and preferences for these services. Study assessments will be completed before and after watching the video or hearing the verbal narrative in the hospital.</detailed_description>
