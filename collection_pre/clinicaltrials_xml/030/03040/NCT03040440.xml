	<brief_title>Comparison of the Cuff Pressure of TaperGuard and Cylindrical- Endotracheal Tube During Laparoscopic Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sixty four participants were assigned to one of the two groups: cylindrical and TaperGuard endotracheal tube. At the supine position, cuff pressure of endotracheal tube was measured before and after abdominal insufflation in the supine position. After insufflation the head-up position (30Â°) was made and cuff pressure was recorded.</detailed_description>
