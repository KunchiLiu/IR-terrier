	<brief_summary>The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if netupitant/palonosetron can help to decrease chronic nausea and vomiting in patients with cancer. The safety of the study drug will also be studied. Some participants will receive the study drug and some will receive a placebo. A placebo is not a drug. It looks like the study drug but is not designed to treat any disease or illness. It is designed to be compared with a study drug to learn if the study drug has any real effect.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Netupitant and Palonosetron (AKYNZEO) for Chronic Nausea and Vomiting in Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For all participants, if you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will complete questionnaires about the nausea/vomiting symptoms. These questionnaires should take about 20 minutes to complete. Study Drug Administration: If you are still eligible to take part in this study, you will be randomly assigned (as in the roll of dice) to 1 of 2 groups. This is done because no one knows if one study group is better, the same, or worse than the other group. You will have a 2 in 3 chance of being assigned to the netupitant/palonosetron group. You will take 1 capsule of netupitant/palonosetron/placebo by mouth on Days 1, 6, and 11. You will report the time you take these doses to the study staff. For the Day 1 dose, you will not know if you are receiving the study drug or the placebo. For the Days 6 and 11 doses, neither you nor the study staff will know if you are receiving the study drug or the placebo. However, if needed for your safety, the study staff will be able to find out what you are receiving. You will take the Day 1 dose in the clinic or at home. The Days 6 and 11 doses may be mailed to you separately and should not be taken until you have instructed to by the study staff. You will be given a patient diary to keep track of your daily nausea, vomiting, and rescue nausea medication on Days 1-15. You should complete it at the end of each day before you go to sleep. Length of Study: You may take the study drug/placebo until Day 11. You will no longer be able to take the study drug/placebo if intolerable side effects occur or if you are unable to follow study directions. Your participation on the study will be over after your last visit/call. There is also an optional 10-day extension described below. Study Visits/Calls: On Day 4 (+/- 1 day), the research staff will call you to ask about your level of nausea in the past 24 hours and your feeling of nausea and vomiting in the last 12 hours. This is information you would have recorded in your patient diary. This call should last about 10 minutes. On Day 10 (+/- 2 days), the research staff will call you to ask about your level of nausea and vomiting in the past 5 days, your symptoms in the past 24 hours, and any side effects from taking the study drug or placebo. This call should last about 15 minutes. On Day 15 (+/- 2 days), you will complete questionnaires about the nausea/vomiting symptoms, side effects, your opinion on whether you received the study drug or placebo, and your opinion about taking part in the study. These questionnaires should take about 20 minutes to complete. If you are unable to return to the clinic, the research staff will call you to ask you to answer these questions by phone. This is an investigational study. Netupitant/palonosetron is FDA approved and commercially available to help prevent short-term nausea and vomiting. Giving it to patients with chronic nausea and vomiting is investigational. The study doctor can explain how the study drug is designed to work. Up to 42 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>
