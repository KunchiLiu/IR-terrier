	<brief_summary>Adolescents and young adults with type 1 diabetes often have a difficult time achieving good glucose control which is so important in reducing the risk for diabetes complications. Despite the use of multiple daily injections or insulin pumps and glucose sensors there is still a need for many individuals to further improve glucose levels but do so without causing low blood glucose levels (hypoglycemia) or adding to the daily burden of living with diabetes. Today an insulin pump can receive glucose readings from a continuous glucose monitor and adjust the insulin delivery up or down in an attempt to keep glucose levels in a more optimal range. These systems are called hybrid closed loop meaning while much of the insulin delivery is automated the patient still interacts regularly with the system particularly to help determine the insulin dose to deliver to cover a meal. Results of early studies using hybrid closed loop systems in adolescents and adults with type 1 diabetes are very encouraging. This study will compare the FDA-approved hybrid closed loop system by Medtronic (670G) to a next-generation Medtronic system programmed to further improve glucose control, particularly around mealtime, which is currently one of the biggest challenges with all hybrid closed loop systems. One hundred adolescents and young adults (ages 14-30) will test each system for three months in a crossover fashion. The investigators will compare how effective each hybrid closed loop system is at preventing high blood glucose readings during day. The investigators will also evaluate the safety of each system and how participants adjust to the daily use of the technology.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Crossover Study Comparing Two Automated Insulin Delivery System Algorithms in Adolescents and Young Adults With Type 1 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Seven clinical sites (4 in the US and 3 in Europe) will enroll patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D), ages 14 to less than 30 years old, who have an HbA1c from 7-12% and are using multiple daily injections of insulin (with or without continuous glucose monitoring -CGM) or are using and insulin pump (with or without CGM). Participants may not be currently using the Medtronic 670G system. All patients will be assessed for their QOL and attitudes about the use diabetes management technology. - Patients glucose control on their current insulin treatment regimen will be assessed for 2 weeks using blinded CGM (CGM they cannot see the glucose reading on). - Then all participants will be started on the same insulin pump (Medtronic 670G) and the pump standard insulin delivery settings will be adjusted. - Next all participants will start an Enlite 3 continuous glucose sensor and be instructed on its use and further adjustments to the insulin pump settings will be made using this CGM information. The pump remains in the usual manual mode or open loop mode of operation at this time. - All patients will then be randomized to start hybrid closed loop therapy using one of two systems for 12 weeks. They will either use the 670G pump (which uses an algorithm called PID to adjust insulin delivery based on the Enlite 3 CGM data) in open loop or auto mode for 3 months or they will use a different Medtronic Pump very similar in nature the 670G but this has a slightly different algorithm called PID + Fuzzy Logic) to adjust insulin delivery based on the Enlite 3 CGM data in open loop or auto mode for 3 months. Glucose control, adjustment to the technology and the safety of the technology will all be carefully evaluated over this 3 month period with the participants at home, school or work undergoing their usual activities. They will have regular contact with the study team and will intermittently share their ongoing CGM glucose data with the study team at a clinic visit or by uploading their glucose and insulin data to the cloud so it can viewed in a secure fashion by the study team. - At the end of 3 months each participant will go back on the 670 G and the CGM system in manual mode or open loop for one month. This is called the washout period. - Then all participants will switch to or crossover to the hybrid closed system they were not on originally and use this new hybrid closed loop system in closed loop or auto mode for 3 months as above. - At the end of each 3 month period on either the 670G system using the PID algorithm or the new hybrid closed loop system using the PID + Fuzzy Logic algorithm participants will rate their QOL and their adjustment to and attitude toward the hybrid closed loop system they are using. - A careful analysis of the all measures of glucose control based on the CGM data for each 3 month period for each hybrid closed loop system will be collected and compared. In addition system safety data will be collected as will all medical events during the study. After each participant has completed 3 months on each hybrid closed loop system the investigators will be able to compare the effectiveness, safety and patient preference regarding each system.</detailed_description>
