	<brief_title>Effect Evaluation of The International Child Development Programme (ICDP)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The International Child Development Programme (ICDP) is a psychosocial preventive programme offered to parents and other caregivers. The programme aims to improve parenting practices and thereby child development and well-being. The ICDP is designed to influence and improve the quality of contact and relation between the caregivers, usually parents, and their children through the practical application of eight themes or guidelines for positive interaction. ICDP courses are implemented in a group format and include group discussions, caregiver assignments, and report back through a sequence of eight meetings. The caregiver groups are led by facilitators trained in the ICDP, and with the competence to lead such groups. The aim of this study is to evaluate if ICDP has an effect on caregiver's positive involvement and sensitivity to childrens emotions, and on parental self-efficacy. The study will also evaluate the effect of ICDP on caregiver-child relationships, and the children's development and well-being. The study will use a stratified cluster randomized control design, and will be implemented in regular clinical practice in Norway. More knowledge within this field is important for practitioners as well as policy makers in planning preventive interventions for caregivers ant their children.</detailed_description>
