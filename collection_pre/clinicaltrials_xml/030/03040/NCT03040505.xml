	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to investigate temporal organization of future thinking in patients with schizophrenia. Patients and control participants will be asked to envision and briefly describe ten personal future events using a cue-words list. Then they will be asked to describe everything that came to their minds (i.e. to think aloud) while they attempted to determine when an event will likely occur. The investigators will compare the proportion of several predefined strategies mentioned by the two groups of participants to locate future events in time. The investigators predict that patients will envision less personal future events and will rely to a lesser extent on strategies to locate events in time, than control participants.</brief_summary>
