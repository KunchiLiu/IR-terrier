	<brief_summary>This study is a prospective, multi-center, open-label, randomized controlled clinical trial,aims to assess the safety and effectiveness of the Firehawk™ sirolimus target-eluting coronary stent system with abluminal grooves containing a biodegradable polymer (Firehawk™) comparing the XIENCE everolimus-eluting coronary stent system in the treatment of subjects with total coronary occlusion lesion(s).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Firehawk™ Coronary Stent System in the Treatment of Total Coronary Artery Occlusion Lesion(s)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will recruit 196 subjects with total coronary occlusion lesion(s) in coronary arteries ≥2.25 mm to ≤4.0 mm in diameter and ≤100 mm in length (by visual estimate) in no more than 10 research centers in China. All participants met the inclusion criteria will be 1:1 randomized to receive Firehawk™ sirolimus target-eluting coronary stent or XIENCE everolimus-eluting coronary stent. Optical Coherent Tomography (OCT) sub study: the first 44 consecutive subjects who consented to participate in the OCT sub study will undergo OCT assessment at 3 months and 12 months post index procedure. The OCT sub study will be performed in 3-5 pre-selected sites. The clinical follow-up will be carried out at 30 days, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months,and 2-5 years post-index procedure.The primary endpoint is in-stent late lumen loss at 12 months post-index procedure.The secondary endpoint is neo-intimal thickness by Optical Coherent Tomography (OCT) at 3 months post-index procedure.</detailed_description>
