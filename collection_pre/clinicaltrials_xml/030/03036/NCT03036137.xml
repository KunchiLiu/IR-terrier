	<brief_summary>Relating the electroencephalogram findings of patients with tinnitus before and after a therapeutic modality is still scarce in the literature, especially with neuromodulatory methods, more specifically with Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation - tDCS. This study is a double blind, sham-controlled clinical trial aiming investigate the impact of tDCS on patterns of brain electrical activity in patients with chronic tinnitus. 36 volunteers with tinnitus will be allocated randomly in 2 groups: the first (n = 18) will receive anodic tDCS in the temporoparietal left area and cathode in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the second group (n = 18) correspond to the sham group. In addition, healthy individuals (n = 18) will be recruited for comparative purposes of brain electrical activity with and without tinnitus, totaling 54 participants. Patients with tinnitus will receive transcranial direct current stimulation for 20 minutes for 5 consecutive days (1 week) and will be assessed before and after intervention by electroencephalogram, Acuphenometry, Visual Analogue Scale - VAS and questionnaire Tinnitus Handicap Inventory- THI. Follow-up of volunteers will also be performed after 1 month of the end of treatment with tDCS.</brief_summary>
