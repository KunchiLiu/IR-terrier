	<brief_summary>This study evaluates the safety, feasibility and usability of a SaeboGlove rehabilitation device in the treatment of patients who have reduced ability to open their hand due to weakness after an acute stroke.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The SaeboGlove Evaluation Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The SaeboGlove is a new rehabilitation aid that can be used in people with hand weakness after a neurological injury. It assists the hand to open, which is crucial for people to grasp, and release everyday objects. It may improve function by doing this but may also help people with severe weakness take part more fully in therapy sessions. This glove is already marketed and is being used in some NHS sites. This trial will assess how it could be used in NHS practice in acute stroke patients and will develop a plan to implement this.</detailed_description>
