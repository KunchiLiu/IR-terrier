	<brief_title>Cognitive Function Before and After Opioid Reduction in Patients With Chronic Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The number of patients with chronic non-malignant pain is high and constant. An estimated 3-5% of the population use opioids daily. These patients have a lower quality of life and a higher use of healthcare services. This leads to enormous costs, both human and economic. Many patients lose their ability to work, not only because of the pain, but also because of their treatment. For a long period, opioids have been prescribed for chronic pain, even though the evidence is scarce. A rising conscience about opioid use is on the way, and now, there is a tendency to reduce, rather than increase opioids. The reasons are many: Constipation, inability to drive, a sense of drowsiness and no relief of pain, just to name a few. Furthermore, opioids may have decreased effect over time or may even lead to higher levels of pain. Many patients are at first reluctant to start the reduction programme. Mostly because the patients may not be aware of the effects, the drugs are having on them. Many patients value their opioid treatment as positive and necessary, in spite of the many adverse effects. The investigators wanted to test the cognitive function of patients before, during and after opioid reduction. The results can be used to help patients understand the deleterious effects of high opioid usage, and can also be used to motivate the individual patient along the way.</detailed_description>
