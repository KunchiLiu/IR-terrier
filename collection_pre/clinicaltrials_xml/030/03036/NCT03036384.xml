	<brief_summary>Hyperbaric bupivacaine 0.5% associated with opioids is the local anesthetic the most commonly used for spinal injection in cesarean section. Nevertheless, its use often results in a long duration of motor nerve block and a haemodynamical instability. Recently developped, the Prilocaine, with its new 2% hyperbaric formulation, seems to offer a good alternative for hyperbaric bupivicaine. A first study has determined the ED95 of hyperbaric prilocaine 2% for intrathecal anesthesia in scheduled cesarean delivery. As opioid adjuvants potentiate the effect of the local anesthetics while decreasing their dose-related side effects, the aim of this study is to determine the ED95 of hyperbaric prilocain 2% with sufentanyl for scheduled cesarean delivery under spinal anesthesia,by using the Continual Reassessment Method (CRM)</brief_summary>
