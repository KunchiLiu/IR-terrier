	<brief_summary>Nasal packing is frequently applied after nasal surgery. Nasal packing reduces epistaxis, prevents septal hematoma and stabilizes nasal septum. Nasal mucosa is quite sensitive to pain, therefore the most common problems after surgery are postoperative pain and anxiety during removal of the nasal packing. Lots of methods have been tried to control this pain (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, nerve blockade with long-acting local anesthetics, local anesthetics infiltration into nasal packing). Glucocorticoids have been used as an adjuvant in the management of acute postoperative pain. Perineural dexamethasone as an adjuvant for the single-injection nerve block can prolong analgesia and reduce opioid-requiring after surgery. Furthermore dexamethasone reduces postoperative nausea and vomiting incidance.</brief_summary>
