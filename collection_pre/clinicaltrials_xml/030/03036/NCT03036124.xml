	<brief_title>Study to Evaluate the Effect of Dapagliflozin on the Incidence of Worsening Heart Failure or Cardiovascular Death in Patients With Chronic Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an international, multicentre, parallel group, event-driven, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in patients with chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), evaluating the effect of dapagliflozin versus placebo, given once daily in addition to background regional standard of care therapy, for the prevention of cardiovascular (CV) death or reduction of heart failure (HF) events.</detailed_description>
