	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to find out what a new amino acid-based PET agent, fluciclovine (18F), can tell us about breast cancer biology (how it grows and develops), and quantify the differences in fluciclovine (18F) uptake between breast cancer subtypes. This will inform further work to investigate its use in breast cancer management.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Biopsy proven, clinically palpable breast cancer (invasive ductal or ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)) measuring â‰¥ 2cm scheduled to be treated by primary surgical resection Tumour size should be based on the longest diameter measured on ultrasound, mammogram or MRI performed within 2 months prior to enrolment. 2. No prior treatment for breast cancer. 3. Female, Age &gt;= 50 years. 4. The patient has reached menopause, defined in this age group as amenorrhoea for at least 12 months. 5. The patient is willing and able to comply with the protocol scheduled visits and examinations for the duration of the study. 6. Written (signed and dated) informed consent. 1. Major surgery or significant traumatic injury within four weeks prior to enrolment. 2. Treatment with any other investigational agent, or participation in another interventional clinical study within 4 weeks prior to enrolment. 3. Multifocal and/or bilateral breast cancer 4. Known hypersensitivity to fluciclovine (18F) or any of its constituents. 5. Other psychological, social or medical condition, physical examination finding or a laboratory abnormality that the Investigator considers would make the patient a poor study candidate or could interfere with protocol compliance or the interpretation of study results. 6. Any other active or previous malignancy.</criteria>
