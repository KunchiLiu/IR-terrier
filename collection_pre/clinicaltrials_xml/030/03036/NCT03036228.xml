	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to determine safety and tolerability of Karonudib for the treatment of cancer. Secondary objectives are to determine a recommended RP2D and schedule for further development of Karonudib, to determine the pharmacokinetics of Karonudib, to look for evidence of treatment efficacy. Overall survival will also be recorded.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Written informed consent. 2. Age at least 18 years (there is no upper age limit but patients must be judged to have a "biologic" age of 75 years or less). 3. Histological or cytological confirmation of cancer (imaging/AFP are sufficient for patients with HCC according to international standards). 4. The patient has received standard of care treatments and has progressive disease with only experimental therapies as further treatment options. 5. Life expectancy of at least 12 weeks (as per investigators clinical assessment). 6. ECOG PFS 0 or 1. 7. Patients must have measurable disease based on RECIST 1.1 criteria. 8. Adequate bone marrow, hepatic and renal function defined as: 1. Haemoglobin ≥ 100 g/L (blood transfusion not less than 21 days prior to screening). 2. Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1.5 x 109/L, platelets ≥100 x 109/L. 3. Total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x ULN (does not apply to patients with Gilberts Syndrome). 4. AST and ALT ≤ 1.5 x ULN (or ≤ 3 x ULN in the presence of liver metastases). 5. Serum creatinine not over ≤ ULN (if serum creatinine is between 1 and 1.5 x ULN, patients may be eligible provided that the calculated GFR is at least 50 ml/min using CockcroftGault method). 6. Albumin greater than or equal to 24 g/L. 9. Subject must be able to take oral medication. 10. Negative pregnancy test according to CTFG guidance 2014 for females of childproducing potential. 1. Age less than 18 years. 2. Less than 4 weeks since stopping previous systemic cancer treatment. 3. Less than 3 weeks since stopping palliative radiotherapy. 4. Less than 3 weeks after minor surgery. 5. Less than 6 months since a clinically significant cardiovascular event such as myocardial infarction, unstable angina, angioplasty, bypass surgery, stroke or TIA. 6. Congestive heart failure NYHA class ≥ II. 7. History of arrhythmias or arrhythmias discovered during the screening period (apart from atrial fibrillation without ventricular tachycardia and premature extra beats. 8. Patients requiring antiarrhythmic drugs. 9. QTc interval &gt;450 ms at baseline. 10. Use of fentanyl (must be stopped at least 1 week prior to initiation of Karonudib). 11. Use of antioxidants vitamins and acetylcysteine (must be stopped within 48 hours of starting treatment with Karonudib). 12. Use of antidepressant medications which are substrate for CYP2D6 (must be stopped at least 3 weeks prior to starting treatment with Karonudib). 13. Any severe acute or chronic medical condition that places the patient at increased risk or interferes with the interpretation of study results. 14. Leptomeningeal metastases (patient with previously treated brain metastases are eligible provided that there is no evidence of disease progression for a minimum of 8 weeks prior to inclusion in these cases a CNS MR is required within the screening period). 15. Known acute or chronic infection with hepatitis B or C. 16. Known HIV infection. 17. Pregnant or breastfeeding women. 18. Patients with reproductive potential not implementing accepted and effective means of contraception. 19. Participation in any other clinical trial within the previous 4 weeks. 20. Unable to comply with study procedures.</criteria>
