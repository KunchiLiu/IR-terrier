	<brief_summary>This clinical trial studies how well recombinant human papillomavirus nonavalent vaccine works in preventing human papillomavirus-related cancer in adult women after kidney transplant. Vaccines made from peptides of human papillomavirus may help the body build an effective immune response to kill tumor cells. Giving booster vaccinations may make a stronger immune response and prevent or delay the recurrence of cancer.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine-type-specific seroconversion rates at 12-months post-transplantation among female living donor kidney transplant recipients who receive &gt;= 1 doses of the recombinant human papillomavirus nonavalent vaccine (Gardasil 9 HPV vaccine) &gt;= 30 days prior to transplantation. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the following in female living donor kidney transplant recipients who receive &gt;= 1 doses of the Gardasil 9 HPV vaccine &gt;= 30 days prior to transplantation: HPV vaccine-type-specific seroconversion rates at 12-months post-transplantation stratified by: a) number of doses (1 versus [vs.] 2) of the vaccine given pre-transplant; b) time elapsed between last vaccine dose and the transplant procedure; c) variations in dosing and types of post-transplant immunosuppressant medications; and d) differences in human leukocyte antigen (HLA) histocompatibility between donor and recipient. II. To evaluate the following in female living donor kidney transplant recipients who receive &gt;= 1 doses of the Gardasil 9 HPV vaccine &gt;= 30 days prior to transplantation: persistence and stability of HPV vaccine-type-specific geometric mean titers (GMT) at 6 and 12-months post-transplantation, and rise in HPV vaccine-type-specific GMT at the 13-months posttransplantation visit (1-month after the third/booster vaccine dose). III. To evaluate the following in female living donor kidney transplant recipients who receive &gt;= 1 doses of the Gardasil 9 HPV vaccine &gt;= 30 days prior to transplantation: vaccine safety profile and allograft rejection/opportunistic infections stratified by number of vaccine doses and time between the last vaccine dose and the transplant procedure. IV. To evaluate the following in female living donor kidney transplant recipients who receive &gt;= 1 doses of the Gardasil 9 HPV vaccine &gt;= 30 days prior to transplantation: HPV detection in samples from the cervix/vagina, and oral cavity at baseline (pre-vaccination) and at 6- and 12-months post-vaccination, overall and by number of vaccine doses (1 vs. 2), sexual behavior, type-specific seroconversion rates, and time elapsed between the last vaccine dose and the transplant procedure. OUTLINE: Patients receive recombinant human papillomavirus nonavalent vaccine intramuscularly (IM) at baseline and approximately 30 days after first dose. Patients then receive a booster 12 months after kidney transplant.</detailed_description>
