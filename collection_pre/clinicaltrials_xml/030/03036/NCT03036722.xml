	<brief_summary>This proposed randomized double blinded, placebo-controlled, parallel trial; with two arms, in females aged 50-70 years, volunteers will be postmenopausal with a BMI between 25-35 kg/m2. This study aims to determine the benefits of phytoestrogen-rich flaxseeds on decreasing bone turnover in postmenopausal women aged over 50 years.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Flaxseed Consumption and Bone Metabolism in Postmenopausal Women.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Osteoporosis affects approximately 1 in 3 women over the age of 50 and accounts for more days spent in hospital than diabetes and breast cancer; amongst women of that age group (Cosman, De Beur et al. 2014). Aging, a sedentary lifestyle, a poor diet and smoking are all risk factors (Foundation 2003). A healthy diet (including food rich in calcium, vitamin D and phytoestrogens) may protect against osteoporosis and risk of fractures (Go, Tserendejid et al. 2014). Phytoestrogens in the diet are of putative benefit through and post the menopause (Mei, Yeung et al. 2001). The term phytoestrogens describes a wide variety of plant food derived chemicals having a structure similar to estradiol (oestrogen). The three main classes of phytoestrogens are the isoflavones, the lignans and coumestans. Oil seeds are a good source of lignans, with flaxseeds being particularly rich. (Weaver and Cheong 2005). Flaxseeds consumption has previously been associated with changes in bone turnover markers in postmenopausal women ( Hutchins, Martini et al. 2001). This study therefore is designed to test the hypothesis that consumption of a quantity of flaxseeds achievable in an individual's habitual diet (40g) will induce improvements in bone turnover markers, mediated through the increased circulation of phytoestrogens, in postmenopausal women. . The study arms are i) A placebo control arm, volunteers consume a placebo 40g porridge (matched for fibre and fat with the flaxseed product) every day over 12 weeks, or ii) 40g of flaxseeds added to 40g porridge daily over a 12 week study period. Adherence to the intervention will be assessed via analysis of concentrations of the mammalian lignans enterolactone and enterodiol in urine. The primary outcome for the study will be changes in markers of bone health. The secondary outcomes for the study will be changes in urinary and plasma androgens. Volunteers will need to attend the Hugh Sinclair Unit of Human Nutrition clinical unit on four occasions to facilitate screening and the study visit. Volunteers will be required to provide a fasting blood (30ml; 2 tablespoons); 24 hr urine (started the day prior to each study visit) and faecal samples at all 3 study visits (baseline, weeks 6 and 12). As vitamin D status and bone turnover markers are related to bone health, the volunteers will be given the opportunity to undergo an additional measurement of total body composition using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) at baseline and week 12.</detailed_description>
