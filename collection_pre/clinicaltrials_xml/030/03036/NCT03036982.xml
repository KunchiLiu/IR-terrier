	<brief_title>Remote Use of the Asthma Control Test (ACT) to Improve Care of Children With Asthma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Asthma is the most prevalent chronic disease of childhood with an overall prevalence of 10%. While effective therapies exist to control symptoms and prevent exacerbations, many asthma patients experience significant morbidity including limitations on daily activities as well as asthma exacerbations that lead to missed school (and work for care givers) and necessitate emergency department visits and hospitalizations. Among children from lower socioeconomic statues and in black and Hispanic families, asthma incidence and severity are even greater. Reasons for this disparity included decreased access to effective asthma care, increased exposure to tobacco smoke and environmental allergens, and underutilization of controller medicines. These groups have significantly increased resource utilization due to emergency department visits and hospitalizations. Optimal care for asthma patients, especially those with at highest risk, will therefore require new strategies for evaluating ongoing control and providing direct feedback to patients. We propose to transform the way asthma care is provided through the use of an innovative patient centered technology -Trivox Asthma ‚Äê to improve quality of care and outcomes for asthma patients while reducing the cost of care. Specifically we will extend Trivox Health to facilitate closer monitoring of patients with asthma through the existing web platform and a new mobile interface. This will allow asthma patients, their parents and school nurses to remotely input data on asthma control through smartphones and/or tablets. We will use the ACT+, an expansion of a validated measure currently utilized in both primary care and specialty clinics, to measure both asthma control and risk. Effectiveness of this intervention will be measured by examining resource utilization and ongoing asthma control.</detailed_description>
