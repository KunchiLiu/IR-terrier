	<brief_title>Exercise Training and Metabolic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Besides the traditional metabolic syndrome risk factors (dyslipidemia, raised blood pressure, central obesity and dysglycemia) subclinical disorders related to chronic inflammation and cell damage have been reported on metabolic syndrome. Therefore, regarding the systemic feature of metabolic syndrome, we investigated an new approach of aerobic interval training on several clinical biomarkers widely used. Such training used differs from current aerobic protocols in order to attenuate metabolic and musculoskeletal overload on untrained and unhealthy subjects.</detailed_description>
