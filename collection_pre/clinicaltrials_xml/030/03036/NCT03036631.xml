	<brief_summary>The Ideal Sedation for Stroke Thrombectomy (ISST) registry will answer the key questions whether sedation with intubation and paralytics is feasible and whether it delays the time to recanalization in comparison with conscious sedation alone. As a pilot registry, it is anticipated to enroll 40 acute stroke patients requiring mechanical thrombectomy over 12-18 months. Following enrollment, data will be collected prospectively from medical records and from patients' visits.</brief_summary>
