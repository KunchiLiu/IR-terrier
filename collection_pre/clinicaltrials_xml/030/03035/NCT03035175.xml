	<brief_title>Using Video Laryngoscopy for Neonatal Intubation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To evaluate whether residents who receive guidance from a supervisor concurrently viewing the neonate's airway via video laryngoscopy will have a higher rate of successful neonatal intubations than residents receiving guidance using traditional direct laryngoscopy. The investigators conducted a randomized controlled trial involving 48 first and second year pediatric and medicine-pediatric residents who received either video-facilitated (VDL) or traditional (TDL) supervisor guidance during direct laryngoscopy. Residents attempted intubations in the neonatal intensive care unit according to their randomization group. The primary outcome was a successful intubation that occurred within two attempts.</detailed_description>
