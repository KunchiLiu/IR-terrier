	<brief_summary>The goal of this clinical protocol is to perform a randomized crossover study to determine the energy cost of holding the MedGem® device above a person's normal resting metabolic rate (RMR) compared to not holding the MedGem® device.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Energy Cost for Holding a MedGem® Indirect Calorimeter</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Forty (40) subjects will be randomized to two (2) RMR measurements separated by a 40-minute rest (washout) period. The two RMR evaluation periods are as follows: 1. RMR with MedGem® Indirect Calorimeter 2. RMR without MedGem® Indirect Calorimeter Study recruitment will be performed at PBRC. Screening, consenting, and all study procedures will be performed within a single study visit at PBRC within the Inpatient Unit. All subjects will be introduced to the ventilated hood to determine presence of claustrophobia prior to enrollment (i.e., signing of the consent form).</detailed_description>
