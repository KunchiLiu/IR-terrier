	<brief_summary>Dyspnea is a common complaint in obese patients. The mechanisms behind this dyspnea and the effects of weight loss on dyspnea are not completely understood. The objectives of this study were to examine the relationships between exercise parameters and dyspnea in obesity and assess the effects of weight loss. The investigators compared pulmonary function, exercise performance and dyspnea in 34 patients with abdominal obesity and metabolic syndrome (MS) against 34 age and sex-matched controls. The study also assessed within-group changes in physiology and symptoms in a subset of patients following participation in a weight management program. Because obesity is a heterogeneous condition, with variable genetic associations, co-morbidities and distributions of adipose tissue, the study focused on patients with abdominal obesity who met diagnostic criteria for metabolic syndrome.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Exercise Capacity and Dyspnea in Obese Patients With Metabolic Syndrome: Effects of Weight Loss</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study has two parts: first, the investigators compared dyspnea, pulmonary function and exercise measurements between obese patients and control subjects with normal weight; then, the investigators assessed the effects of medical weight loss in the obese group on these parameters. Baseline dyspnea was assessed using the baseline dyspnea index.The effect of weight loss on dyspnea was assessed using the transitional dyspnea index. The main physiologic measurement of interest was the inspiratory capacity (L, measured at rest and during exercise).</detailed_description>
