	<brief_summary>Thyroidectomy for large thyroid tumor poses a problem of cosmetics, especially in terms of wide post-operative scar and prominent neck wrinkles. In this manuscript, we performed purse-string suture for the first time for the closure of skin defect after thyroidectomy of large thyroid tumors which resulted in better cosmetics as compared to the conventional suturing method.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Purse String Suture for the Closure of Large Thyroidectomy Resulted in Better Cosmetics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Increasing demand for better cosmetics following thyroidectomy for large thyroid tumor of &gt; 6 cm diameter created a necessity to find an alternative to the conventional technique (CT), which could be addressed by purse string technique (PST). A non-randomized controlled trial was conducted to new thyroid tumor patients at Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital (RSCM) from October 2013 until December 2014. Thirty patients grouped into two intervention arms of thyroidectomy with PST and CT were assessed for post-operative scar outcomes.</detailed_description>
