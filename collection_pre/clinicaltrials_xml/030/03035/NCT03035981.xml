	<brief_summary>Glycemic carbohydrates are associated with metabolic disturbances, such as type II diabetes, due to rapid digestion of starch into glucose. The specific properties of starch within these foods has been studied for the purpose of slowing their digestion rate and improving related physiological outcomes, such as gastric emptying rate. The current study investigated the relationship among starch digestion, gastric emptying rate and satiety in white and brown rice.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gastric Emptying of Rice With Different Starch Properties</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Studies have indicated that starch-based foods with somewhat high amylose content have slower in vitro starch digestion rates, which relate to a low glycemic response. Low glycemic response is associated with delayed gastric emptying rate as well. Therefore, we hypothesized that rice with a slow starch digesting property would delay gastric emptying. White and brown rice with varying amylose contents were used in this study. A 13C-labeled octanoic acid breath test method was used to measure gastric emptying rate, and questionnaires were used to assess hunger and fullness during the testing sessions. Twelve healthy volunteers were recruited to participate in a crossover design study with six rice treatments and outcome measurements were gastric emptying and satiety assessments. One fermentable carbohydrate (fructooligosaccharide, FOS) solution was used to validate the production of breath hydrogen.</detailed_description>
