	<brief_summary>This clinical trial studies how well a long-term follow-up works in patients with prostate cancer after surgery. Long-term follow-up data may serve as a resource to help ask clinical questions, describe health-related quality of life and long-term complications related, and facilitate future studies focusing on interventions to improve health status and health-related quality of life in prostate cancer survivors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Long-Term Follow-Up in Patients With Prostate Cancer After Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To provide comprehensive long-term follow-up care to prostate cancer survivors at the City of Hope who underwent definitive surgical therapy. II. To use the information obtained from follow-up of prostate cancer survivors who underwent definitive surgical therapy to serve as a resource that will help answer clinical questions, generate and test hypotheses, describe the incidence of long-term complications, and facilitate future studies focusing on interventions for long-term complications of prostate cancer and its therapy. III. To use the information gained from follow-up of prostate cancer survivors who underwent definitive surgical therapy to describe health-related quality of life (HRQL) concerns and to serve as a resource to facilitate future studies focusing on interventions to improve health status and HRQL in prostate cancer survivors. OUTLINE: Patients undergo long-term follow-up and receive a written survivorship care plan including comprehensive health evaluation and health education beginning 1 year post surgery.</detailed_description>
