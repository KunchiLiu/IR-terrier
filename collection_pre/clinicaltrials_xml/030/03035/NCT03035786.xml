	<brief_summary>This is a survey of airway codes, which are emergency mobile phone requests for anaesthetic help to manage acute airway crises in the hospital (out of theatre, out of Surgical Intensive Care Unit, SICU). The anaesthetists are doctors trained in advance airway management. Patients in the hospital may suffer airway crises e.g. airway obstruction or need for tracheal intubation (insertion of breathing tube) for various reasons. The on call SICU anaesthetists responds to the airway code by attending the patient in need and managing the patient at their own discretion. Airway management will depend on the anaesthetist's knowledge, skills and experience. it will also depend on the available airway equipment. We plan to evaluate airway codes for a 24 month period. Parameters include: type of incident; patient factors (including airway assessment); type of equipment used; anaesthetic drugs used; airway management chosen by the attending anaesthetist; and, airway complications.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Airway Code Calls - Survey of Management</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Airway codes will be managed as standard care. These calls are taken and managed by anaesthetists on call on SICU. The audit form is filled in by the on call anaesthetist after the airway code has been managed. This is an audit looking at: Primary outcome â€¢Evaluate the type of airway codes that the SICU anaesthetist is called for Secondary outcomes: - Patient factors (including airway assessment) - Type of equipment used - Type of anaesthetic drugs used - Airway management chosen by the attending anaesthetist - Airway complications.</detailed_description>
