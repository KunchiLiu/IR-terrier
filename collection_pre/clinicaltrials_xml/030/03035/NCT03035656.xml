	<brief_summary>The following is a double blinded, randomized controlled clinical trial to test the hypothesis that a single epidural injection of Ropivaciane® intra operatively will:1) Single intra-operative epidural injection of Ropivaciane® will result in decreased postoperative pain and opioid use in both minimally invasive (MIS) and open lumbar fusion patients; 2) Decreased postoperative pain will lead to improved clinical outcomes; and 3) Elucidate if there are differences in pain management between MIS and open surgical procedures. The proposed study will add novel information to current knowledge by 1) exploring of the effects of intra-operative single epidural injection analgesic on patients receiving MIS compared to open surgery, and 2) investigate potential immediate and short-term functional improvements gained from intra-operative single injection of Ropivaciane®.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This double blinded, randomized clinical trial will test hypotheses by administering a single epidural injection prior to wound closure of either Ropivaciane® or saline. All pre-surgical activities and anesthesia will proceed as usual, with the addition of a single epidural injection immediately prior to wound closure at the operated spine level. Experimental groups will receive 0.1% Ropivaciane® (10 ml; dose shown to be effective without transient weakness), 9 and the control group will receive 0.9% saline solution (10 ml). Accurate placement into the space will be verified by the injection of contrast medium (iohexol, 180 mgl/ml) under fluoroscopic guidance. Epidural solutions will be prepared prior to surgery by pharmacy and coded; surgeons will administer according to the patient's code maintaining the double-blind procedure. It is important to note that treatment as usual differs between open and MIS cohorts. The question of interest is whether the addition of the epidural analgesic to current practices for each surgery type results in increased positive outcomes, whether this is due to synergistic effects or not.</detailed_description>
