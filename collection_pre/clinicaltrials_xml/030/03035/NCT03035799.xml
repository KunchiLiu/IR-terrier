	<brief_title>Comparing Two Types of Diets on Psychological and Gastrointestinal Symptoms</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In the proposed study, the primary hypothesis is that, compared with a customary diet, consumption of a paleo-diet will improve psychological and gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with irritable bowel syndrome. Investigators also hypothesize consumption of the Paleolithic diet will result in decreased intestinal permeability, decreased inflammatory markers, and changes in the gut microbiome and microbiologic profiles.</detailed_description>
