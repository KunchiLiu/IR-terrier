	<brief_summary>Several studies have demonstrated that D2 treatment is associated with a decrease in 25(OH)D3 level and therefore have proposed that D3 would be preferable in term of raising total 25(OH)D level. The investigators postulate that the D2 treatment-associated decrease in 25(OH)D3 level may be related to an increase in total 25(OH)D level rather than being specific to D2 treatment, and thus there would be a D3 treatment-associated decrease in 25(OH)D2 level. The investigators plan to conduct a double-blind placebo-controlled trial to examine the effect of D3 treatment on 25(OH)D2 level and the effect of D2 treatment on 25(OH)D3 leve</brief_summary>
