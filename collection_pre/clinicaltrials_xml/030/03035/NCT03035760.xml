	<brief_summary>This Phase I study is an open label multiple ascending dose evaluation of the safety and PK of oxfendazole given orally daily to healthy adult men and nonpregnant women aged 18-45 followed by a single dose cross over trial evaluating the safety and pharmacokinetics of a single dose of oxfendazole given following an 8 hour fast or following a high fat meal. The study duration will be approximately 12 months with each subject participation lasting approximately 6 weeks. In the first phase of this study, between 8 and 24 subjects will be enrolled; each dose group will be comprised of 8 volunteers. To enhance safety, one sentinel subject will be dosed for five days and monitored for 7 days from the time of the first dose for predefined adverse events. If there are no predefined safety events, a second sentinel subject will be enrolled and followed for a total of 7 days. If there are no predefined safety signals identified for either of these two sentinel subjects, the remaining subjects in the group will be enrolled. After all eight subjects have completed the 10 day follow up period, a safety review of the electronic data will be performed. If none of the predefined safety events have occurred DMID will approve enrollment into the second dose group and will be monitored for a total of 7 days each for predefined adverse events prior to enrolling the remaining subjects in the group. After the 10 day follow up period has been completed for group 2, a safety review will be completed and if no predefined events have occurred two sequential subjects will be enrolled into the third dose group and will be monitored for a total of 7 days each for predefined safety events prior to enrolling the remaining subjects in the group. In the second phase of the study evaluating the effects of food on drug absorption, 12 subjects will be enrolled into the single dose cross over study where half of the subjects will initially receive a single dose of oxfendazole following an 8 hour fast and the other half will receive a single dose of oxfendazole following a high fat meal. Subjects will then cross over to receive a single dose following a high fat breakfast or fasting period. All subjects will have received a dose of oxfendazole following both a fasting period and a meal. The primary objectives are: 1) To assess the safety of oxfendazole administered daily for five days; and 2) To assess the safety of oxfendazole administered as a single dose with or without food.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Multiple Ascending Dose Study of Oxfendazole in Healthy Adult Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase I study is an open label multiple ascending dose evaluation of the safety and PK of oxfendazole (3, 7.5, or 15 mg/kg) given orally daily to healthy adult men and nonpregnant women aged 18-45 followed by a single dose cross over trial evaluating the safety and pharmacokinetics of a single dose of oxfendazole (3 mg/kg) given following an 8 hour fast or following a high fat meal. The study duration will be approximately 12 months with each subject participation lasting approximately 6 weeks. In the first phase of this Phase I study, between 8 and 24 subjects will be enrolled; each dose group will be comprised of eight volunteers. . To enhance safety, one sentinel subject will be dosed for five days and monitored for 7 days from the time of the first dose for predefined adverse events. If there are no predefined safety events, a second sentinel subject will be enrolled and followed for a total of 7 days. If there are no predefined safety signals identified for either of these two sentinel subjects, the remaining subjects in the group will be enrolled. After all eight subjects have completed the 10 day follow up period, an electronic safety review of the electronic data will be performed. If none of the predefined safety events have occurred DMID will approve enrollment into the second dose group (7.5 mg/kg oxfendazole daily x 5 days) and will be monitored for a total of 7 days each for predefined adverse events prior to enrolling the remaining subjects in the group. After the 10 day follow up period has been completed for group 2, an electronic safety review will be completed and if no predefined events have occurred two sequential subjects (one at a time with 7 days between each subject) will be enrolled into the third dose group (15 mg/kg oxfendazole daily x 5 days) and will be monitored for a total of 7 days each for predefined safety events prior to enrolling the remaining subjects in the group. In the second phase of the study evaluating the effects of food on drug absorption, 12 subjects will be enrolled into the single dose cross over study where half of the subjects will initially receive a single dose of 3 mg/kg of oxfendazole following an 8 hour fast and the other half will receive a single dose of 3 mg/kg of oxfendazole following a high fat meal. Subjects will then cross over to receive a single dose following a high fat breakfast or fasting period (water is permitted). All subjects will have received a dose of oxfendazole following both a fasting period and a meal. The primary objectives are: 1) To assess the safety of oxfendazole administered daily for five days; and 2) To assess the safety of oxfendazole administered as a single dose with or without food. The secondary objectives are: 1) To define the multi-dose kinetics of oxfendazole; and 2) To determine the effect of food on the kinetics of oxfendazole.</detailed_description>
