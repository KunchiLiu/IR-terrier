	<brief_summary>The study is a Phase I, first in human, monocenter study, aiming at assessing the safety and immunogenicity of a genetically detoxified pertussis toxin (PT) when administered via the cutaneous route with Viaskin patches to healthy volunteers at 2 different doses of 25 mcg or 50 mcg PT protein compared to Viaskin placebo. Two cohorts of 30 subjects will be successively enrolled. Safety of the product will be assessed throughout the 10-week study and its immunogenicity will be assessed at regular intervals with collection of blood samples for immunological analyses. Four weeks after the second Viaskin application (at Day 42 of the study), all subjects will receive a dose of diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccine (BoostrixÂ® dTpa) to ensure the optimal recall of their immunity against pertussis.</brief_summary>
