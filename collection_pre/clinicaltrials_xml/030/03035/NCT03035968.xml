	<brief_summary>Stroke is the major cause for permanent disability in adults. It is still unclear, which physiotherapeutic approaches are most effective. The Bobath-concept is one of the most widely used approaches in stroke rehabilitation within the western world, although several studies have failed to demonstrate superiority and showed partially even inferiority compared to other physiotherapy approaches. The Vojta therapy is based on a completely different approach - the reflex locomotion. However to date no study has been performed for stroke. We designed a randomized clinical trial (RCT) to compare Vojta and conventional physiotherapy in patients with acute ischemic (AIS) or hemorrhagic stroke (ICH). This RCT will be the first trial to investigate improvement of postural control due to Vojta therapy in early rehabilitation of stroke patients, which is a very new approach in stroke-rehabilitation.</brief_summary>
