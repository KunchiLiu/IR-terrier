	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to test the safety and efficacy of an experimental drug, OMP-305B83, when given in combination with FOLFIRI. OMP-305B83 is a humanized bispecific monoclonal antibody and was developed to target cancer stem cells. Based on preclinical studies, it is believed that OMP-305B83 may block the growth of cancer stem cells and may also impair the productive growth of new blood vessels, which tumors need to grow and spread. The study is sponsored by OncoMed Pharmaceuticals, which is referred to as OncoMed or the Sponsor.</brief_summary>
