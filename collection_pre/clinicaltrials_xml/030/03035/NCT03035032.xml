	<mesh_term>Leuprolide</mesh_term>
	<criteria>A patient for whom the physician has decided to initiate treatment with a Luteinizing Hormone Releasing Hormone (LHRH) agonist in standard clinical practice Biopsyproven prostate adenocarcinoma Locally advanced prostate cancer with biochemical relapse radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy. Hormonal treatmentnaive advanced or metastatic prostate cancer patient who has not received chemotherapy and has no plans to undergo treatment with chemotherapy at study entry. Patient who indicates that once the study is completed, he expects having access to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), either medical or surgical, within the local healthcare system (either through public/ private health insurance or out of pocket payment). Patient with castrate resistant prostate cancer Patient who previously underwent bilateral orchiectomy Patient who has received prior treatment with LHRH analogues Prior or concomitant treatment with systemic chemotherapy. A patient where there is a likelihood to receive systemic chemotherapy should not be enrolled Life expectancy of &lt; 1 year due to comorbidities Participation in another interventional clinical trial within one month prior to study entry or during the duration of the study Patient who plans to receive intermittent ADT at the time of study entry Patient receiving nonpalliative radiotherapy within 3 months prior to study entry Patient receiving adjuvant ADT in combination with definitive radiotherapy Patient with metastatic hormonal treatmentnaive prostate cancer, for whom chemohormonal treatment (combination of Docetaxel and ADT) is indicated. Patient with hypersensitivity to gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH), GnRH agonist analogs or any of the components of ELIGARD速 Patient with any contraindication for ELIGARD速 use based on local prescribing information</criteria>
