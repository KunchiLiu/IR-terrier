	<brief_title>Effects of Anamorelin on Cancer-Related-Fatigue</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Baseline Tests: If after the screening procedures and pregnancy test (if applicable) participant is found to be eligible to take part in this study, participant will be asked to: - Participant will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for cytokine testing. Cytokines are proteins that may affect the immune system. - Participant will complete 8 questionnaires about participant's symptoms, emotional and physical health, level of fatigue, appetite, and regular exercise habits. It should take about 40 minutes to complete all questionnaires. - Participant will meet with an exercise specialist to discuss participant's current strength and fitness level. - Participant will complete a 6-minute walk test where participant will be timed while participant walks a 100-foot loop as many times as participant can. - Participant will complete a chair-stand test where participant will sit in a chair and stand and sit down as many times as participant can in 30 seconds. - Participant will have participant's resting energy expenditure (REE) measured to see how much oxygen participant uses at rest. To measure participant's REE, participant will hold a device called a calorimeter and will breathe into the mouthpiece for 5 minutes. - Participant will have participant's body mass index (BMI) measured while participant stands on a scale and holds a device for about 20 seconds. - Participant will be taught how to do resistance exercises to complete at home. Study Drug Administration: Participant will take anamorelin by mouth 1 time each day for 6 weeks. Participant should take anamorelin with 1 cup (8 ounces) of water and should fast (having nothing to eat or drink except water) overnight and for at least 1 hour before participant's first meal of the day. Physical Activities: Participant will be asked to complete resistance exercises and a walking program at home for 6 weeks while also taking anamorelin. Participant will be given an accelerometer to wear while exercising for 5 days before each study visit. An accelerometer is a small device that measures participant's physical activity. Participant can clip the accelerometer to participant's waistband or belt. For the resistance exercises, participant will use color-coded tubes that have 3 levels of resistance: light, moderate, or hard. Participant will begin with 1 set of 10-12 repetitions at the lightest resistance and progress to 2 sets of 12 repetitions as participant gets stronger. Once participant has mastered a resistance level, participant will move up in resistance as participant's strength and endurance increases. Participant should begin the next level of resistance with 2 sets of 12 repetitions. Participant will complete these exercises 3 days a week with at least 48 hours between each session. For the walking program, participant will be asked to walk at least 5 days per week. The study staff will recommend how long each walk should be and how many times to walk each day. Participant will wear a pedometer at all times while participant is on study. A pedometer is a device that shows the number of steps participant has taken. Participant will receive instructions on how to use the pedometer. Participant will also receive a diary to record the number of steps participant takes each day. Participant should bring this diary to each study visit. Length of Study: Participant will receive anamorelin while performing the physical activities for 6 weeks. If participant and the doctor think it is in participant's best interest, participant may continue to take the study drug for an additional 6 weeks and repeat all study visits and procedures. Participant will no longer be able to take the study drug or perform the physical activities as part of this study if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if participant is unable to follow study directions. Participation on the study will be over after the follow-up period. Study Visits: One (1) time each week, participant will be called to ask about participant's physical activity progress and how participant is doing. These calls should last about 10-15 minutes each time. On or about Days 8, 15, 21, 29, 36, and 43, participant will complete the same 8 questionnaires that participant completed at baseline. On or about Days 15, 29, and 43 participant will complete a questionnaire about any symptoms participant may be having. This questionnaire should take about 5 minutes to complete each time. On or about Day 15, participant will meet with an exercise specialist to discuss participant's physical activity progress. On or about Day 21, participant will meet with a dietitian for nutrition counseling. If participant has difficulty tasting food, participant will be given zinc oxide and amino acids to take every day for 4 weeks to help increase participant's appetite. On or about Days 29 and 43, blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine and cytokine testing, and to check participant's liver function and fasting blood glucose levels. On or about Day 43: - Participant will have a physical exam. - Participant will complete the same physical performance tests participant did at baseline. - Participant will complete 2 questionnaires about participant's regular exercise habits and participant's symptoms after treatment. It should take about 10 minutes to complete these questionnaires. - Participant will have participant's REE and BMI measured. Follow-Up Period: About 4 weeks after the Day 43 visit, participant will be called by a member of the study staff and asked about participant's health. This call should last about 10 minutes. This is an investigational study. Anamorelin is not FDA approved or commercially available. Its use in combination with physical activity is investigational. The study doctor can explain how the study drug is designed to work. Up to 38 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>
