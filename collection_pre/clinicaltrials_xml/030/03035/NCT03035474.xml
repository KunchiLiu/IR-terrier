	<brief_summary>CONNECT-HF is a large-scale, pragmatic, cluster-randomized clinical trial to evaluate the effect of 2 quality improvement (QI) initiatives compared with usual care on heart failure (HF) outcomes and HF quality of care metrics at 1 year after discharge for participants hospitalized with acute HF and reduced ejection fraction (EF). The interventions will include both a health-system engagement group (direct) and a participants engagement group (digital).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>CONNECT-HF will be a large-scale, pragmatic, cluster-randomized clinical trial to evaluate the effect of 2 quality improvement (QI) initiatives compared with usual care on heart failure (HF) outcomes and HF quality of care metrics at 1 year after discharge for participants hospitalized with acute HF and reduced ejection fraction (EF). All participants in the trial will be consented for longitudinal follow-up as part of the CONNECT-HF registry on clinical outcomes, medication use, and participant-centered outcomes, including quality of life (QOL) assessments, at 6 weeks and 3, 6, and 12 months after discharge. Two QI initiatives evaluated in this trial are: A health-system engagement strategy (direct) that will involve site visits and ongoing mentoring from teams of healthcare professionals with specialized training and field experience to help health systems and individual hospitals to design local quality improvement plans. A participant engagement strategy (digital) of mobile applications utilizing behavioral tools to reinforce health behaviors, including self-monitoring/self-management and medication adherence. After the index hospitalization for HF, longitudinal information on management (ie, HF medications), QOL assessments, and resource utilization will be collected. Follow-up will occur via a centralized telephone interview by trained personnel via the DCRI Call Center. At each interview, participants will be asked to report current medications, rehospitalizations, and QOL assessments. Based on participant-reported events, medical billing data for rehospitalizations, emergency department visits, and procedures will be obtained. Quality of life assessments will include the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) and EuroQOL five dimensions questionnaire (EQ-5D).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Provide informed consent before trial enrollment Age ≥ 18 years Acute HF as the primary cause of hospitalization and a previous clinical diagnosis of HF Hospitalizations for acute HF will be determined by local clinicianinvestigators but should include the following: Symptoms (eg, dyspnea, fatigue), signs (eg, elevated jugular venous pressure, peripheral edema), or laboratory/imaging evidence of HF (eg, pulmonary congestion on chest xray, elevated natriuretic peptide levels) during the hospitalization and Treatments aimed at acute HF (eg, intravenous diuretics, vasodilators, or inotropes) LVEF ≤ 40% based on last local measurement using echocardiography, multigated acquisition scan, computed tomography (CT) scanning, magnetic resonance imaging, or ventricular angiography Planned discharge to home or other supported care facility where patients are individually responsible for medication management Prior heart transplant or current/planned left ventricular assistance device Chronic kidney disease requiring dialysis Terminal illness other than HF, such as malignancy, or with a life expectancy of less than 1 year as determined by the enrolling clinicianinvestigator Unable to use mobile applications or participate in longitudinal followup, such as plans to move outside the US in the following year</criteria>
