	<brief_title>A Physiological Profile of Recovery From Resistance, Endurance, and Mixed Exercise Types</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study utilised a between groups design, with a within-groups control. This allowed the within-subject profiling of recovery during both a control and exercise week. This design also allowed each group to perform an ecologically valid exercise session as well as having markers of recovery tailored to the areas of interest specific to each cohort. By having each group perform a non-exercise control week, this gives valuable information on the reliability and smallest worthwhile change for a range of both novel and commonly used recovery markers.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Demonstrates understanding of the study procedures, restrictions and willingness to participate as evidenced by voluntary written informed consent (see Appendices 24) and has received a signed and dated copy of the informed consent form. Participant is male Good general and mental health as assessed by a health questionnaire and with, in the opinion of the investigator or medically qualified designee ,no clinically significant and relevant abnormalities in medical history or upon oral examination. As well as absence of any condition that would impact on the participant's safety or wellbeing or affect the individual's ability to understand and follow study procedures and requirements. Participants will be fully briefed prior to agreeing to participate in the study and the research team will confirm that they are willing, able, and likely to comply with all procedures and complete the study. Only the following individuals will be recruited as participants for the study: Group 1: Resistance trained individuals (≥3 sessions per week for ≥2 years with a minimum of 1 session per week including legbased exercises). Group 2: Trained cyclists (competing at a minimum of Category 3 roadracing/ estimated 10 mile TT of &lt;25 minutes and a training history of ≥5 hours per week for ≥2 years). Group 3: Team sports players (minimum of University 1st team level e.g. soccer, rugby union, rugby league, hockey, and basketball, playing competitively ≥1x per week for ≥2 years). Individuals that do not fit the training status inclusion criteria. Current use of any nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAID's) or other analgesics for pain relief. Participation in another clinical study or receipt of an investigational drug within 30 days of the screening visit. Previous participation in this study. Recent history (within the last 1 year) of alcohol or other substance abuse. An employee of the sponsor or the study site or members of their immediate family. Have a heart or any other medical condition that may contraindicate participants from taking part in high intensity or exhaustive physical activity.</criteria>
