	<brief_summary>Background: People get malaria from bites from infected mosquitos. Researchers are studying a vaccine strategy. They will give people malaria parasites by injecting them with live infectious malaria parasites with antimalarial medications and then see if this strategy prevents malaria infection while off antimalarial medications. Objective: To see if combining a high dose of live, infectious malaria parasites (known as Sanaria PfSPZ Challenge) and two FDA approved drugs that kill malaria parasites (pyrimethamine [PYR] OR chloroquine [CQ]) is safe and can provide people protection against malaria. Eligibility: Healthy adults ages 18-50 who: - are not pregnant or breastfeeding or planning on becoming pregnant while in the study - are not infected with HIV, Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C - have reliable early morning access to the NIH Clinical Center - are able to come to the outpatient clinic frequently, sometimes daily Design: - Participants will be screened with medical history and physical exam. They will have heart, blood, and urine tests. - Participants will have blood drawn for tests at most visits. - Participants will keep track of their temperature and symptoms during some sections of the study. - Participants will join one part of the study. Part 1 is one month: - Participants will get the parasites by an injection into a vein on day 1 and receive antimalarial medications. - They will have daily visits on days 7-14 - They will take another antimalarial at visits on days 15-17. - The final visit will be on day 29. Part 2 is seven months: - For the first 3 months, participants will get the parasite injection into a vein for 3 injections in total. Each injection will occur once per month while taking an antimalarial drug. - They will have daily visits on days 7-14 after the first injection, and on days 7-11 after the second and third injection. - They will have a final (fourth) injection around month 6 without any antimalarial medication. - After this fourth injection, participants may have up to 21 daily visits from day 7 after injection until end of study. Part 3 is one month: - Participants will get the parasites by injection into a vein on day 1 without antimalarial medications. - They will have visits almost every day starting day 7 from injection. - They will take an antimalarial medication when they are diagnosed with malaria - They will return for final end of study visit on days 27-29.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sanaria PfSPZ Challenge With Pyrimethamine Chemoprophylaxis (PfSPZ-CVac Approach): Trial to Determine Safety and Development of Protective Efficacy After Exposure to Only Pre-erythrocytic Stages of Plasmodium Falciparum</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Human studies have shown that immunization by the bite Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) sporozoite(SPZ)-infected mosquitoes under drug coverage with chloroquine, an approach called chemoprophylaxis with sporozoites (CPS) or infection treatment vaccination (ITV), can provide high level, long term protection against homologous controlled human malaria infection (CHMI). The Sanaria PfSPZ chemoprophylaxis vaccination (PfSPZ CVac) approach duplicates this with an injectable SPZ regimen. In both approaches, whether mosquitoes or syringes are used for SPZ administration, when chloroquine is used as the chemoprophylactic agent, transient, limited, asexual erythrocytic stage is seen in the majority of participants. Thus the question remains whether the significant protective efficacy seen can be achieved with pre-erythrocytic (sporozoite/liver stage) exposure only. Previously, we performed a phase 1 study to investigate the safety, tolerability, immunogenicity, and protective efficacy of Sanaria PfSPZ CVac with chloroquine (sporozoites, liver, and blood stage) or pyrimethamine with chloroquine (sporozoites and liver stage only) to further describe stage specific sterile protection (NIAID protocol #15-I-0169). In this study, we demonstrated that pyrimethamine is safe to administer, well tolerated, and can prevent subpatent and patent parasitemia (qPCR and blood smear negative) 100% of the time during Sanaria PfSPZ CVac. The study also duplicated the results previously reported with Sanaria PfSPZ CVac with chloroquine in terms of safety profile and protective efficacy against homologous CHMI. Although a combination of Sanaria PfSPZ CVac with pyrimethamine and PfSPZ Challenge at 51,200 PfSPZ did not provide significant protection against homologous CHMI, we demonstrated that protective immunity can develop without any evidence of blood stage exposure during PfSPZ CVac. Building on these results and taking the lessons learned from other pre-erythrocytic vaccine studies and models that have shown the importance of reaching a minimal antigen threshold required for the development of sterile immunity, this proposed study will assess the safety, tolerability, immunogenicity, and protective efficacy of increasing the dose of Sanaria PfSPZ Challenge sporozoites while receiving similar doses of pyrimethamine. Additionally, we will explore the impact of increasing the number Sanaria PfSPZ Challenge sporozoites while under chloroquine prophylaxis on heterologous protection. The results of this study will contribute to understanding the targets and mechanisms of immunity against Pf malaria infection and how the degree of exposure to the parasite (pre-erythrocytic or erythrocytic stage only or both) impacts these responses and subsequent protective efficacy.</detailed_description>

Such participants will be counseled on risks at the time of consent and at appropriate points (e.g. when pregnancy testing occurs) during the study: Females who have had their uterus, and/or BOTH ovaries removed Females who have had BOTH fallopian tubes surgically 'tied' or removed Females who are above the age of 45 and have spontaneously had no menses at any point during the past 12 or more consecutive months (i.e. have reached menopause) Females who, in the conservative and reasonable judgment of the PI (e.g. due to sexual orientation or serious life choice (such as being celibate clergy or transgender), during the entire trial will NOT participate in any potentially reproductive sexual contact Females who, in the conservative and reasonable judgment of the PI, are in a monogamous stable relationship with a male who has undergone vasectomy at least 4 months prior or another procedure/medical condition that deems the male sterile Subject to the judgment and discretion of the PI, female participants who DO NOT meet ANY of the criteria listed above, will be appropriately counseled on reproductive risks and pregnancy avoidance, and will be required to adhere to the following measures and agree to 2 methods of pregnancy prevention as noted below: CATEGORY 1: a highly effective hormonal method to prevent pregnancy [e.g. CONSISTENT, CONTINUOUS use of contraceptive pill, patch, ring, implant or injection], and/or IUD or equivalent IN ADDITION TO CATEGORY 2: a barrier method to be used at the time of potentially reproductive sexual activity (e.g. [male/female condom, 'cap,' or diaphragm] + spermicide).
