	<brief_summary>In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, either a single dose of Adrecizumab (0.5, 2.0 or 8.0 mg/kg) or placebo will be administrated to 24 healthy male volunteers during experimental endotoxemia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Adrecizumab-LPS Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Adrenomedullin (ADM) is a natural occurring 52 amino acid peptide which is mainly expressed in endothelial and smooth muscle cells. ADM plasma levels are increased in patients with sepsis and related with severity of disease. ADM is a key regulator of vasotonus and of endothelial integrity in sepsis. Adrecizumab is an antibody against the N-terminus of ADM which only partially inhibits the bioactivity of ADM. Several septic animal studies have shown that administration of Adrecizumab leads to stabilization of hemodynamics in mice and pigs, improved renal function, reduced catecholamine demand, improved fluid balance and improved survival. The administration of Adrecizumab to rodents, non-human primates and recently humans, has been tolerated very well. The experimental human endotoxemia model, in which healthy male volunteers receive a low dose of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) derived from Escherichia coli, is widely used to study the effects of systemic inflammation in humans in vivo and is considered a safe and highly reproducible method to activate the innate immune system. Furthermore, previous data has shown that experimental human endotoxemia results in increased plasma ADM levels. In this study, the investigators wish to assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics/-dynamics of Adrecizumab under inflammatory conditions in healthy volunteers.</detailed_description>
