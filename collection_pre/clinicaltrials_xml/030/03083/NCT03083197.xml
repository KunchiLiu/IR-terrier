	<brief_summary>Study type: Randomized Control Treatment Trial Study population: Male and female patients with ≥15 years of age and acute scrub typhus Duration: 2 years Study Design: Prospective, open-label, randomized-controlled treatment trial in patients ≥15 years old admitted to hospital with acute scrub typhus. Randomization into 3 oral treatment arms (each n=59 patients, total n=177): i) 7 days of doxycycline, ii) 3 days of doxycycline, and iii) 3 days of azithromycin Primary Objective: To evaluate the clinical and microbiological responses in scrub typhus patients to three oral treatment regimens: 7 days of doxycycline, 3 days of doxycycline, and 3 days of azithromycin Secondary Objectives: 1. To perform pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) characterization of the therapeutic responses for doxycycline and azithromycin, incl. serial bacterial load measurements. 2. To define clinical, bacterial, pathophysiological and pharmacological factors associated with disease severity, fever-clearance times (FCT), treatment failures and relapse/re-infection. 3. To determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of clinical Orientia tsutsugamushi isolates to doxycycline, azithromycin and chloramphenicol, using in vitro growth-inhibition assays 4. To genotype all clinical isolates using whole genome sequencing for comparative genomics. 5. To dissect the natural immune response in scrub typhus, using antigen-specific cellular immune and antibody studies, and cytokine profiling</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Age ≥ 15 years old Hospitalization with acute undifferentiated fever (temperature &gt; 37.5°C, tympanic) ≤14 days or patients admitted to hospital with a history of fever ≤ 14 days who subsequently develop fever within 24 hours of admission Clinically suspected scrub typhus: defined as acute undifferentiated fever with no clear focus of infection and negative malaria blood smear and/or negative malaria RDT. Patients may have one, none, or a combination of other clinical findings such as eschar, rash, lymphadenopathy, headache, myalgia, cough, nausea and abdominal discomfort. A positive scrub typhus RDT (Scrub Typhus IgM RDT, InBios International, Seattle, WA, USA) and/or positive PCRbased detection of O. tsutsugamushi DNA from the admission blood sample Written informed consent and/or, written informed assent as required Able to take oral medication Known hypersensitivity to tetracycline, doxycycline or azithromycin Administration of doxycycline, azithromycin, chloramphenicol, rifampicin, or tetracycline during the preceding 7 days Pregnancy or breastfeeding Patients with myasthenia gravis or systemic lupus erythematosus Patients with an established infection (diagnostic test required) e.g. acute malaria, dengue, leptospirosis, typhoid, Japanese encephalitis etc. Current TB or TB treatment in ≤ 6 months (contain active antibiotics against Orientia spp.) Current HAART use for HIV, long term use of immunosuppressants (e.g. steroids, chemotherapy, TNFinhibitors and related agents) Patients with severe disease whom the clinical team feel their condition necessitates the need for additional scrub typhus treatment beyond the allocated antibiotic treatment assigned at randomization (e.g. IV chloramphenicol and/or PO/NG rifampicin)</criteria>
