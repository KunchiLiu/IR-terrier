	<criteria>1. Age: 18 to 75 years old 2. Pathologically diagnosed advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer (stage Ⅳ) with measurable lesions (diameter of tumor lesions displayed on CT scan ≥ 10 mm; short diameter of lymph node lesions on CT scan ≥ 15 mm; and no radiotherapy, radiofrequency ablation or other local treatment has been given to such measurable lesions) 3. Patients with negative EGFR or ALK genesensitive mutations or unknown status and with treatment failure or recurrence after previously undergoing the treatment with two chemotherapy regimens (at least one platinumcontaining twodrug regimen included) 4. Patients with positive EGFRTKI or ALKTKI genesensitive mutations and with treatment failure or recurrence after previously undergoing one platinumcontaining chemotherapy regimen may be included. Note that treatment given in neoadjuvant therapy phase is not considered a part of the treatment regimen; however, if recurrence occurred within 6 months after the end of adjuvant therapy, the adjuvant therapy is considered a part of the treatment regimen, and if not within such 6 months, the adjuvant therapy is not considered a part of the treatment regimen. The term "treatment failure" is defined as: (1) progression presents in the course of treatment or after the last treatment with evidence of definitive imaging or clinical progression; (2) patients withdrawn from standard treatment due to inability to tolerate adverse events of grade IV and above hematological toxicity, of grade II and above nonhematological toxicity or of grade II and above major organ damage, such as heart, liver and kidney according to NCICTCAE Version 4.0. 5. ECOG status 01 6. Expected survival ≥ 3 months 7. Patients recovered from damages caused by other treatment given to them (≤ grade 1 according to NCICTCAE version 4.0); the interval of nitrosourea or mitomycin given was ≥ 6 weeks; the interval of other cytotoxic drugs, Avastin, radiotherapy or surgery was ≥ 4 weeks; and the interval of EGFR TKI molecular targeted drugs was ≥ 2 weeks 8. Major organs function normally, e.g. the following criteria are met (1) Blood routine tests shall comply with the criteria as follows (no transfusion of blood or blood products within 14 days, no correction with GCSF and other hematopoietic stimulating factors): 1. Hemoglobin（HB） ≥ 90 g/L 2. Absolute neutrophil count（ANC） ≥ 1.5 × 10（9）/L 3. Platelets（PLT ）≥ 80 × 10（9）/L (2) Biochemical test shall comply with the criteria as follows: 1. Total bilirubin（TBIL） &lt; 1.5 × upper limit of normal（ULN） 2. Alanine aminotransferase （ALT） and aspartate aminotransferase（AST） &lt;2.5 × ULN; and &lt; 5 × ULN for patients with liver metastases 3. Serum Cr ≤ 1.25 × ULN or endogenous creatinine clearance &gt; 45 ml / min (CockcroftGault formula) 9. Female patients at a childbearing age must have taken reliable contraceptive measures or received pregnancy test (either by serum or urine) showing a negative result within 7 days before inclusion and are willing to take appropriate contraceptive measures during the trial and in the following 8 weeks after the last administration of the test drug. Male patients shall agree to take appropriate contraceptive measures or have undergone surgical sterilization during the trial and in the following 8 weeks after the last administration of the test drug 10. Subjects shall participate in the study out of their own will, sign the informed consent, have good compliance, and cooperate with followup 1. Small cell lung cancer (including small cell carcinoma and mixed nonsmall cell lung cancer) 2. Patients who have a definitive history of severe allergy to biological products 3. Patients with active (without medical control) brain metastases, cancer meningitis, spinal cord compression, or with brain or leptomeninges disorders identified in CT or MRI examination in the inclusion process (however, patients with brain metastases who have completed treatment 21 days prior to the randomization and maintained symptomatic stability may be included) 4. Patients with Grade II and above myocardial ischemia or myocardial infarction and poorly controlled arrhythmia (including male patients with QTc interval ≥ 450 ms and female patients with QTc interval ≥ 470 ms) 5. Patients with Grade III to IV heart dysfunction according to NYHA or left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt;50% identified in cardiac ultrasound examination 6. Patients with persistent bradycardia and positive results in the atropine test 7. Patients with diseases concerning hemorrhagic tendency 8. Dropsy of serous cavity (including pleural effusion, ascites, and pericardial effusion) presenting clinical symptoms and requiring medical treatment 9. Patients with active hepatitis B or hepatitis C 10. Patients with active infection requiring antimicrobial treatment (such as antibiotics, antiviral drugs, and antifungal drugs) 11. Patients with a history of psychotropic drug abuse and failure to get rid of those drugs or who have mental disorders 12. Patients who have participated in other clinical trials regarding antitumor drugs within 4 weeks prior to randomization 13. Longterm users of adrenal cortex hormones or immunosuppressive agents 14. Patients with a history of or suffering from other noncured malignancies, except for cured skin basal cell carcinoma, cervical carcinoma in situ and superficial bladder cancer 15. Pregnant or breastfeeding women; fertile patients who are unwilling or unable to take effective contraceptive measures 16. Patients with positive skin test results for injection of recombinant human Apo2 ligand 17. Other conditions as the researcher consider that may have impacts on the performance of the clinical trial and interpretation of results</criteria>
