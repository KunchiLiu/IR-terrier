	<brief_summary>Prospective, multicenter, single-arm, open label, interventional study evaluating adoptive cell therapy (ACT) with autologous tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) infusion (LN-145) followed by IL-2 after a non-myeloablative (NMA) lymphodepletion preparative regimen for the treatment of patients with recurrent and/or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of LN-145 Autologous Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes in the Treatment of Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head &amp; Neck</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>LN-145 is an adoptive cell transfer therapy that utilizes an autologous TIL manufacturing process, as originally developed by the NCI, for the treatment of patients with recurrent and/or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. The cell transfer therapy used in this study involves patients receiving a NMA lymphocyte depleting preparative regimen, followed by infusion of autologous TIL followed by the administration of a regimen of IL-2.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Must be greater than 18 years of age at the time of consent. Must have persistent, recurrent or metastatic HNSCC; histologic documentation of the primary tumor is required via the pathology report. Must have had at least 1 prior systemic chemotherapeutic regimen for management of persistent, recurrent or metastatic HNSCC. Patients must not have any curative therapy options, or be intolerant of, or decline standard of care therapy for persistent, recurrent or metastatic disease. Any prior therapy directed at the malignant tumor, including radiation therapy, chemotherapy, biologic/targeted agents and immunologic agents must be discontinued at least 21 days prior to tumor resection for preparing TIL therapy. Have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1. Patients must be seronegative for the HIV antibody, hepatitis B antigen, and hepatitis C antibody or antigen. Female patients of childbearing potential must be willing to practice an approved method of birth control starting at the time of informed consent and for 1 year after the completion of the lymphodepletion regimen. Patients who are on a systemic steroid therapy (greater than 10 mg of prednisone or equivalent) within 28 days prior to Visit 2. Patients who currently have prior therapyrelated toxicities greater than Grade 1 according to Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.03; (see Appendix Section 16.4), except for alopecia or vitiligo prior to enrollment. Patients who have had immunotherapyattributable AE: which led to discontinuation, or have had an ophthalmologic or neurologic AE of any grade, or actively receiving any immunosuppressive agents for the treatment of toxicity related to prior immunotherapy. Patients with documented Grade 2 or greater diarrhea or colitis as a result of previous immunotherapy within six months from screening. History of severe immediate hypersensitivity reaction to cyclophosphamide, fludarabine, or IL2. Patients with active systemic infections, coagulation disorders or other active major medical illnesses of the cardiovascular, respiratory or immune system. Have any form of primary immunodeficiency, such as severe combined immunodeficiency disease or acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Diagnosis of endstage renal disorder requiring hemodialysis. Patients who have a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt; 45%. Patients who have a FEV1 (forced expiratory volume in one second) of less than or equal to 60 % of normal.</criteria>
