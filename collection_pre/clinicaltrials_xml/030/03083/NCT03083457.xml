	<brief_summary>Low-tidal volume ventilation is arising as a tool to optimize the ventilatory management and to improve clinical outcome in patients undergoing general anesthesia for abdominal surgery. A recent large randomized controlled trial failed to detect a significant difference between two different approaches for ensuring adequate lung recruitment (PEEP=12 cmH2O + scheduled recruiting maneuvers vs. PEEP 2 cmH2O) during protective ventilation. Thus, in patients undergoing open abdominal surgery and receiving low-tidal volumes, the effects of different positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) levels and recruiting maneuvers remain to be established. Design: prospective, cross-over, physiological trial. PURPOSE To assess the physiological effects of different PEEP levels with or without scheduled recruiting maneuvers in patients undergoing general anesthesia for open abdominal surgery and receiving low-tidal volume ventilation.</brief_summary>
