	<brief_title>Clinical Evaluation of Different Potassium Oxalate Concentrations in Dentin Hypersensitivity Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dentin hypersensitivity (DH) is characterized as a short, intense and sudden pain caused by thermal, chemical and evaporative stimuli. There are several types of desensitizing agents, used to aid in the control of this pathology, but they are not very effective and have short longevity. The agents based on potassium oxalate have been used by dental surgeons because they have mixed action, both neural and obliterating. Therefore, the aim of this study is through a triple blind randomized clinical trial (split-mouth), evaluate the longevity and efficacy of two products potassium oxalate-based in two concentrations, 10% and 5%. Thirty-two with DH at least 2 teeth and adequate oral hygiene will be randomly divided into two different groups according to the desensitization approach (10% and 5%) The dentin hypersensitivity level will be evaluated immediately after desensitization and after 1, 2 and 3. Data will be collected, tabulated and submitted to statistical analysis.</detailed_description>
