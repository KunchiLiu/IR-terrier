	<brief_summary>Application of Nanotechnology and Chemical Sensors for Diagnosis of Decompensated Heart Failure by Respiratory Samples. Breath testing, which links specific volatile molecular biomarkers in exhaled breath to medical conditions, is becoming increasingly popular as a non-invasive and potentially inexpensive diagnostic method for various diseases. NA-NOSE performs odor detection from exhaled breath, thus producing a distinct fingerprint for each mixture of analytes. Several studies have been published, stating the advantages of these sensors, leading to promising outcomes in several fields. The NA-NOSE breath test would be fast (examination and results would be obtained within 5-10 min), inexpensive, eventually portable (smaller than desktop computer), non-invasive and free of any side effects.</brief_summary>
