	<brief_summary>In this study the investigators will evaluate whether more careful reading (than the current standard) of standard computerised tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) performed in the clinical work-up of suspected (pulmonary embolism (PE) will differentiate patients with acute PE from those with more chronic or acute on chronic PE, which could be an early sign of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CTEPH Identification an Standard Computerised Tomography Pulmonary Angiography in Pulmonary Embolism Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators will study 50 consecutive patients diagnosed with CTEPH as well as 50 patients diagnosed with acute PE in whom CTEPH was ruled out 2 years after the PE diagnosis by sequential echocardiography. These control patients without CTEPH will be matched on the RV/LV ratio of the patients who developed CTEPH. Three experienced thorax radiologists with specific expertise on acute PE and CTEPH will blindly assess the index CTPAs of the study population. In addition to the binominal judgement whether CTEPH signs are already present (or not), the presence of the following items will be scored by all 3 readers independently: - Webs or bands - Residual thrombus attached to the vascular wall - Complete occlusion /retraction - Mosaic perfusion - Pulmonary infarct - Parenchymal bands - Bronchial arteries - Right atrial (RA) dilatation - Right ventricle (RV) dilatation - Flattening of the septum - Right ventricle (RV) hypertrophy - Dilated truncus pulmonalis - Cardiac signs of pulmonary hypertension (PH) - Further remarks (free text)</detailed_description>
