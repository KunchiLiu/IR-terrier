	<brief_summary>The proposed study represents a crucial and important stage in translating basic research to strategies for treating nicotine dependence. The investigation addresses an important public health issue by testing an intervention - informed by basic research - that may lead to a more effective and efficient treatment for smokers. The expected findings should provide initial effect size data for the addition of isradipine to an integrated psychosocial/behavioral and pharmacological smoking cessation intervention for smokers, and thus provide the necessary data for a large-scale follow-up trial.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Enhancing Cue Exposure Treatment for Smoking Reduction With Isradipine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The proposed proof-of-concept study will utilize a prospective, experimental research design. The investigators will recruit adult daily smokers who will be randomly assigned to either: (1) Cue Exposure Treatment with Isradipine (CET+ISR )or (2) CET with placebo (CET+PBO). Two 90-minute CET sessions will be conducted to expose participants to interoceptive and situational cues for tobacco use and craving. In the first session, participants will receive a dose of ISR or PBO and begin the CET session after waiting 75 minutes. CET has three components: exposure to slides depicting smoking cues (visual exposure), exposure to emotions and imagined situations that most reliably triggered an urge to smoke (emotional/imaginal), and exposure to a participant's own cigarettes (in vivo). The second session will be conducted 24 h after the first in a medication-free state. Clinicians will record craving throughout the CET sessions. Participants will return one week after the second CET session to complete several questionnaires related to smoking and mood, provide a carbon monoxide sample to verify abstinence, and report craving to smoking related cues.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Male and female patients ages 1865 capable of providing informed consent Willing and able to provide informed consent, attend all study visits and comply with the protocol Daily smoker for at least one year Currently smoke an average of at least 10 cigarettes per day Report a motivation to quit smoking in the next month of at least 7 on a 10point scale Current diagnosis of a psychotic, eating, developmental or bipolar disorder Significant suicide risk as determined by structured interview Exclusion criteria related to isradipine administration: Potential participants will be excluded if they report any history of the following: 1. known allergy or sensitivity to isradipine, 2. hypertension, 3. congestive heart failure, 4. any type of liver disease, 5. current pregnancy, or 6. women of childbearing potential who are not using medically accepted forms of contraception (e.g., IUD, oral contraceptives, barrier devices, condoms and foam, or implanted progesterone rods stabilized for at least 3 months). Potential participants will also be excluded if they are currently taking: 1. Rifampin, or 2. Tagamet. Rifampin has been shown to decrease availability of calcium channel blockers and concurrent administration of Tagamet and isradipine has been shown to increase hypotensive effects and inhibit hepatic metabolism of isradipine. Psychoactive substance use assessed with urinalysis A history of significant medical condition and/or be deemed as currently unhealthy by the Dr. Young Limited mental competency and the inability to give informed, voluntary, written consent to participate Current use of any pharmacotherapy or psychotherapy for smoking cessation not provided by the researchers during the quit attempt Concurrent psychotherapy initiated within three months of screening, or ongoing psychotherapy of any duration directed specifically toward treatment of anxiety or mood disorder other than general supportive therapy initiated at least 3 months prior to the study Use of other tobacco products, including ecigarettes Insufficient command of the English language</criteria>
