	<brief_summary>Despite the fact that pancreatoduodenectomy is the standard treatment of malignant tumor at periampullary area, the morbidity and mortality rate with intra-abdominal collection, post pancreatectomy hemorrhage, and delayed gastric emptying, is still high at approximately 50-60%. The causes of these complications usually come from post-operative pancreatic fistula. Nowadays, several methods have been reported to reduce the incidence of pancreatic fistula after undergoing pancreatoduodenectomy, such as pancreatic stenting, the use of intravenous somatostatin, the use of sealant material and wrapping anastomosis by soft tissue. Wrapping pancreato-jejunal anastomosis with omentum is not a complicate procedure and requires no extra treatment expenses of the patient. It has been reported this technique has been applied in the non-randomized controlled trials and their data have significantly shown that the technique could reduce pancreatic fistula rate. Therefore, the researchers want to conduct an RCT study to compare complication rates between omental roll-up pancreato-jejunal anastomosis and non-omental roll-up groups.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial of Omental Roll-up Technique on Pancreato-jejunostomy Anastomosis for Reducing Perioperative Complication in Patients Undergoing Pancreatoduodenectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a RCT study designed to compare the use of omental roll-up technique with non-omental roll-up technique at pancreato-jejunal anastomosis in patients undergoing pancreatoduodenectomy. The purpose of this study is to prove the hypothesis that omental roll-up technique can reduce the complication rate or pancratic fistula after pancreatoduodenectomy. This study was approved by the committee on human rights to conduct the research involving human subjects, faculty of medicine Ramathibodi hospital, Mahidol university. The patients are operated by experienced surgeons of Hepato-pancreato-biliary unit, department of surgery, Ramathibodi hospital and randomized into two groups by using the closed envelope method after completing pancreato-jejunal anastomosis. Then, patients are followed-up and the data are collected for 30 days after the surgery.</detailed_description>
