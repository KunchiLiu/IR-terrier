	<brief_summary>The Nor-Hand study is a hospital-based observational study including 300 patients with evidence of hand OA by ultrasound and/or clinical examination. The baseline examination (2016-17) consists of functional tests and joint assessment of the hands, medical assessment, pain sensitization tests, ultrasound (hands, acromioclavicular joint, hips, knees and feet), computer tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the dominant hand, conventional radiographs of the hands and feet, fluorescence optical imaging of the hands, collection of blood and urine samples as well as self-reported demographic factors and OA-related questionnaires. Two follow-up examinations are planned after 4 (2020-21) and 8 years (2024-25), respectively. Cross-sectional analyses will be used to investigate agreements and associations between different relevant measures at the baseline examination, whereas the longitudinal data will be used for evaluation of predictors for clinical outcomes.</brief_summary>
