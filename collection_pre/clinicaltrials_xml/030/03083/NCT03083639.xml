	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate the Bioequivalence of Single Oral Dose of Esomeprazole Capsule and Tablet Formulation in Healthy Participants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug being tested in this study is called esomeprazole. Esomeprazole is being tested in healthy participants in order to evaluate the bioequivalence between a single oral dose of esomeprazole tablet and capsule. The study will enroll 52 participants. Participants will be randomly assigned (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the two treatment sequences: - Esomeprazole 40 mg capsule + Esomeprazole 40 mg tablet - Esomeprazole 40 mg tablet + Esomeprazole 40 mg capsule All participants will be asked to take one capsule or tablet on Day 1 of each Intervention Period based on the treatment sequence to which the participant has been assigned. This single center trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall duration to participate in this study is 36 days. Participants will visit the clinic on Day -1 and remained confined until Day 1 of Intervention Period 1 and 2. A washout period of minimum 6 days will be maintained between the dose in each Intervention Period.</detailed_description>

Weighs at least 50 kilogram (kg) and has a body mass index (BMI) from 18.5 to 30 kilogram per square meter (kg/m^2), inclusive at Screening and Day 1. 1. Has uncontrolled, clinically significant neurologic, cardiovascular, pulmonary, hepatic, renal, metabolic, gastrointestinal, or endocrine disease or other abnormality, which may impact the ability of the participant to participate or potentially confound the study results. It is the responsibility of the investigator to assess the clinical significance; however, consultation with the Takeda Medical Monitor may be warranted. 2. Has a history of significant gastro intestinal (GI) disorders manifested with persistent, chronic or intermittent nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or has a current or recent (within 6 months) GI disease that would influence the absorption of drugs (example, a history of malabsorption, severe esophageal reflux, peptic ulcer disease or erosive esophagitis), or any gastrointestinalrelated surgical intervention.. 3. Has a known hypersensitivity to any component of the formulation of esomeprazole capsules or tablets or compounds with the same mechanism of action (dexlansoprazole, lansoprazole, omeprazole, rabeprazole, pantoprazole), or related compounds.</criteria>
