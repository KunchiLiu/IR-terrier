	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of brivaracetam (BRV) compared to placebo (PBO) as adjunctive treatment in Asian subjects (&gt;=16 to 80 years of age) with partial seizures with or without secondary generalization despite current treatment with 1 or 2 concomitant antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) and to assess the safety and tolerability of BRV in subjects &gt;= 16 years to 80 years of age.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subjects (male or female) from 16 to 80 years of age at Visit 1, both inclusive. Subjects who are not legal adults may only be included where legally permitted and ethically accepted. Female subjects with childbearing potential are eligible if they use a medically accepted contraceptive method. Wellcharacterized focal epilepsy/epileptic syndrome according to the 1989 International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) classification. Presence of an electroencephalogram (EEG) reading compatible with the clinical diagnosis of focal epilepsy within the last 5 years. Presence of a brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)/computed tomography (CT) scan performed within the last 2 years. Subjects having at least 8 partial seizures (according to the 1981 ILAE classification) during the 8Week Baseline Period with at least 2 partial seizures during each 4week interval of the Baseline Period. Subjects having at least 2 partial seizures whether or not secondary generalization per month during the 3 months preceding Visit 1. Subjects uncontrolled while treated by 1 or 2 permitted concomitant antiepileptic drug [AED](s). Vagal Nerve Stimulation (VNS) is allowed and will be counted as a concomitant AED. Permitted concomitant AED(s) and VNS being stable and at optimal dosage for the subject from at least 4 weeks (12 weeks for phenobarbital, phenytoin, and primidone) before Visit 1 and expected to be kept stable during whole study period. Subject has history or presence of status epilepticus during the year preceding Visit 1 or during Baseline. Subject has history of cerebrovascular accident, including transient ischemic attack, in the last 24 weeks. Subject has history or presence of known psychogenic nonepileptic seizures.</criteria>
