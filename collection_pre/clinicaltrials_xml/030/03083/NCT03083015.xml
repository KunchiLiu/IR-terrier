	<brief_summary>This study compared the efficiency of pulp revascularization and MTA apexification in the treatment of patients with necrotic immature anterior teeth.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pulp Revascularization Versus MTA Apexification</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>the participants with 66 anterior necrotic immature teeth were randomly assigned into two equal groups with 33 teeth per each, according to regeneration and MTA apexification. At the first visit, all teeth were accessed and irrigated with NaOCl then a TAP was applied as intra-appointment intracanal medication. At the second visit, after removal of the medication with the irrigation, bleeding was initiated into the canal and isolated by the MTA in the orifice in the regeneration group. While in the Apexification group, the MTA was packed apically and all teeth were finally restored with resin composite restorations. The patients were recalled after 1, 3, 6, and 9 months for clinical and radiographic follow up.</detailed_description>
