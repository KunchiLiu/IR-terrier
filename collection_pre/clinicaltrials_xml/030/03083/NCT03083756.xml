	<brief_summary>This study validate the usefulness of SIMPLICITY score to characterize the immune status of the kidney transplant receiver at two points along its course (the one and six months after transplantation), by determination in peripheral blood of various parameters related to cellular immunity (count subpopulations of CD3+ (cluster of differentiation 3), CD4+ (cluster of differentiation 4) and CD8+( cluster of differentiation 8)), humoral immunity (immunoglobulins count) and innate (complement).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Validation of a Risk Score Opportunistic Infections Development in Kidney Transplant Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The monitoring of various parameters related to cellular and humoral immunity (lymphocytes, immunoglobulins and complement) through a score (SIMPLICITY) (8) would allow the identification of renal transplant recipients at high risk for post-transplant infection. Prolonged or prolonged use of CMV (Cytomegalovirus) prophylaxis may modify this risk. The SIMPLICITY score (Seeking for Immune Status based on Peripheral Blood Lymphocytes, Immunoglobulins and Complement Activity) is a practical score based on the monitoring of readily available immunological parameters to assess the risk of infection after RT (Renal transplant). In order to perform this score, the total lymphocyte counts and peripheral blood lymphocyte subpopulations (PBLSs), serum immunoglobulin levels (IgG, IgA (Immunoglobulin A) and IgM) and serum complement levels (C3 and C4) at baseline were investigated, at one month and 6 months after transplantation. The validation of this new score would allow to have a weapon that would lead to reduce to the maximum the pharmacological immunosuppression and to use strict prophylactic measures in these patients. The results of the present study may provide insight into clinically and scientifically relevant aspects of infection in the recipient of an RT undergoing immunosuppressive therapy: From the point of view of assistance, if the hypothesis of the study were confirmed, the possibility of elaborating specific strategies of prophylaxis and early treatment (antibiotic, antifungal or antiviral), adjusted to the risk of the recipient to present some infectious event during its evolution post transplantation according to the SIMPLICITY score. Likewise, it could lay the foundations for the design of individualized immunosuppression guidelines, in which the risk of infectious complications could be evaluated jointly with that of graft rejection. And all this based on simple immunological parameters, of economic determination and accessible for most of the centers of our environment, circumstance that would favor its immediate application in the usual clinical practice. Given that the literature on this line of research is scarce, and the hypothesis we intend to demonstrate is novel and conceptually attractive, the results of this study will be able to be published in journals with a high impact index in the field of immunology and Management of infectious complications in the RT.</detailed_description>
