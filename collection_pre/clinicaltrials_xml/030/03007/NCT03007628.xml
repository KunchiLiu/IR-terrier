	<brief_summary>This trial attempts to evaluate the treatment efficacy of magnetic seizure therapy (MST) and its safety among schizophrenia patients. Half of the participants will be randomized to MST group, while the other half will be randomized to receive electroconvulsive therapy (ECT).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Magnetic Seizure Therapy Versus Electroconvulsive Therapy for Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Magnetic seizure therapy (MST) is likely to be an alternative options to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). Widespread stimulation of cortical and subcortical regions is inevitable for ECT since the substantial impedance of the scalp and skull shuts most of the electrical stimulus away from the brain. Nevertheless, magnetic pulses are capable to focus the stimulus to a specific area of the brain because they can pass the scalp and skull without resistance. In Addition, electric current will penetrate into deeper structures, while magnetic stimulus are only capable to reach a depth of a few centimeters. As a consequence, MST are able to generate focus stimuli on superficial regions of the cortex while ECT can't, which may give MST the capability to produce comparable therapeutic benefits with the absence of apparent cognitive side effects. However, MST and ECT may both works via alterations of cortical inhibition and default mode network.</detailed_description>
