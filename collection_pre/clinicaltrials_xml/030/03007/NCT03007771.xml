	<brief_summary>This study will help to elucidate the treatment sites in the extremities and pelvis for which MR-guided HIFU heating is feasible, which has the potential to be beneficial for patients with conditions at those sites (soft tissue sarcoma, cervical cancer, etc.). The investigators anticipate that successful completion of this study will lead to clinical trials in those feasible sites of interest to determine the safety and efficacy of administering therapeutic levels of heat for hyperthermia or other applications.</brief_summary>
