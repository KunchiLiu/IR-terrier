	<brief_summary>This is an implementation research study designed to evaluate a defined strategy, NIATx, for its effectiveness in installing and sustaining evidence-based integrated services for persons with co-occurring substance use and mental health disorders. This study is a cluster randomized wait-list control group design, in which a cohort of 25 addiction treatment agencies receives the active NIATx approach during an index 12 month period. The second (wait-list) cohort of 25 addiction treatment agencies activates NIATx strategies during a second index 12 month period. The primary "subjects" of the research are the treatment agencies themselves. The study specific aims are: 1. Relative to wait-list, to determine if NIATx strategies improve implementation outcomes (integrated service fidelity and receipt of more integrated services) 2. Relative to wait-list, to determine if NIATx strategies improve patient care outcomes (psychiatric, alcohol and drug problem severity) 3. Across entire sample, to evaluate variation in the extent of and fidelity to NIATx strategies NIATx implementation strategies consist of learning sessions, individualized coaching and peer to peer sharing.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Organizations who are licensed addiction treatment providers in the state of Washington were identified and provided the opportunity to participate in the study. Eligibility criteria include: outpatient and/or intensive outpatient services; taxexempt, government status or at least 50% publically funded (e.g., block grants, Medicare, Medicaid), and no prior participation in NIATx research studies (this last criterion excludes 39 agencies who were involved in the NIDA funded NIATx 200). Public mental health and private addiction treatment agencies are also excluded because only addiction treatment providers in Washington are required to use the state clinical information system, and therefore cannot provide the necessary standardized data</criteria>
