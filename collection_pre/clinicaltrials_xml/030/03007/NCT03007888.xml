	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: To compare the pharmacokinetics (PK) of single and multiple doses of IPX203 with Immediate release carbidopa-levodopa (IR CD-LD) in subjects with advanced Parkinson's disease (PD). Secondary Objectives: To compare the pharmacodynamics of single and multiple doses of IPX203 with IR CD-LD. To compare the efficacy of IPX203 with IR CD-LD following multiple doses. To evaluate the safety of IPX203.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Assess the PK and Pharmacodynamics of IPX203 in Subjects With Advanced Parkinson's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>IPX203 is an investigational product containing CD‑LD. IPX203-B16-01 Study Design: A randomized, open-label, rater-blinded, multicenter, 2-treatment, 2‑period, multiple-dose crossover study. Approximately 30 qualified IR CD-LD-experienced advanced PD subjects will be randomized. The study duration will be approximately 8 weeks, including the screening period.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Eligibility will be determined at screening and Visit 1 of the study. Diagnosed with idiopathic PD at age ≥ 40 years who are being chronically treated with stable regimens of CDLD but experiencing motor complications. Hoehn and Yahr Stages 2, 3, or 4 Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score ≥ 24 at Screening Visit in "on" state. For the 4 weeks prior to the Screening, the subject experiences daily "wearingoff" episodes with periods of bradykinesia and rigidity and experiences an "off" state upon awakening on most mornings by history. Responsive to CD‑LD therapy and currently being treated on a stable regimen with CD‑LD for at least 4 weeks prior to Visit 1 Typically experiences an "on" response with the first dose of IR CD‑LD of the day (by subject history). By history, efficacy of the first morning dose of IR CDLD lasts less than 4 hours History of medical conditions or of a prior surgical procedure that would interfere with LD absorption, such as gastrectomy or proximal smallbowel resection. Liver enzyme values ≥ 2.5 x the upper limit of normal; or history of severe hepatic impairment. History of drug or alcohol abuse within the 12 months prior to Screening. Received within 4 weeks of Visit 1 or planning to take during participation in the clinical study: any doses of a controlledrelease (CR) LD apart from a single daily bedtime dose or any doses of Rytary, additional CD (eg, Lodosyn) or benserazide (eg, Serazide), or catecholOmethyl transferase inhibitors (entacapone or tolcapone) or medications containing these inhibitors (Stalevo). Received within 4 weeks of Visit 1 or planning to take during participation in the clinical study: nonselective monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, apomorphine, or dopaminergic blocking agents including antiemetics. History of psychosis within the past 10 years. Treatment with any dopamine antagonist antipsychotics for the purposes of psychosis or bipolar disorder within the last 2 years. Based on clinical assessment, subject does not adequately comprehend the terminology needed to complete the PD Diary.</criteria>
