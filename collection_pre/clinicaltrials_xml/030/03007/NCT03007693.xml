	<brief_title>A Study to Investigate Safety and Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of JNJ 61393215 in Healthy Participants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Healthy male participants between 18 and 55 years of age, inclusive Participants must have a body mass index (BMI) between 18.0 and 30.0 kilogram per square meter (kg/m^2), inclusive (BMI = weight/height square) Participant must be healthy on the basis of physical examination, medical history, vital signs, and 12lead ECG [incl. QTcF less than or equal to [&lt;=] 450 milliseconds (msec) for males] performed at screening and admission to the clinical unit. Minor abnormalities in electrocardiogram (ECG), which are not considered to be of clinical significance by the investigator, are acceptable. The presence of Left Bundle Branch Block (LBBB), AV Block (second degree or higher), or a permanent pacemaker or implantable cardioverter defibrillator [ICD] will lead to exclusion Participants must be healthy on the basis of clinical laboratory tests performed at screening. If the results of the serum chemistry panel, hematology, or urinalysis are outside the normal reference ranges, the Participant may be included only if the investigator judges the abnormalities to be not clinically significant. This determination must be recorded in the Participant's source documents and initialed by the investigator A man who is sexually active with a woman of childbearing potential and has not had a vasectomy must agree to use a barrier method of contraception e.g., either condom with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository during the study and for a minimum of 1 spermatogenesis cycle (defined as approximately 90 days) after receiving the last dose of study drug. All men must also not donate sperm during the study and for 3 months after receiving the last dose of study drug. In addition, their female partner should also use a highly effective method of contraception for at least the same duration. Examples of highly effective contraceptives include implantable progestogenonly hormone contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation; intrauterine device (IUD); intrauterine hormonereleasing system (IUS); vasectomized partner; sexual abstinence (sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study drug. The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant.), combined (estrogen and progestogencontaining) hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation: oral, intravaginal, and transdermal; progestogenonly hormone contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation: oral and injectable. Participants must be willing to adhere to the prohibitions and restrictions specified in this protocol Participant has a history of or current liver or renal insufficiency; significant cardiac, vascular, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, endocrine, neurologic, hematologic, rheumatologic, psychiatric, or metabolic disturbances, any inflammatory illness or any other illness, though minor deviations, which are not considered to be of clinical significance to both the investigator and to the Janssen Safety Responsible Physician, are acceptable Current or past history of any psychiatric disorder as classified according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental DisordersIV (DSMIV) or DSMV, with the exclusion of an anxiety disorder (i.e., panic disorder with or without agoraphobia, social anxiety disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder) Participant has any liver function test (including alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST], gammaglutamyltransferase [gGT], alkaline phosphatase [ALP and bilirubin] at screening exceeding the upper limit of normal Participant has estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &lt;60 milliliter per minute (mL/min)/1.73m^2 at screening (provided by the local laboratory) Participant has a heart rate &lt; 50 beats per minute (bpm) or &gt; 100 bpm or systolic blood pressure greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 150 millimeter of mercury (mmHg) at screening or at admission to the clinical unit</criteria>
