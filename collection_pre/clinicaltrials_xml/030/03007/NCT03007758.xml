	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine how the robotic retromuscular hernia repair compares to the open retromuscular hernia repair for large hernia defects in patients at higher risk of wound complications.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Open Versus Robotic Retromuscular Ventral Hernia Repair</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All patients presenting to the Greenville Health System Hernia Center who meet the inclusion criteria will be considered for enrollment. Patients who qualify and agree to participate will be randomized 1:1 to robotic retromuscular ventral hernia repair or open retromuscular ventral hernia repair. Data to be collected includes the following: demographic information, medical characteristics, medications, medical and surgical history, operative details, hospital stay data, and patient-reported outcomes via a quality of life questionnaire. Post-operative follow-up will occur at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 6 months, 1 year and 2 years.</detailed_description>
