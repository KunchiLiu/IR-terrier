	<brief_title>Glucose Monitoring During Threatening Preterm Birth in Patients With and Without Gestational Diabetes Mellitus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND: The therapy with glucocorticoids for fetal lung maturation in the case of threatening preterm birth is an long existing part of the obstetric routine procedures. Under this therapy it should not be forgotten, that glucocorticoids can lead to a decrease of the maternal insulin sensitivity as well as they can cause an impaired maternal glucose tolerance. Therefore a threatening preterm birth as well as the including medical therapy do challenge the glucose metabolism of mother and child. Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is one of the most common complications during pregnancy, and the numbers are on the rise. GDM is characterized through an insulin resistance during the pregnancy. High blood glucose level during pregnancy or labour can cause complications like a fetal hypoglycaemia right after birth. METHODS: This study includes pregnant women with and without gestational diabetes who are medicated with betamethasone due to threatening preterm birth. In this study the blood glucose measurements of one week, as well as the measurements of HbA1C, Insulin and Blood Glucose from a blood draw one week after the lung maturation therapy will be considered.</detailed_description>
