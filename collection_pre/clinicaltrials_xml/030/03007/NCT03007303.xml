	<brief_summary>This study investigates the relationship of circulating microRNA-30e and schizophrenia, and shows the relevance of the aberrant microRNA-30e expression in plasma with the variation disease status.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Relevance Between the microRNA-30e in Plasma and the Prognosis of Schizophrenia Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The plasma samples from 15 individuals with schizophrenia (with a diagnosis of ICD-10) and the equivalent healthy controls will be conducted with the quantification analysis of the microRNA-30e via real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction(RT-PCR). The 15 patients enrolled should be the first-episode and have not been treated, or were drug free 3 months recently at least. This research measures the expression level of microRNA-30e in schizophrenia respectively before the beginning treatment with atypical psychotics or combined with MECT, after the 4-week treated , the 8-week treated compared with 15 healthy controls.</detailed_description>
