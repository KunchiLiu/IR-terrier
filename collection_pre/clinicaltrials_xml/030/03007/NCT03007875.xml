	<brief_title>High-activity Natural Killer Immunotherapy for Small Metastases of Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>By enrolling patients with small metastases of non-small cell lung cancer adapted to enrolled criteria, this study will document for the first time the safety and the short and long term efficacy of high-activity natural killer cells. The safety will be evaluated by statistics of adverse reactions. The efficacy will be evaluated according to local relief degree, progress free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).</detailed_description>
