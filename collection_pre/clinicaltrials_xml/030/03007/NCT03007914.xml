	<brief_title>Effect of Traditional Chinese Medicine on Outcomes in COPD Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>COPD, with high prevalence, morbidity, mortality and economic burdens, affects millions worldwide. Although many therapies exist and are being developed to relieve symptoms and reduce mortality in COPD, most have only been studied in placebo-controlled efficacy studies in highly selected populations. There are few clinical trials to compare therapeutic alternatives in real world. Furthermore, some randomized controlled trials on comprehensive TCM interventions, especially based on the TCM patterns, have been the certain evidence for showing definite effect for COPD patients. In addition, studies in real world populations of COPD that received different therapies that do have efficacy evidence was found wide variations in care delivery. In short, there is a need for cohort study in COPD. This is a multi-center, prospective, cohort study to evaluate the effectiveness of TCM on COPD patients. The cohort study will enroll approximately 2540 patients that in two cohort, one, TCM cohort, which have been evaluated and have certain effect; the other, conventional medicine treatments cohort, based on 2015 Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD).Subjects in two cohort will be followed-up 2 years.The primary outcome measure is the frequency of exacerbations. The secondary efficacy measures include mortality rate and all-cause mortality, FEV1, dyspnea (MMRC), exercise capacity( 6MWD), quality of life ( CAT, SF-36 and COPD-PRO), and effectiveness satisfaction with treatment(ESQ-COPD).</detailed_description>
