	<brief_summary>This is a single-center cross-sectional imaging study in patients with localized bladder cancer undergoing neoadjuvant atezolizumab as part of a companion clinical trial (NCT02451423; Phase 2 study of atezolizumab in non-metastatic bladder transitional cell carcinoma), and patients with locally advanced or metastatic bladder cancer receiving standard of care (SOC) atezolizumab. For the neoadjuvant cohort, study participants will undergo whole body PET(Positron Emission Tomography)/MR(Magnetic Resonance) imaging with [18F]F-AraG within 7 days of initiating atezolizumab and within 7 days before surgery. For the SOC cohort, study participants will undergo whole body PET/MR imaging with [18F]F-AraG within 7 days of initiating atezolizumab and between Day 14 and Day 21 of Cycle 1 atezolizumab.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is a single-center cross-sectional imaging study in patients with localized bladder cancer undergoing neoadjuvant atezolizumab as part of a companion clinical trial (NCT02451423; Phase 2 study of atezolizumab in non-metastatic bladder transitional cell carcinoma), and patients with locally advanced or metastatic bladder cancer receiving standard of care (SOC) atezolizumab. For the neoadjuvant cohort, study participants will undergo whole body PET/MR imaging with [18F]F-AraG within 7 days of initiating atezolizumab and within 7 days before surgery. For the SOC cohort, study participants will undergo whole body PET/MR imaging with [18F]F-AraG within 7 days of initiating atezolizumab and between Day 14 and Day 21 of Cycle 1 atezolizumab, where a Simon's two-stage design will be utilized. A total of 31 patients will be enrolled over an accrual period of approximately 20 months. 12 patients will be enrolled in the neoadjuvant atezolizumab cohort, and approximately 19 patients will be enrolled in the SOC atezolizumab cohort. Patients will be evaluated one day and one week via telephone visit after each radiopharmaceutical injection for safety follow-up. All adverse events will be recorded. Due to the noninvasive and non-therapeutic nature of the study, potential risks of the study are anticipated to be low. To the investigator's knowledge, this is the first study to investigate changes in activated T cell localization in the setting of immunotherapy for bladder cancer utilizing functional PET imaging.</detailed_description>
