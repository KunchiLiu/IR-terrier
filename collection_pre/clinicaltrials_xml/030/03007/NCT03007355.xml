	<brief_summary>Hypotensive anesthesia is effective in reducing the intraoperative blood loss. The risk of hypoperfusion of vital organs continues to be a concern. An adequate monitoring of tissue perfusion and oxygenation is crucial issue. Peripheral Perfusion Index (PPI) as a noninvasive new monitoring, can reflect the peripheral perfusion dynamics. This study is designed to explore the behavior and trend of PPI during deliberate hypotensive anesthesia in adult patients undergoing functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS).</brief_summary>
