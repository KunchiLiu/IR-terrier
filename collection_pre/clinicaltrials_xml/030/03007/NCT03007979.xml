	<brief_summary>The investigators propose to conduct a study to test an alternative dosing schedule of palbociclib. With the current three-week on and one week off schedule, a significant number of patients develop grade 3 or higher degree of neutropenia and require dose reduction and sometimes discontinuation. This potentially compromises the efficacy of the drug. In addition, as the half-life of palbociclib is 27 hours, 1 week break with the standard 3 weeks on and 1 week off dosing schedule could potentially lead to recovery of Rb phosphorylation during the off week. Hence, the investigators propose a 5 days on and 2 days off schedule each week without any weeks off drug. Although the cumulative doses each 28-day cycle is roughly the same with this schedule compared to conventional dosing, the bone marrow is not exposed to the drug continuously for 21 days and rather gets frequent breaks from therapy. The investigators hypothesize that the 5 days on and 2 days off schedule is more tolerable with less frequent high grade neutropenia and dose interruption/reduction. In addition, this schedule also provides for a more continuous drug delivery to the patient since there is not a week's break in therapy, which could ultimately prove to be more efficacious.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Histologically confirmed metastatic ER+ and/or PR+ and HER2 breast cancer who are candidates for palbociclib in combination with either letrozole or fulvestrant per treating physician. Presence of measurable or nonmeasurable disease by RECIST 1.1 criteria. One prior systemic therapy in the metastatic setting is allowed, but patients who have not had any prior systemic therapies in the metastatic setting are also eligible. At least 18 years of age. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤ 2 Normal bone marrow and organ function as defined below: Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mcl Platelets ≥ 100,000/mcl Total bilirubin ≤ institutional upper limit of normal (IULN) or total bilirubin ≤ 3.0 x IULN with direct bilirubin within normal range in patients with documented Gilbert's syndrome AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) ≤ 1.5 x IULN (up to 5 x IULN in patients with liver disease) Creatinine ≤ IULN OR creatinine clearance ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for patients with serum creatinine levels above institutional normal Pre or postmenopausal women are allowed. If pre or perimenopausal, concurrent ovarian suppression for pre or perimenopausal women is required. Women of childbearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control, abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she must inform her treating physician immediately. Able to swallow and retain oral medication. Washout of at least 3 weeks from prior chemotherapy or targeted therapy that induces myelosuppression and recovery of treatment related adverse events to grade 1 or less, with the exception of alopecia, is required prior to the start of palbociclib. Ability to understand and willingness to sign an Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved written informed consent document (or that of legally authorized representative, if applicable). Prior therapy with any CDK inhibitor. Currently receiving any other investigational agents. Currently receiving exogenous hormone therapy (topical vaginal estrogen therapy is allowed). Known brain metastases. Patients with known brain metastases must be excluded from this clinical trial because of their poor prognosis which could affect the evaluation of allcycle adverse events. A history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to palbociclib or other agents used in the study. Receiving any medications or substances that are potent inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A isoenzymes within 7 days prior to registration. Clinically significant history of liver disease. A condition that would interfere with enteric absorption. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, or cardiac arrhythmia. Pregnant and/or breastfeeding. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within 7 days of study entry. Known HIVpositivity on combination antiretroviral therapy because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with palbociclib. In addition, these patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrowsuppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.</criteria>
