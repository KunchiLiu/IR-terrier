	<brief_summary>This is a non-comparative open-label multicenter Phase 2 clinical trial combining definitive prostatic radiotherapy (RT) and pembrolizumab with or without intratumoral SD-101 in patients with newly diagnosed hormone-naive oligometastatic prostate cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pembrolizumab in Combination With Intratumoral SD-101 Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A safety lead-in for each treatment arm will be performed prior to full 1:1 randomization into each arm. Definitive RT to the whole prostate gland will be delivered via high-dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy on Day 1 and Day 8 (+7 days) of Cycle 1 pembrolizumab in each arm. Immediately before RT, SD-101 will be delivered to the dominant prostatic lesion on Day 1 and Day 8 (+7 days) of Cycle 1 pembrolizumab in Arm 2. SD-101 will be administered intratumorally in concert with placement of the HDR brachytherapy catheters. Pembrolizumab will be continued for a total of 13 cycles, until disease progression, or unacceptable toxicity, whichever occurs first. Patients will receive 3 months of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) run-in, followed by combined androgen blockade (CAB) for 9 months, then discontinuation of ADT. Primary outcome is to evaluate the rate of prostate specific antigen (PSA) &lt; nadir +2 ng/mL at 15 and 24 month from the start of treatment among patients with non-castrate levels of testosterone (&gt;150 ng/dL). Serum, archival prostate biopsy, mandatory baseline metastatic tumor biopsy, and optional repeat biopsy at time of progression, will be obtained to characterize circulating and intratumoral immune responses.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Be willing and able to provide written informed consent/assent for the trial. Be &gt;=18 years of age on day of signing informed consent. Have a performance status of 0 or 1 on the ECOG Performance Scale. Histologically documented adenocarcinoma of the prostate Oligometastatic disease. In order to be eligible, the patient must have a total of &lt;4 metastatic bone and/or metastatic lymph node sites based on bone and/or soft tissue lesions as defined by any of the following: Bone metastases will be defined by bone imaging. If the patient has technetium bone scan and/or NaF PET performed, either study may be used for documenting metastases; both scans do not need to show the number of metastases required for study entry. For patients undergoing PSMA PET, only PSMA avid lesions that have a CT or MRI correlate will be counted as a site of metastasis. Distant metastatic lymph node disease. A lymph node ≥1 cm in shortest dimension will be noted as involved with disease. Distant metastatic lymph nodes will be determined as any lymph nodes outside the confine of the true pelvis. For patients undergoing PSMA PET, only PSMA avid lesions that have a CT or MRI correlate will be counted as a site of metastasis. Any other soft tissue lesion deemed by the physician to be consistent with distant metastatic disease i.e. lung and liver metastases. For patients undergoing PSMA PET, only PSMA avid lesions that have a CT or MRI correlate will be counted as a site of metastasis. Treatment naïve, defined as less than 2 months of standard of care ADT (e.g. GNRH agonist or antagonist with or without antiandrogen) for metastatic hormonesensitive prostate cancer prior to enrollment No prior chemotherapy for prostate cancer Not a candidate for or refuse chemotherapy No prior prostatectomy or prostatic radiation PSA &gt;2 ng/mL at baseline or prior to initiation of hormonal therapy Baseline testosterone &gt;150 ng/dL if patient has not initiated hormonal therapy Available archival tumor tissue for correlative studies. Submission of archival TRUS prostate biopsy tissue is required if available, in the form of representative formalinfixed paraffinembedded (FFPE) tumor specimens in paraffin blocks (preferred) or at least 15 slides, with an associated pathology report. If archival prostate tissue are unavailable or cannot be obtained, a repeat TRUS prostate biopsy is not required for eligibility. Consent to undergo a mandatory baseline biopsy of a metastatic tumor, if clinically feasible and safe to perform. Acceptable samples include core needle biopsies of bone or lymph node. At least three cores should be obtained. A fine needle aspirate is not acceptable. Subjects have the option of consenting to a repeat biopsy at time of progression. Consent to undergo mandatory intraoperative prostatic core biopsies at the time of HDR brachytherapy with or without SD101 therapy, depending on study arm. The effects of pembrolizumab on the developing human fetus is unknown. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must agree to use adequate contraception prior to the first dose of study therapy, for the duration of the study participation, and for 120 days after the last dose of study therapy. Demonstrate adequate organ function as defined in Table 1, all screening labs should be performed within 10 days of treatment initiation. Adequate Organ Function Laboratory Values: Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1,500 /mcL Platelets ≥100,000 / mcL Hemoglobin ≥9 g/dL or ≥5.6 mmol/L without transfusion or EPO dependency (within 7 days of assessment) Serum creatinine OR Measured or calculated creatinine clearance (GFR can also be used in place of creatinine or CrCl) ≤1.5 X upper limit of normal (ULN) OR ≥60 mL/min for subject with creatinine levels &gt; 1.5 X institutional ULN Serum total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 X ULN OR Direct bilirubin ≤ ULN for subjects with total bilirubin levels &gt; 1.5 ULN AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) ≤ 2.5 X ULN OR ≤ 5 X ULN for subjects with liver metastases Albumin &gt;2.5 mg/dL International Normalized Ratio (INR) or Prothrombin Time (PT) Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT) ≤1.5 X ULN unless subject is receiving anticoagulant therapy as long as PT or PTT is within therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulants ≤1.5 X ULN unless subject is receiving anticoagulant therapy as long as PT or PTT is within therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulants Creatinine clearance should be calculated per institutional standard. Subjects should agree to use an adequate method of contraception prior to the first dose of study therapy through 120 days after the last dose of study therapy. Their partners should also be encouraged to use proper method of contraception. Patients who are not appropriate candidates for prostate brachytherapy.
