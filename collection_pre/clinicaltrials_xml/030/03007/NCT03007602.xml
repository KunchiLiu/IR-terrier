	<brief_summary>Hematologic malignancy is a tumor of myeloid or lymphatic cells that affects lymph nodes with the involvement of blood, bone marrow or other organs.There are various treatment options for hematological malignancies ranging from follow-up to single or multiple agent chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy and autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplants. The general recommendation for patients is to relax and avoid intense exercise, regardless of the devastating consequences of neglecting physical exercise. Patients also go to relaxation by reducing their activity to avoid fatigue, which leads to loss of muscle strength and endurance in patients. As a consequence of all, fatigue, vomiting, weight loss, anemia, depression, decrease in aerobic capacity, loss of muscle strength, decrease in physical function and worsening of quality of life are observed in stem cell recipients. It has been shown that physical exercises improve oxygen consumption, depression and fatigue, cardiorespiratory fitness, muscle strength and physical well-being in patients with hematologic malignancies being stages of various treatment. In literature, effects of upper extremity aerobic exercise have been investigated in patients with spinal cord injury, neuromuscular diseases, claudication, hypertension, multiple sclerosis, heart failure, paraplegic patients and healthy individuals. Results of these studies has shown that upper extremity aerobic exercise improves walking distance, increases oxygen pulse, muscle strength and endurance of upper extremity. No study was observed to investigate the effects of upper extremity aerobic exercise on exercise capacity and quality of life in hematopoietic stem cell recipients, according to our knowledge. For this reason, our aim is to investigate the effects of upper extremity aerobic exercise on exercise capacity and quality of life in hematopoietic stem cell recipients.</brief_summary>
