	<brief_summary>This randomized phase III trial studies how well imatinib mesylate and combination chemotherapy work in treating patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Imatinib mesylate may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving imatinib mesylate and combination chemotherapy may work better in treating patients with Philadelphia chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Imatinib Mesylate and Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Philadelphia Chromosome Positive Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To compare disease-free survival (DFS) of standard risk pediatric Philapdelphia chromosome (Ph)+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) treated with continuous imatinib mesylate (imatinib) combined with either a high-risk Children's Oncology Group (COG)/Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster (BFM) ALL chemotherapy backbone or the more intensive European (Es)PhALL chemotherapy backbone. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the feasibility of administration of imatinib after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in high risk Ph+ ALL patients. II. To determine disease-free survival (DFS) of high risk pediatric Ph+ ALL patients treated with EsPhALL chemotherapy, HSCT in first complete remission and post-HSCT imatinib. III. To compare rates of grade 3 or higher infections in standard risk Ph+ ALL patients between the two randomized arms. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To describe the toxicities associated with post-HSCT administration of imatinib. II. To evaluate the long-term toxicities in patients treated with chemotherapy plus imatinib (no transplant), and explore the differences between arms. III. To determine prognostic significance of minimal residual disease (MRD) in Ph+ ALL at various time points during therapy. IV. To determine the prognostic significance of MRD at end of Induction IA. V. To evaluate MRD during post-Induction IB therapy in standard risk (SR) patients and explore whether there are any differences between randomized arms in the proportion of patients with non-detectable MRD at each time point. VI. To evaluate MRD in high risk (HR) patients just prior to HSCT and then at regular intervals post-HSCT and explore the association of these measurements with long-term outcome. VII. To evaluate concordance of MRD assessments made by immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH)-T cell receptor (TCR) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay and next generation sequencing (NGS) assays. VIII. To determine prognostic significance of IKZF1 gene aberrations and deletions. IX. To determine frequency and prognostic significance of p210 BCR-ABL1 fusion variants in pediatric Ph+ ALL. X. To measure adherence to oral chemotherapeutic agents (imatinib, 6-mercaptopurine, and methotrexate) for 6 months during the maintenance phase in standard risk Ph+ ALL patients. XI. To identify factors associated with poor adherence. XII. To determine association between relapse risk and adherence to each oral chemotherapeutic agent (separately and combined). XIII. To measure adherence to imatinib after allogeneic HSCT in high risk Ph+ ALL patients and identify factors associated with poor adherence.
