	<brief_summary>This research is a randomized smoking cessation trial conducted within and specifically personalized for lung cancer screening patients presenting to a lung screening clinic. Novel tobacco treatments for this population are critically needed, given the growing population of lung screening patients, which will grow dramatically now that lung screening is an approved CMS benefit. In the proposed study, we will test a gain-framed messaging intervention specifically designed for lung screening patients (vs. unframed messaging), as well as evaluating NRT sampling (vs. no medication) at 2 study sites. Our project is designed to be translational (in that it can be transferable from our controlled efficacy study to other lung screening programs).</brief_summary>
