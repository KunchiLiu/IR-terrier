	<brief_title>Comparative Population Pharmacodynamic Modeling for Sevoflurane Effects Using ADMS and Bispectral Index</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Intraoperative awareness under general anesthesia is rare, but it may cause serious psychological sequelae. Anesthetic depth monitoring system based on electroencephalography(EEG) or evoked potential are broadly used methods. Bispectral index (BIS) monitor is most popular anesthetic depth monitoring system. Anesthetic depth monitoring for sedation (ADMS) is developed in Korea as an electroencephalographic monitor for measuring the depth of anesthesia. The investigators want to compare the performance of ADMS to the bispectral index (BIS) as electroencephalographic measures of sevoflurane effect using two combined sigmoidal Emax models via population pharmacodynamic approach.</detailed_description>
