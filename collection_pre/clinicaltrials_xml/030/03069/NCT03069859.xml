	<brief_summary>Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) occurs in up to one in ten deliveries worldwide and is the leading cause of maternal morbidity and mortality. In developing countries 30% of women develop PPH because access to a number of treatments is not readily available. Interestingly, the rate of PPH and consequently of maternal morbidity has increased significantly even in developed nations, such as Canada, over the past decades. This rate is also increasing amongst parturients in Ontario. Unfortunately, few effective preventative treatments exist. Antifibrinolytic drugs are routinely used to reduce bleeding and the requirement for blood transfusions in a wide range of hemorrhagic conditions. The most commonly used antifibrinolytic drug is tranexamic acid (TXA). TXA is safe, affordable, with very few side effects. The World Health Organization recommended that TXA be used to reduce blood loss in several conditions, including in patients with established PPH refractory to conventional therapy.However, little is known about the prophylactic use of TXA to prevent PPH.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use of TXA to Prevent Postpartum Hemorrhage</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This pragmatic, singlecentered, doubleblinded, randomized-controlled pilot trial will assess the feasibility of administering a prophylactic dose of TXA to prevent the onset of PPH amongst parturients undergoing cesarean section and spontaneous vaginal delivery. Our primary outcome will be to determine the proportion of patients who receive the investigational product successfully. Our secondary outcomes include 1) additional feasibility endpoints余 2) safety endpoints and 3) various other clinical endpoints. These clinical endpoints include a) incidence of PPH (and severe PPH)余 b) total number of transfusions余 c) use of uterotonic drugs余 and d) hospital length of stay. The investigators anticipate that TXA can be safely administered to parturients prior to delivery. The investigators also believe it will be an effective prophylactic therapy for PPH and will reduce its severity and associated morbidity. Results from this trial will be used to design and conduct a larger multicentered trial, powered to assess the outcomes of interest. Furthermore, this prophylactic use of TXA for PPH could improve outcomes of parturients not only in Ontario but worldwide where effective management of PPH remains an ongoing challenge.</detailed_description>
