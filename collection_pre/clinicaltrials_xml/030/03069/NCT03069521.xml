	<brief_title>Study to Evaluate the Safety of the EndoArt™ for Treatment of Subjects Suffering From Corneal Edema</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Title: Prospective, feasibility study to evaluate the safety of the EndoArt™ for treatment of subjects suffering from corneal edema Device: EndoArt™ (Artificial Endothelial Layer) Intended Use: The EndoArt™ device is intended for use as an endothelial kearatoprosthesis in patients with chronic cornel edema Study Design: Prospective open-label feasibility clinical study Study Objectives: To evaluate the safety of the EndoArt™ implanted in subjects suffering from corneal edema. Study Hypothesis: Treatment with the EndoArt™ is safe and may result in alleviating symptoms resulting from chronic corneal edema (corneal thickness). Study population: Men and women suffering from a decrease in vision due to chronic corneal edema that meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria and provide written Informed Consent will enrolled in the study. Enrollment: A total of 12 subjects will be enrolled. Study Duration: Completion of active enrolment is anticipated to last approximately 12 months. The primary end point will be achieved when the final study subject has completed 6 month follow up. Subject will be followed up to 12 month. Primary Safety Endpoint: The frequency and severity of all treatment-related adverse events, during and after implantation of the EndoArt™ and throughout the 6 month follow-up period. Adverse events will be assessed on a continuous basis from the procedure through the study completion at 6 months. Related adverse events include: corneal perforation, melting, uncontrolled inflammation, severe infection. Secondary Efficacy Endpoints: Corneal thickness, Subjective corneal clarity, Pain as assessed by a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) Measurement Best Corrected Distance Visual Acuity (BCDVA) Study Treatment: Subjects will be implanted with the EndoArt™</detailed_description>
