	<brief_summary>We wish to perform a multicenter, double-blind RCT with two parallel-group stratified on the center, comparing rifaximin to no rifaximin (placebo) for the primary prophylaxis of SBP in 'severe' cirrhotic patients with large ascites. The primary outcome will be the 12-month survival.</brief_summary>
