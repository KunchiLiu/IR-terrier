Patients must have demonstrated at least a PR to rituximab if previously administered. Patient consent according to institutional and university human experimentation committee requirements Adequate Renal, hepatic and hematopoietic function test unless the abnormal values are thought to be due to involvement with lymphoma as defined by: Hb&gt; 85 ANC &gt;1000/mm3 Platelets &gt;100,000/mm3 Serum/Total Bilirubin &gt;=2 SI units AST/ALT &lt;2x Upper Limit of Normal Positive serology for HIV Uncontrolled Infection Pregnancy CNS Metastases History of Psychiatric Disorder Other Malignancy (except nonmelanoma skin cancer) Serious nonmalignant disease (e.g., congestive heart failure, or active uncontrolled bacterial, viral, or fungal infections), or other conditions, which, in the opinion of the investigator and/or the sponsor, would compromise other protocol objectives. Major surgery, other than diagnostic surgery, within four weeks. Presence of antimurine antibody (HAMA) reactivity. These laboratory results must be available prior to receiving treatment for those patients who have received prior murine proteins or patients who have allergies to murine proteins.
