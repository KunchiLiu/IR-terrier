	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to identify and compare complication rates between autologous breast reconstruction techniques with and without the inclusion on intraoperative indocyanine green (ICG) angiography.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intraoperative Indocyanine Green Laser Angiography; Postoperative Outcomes for Autologous Tissue Flaps</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ICG-angiography is a real-time visualization of tissue perfusion using intravenous fluorescence. It allows the surgeon a tool for intraoperatively assessment of tissue perfusion of the autologous flap, providing a basis for trimming of hypo perfused areas. The study evaluates the effect of inclusion of this technique by examine postoperative outcomes retrospectively. This is done by differentiation between major and minor complications to evaluate the greatest gains of the intervention.</detailed_description>
