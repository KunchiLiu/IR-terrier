	<brief_title>Restenosis Intrastent: Bioresorbable Vascular Scaffolds Treatment With Scoring Balloon Pre-dilatation (RIBS VI Scoring)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Treatment of patients with ISR remains a challenge. Currently both drug-eluting stents (DES) and drug-coated balloons (DCB) are considered as the strategies of choice in this setting. However, data on the value of BVS in patients with ISR is scarce. BVS are very effective to inhibit neointimal proliferation and they avoid the need of implanting a new permanent metal layer. Accordingly, currently, there is a major interest to elucidate the potential value of BVS in patients with ISR. The use of scoring balloon pre-dilatation has not been studied previously in this setting. This prospective Spanish multicenter study will assess the clinical and angiographic outcome of patients with ISR treated with BVS with scoring balloon pre-dilatation. BVS will be implanted in selected patients (fulfilling inclusion and exclusion criteria) presenting with either BMS-ISR or DES-ISR. Care will be paid to ensure device optimization. Scoring balloon pre-dilatation is mandatory. Angiographic follow-up will be obtained at 6-9 months. A centralized angiographic corelab will be used to provide QCA measurements. Clinical follow-up will be also obtained at 1 year and then yearly. Clinical events will be adjudicated by an independent Clinical Event Committee.</detailed_description>
