	<brief_title>Phase II Study of Docetaxel Before Degarelix in Patients With Newly Diagnosed Metastatic Prostate Cancer.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will look at two drugs, docetaxel and degarelix, which are both FDA approved for the treatment of prostate cancer. Docetaxel is a standard chemotherapy treatment for metastatic prostate cancer. Degarelix is an androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) agent that decreases the amount of testosterone in the body, which helps to fight tumor growth. Usually, docetaxel is given after ADT. This study will look at how your cancer changes when docetaxel is started before ADT. You are being asked to participate in this study because you have metastatic prostate cancer that can be treated with docetaxel and ADT.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histological or cytological diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the prostate. Metastatic disease identified via radiographic assessment by CT scans of the chest, abdomen, pelvis, and nuclear bone scan. MRI may be used if deemed necessary by the investigator. See section 8.5 for more details about radiographic assessment requirements. More specifically, patients must have at least one of the following at time of study enrollment: Any visceral metastases identified by CT scans or MRI. Site(s) of bony metastasis identified by nuclear bone scan, MRI, and/or CT scan. Lymph node based disease not considered to be within a single radiation therapy port (e.g. at or above the aortic bifurcation.) Noncastrate testosterone level, &gt;50 ng/dl, at study enrollment. Age greater than or equal to 18 years. ECOG performance status 02. Meet the following hematologic criteria within 14 days of enrollment to trial: Absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1,500/mm3 Hemoglobin &gt; 8.0 g/dl (may be transfused) Platelet count &gt; 100,000 mm3 Have adequate endorgan function as defined by the following parameters. All lab values must be obtained within 14 days of enrollment to trial: Creatinine clearance of &gt; 30 ml/min. Creatinine clearance should be determined by the CockcroftGault formula (Appendix A) AST &lt; 2 x institutional ULN ALT &lt; 2 x institutional ULN Total bilirubin &lt; institutional ULN aPTT, PT and INR &lt; 1.5 x institutional ULN (unless on therapeutic anticoagulation). Agree to use barrier methods of birth control during the docetaxel portion of the protocol and for at least one month after last docetaxel administration. Informed and must sign and give written informed consent in accordance with institutional and federal guidelines. CNS metastases (brain or leptomeningeal). Osseous metastases felt in the opinion of the clinician to be highrisk for impending pathologic fracture or spinal cord compression. Active cardiac disease defined as symptomatic congestive heart failure, history of NYHA Class III or IV Heart Failure, uncontrollable supraventricular arrhythmias, any history of a ventricular arrhythmia, active angina pectoris, myocardial infarction or coronary intervention within 6 months of registration. Prior malignancy requiring systemic therapy within the last 5 years except for treated basal or squamous cell skin cancer. History of lowgrade malignancies with limited potential to progress as determined by the primary investigator may be enrolled. Subjects must not have received any previous androgen deprivation therapy (LHRH agonist or LHRH antagonist) or cytotoxic therapy for prostate cancer in the metastatic setting.</criteria>
