	<brief_summary>This study evaluates blood type 2 innate lymphoid cells in participants with mild to moderate asthma and participants with chronic urticaria as compared to healthy adult participants.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Role of Circulating Innate Lymphoid Cells in Allergic Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The first objective of this study is to determine whether blood ILC2s differ in female vs. male allergic asthmatics. This is because females become more susceptible to asthma after puberty and experience more severe disease as adults. The second objective of this study is to determine whether ILC2 cells in chronic urticaria differ from healthy controls. There will be one shared healthy control adult subject group for comparison for objective 1 and 2. In this study, there will be a blood draw once on 3 different adult populations aged 19-50 years: 1) Participants with mild-to moderate allergic asthma; 2) Participants with chronic urticaria, and 3) Healthy control adult participants. Demographics and allergy indicators will be collected from the medical chart. The investigators will acquire whole blood for serum and acquisition of specific lymphocyte populations. There will be no intervention or research follow up.</detailed_description>
