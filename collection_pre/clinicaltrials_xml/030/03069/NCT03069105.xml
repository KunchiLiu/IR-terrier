	<brief_title>An Exploratory Study of Caregiver Burden Among Family Caregivers of Patients With Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal of this study is to explore caregiver burden and the coping behavior of caregivers of patients with cancer. It has been documented that non-professional caregivers and long-term care providers to patients with cancer receive little preparation, information, or support to perform their vital role. Through this study, the investigators will identify the relationship between cognitive dysfunction, resilience, social support, cognitive appraisal, coping behavior, and caregiver burden, anxiety, and depression among family caregivers of patients with cancer. The findings of this study will direct future intervention studies to reduce caregiver burden and improve outcomes for the many individuals caring for family members with cancer.</detailed_description>
