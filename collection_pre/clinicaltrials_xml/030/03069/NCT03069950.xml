	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to see if patients treated with both regional chemotherapy using the HAI pump and intravenous chemotherapy are able to have their liver tumors removed surgically (resected), versus treatment with only intravenous chemotherapy.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>History of histologically confirmed colorectal adenocarcinoma metastatic to the liver with no clinical or radiographic evidence of extrahepatic disease. Confirmation of diagnosis must be performed by the enrolling institution. Confirmed RAS/RAF wild type tumor. Paraffinembedded tumor tissue obtained from the primary tumor or metastasis Have received prior treatment for metastatic disease with oxaliplatinbased regimen and had disease progression °Please note: Patients who have received prior oxaliplatinbased regimens in the adjuvant settings are not eligible. Oxaliplatin must have been given in the metastatic setting. Patients must meet the following criteria for unresectability as determined by two hepatobiliary surgeons and one radiologist: When a margin negative resection would require resection of all three hepatic veins, both portal veins, or the retrohepatic vena cava. Requiring a resection that leaves less than 2 hepatic segments (not including the caudate lobe) behind with adequate arterial/portal inflow, venous outflow and biliary drainage. ** **A patient is considered resectable if the procedure includes a minor wedge or thermoablation encompassing 10% or less of the volume of the remaining 2 segments. Patient‟s liver metastases must comprise &lt;70% of the liver parenchyma. All patients must be clinically fit to undergo surgery as determined by the preoperative evaluation Lab values within 14 days prior to enrollment/randomization: WBC ≥ 3.0 K/uL ANC &gt; 1.5 K/uL Platelets ≥ 100,000/uL Renal function (≤ 10 days prior to enrollment/randomization) °Creatinine ≤ 1.5 mg/dL or creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min calculated by the CockcroftGault method as follows: CockcroftGault method as follows: Male creatinine clearance = (140 age in years) x (weight in Kg) / (serum Cr in mg/dl x 72) Female creatinine clearance = (140 age in years) x (weight in Kg) x 0.85 / (serum Cr in mg/dl x 72) (use of creatinine clearance per protocol based on chemotherapy regimen) Hepatic function, as follows: (≤ 10 days prior to enrollment/randomization) Total Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 mg/dl Calcium ≥ lower limit of normal (≤ 48 hours prior to enrollment/randomization) KPS ≥ 60% (ECOG (or Karnofsky) performance status (preferably 0 or 1/≥ 60% for Karnofsky)) Patients &lt; 18 years of age Patients who have received more than one chemotherapy regimen for metastatic disease Patients who are chemotherapy naïve Prior radiation to the liver (Prior radiation therapy to the pelvis is acceptable if completed at least 4 weeks prior to registration) Active infection °Active infection includes patients with positive blood cultures Prior treatment with HAI FUDR Prior TACE Female patients who are pregnant or lactating or planning to become pregnant within 6 months after the end of the treatment (female patients of childbearing potential must have negative pregnancy test ≤ 72 hours before enrollment and randomization, and must have a negative pregnancy test ≤ 72 hours prior to treatment start) If a patient has any serious medical problems which may preclude receiving this type of treatment Patients with history or known presence of primary CNS tumors, seizures not wellcontrolled with standard medical therapy, or history of stroke will also be excluded. Serious or nonhealing active wound, ulcer, or bone fracture History of interstitial lung disease e.g. pneumonitis or pulmonary fibrosis or evidence of interstitial lung disease on baseline chest CT scan Patients who have a diagnosis of Gilbert‟s disease History of other malignancy, except: 1. Malignancy treated with curative intent and with no known active disease present for ≥ 3 years prior to randomization and felt to be at low risk for recurrence by the treating physician 2. Adequately treated nonmelanomatous skin cancer or lentigo maligna without evidence of disease 3. Adequately treated cervical carcinoma in situ without evidence of disease</criteria>
