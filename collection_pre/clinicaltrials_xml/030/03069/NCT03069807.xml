	<brief_title>Completion and Acceptability of Treatment Across Primary Care and the commUnity for Latent Tuberculosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>People with dormant/latent TB (LTBI) have TB bacteria in their bodies, but do not have any symptoms because the bacteria are not active. The investigators know that recent migrants with LTBI from countries where TB is very common (incidence greater than 150 per 100 000) are at risk of developing active TB (their dormant bacteria become active) after they arrive in the UK. Active TB can be both infectious and deadly. The treatment for LTBI is three-month course of antibiotics. This significantly reduces the risk of developing active TB. This treatment is currently arranged and supervised by hospital clinics, however, many migrants do not attend and numbers of people completing antibiotics is low. This leaves many at risk of developing active TB. This study investigates whether a community (primary care) based approach to the treatment of LTBI, coordinated by general practices and local pharmacists, will achieve higher rates of antibiotic completion. The London Borough of Newham, in the UK, has amongst the highest rates of active TB in Western Europe. As part of a strategy to tackle this disease burden, an innovative model of care has been implemented in the borough in which GPs and pharmacists screen and treat migrants with LTBI. Our trial will evaluate whether primary care based management of LTBI leads to higher rates of treatment completion amongst recent migrants when compared to hospital based care. This approach would save money (both for the health service and for patients in terms of travels costs) and reduce numbers of new cases of active TB. The treatment for Latent Tuberculosis Infection will be 3 months of combined oral Rifampicin and Isoniazid with Pyridoxine. The dosage is weight dependent.</detailed_description>
