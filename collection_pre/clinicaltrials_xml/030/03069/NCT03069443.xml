	<brief_title>Isometric Handgrip Home Training to Lower Blood Pressure in Hypertensive Older adulTs</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypertension markedly increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases and overall mortality. Lifestyle modifications such as increased levels of physical activity are recommended as the ﬁrst line of anti-hypertensive treatment. A recent systematic review showed that isometric handgrip (IHG) training was superior to traditional endurance and strength training in lowering resting systolic blood pressure (SBP). The average length of previous IHG training studies is approximately 7.5 weeks with the longest being 10 weeks. Therefore, presently it is unknown if it is possible to further lower blood pressure levels beyond the 10 week mark. Recently, the investigators developed a novel method for monitoring handgrip intensity using a standard Nintendo Wii Board (Wii). The primary aim of this study is to explore the effects of 20-weeks IHG home training facilitated by a Wii in hypertensive older adults (+50 years of age) in lowering SBP compared to usual care. Secondary aims are to explore if/when a leveling off effect on SBP will occur during the 20-week intervention period in the training group and to explore adherence and potential harms related to the IHG home training. Methods: Based on previous evidence, the investigators calculated that 50 hypertensive older adults (+50 years of age) is needed to achieve a power of 80% or more. Participants will be randomly assigned to either an intervention group (IHG home training + hypertension-guidelines on lifestyle changes) or to a control group (hypertension-guidelines on lifestyle changes). Participants in the intervention group will perform IHG home training (30% of maximum grip strength for a total of 8 min per day per hand) three times a week for 20-weeks.</detailed_description>
