	<brief_summary>Many studies are in favour of the importance of the rachis on the postural balance of the body.It is possible to study the upright posture by determining the center of pressure using a platform of strength.The spinal surgery have two objectives ,mechanic and neurologic .By deformation correction and stabilizing vertebral stages via arthrodesis, it seems to hypothesize that surgery can modify postural balance. This study aim to evaluate spinal surgery effect on posture using that plaftorm .</brief_summary>
