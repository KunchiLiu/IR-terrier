	<brief_summary>Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a chronic hereditary respiratory disease. Exercise testing is part of CF patients regular assessment. Cardio-Pulmonary Exercise Testing (CPET) is currently considered as the gold standard to assess physical capacities. However, simple field tests are emerging. These tests are easier to perform especially in a population of CF children and adolescents. The 1minute Sit-To-Stand test have recently been evaluated in CF adults. This test correlates with maximal oxygen consumption during CPET. The investigators hypothesized that this test also correlates with 6-Minute Walking distance (during a 6-min Walk Test), quadriceps strength, respiratory muscles strength and health-related quality of life.</brief_summary>
