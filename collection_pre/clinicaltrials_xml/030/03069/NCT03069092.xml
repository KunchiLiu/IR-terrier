	<brief_summary>As the leading cause of death, cardiovascular disease (CVD) accounts for about one-third of U.S. mortality. Physical inactivity, one of the main CVD risk factors, causes 6% of coronary heart disease worldwide. The American Heart Association has identified cardiovascular health behaviors including smoking, obesity, diet, and aerobic exercise; however, resistance exercise was not included due to the limited evidence of its efficacy. Comparatively, the cardiovascular benefits of aerobic training have been well-documented whereas the independent and additive benefits of resistance training on cardiovascular health have not been established. Thus, this project is aimed to answer one of the most common questions about exercise and health:"What type or combination of exercise is most effective for CVD prevention?" This project will significantly contribute to developing more effective CVD prevention approaches, advancing more comprehensive physical activity guidelines, and providing important insights and novel opportunities for the future science of physical activity and health.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Participants will be randomly assigned to aerobic exercise, resistance exercise, combined aerobic and resistance exercise, or a no exercise control group for 1 year. Participants in all four groups will receive healthy diet and lifestyle education sessions and will track their daily steps, body weights, and food intake throughout the 1-year intervention. They will also complete baseline, 6-month, and 12-month physical examinations, which will include assessments of blood pressue, blood lipids, body composition, and aerobic and muscular fitness.</detailed_description>
