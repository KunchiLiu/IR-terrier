	<brief_summary>Emergence agitation following general anaesthesia may lead to serious complications like self-extubation or removal of catheters, which can lead to hypoxia, aspiration pneumonia, bleeding or reoperation. Nose surgery is associated with a higher incidence of emergence agitation. The investigators planned to evaluate the efficacy of external nasal nerve block in prevention of postoperative agitation following external nasal surgeries under general anesthesia(GA).</brief_summary>
