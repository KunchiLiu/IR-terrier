	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the impact of different combinations of intervention as a function of gestational weight gain in pregnant woman. Participants will be randomized at two points during the study. Participants will first be randomized at enrollment to receive study intervention during pregnancy or treatment as usual. Participants will also be randomized just before delivery to receive intervention postpartum or treatment as usual.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Optimizing Health From Pregnancy Through One Year Postpartum</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The perinatal period, from pregnancy through the first postpartum year, has important implications for women's health. Excessive gestational weight gain is linked to deleterious health outcomes; yet most women exceed guidelines established for gestational weight gain , particularly women who begin pregnancy overweight or obese. These women are likely to remain overweight or obese at one year postpartum even if gestational weight gain is within guidelines and pregnancy-related weight gain is lost postpartum. Efforts to mitigate the health risks related to perinatal overweight can have substantial benefits for women's longer-term obesity and cardiometabolic health. To date, interventions to minimize excessive gestational weight gain alone have had limited impact. Some women may require continued intervention in the postpartum period to achieve optimal weight management. Alternatively, intervention delivered only postpartum may be sufficient to achieve a healthier weight at one year postpartum. It also is important to adapt intervention as women's needs vary over the course of pregnancy and postpartum. Accordingly, this application proposes a sequential multiple assignment randomized trial (SMART) to determine the efficacy of different intervention sequences during pregnancy, postpartum, or both. This non-restricted SMART also will allow investigators to investigate the impact of different combinations of intervention as a function of gestational weight gain. The proposed SMART is innovative as the first effort to evaluate different sequences of intervention across the perinatal period to mitigate maternal health risk by one year postpartum. Pregnant women (N=300), stratified by prenatal weight status (body mass index=25-29.9 vs. ≥30) will be enrolled at entry into prenatal care and randomized initially to intervention that addresses the challenges of weight and self-regulation during pregnancy, Health and Behaviors in Transition (HABITpreg), or an educationally-enhanced treatment as usual (TAUpreg). At delivery, women will be re-randomized to a postpartum self-regulation intervention (HABITpost) or educationally-enhanced treatment as usual (TAUpost). Women will complete assessments at a prenatal baseline, the end of pregnancy, and 6- and 12-months postpartum.</detailed_description>
