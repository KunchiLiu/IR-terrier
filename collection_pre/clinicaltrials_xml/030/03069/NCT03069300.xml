	<brief_summary>Recent data have suggested that monocyte oxidative burst defect is associated with the development of infection in patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis. One report found reduced 28 day mortality in patients treated with N-acetylcysteine combined with prednisolone when compared to prednisolone alone. The current study seeks to reveal whether the mechanism by which NAC reduces susceptibility to infection is through improvement of phagocyte oxidative burst.</brief_summary>
