	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the safety of 2 doses of LM11A-31-BHS in 120 patients with Alzheimer's Disease versus placebo and to access biomarker and clinical exploratory endpoints of LM11A-31-BHS</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of LM11A-31-BHS in Mild-moderate AD Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal of this AD Pilot is to conduct a prospective, double-blind, multicenter, phase IIa exploratory safety, feasibility and proof-of-concept trial in mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease patients with the orally bioavailable p75 neurotrophin receptor ligand LM11A-31-BHS dosed twice daily for 26 weeks. Successful completion of this trial will provide the safety, endpoint and statistical basis for the design and execution of a phase 2b/3 efficacy trial. It will also bring to the AD field a much-needed new set of target mechanisms and will help pioneer the strategy of the concomitant targeting of multiple fundamental AD-related pathological processes. During the 26 weeks study period the eligible patients will be invited to 5 visits. Safety monitoring will include the full extent of phase 2 clinical, electrophysiological and laboratory testing.</detailed_description>

MRI or CT assessment within six months before baseline, corroborating the clinical diagnosis of AD and excluding other potential causes of dementia, especially cerebrovascular lesions (see exclusion criteria, number 3) 4. CSF AD specific biomarker profile; positive, defined as CSF Aβ42 &lt;530 ng l−1 together with either of Ttau&gt;350 ng l−1 or ptau &gt;60 ng l−1 5.

Formal education for eight or more years 9. Previous decline in cognition for more than six months as documented in patient medical records 10. A caregiver available and living in the same household or interacting with the patient a sufficient time each week and available if necessary to assure administration of drug 11. Patients living at home or nursing home setting without continuous nursing care 12. General health status acceptable for a participation in a 6month clinical trial 13. Ability to swallow capsules 14. Stable pharmacological treatment of any other chronic condition for at least one month prior to screening 15. Stable treatment with one of the acetylcholinesterase inhibitors donepezil (Aricept ®), galantamine (Razadyne®), or rivastigmine (Exelon) or the partial NMDA receptor antagonist with memantine (Namenda®) at least 3months before baseline Visit or Combination of both treatments mentioned above 16. No regular intake of prohibited medications as noted in Section 11.8 of the protocol 17. Signed informed consent by the patient, examined and verified to be mentally capable by an independent physician, prior to the initiation of any study specific procedure. Signed consent of the caregiver (see inclusion criteria 10). 1. Failure to perform screening or baseline examinations 2. Hospitalization or change of chronic concomitant medication one month prior to screening or during screening period 3. Clinical, laboratory or neuroimaging findings consistent with: Other primary degenerative dementia, (dementia with Lewy bodies, frontotemporal dementia, Huntington's disease, CreutzfeldtJakob Disease, Down's syndrome, etc.) Other neurodegenerative condition (Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, etc.) Cerebrovascular disease (major infarct, one strategic or multiple lacunar infarcts, extensive white matter lesions &gt; one quarter of the total white matter) Other central nervous system diseases (severe head trauma, tumors, subdural hematoma or other space occupying processes, etc.) Seizure disorder Other infectious, metabolic or systemic diseases affecting central nervous system (syphilis, present hypothyroidism, present vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, serum electrolytes out of normal range, juvenile onset diabetes mellitus, etc.) 4. A current DSMIV diagnosis of active major depression, schizophrenia or bipolar disorder 5. Clinically significant, advanced or unstable disease that may interfere with primary or secondary variable evaluations, and which may bias the assessment of the clinical or mental status of the patient or put the patient at special risk, such as: chronic liver disease, liver function test abnormalities or other signs of hepatic insufficiency (ALT, AST, Gamma GT, alkaline phosphatase &gt; 2.5 ULN) Respiratory insufficiency Renal insufficiency (serum creatinine &gt;2mg/dl) or creatinine clearance ≤ 30 mL/min according to CockcroftGault formula). In case of creatinine clearance ≤30mL/min, an alternative verification of the renal function must be completed using Cystatin C analysis. In case of normal level of Cystatin C, the patient can be included Heart disease (myocardial infarction, unstable angina, heart failure, Cardiomyopathy within six months before screening) Bradycardia (heart beat &lt;50/min.) or tachycardia (heart beat &gt;95/min.) Hypertension (&gt;180/95) or hypotension requiring treatment with more than three drugs AV block (type II / Mobitz II and type III), congenital long QT syndrome, sinus node dysfunction or prolonged QTcBinterval (males &gt;450 and females &gt;470 msec) Uncontrolled diabetes defined by HbA1c &gt;8.5 Malignant tumors within the last five years except skin malignancies (other than melanoma) or indolent prostate cancer Metastases 6.

Suspected or known allergy to any components of the study treatments 12. Enrollment in another investigational study or intake of investigational drug within the previous three months 13. Any condition, which, in the opinion of the investigator, makes the patient unsuitable for inclusion</criteria>
