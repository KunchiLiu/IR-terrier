	<brief_title>Eccentric Exercise in Treatment of Achilles Tendinopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with achillodynia for at least 3 months are randomly allocated to one of two exercise regimens. Exercise is performed daily for a 3-month period. Symptom severity is evaluated by tendon tenderness, ultrasonography, a questionnaire on pain and other symptoms, and a global assessment of improvement. Follow-up is performed at time points 3, 6, 9, 12 weeks and 1 year.</detailed_description>
	<mesh_term>Tendinopathy</mesh_term>
	<criteria>1. Pain in the Achilles tendon area with one of the two following findings. a) Distinct tenderness of Achilles tendon with no pain in the neighboring structures. b) Ultrasonographic changes defined as local thickening of the symptomatic tendon or a globally more than 2mm thicker tendon on the sick side. 2. Diffuse pain in the posterior region of the ankle with local tenderness of the Achilles tendon and ultrasonographic changes (as described above). 1. Treatment of achillodynia with stretching or eccentric training for more than 2 weeks within the last 2 years. 2. Other injuries in the lower extremity or the knee, which by the examining doctor was evaluated to influence the evaluation of symptoms or the ability to perform the training program. 3. Acute symptoms with ultrasonographic changes consistent with a partial rupture of the tendon. 4. Age less than 18 years or over 70 years. 5. Previous operation on the tendon or steroid injections.</criteria>
