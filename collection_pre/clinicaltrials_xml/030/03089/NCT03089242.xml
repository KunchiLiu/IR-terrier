	<brief_title>MicroRNAs in Acute Kidney Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this pilot study we will include 150 patients undergoing cardiac surgery in a German university hospital. We will profile microRNA expression in plasma and urine before and at several timepoints after surgery. We will use a preselected panel of microRNAs and lncRNAs for analysis. Goal is to identify microRNAs/lncRNAs that are able to predict the occurence of AKI in these patients.</detailed_description>
