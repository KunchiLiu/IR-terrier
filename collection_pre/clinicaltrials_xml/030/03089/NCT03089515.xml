	<brief_summary>Many "Survivors" in the World Trade Center (WTC) clinical program have a clinical syndrome characterized by chronic obstruction in small airways and persistence of lower respiratory symptoms despite therapy. This study will test the hypothesis that persistent symptoms in WTC "Survivors" are associated with abnormal small airways whose dysfunction is amplified during exercise and is associated with biologic evidence of inflammation and remodeling. The results from this study will have important treatment implications for our WTC population with potential applicability to larger populations with either inhalational lung injury and/or airway diseases such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.</brief_summary>
