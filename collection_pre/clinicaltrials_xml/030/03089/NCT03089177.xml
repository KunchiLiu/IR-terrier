	<brief_summary>The investigators previous studies show that community gardening is associated with reduction of key health behaviors for cancer prevention in diverse populations. Community gardeners eat more fruits and vegetables per day, are more physically active, and are more likely to avoid age-associated increase in body mass index (BMI). The effect is partially explained by the finding that gardeners are more socially involved, and feel more social support than non-gardeners. The investigators propose a randomized controlled trial to determine whether community gardening improves cancer-preventive behaviors among a multi-ethnic, low-income adult population and elucidate the pathways that shape cancer-preventive behaviors. A randomized controlled trial is needed to demonstrate that the observed behavioral differences are due to the effect of gardening as an intervention rather than self-selection by gardeners.</brief_summary>
