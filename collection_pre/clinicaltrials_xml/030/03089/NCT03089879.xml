	<brief_summary>GVGH Shigella Sonnei 1970GAHB is a vaccine aimed at preventing the disease caused by Shigella sonnei. A post-hoc analysis of subjects who participated in the parent study showed significantly different responses in subjects with detectable versus undetectable antibody titres at baseline, suggesting the possibility that the vaccine might not be sufficiently immunogenic in completely naïve adults. This study was then designed to further characterize the immunogenicity profile of the vaccine and to evaluate whether it was able to induce an immunological memory response.</brief_summary>

Received immunoglobulins or any blood products within 180 days prior to informed consent. Study personnel as an immediate family or household member. Any other clinical condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, might interfere with the results of the study or pose additional risk to the subject due to participation in the study. Individuals who have received an investigational product in another clinical trial 28 days prior to first study visit or intent to receive another investigational product at any time during the conduct of this study. Individuals who received any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to enrollment in this study or who are planning to receive any vaccine within the entire study duration. Inactivated influenza vaccine can be given, but only 4 weeks earlier or 4 weeks later than the date of immunization.
