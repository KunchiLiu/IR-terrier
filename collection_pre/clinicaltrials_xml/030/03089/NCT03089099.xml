	<brief_summary>As prostate cancer progresses into castration-resistant stage from initial hormone-sensitive status, the biological behavior of tumor cells that dissociated from primary lesions changed. Considered a "liquid biopsy," these circulating tumor cells (CTCs) can show how a patient's cancer responded to treatments. The purpose of this study is to determine whether sequentially analyzing the expression of molecular markers in high volume circulating tumor cells in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients can predict the therapeutic effects and outcomes of these patients.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Male patients 2. 18 yrs and older, and 80 yrs and younger 3. Histologically or cytologically proven prostate adenocarcinoma; 4. Imaging examinations including Emission Computed Tomography (ECT), Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and so on revealed a highvolume disease of patients(A highvolume of disease was defined by the presence of visceral metastases or four or more bone lesions with at least one beyond the vertebral bodies and pelvis) 5. Have been received hormonal therapy and progressed into castrationresistant stage 6. Not yet receiving chemotherapy 7. Patients are willing to participate and can be followed up regularly 1. Received the treatment of abiraterone acetate previously 2. Patients received chemotherapy previously 3. Combined with other malignant tumor history (in addition to the skin basal cell carcinoma or other tumors that have been cured more than five years).</criteria>
