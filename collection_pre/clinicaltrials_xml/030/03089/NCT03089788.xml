	<brief_summary>In this Project we will monitor the symptoms of cat allergic participants who live together with a cat which is immunized with FEL-CMV using the novel symptom recording method "HypoScore", a General weekly symptom score, and a skin prick test before and after immunization of the cat. This project may enable us to determine if the scoring System and the tests are able to detect a difference in participant symptoms before and after immunization of the cats.</brief_summary>
