	<brief_title>Financial Incentives, Randomization With Stepped Treatment Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>HIV-positive patients with unhealthy alcohol use are not often motivated to decrease their alcohol consumption and rarely receive treatment for their drinking. To address these challenges, we plan to provide treatment in HIV clinics, highlight to patients the impact alcohol can have on their medical conditions, and use Contingency Management (CM) with a stepped care design to adjust treatment to patient response. CM is an evidence based therapy that promotes abstinence from substance use, including alcohol. Since CM has not been studied for unhealthy alcohol use in HIV-infected patients we will include a stepped care strategy that provides Addiction Psychiatrist Management (APM) (with alcohol pharmacotherapies as indicated) and Motivational Enhancement Therapy (MET) for patients who do not achieve abstinence with CM. Phosphatidylethanol (PEth), is a validated biomarker that can confirm alcohol abstinence over three weeks. To capture the range of adverse effects of alcohol on health, we will include patients with at-risk drinking, alcohol use disorder, and medical conditions that can be adversely impacted by alcohol including those with a detectable HIV viral load, tobacco use disorder, liver fibrosis, untreated hepatitis C, depression and those taking psychoactive medications that interact with alcohol. The goal of the Financial Incentives, Randomization with Stepped Treatment (FIRST) Trial is to compare onsite CM plus stepped care versus treatment as usual (TAU) in a randomized clinical trial of HIV-positive patients with unhealthy alcohol use at seven HIV clinics. CM patients will receive onsite CM counseling sessions with financial rewards contingent on abstinence demonstrated by breathalyzer and PEth. Rewards can also be awarded for addressing medical conditions impacted by alcohol and achieving alcohol treatment goals. After three months, patients will be stepped up to APM and MET if PEth results indicate they have not attained abstinence. This randomized clinical trial will test the hypothesis that CM plus stepped care leads to greater abstinence, decreased alcohol consumption and improved HIV biomarkers as measured by the VACS Index.</detailed_description>

Alcohol Use Disorder Meet DSM5 criteria for alcohol use disorder, not in remission No subject may: Be acutely suicidal, or with a psychiatric condition that affects his/her ability to provide informed consent or participate in counseling interventions (e.g. psychotic, dementia, delusional). Be currently enrolled in formal treatment for alcohol (excluding mutualhelp, e.g. Alcoholics Anonymous) Have medical conditions that would preclude completing or be of harm during the course of the study. Be a pregnant or nursing woman or women who do not agree to use a reliable form of birth control. Have a current diagnosis of or be in remission for a gambling disorder given the gaming nature of CM.</criteria>
