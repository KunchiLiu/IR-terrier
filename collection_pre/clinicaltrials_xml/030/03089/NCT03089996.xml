	<brief_summary>This study will compare the techniques of piezocision and alveolar corticotomies in accelerating orthodontic tooth movement. It will consist of a split-mouth study in patients who require the extraction of the first premolars to correct malocclusion. The canine will be retracted using these surgical techniques, as well as without any intervention, being this the control side. In addition, will be evaluated the inflammatory biomarkers present in the gingival crevicular sulcus during the dental movement, as well as data related to pain and discomfort.</brief_summary>
