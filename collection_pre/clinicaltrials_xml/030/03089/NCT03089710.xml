	<brief_title>Mini-fluid Challenge in Predicting Fluid Responsiveness During Prone Position Spine Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Perioperative fluid management is crucial for patients' outcome. Series of studies have indicated that adequate fluid management optimizes the cardiac out put, improves tissue perfusion, thus decrease the risk of postoperative morbidity. Muller et al developed a "Mini-fluid challenge method " to predict fluid responsiveness and the efficacy. To the best of our knowledge, the efficacy of the test was not discussed in the perioperative care in prone position surgery. The investigators design the study to investigate the effectiveness of mini-fluid challenge test in prone position surgery.</detailed_description>
