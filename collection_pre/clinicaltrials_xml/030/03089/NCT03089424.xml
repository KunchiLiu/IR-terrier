	<brief_summary>Photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) is a non-pharmacological method commonly used in treatment of musculoskeletal disorders. However, there are few high-quality scientific evidence to support the effectiveness of this therapy in the treatment of patients with chronic low back pain, at short, medium and long term. The present research project aims to evaluate the effects of PBMT in patients with chronic non-specific low back pain.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Photobiomodulation Therapy on Low Back Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized, triple-blinded, placebo-controlled trial, with voluntary patients with chronic non-specific low back pain.One hundred and forty-eight patients will be randomly allocated to two treatment groups: Placebo or PBMT for 4 weeks (3 times per week, total of 12 sessions of 27 minutes each). The clinical outcomes will be obtained at the completion of treatment (4 weeks) and at 3, 6 and 12 months after randomization. The data will be collected by a blinded assessor. The statistical analysis will follow the intention-to-treat principles and the between-group differences will be calculated by using mixed linear models. The outcomes of interest are pain intensity, disability, function and global perceived effect.</detailed_description>
