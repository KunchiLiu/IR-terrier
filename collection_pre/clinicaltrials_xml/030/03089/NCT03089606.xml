	<brief_title>Pembrolizumab TX-naive Distant Mets Melanoma and Use of AMT (PET) at Baseline as Imaging Biomarker</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objectives: Primary Objective Explore association between intensity of C11-AMT PET at baseline, as measured by mean standardized uptake value (SUVmax at each lesion), total tumor metabolic volume, measurement of intra-tumoral and inter-lesional heterogeneity), with objective response rate (ORR) at 12 weeks (as defined via RECIST1.1) to pembrolizumab in patients with treatment-naïve metastatic melanoma. Secondary Objectives Estimate ORR (Complete Response + Partial Response) by RECIST 1.1 at 12 weeks to pembrolizumab in patients with treatment-naïve metastatic melanoma. Estimate progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with metastatic melanoma treated with pembrolizumab as front-line therapy. Explore associations in SUVmax, and other PET parameters (e.g. total tumor metabolic volume, measurement of intra-tumoral and inter-lesional heterogeneity), using C11-AMT PET co-registered with CT with no contrast and 18F-FDG-PET at baseline. Explore associations between SUVmax, and other PET parameters (e.g. total tumor metabolic volume, measurement of intra-tumoral and inter-lesional heterogeneity), from C11-AMT PET imaging at baseline with expression of components of the IDO pathway detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC) or immunofluorescence such as LAT1, IDO, TPH1, lymphocyte subtypes (CD4, CD8, FoxP3, MDSC), PD-1/PD-L1, and other immune checkpoint pathways (LAG3, GITR, TIM3) in freshly acquired tumor specimens prior to treatment with pembrolizumab. Assess metabolic changes at week 12 following treatment with pembrolizumab using baseline and week 12 18F-FDG PET. Outline: Screening: Whole body FDG PET/CT scan with IV contrast will be performed at least 24 hours before C11-AMT PET scanning, as per standard of care. C11-AMT PET will be performed at least 24 hours before pembrolizumab treatment and at least 24 hours after FDG PET/CT scan. After screening and enrollment, treatment will consist of the following: Pembrolizumab 200mg IV flat dose will be administered over 30 minutes on Day 1; Pembrolizumab dosing will be repeated every 3 weeks until progression or subject withdrawal for other reasons. At the end of treatment: Whole body FDG PET/CT scan with IV contrast. Projected Accrual: Up to 25 subjects who have not received prior therapy for their recent diagnosis of distant melanoma.</detailed_description>

NOTE: HIPAA authorization may be included in the informed consent or obtained separately. 2. Subject must be 18 years of age or more on the day of signing informed consent. 3.

Patients with bulky stage IIIB or stage IIIC melanoma in the axillary area, in particular, can be entered into the study after discussion between Merck and the Principal Investigator. 4. Have measurable disease based on RECIST v1.1. for solid tumors 5. Be willing to provide tissue from a newly obtained core or excisional biopsy of an accessible tumor lesion prior to treatment. A mandatory fresh biopsy will be collected following C11AMT PET imaging. Subjects for whom fresh samples cannot be provided (e.g. inaccessible or subject safety concern) or do not agree to this fresh tumor research biopsy of accessible tumor will be deemed ineligible for study participation. 6. Be willing to be injected with 11CmethylLtryptophan (C11AMT) at least at baseline 7. Have a performance status of 0 2 on the ECOG Performance Scale. 8. Has not received prior therapy with CTLA4, PD1/PDL1 inhibitors, other costimulatory or coinhibitory immune checkpoint antibody therapies (e.g. LAG3, TIM3, CD137, KIR3DL, CD70, and CD27) or MAPK pathway inhibitors for distant metastatic melanoma. Patients who have received CTLA4 inhibitors in the adjuvant setting are allowed. Patients who have previously received adjuvant PD1 inhibitors are excluded. 9. Demonstrate adequate organ function as defined in below; all screening labs to be obtained within 14 days prior to registration: Hematological: Hemoglobin (Hgb) ≥ 9 g/dL or ≥ 5.6 mmol/L without transfusion or EPO dependency (within 7 days of assessment) Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) ≥ 1,500/mm3 Platelets ≥ 100,000/mm3 Renal: Serum Creatinine OR Measured or calculated creatinine clearance (GFR can also be used in place of creatinine or CrCl) ≤1.5 x ULN OR ≥ 60 mL/min using the CockcroftGault formula for subject with creatinine levels &gt; 1.5 X institutional upper limits of normal (ULN) Hepatic: Serum Total Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 X ULN Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤ 2.5 X ULN OR &lt; 5 X ULN for subjects with liver metastases Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤ 2.5 X ULN OR &lt; 5 X ULN for subjects with liver metastases Albumin ≥ 2.5 mg/dL Coagulation: International Normalized Ratio (INR) or Prothrombin Time (PT) ≤1.5 X ULN, unless subject is receiving anticoagulant therapy as long as PT or PTT is within therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulants Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT) ≤1.5 X ULN, unless subject is receiving anticoagulant therapy as long as PT or PTT is within therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulants 10. Female subjects of childbearing potential should have a negative urine or serum pregnancy within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study medication. If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required. 11. Female subjects of childbearing potential must be willing to use adequate methods of contraception as outlined Contraception for the course of the study through 120 days after the last dose of study medication. Subjects of childbearing potential are those who have not been surgically sterilized or have not been free from menses for &gt; 1 year. Note: Abstinence is acceptable if this is the usual lifestyle and preferred contraception for the subject. Male subjects should agree to use an adequate method of contraception as outlined Contraception starting with the first dose of study therapy through 120 days after the last dose of study therapy.
