	<brief_summary>Patients with type-1 diabetes are more susceptible to motility-related upper gastrointestinal symptoms. Dietary interventions are one of the treatment pillars for these symptoms. Many gastrointestinal conditions other than celiac disease, are being increasingly treated with gluten-free diet (GFD). The role of GFD in non-celiac type-1 diabetic patients with dyspepsia-like symptoms has not been assessed before. In this study, type 1 diabetes patients with concomitant upper gastrointestinal symptoms will be asked to follow a 3-month GFD to assess changes in upper gastrointestinal symptoms and gastroduodenal motility before and after the dietary intervention.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect of Gluten-free Diet in Type 1 Diabetics With Dyspepsia Symptoms</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a complex and heterogeneous disease that is associated with poor outcomes. In studies from referral centers, 50-65% of diabetics reported dyspeptic symptoms. In addition, approximately 50% of type 1 DM (T1DM) patients, especially those with longstanding disease, have evidence of delayed gastric emptying. Dietary modification is one of the treatment pillars for patients with dyspeptic symptoms. Further, many individuals in which both symptoms and motility abnormalities improve after a GFD have positive anti-gliadin antibodies (AGA), which reinforces the role of gluten-induced inflammation/immune activation as a possible cause of motility abnormalities and related symptoms. Ameliorating UGI symptoms is not only pivotal for improving the quality of life of diabetic GP patients, but the improvement in gastroduodenal motility is also needed for a more predictable glycemic response. In non-celiac T1DM patients, the role of the GFD in symptom improvement, gastroduodenal motility and glycemic control has never been assessed. The overall aim of the present study is to improve the knowledge about the role of dietary interventions as non-pharmacological treatments for upper-gastrointestinal symptoms and underlying motility abnormalities in patients with type 1 diabetes. This will be a non-randomized, open label, before and after trial of a 3 month GFD in non-celiac type 1 diabetics to assess symptomatic, motility and glycemic response changes.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Adult men and women (1875 years) with type 1 diabetes diagnosis and no history of celiac disease, that complain of upper gastrointestinal symptoms (early satiety, postprandial fullness, bloating, abdominal swelling, nausea, vomiting, and retching) will be invited to participate. Patients with very severe symptoms of gastroparesis that require specialized nutritional therapy or surgical treatment; Pregnant women; Patients with concomitant diseases/treatments that can alter gastrointestinal motility and concomitant severe systemic diseases.</criteria>
