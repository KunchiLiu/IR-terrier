	<brief_summary>It is hypothesized that food allergy is preceded by atopic dermatitis (AD), due to a disruption of skin barrier which can predispose one to food sensitization through the skin. Lipid-enriched moisturizers are widely used in AD as ongoing treatment and maintenance skin care. The investigators hypothesize that early intervention with lipid-rich barrier cream in infants at high risk of atopy will prevent skin barrier dysfunction, and thereby prevent the risk of epicutaneous food allergen sensitization.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Women with physician confirmed pregnancy at a gestational age of ≥ 34 weeks. Infants at high risk for atopy will have one or both parents affected by an allergic disease. Infants at low risk for atopy will have no parent or sibling affected by allergic disease.
