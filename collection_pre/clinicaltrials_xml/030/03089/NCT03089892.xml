	<brief_summary>Chemotherapy is effective and most often used to treat cancer. The common drugs used on gynecologic cancer treatment include platinum compounds like cisplatin and carboplatin, which combined with taxane, topotecan, or liposomal doxorubicin to date. The most side effects of chemotherapy are esophagitis, mucositis, anxiety, nausea, vomiting, abdominal convulsion, painful swallowing, fatigue and sometimes diarrhea, dizziness, allergy (rash, itching), neutropenia, thrombocytopenia (fever, chills, cough, pain), anemia and bleeding. Cancer-related fatigue (CRF), an indicator of quality of life, is a highly prevalent symptom (75-80%) during treatment and in patients with advanced cancer, yet is sometimes ignored. Fatigue affected their life more than pain. Proposed criteria for CRF have been adopted for inclusion in the International Statistical Classification of Disease and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM). Therefore, more in-depth researches on CRF are needed in Taiwan. Patients with CRF in need of improvement, commonly use nutrition supplements, acupuncture, healthy food, massage, drugs, etc. Hence, patients with CRF could consult their vital physician for an appropriate treatment. Furthermore, several drugs could be chosen to relieve CRF, including anemia drugs, antipsychotics or Astragalus polysaccharides extract. The objective of this retrospective study is to collect and analyze the medical records of gynecologic cancer patients who had accepted prescription drug treatment for cancer-related fatigue under chemotherapy in the Department of Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology of Tri-Service General Hospital from December 1st, 2015 to November 30th, 2017. This study will compare the fatigue improvement profile by different chemotherapy regimens, tumor stage, CRF treatment, etc. and investigate the association between the profile of fatigue improvement and fatigue cluster (weight loss and other symptoms of functional assessment of cancer therapy). These results will supply physicians with more understanding about CRF, and help them to enhance the quality on gynecologic cancer care to being perfected in the future.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Perspective Study of Cancer-related Fatigue in Gynecologic Cancer Patients Under Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>About 60 gynecologic cancer patients' medical records are expected to collect and analyze in this retrospective study. The data collection from medical records of gynecologic cancer patients who had accepted prescription drug treatment for cancer-related fatigue under chemotherapy include the demographic information (e.g., height, weight, age, sex, tumor stage, time from tumor diagnoses, prescription drug of cancer-related fatigue treatment and chemotherapy toxicities), the diagnosis and severity of cancer-related fatigue, functional assessment of cancer therapy and so on.</detailed_description>
