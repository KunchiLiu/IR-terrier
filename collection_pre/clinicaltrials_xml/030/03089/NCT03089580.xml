	<brief_title>Intense Pulsed Light Study for Dry Eye Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dry eye disease (DED) affects tears and the front surface of the eye. Patients who have DED can experience symptoms of discomfort, blurry vision, redness, and pain. DED can also cause tears to become unstable which could result in damage to the front surface of the eye. There are two types of DED. The one the investigators are studying is called evaporative dry eye disease. This type of DED occurs because the pores on the eyelids are not functioning properly. In preliminary studies, a new treatment called Intense Pulsed Light (IPL) has shown promise to reduce signs and symptoms of evaporative DED. IPL is a non-invasive and non-laser light treatment that was approved in 1995 by the FDA for dermatology. It is commonly used for treatment of facial rosacea, acne, and hair, wrinkle and lesion removal. It is not currently approved for the treatment of dry eye disease. This treatment is thought to provide relief of evaporative DED symptoms and improve the expression of the pores on the edge of the eyelid.</detailed_description>
