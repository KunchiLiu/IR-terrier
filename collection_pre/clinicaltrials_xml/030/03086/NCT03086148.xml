	<brief_summary>Perioperative depression symptom is one of the common metal complications which will affect patients' clinical outcome and prognosis and it may reduce long-term quality of life (QOL). However, there isn't any effective treatment can relieve patients' depression symptom. To date, lots of clinical trails have confirmed that low-dose ketamine have robust, rapid, and sustained antidepressant properties. The remission of major depressive episodes has proved, however the application during perioperative for depression symptom have not researched ever. Thus, we need to design a random-controlled clinical trail to observe the anti-depression effect during perioperative. If ketamine can reduce the depression symptom significantly, this treatment can be popularized in future clinical works to decrease the rate of perioperative adverse events related of patients' depressive symptom and to enhance the patients' long-term QOL.</brief_summary>
