	<brief_title>Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics of JS001 in Combination With Axitinib in Patients With Kidney Cancer and Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a phase Ib, open, mono-center, dose-escalation, tolerability and pharmacokinetic study evaluating the Recombinant Humanized Anti-PD-1 mAb for Injection in combination with Axitinib in patients with advanced kidney cancer and melanoma who have failed in routine systemic treatment.The study will be conducted in 2 parts: dose escalation and cohort expansion. 18 to 24 patients will be enrolled in dose escalation part.This part is to analyze safety and efficacy of the humanized anti-PD-1 antibody in combination with axitinib and to confirm dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended dose (RD). After finishing the dose escalation part, we will enroll other patients for each tumor types of recommended dose group to ensure each group have 10 patients. This part is to further analyze safety and efficacy of the humanized anti-PD-1 antibody.</detailed_description>

Must have read, understood, and provided written informed consent voluntarily. Willing to adhere to the study visit schedule and the prohibitions and restrictions specified in this protocol. Prior treatment with antiPD1/PDL1/PDL2 antibody and Axitinib Hypersensitivity to recombinant humanized antiPD1 monoclonal Abm or its components Prior antitumor therapy (including corticosteroids and immunotherapy) or participation in other clinical trials within past 4 weeks, or have not recovered from toxicities since the last treatment; Pregnant or nursing; Positive tests for HIV, HCV, HBsAg or HBcAb with positive test for HBV DNA (&gt;500IU/ml); HBsAg or HBcAb with positive test for HBV DNA (&gt;500IU/ml) History with active tuberculosis; Associated with clinical symptoms or symptomatic treatment of pleural effusion or ascites; Patients with any active autoimmune disease or a documented history of autoimmune disease, or history of syndrome that required systemic steroids or immunosuppressive medications, such as hypophysitis, pneumonia, colitis, hepatitis, nephritis, hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism; Severe, uncontrolled medical condition that would affect patients' compliance or obscure the interpretation of toxicity determination or adverse events, including active severe infection, uncontrolled diabetes, angiocardiopathy (heart failure &gt; class II NYHA, heart block &gt;II grade, myocardial infarction, unstable arrhythmia or unstable angina within past 6 months, cerebral infarction within past 3 months) or pulmonary disease ( interstitial pneumonia, obstructive pulmonary disease or symptomatic bronchospasm).

Psychiatric medicines abuse without withdrawal, or history of psychiatric illness. Prior malignancy active within the previous 5 years except for locally curable cancers that have been apparently cured, such as basal cell skin cancer or carcinoma in situ of the cervix. Underlying medical condition that, in the Investigator's opinion, would increase the risks of study drug administration or obscure the interpretation of toxicity determination or adverse events.</criteria>
