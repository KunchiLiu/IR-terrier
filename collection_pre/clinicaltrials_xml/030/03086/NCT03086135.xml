	<criteria>Adult subjects (18 years or older) Subject with conductive or mixed hearing loss in the ear to be implanted. Bone conduction thresholds with pure tone average (PTA4; mean of 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 kHz) of 55 dB HL. OR Subject with singlesided sensorineural deafness who is a candidate for Baha surgery. Air conduction thresholds with a pure tone average PTA4 of 20 dB HL (mean of 0.5, 1, 2 and 3 kHz) in the good ear OR subject who is indicated for an AC CROS but—for some reason—cannot or will not use an AC CROS (Air ConductionContralateral Routing of Signal). Signed informed consent Previous experience from amplified sound though a nonsurgical solution. (For example but not limited to Hearing aid, CROS device, Bone conductional hearing device on headband/ softband) Uncontrolled diabetes as judged by the investigator. Condition that could jeopardise osseointegration and/or wound healing (e.g. osteoporosis, psoriasis, longterm systemic use of corticosteroids) or condition that may have an impact on the outcome of the investigation as judged by the investigator. Insufficient bone quality and quantity for implantation of a BI300 Implant. Subject that has received radiotherapy in the area of implantation, or is planned for such radiotherapy during the study period Use of ototoxic drugs that could be harmful to the hearing, as judged by the investigator Unable to follow investigational procedures, e.g. to complete quality of life scales. Participation in another clinical investigation with pharmaceutical and/or device.</criteria>
