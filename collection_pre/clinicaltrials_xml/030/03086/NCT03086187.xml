	<brief_summary>11 healthy men used the HEPHAISTOS unloading orthosis in an ambulatory 8 week intervention study. It greatly reduces calf muscle forces without reducing ground reaction forces.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effects of the Novel Unloading Device "HEPHAISTOS" on Bone, Muscles and Vessels</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The 56day unloading intervention with HEPHAISTOS had the following key objectives: 1. Primary objective: Assessment and evaluation of bone adaptation. 2. Secondary objective: Assessment and evaluation of functional and structural muscular adaptations. 3. Third objective: Assessment and evaluation of functional and structural vascular adaptations. 4. Fourth objective: Assessment and evaluation if the present findings deviate from findings observed in established unloading models.</detailed_description>
