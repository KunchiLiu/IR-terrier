	<brief_summary>Restoration of anterior teeth using conservative approach allows clinicians to provide porcelain laminate veneers with excellent esthetics without extensive tooth structure removal. laminate veneers need the use of etch-able ceramics like glass ceramics (E.max) and hybrid ceramics (Lava Ultimate). The aim of this study is to compare both e.max and lava ultimate veneers clinically.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>One Year Clinical Evaluation of E-max CAD and Lava Ultimate Laminate Veneers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The use of E-max CAD well documented in the literatures as successful restoration modality which has superior optical and mechanical properties. The introduction of hybrid ceramic materials combined the advantages of both glass ceramics and composite resin. Resin nano-ceramic is a mixture of a resin composite matrix and nano-ceramic fillers of approximately 80% by weight. The main advantages of this material over the glass ceramics are the stress absorbing action or stress distribution by having modulus of elasticity near to the tooth dentin and can be individualized intra-orally or extra-orally, either before or after definitive cementation. Yet there are no studies for clinical evaluation of both mentioned laminate veneers restorations. This study is conducted to compare between both materials clinically according to modified USPHS criteria in terms of marginal adaptation, fracture, debonding, marginal discoloration and patient satisfaction.</detailed_description>
