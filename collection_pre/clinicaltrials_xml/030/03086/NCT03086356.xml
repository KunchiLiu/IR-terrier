	<brief_summary>The primary objective of the trial is to investigate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of idarucizumab in Chinese healthy male and female subjects following intravenous administration of idarucizumab followed by idarucizumab with 15 minutes interval when administered at or close to the steady state of dabigatran. Another objective of this trial is to explore the effect idarucizumab on the PK (pharmacokinetic(s)) and PD (pharmacodynamic) parameters of dabigatran.</brief_summary>
