	<brief_summary>Musculoskeletal pain is highly prevalent, disabling, and with high socio-economic costs, with many negative effects on quality of life. It affects the ability to perform work, social, recreational and domestic tasks, changing the mood and concentration of this population. Despite the worldwide prevalence and socioeconomic burden of this condition, a clear understanding of its etiology and pathogenesis remains elusive. Aims: (i) to analyze the possible level of association between fear of pain, fear of movement, self-efficacy, and pain acceptance on pain-disability at the start of the study and prospectively evaluate its role as a risk factor; (ii) to evaluate the possible role as a prognostic factor of fear of pain, fear of movement, self-efficacy and pain acceptance in those who develop musculoskeletal pain at follow-up; (iii) explore the possible mediating power of fear of movement and self-efficacy in the relationship between pain-disability; (iv) investigate what percentage of the variance accounts for beliefs (fear of pain, fear of movement, self-efficacy, and acceptance of pain) in predicting the onset and / or maintenance of musculoskeletal pain.</brief_summary>
