	<brief_title>EVALUATION OF RESPIRATORY MECHANICS AND FUNCTIONALITY IN PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Individuals with COPD present restriction in their daily lives due to changes and bodily disorders promoted by the disease, such as changes in types of muscle fibers and chronic inflammatory process, causing a low level of physical activity and quality of life, besides being closely Related to the need for hospitalizations and increased mortality. A cross-sectional study with a convenience sample was performed at the Laboratory of Cardiopulmonary Physiotherapy of the Federal University of Pernambuco during the period from December 2016 to February 2018. As measurements of body composition were performed with a bio-balance scale, Evaluation of the peripheral muscle strength will be used the dynamometer, a load cell and electromyography, a kinematic thoracic-abdominal will be measured by optoelectronic plethysmography, a respiratory metabolic response will be verified during the 6-minute walk test using the gas analyzer, and for evaluation of mobility and diaphragmatic thickness are used on ultrasound associated with pneumotachograph.</detailed_description>
