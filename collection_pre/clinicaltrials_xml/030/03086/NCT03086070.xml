	<brief_summary>The hypothesis of this study is that a gastroesophageal reflux recommended treatment with proton pump inhibitor (dose and duration) compared to placebo significantly reduces both the signs and symptoms of laryngopharyngeal reﬂux and comorbid chronic rhinosinusitis. Primary objective was to determine whether 8 weeks of treatment with omeprazole 20 mg ones daily (OD) significantly reduces the signs and symptoms of laryngopharyngeal reﬂux when compared to placebo in patients with laryngopharyngeal reﬂux with comorbid chronic rhinosinusitis. Secondary objectives were to determine whether 8 weeks of treatment with omeprazole 20 mg OD significantly reduces the signs and symptoms of comorbid chronic rhinosinusitis in patients with laryngopharyngeal reﬂux when compared to matching placebo; and to investigate the association of the severity of signs and symptoms of laryngopharyngeal reﬂux with the ones of chronic rhinosinusitis in the same group of patients. The research was carried out as a double blind randomized placebo controlled trial. Patients were randomized into two groups in an approximate 1:1 ratio using a concealed random sequence. After randomization and initial assessment treatment was initialized. Patients on active treatment were given omeprazole 20 mg once daily half an hour before breakfast for 8 weeks, while those in the placebo group were given matching placebo tablets using the same regimen for 8 weeks as the group on the active treatment. Patients were reassessed at the end of treatment for signs and symptoms of laryngopharyngeal reﬂux and comorbid chronic rhinosinusitis.</brief_summary>
