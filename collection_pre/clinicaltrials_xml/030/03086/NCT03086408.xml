	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate whether diagnostic bronchoscopy can be safely and potentially more effectively performed without the use of tracheal intubation or a supraglottic airway, under completely unobstructed surgical conditions afforded by THRIVE: Transnasal Humidified Rapid- Insufflation Ventilatory Exchange. THRIVE provides patient's gas exchange through rapid insufflation of high-flow oxygen via specialized nasal cannula.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients presenting for diagnostic bronchoscopy Patients with significantly decreased myocardial function (ejection fraction &lt; 50%) Patients with abnormal cardiac rhythm and conduction abnormalities, except for patients with isolated, asymptomatic premature atrial and ventricular contractions. Patients with significant peripheral vascular disease, such as those with the symptoms of intermittent claudication. Patients with known significant cerebrovascular disease, such as history of cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs) and transient ischemic attacks (TIAs).
