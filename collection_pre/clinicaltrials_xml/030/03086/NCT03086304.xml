	<brief_summary>Postoperative intestinal obstruction is one of the most common complication of gastrointestinal surgery, some research have confirmed that transcutaneous acupoint electrical stimulation (TEAS) can promote recovery of gastrointestinal function, reduce the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting, our goal is to investigate the effectiveness of TEAS in reducing the incidence of gastrointestinal obstruction after operation in perioperative.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Transcutaneous Acupoint Electrical Stimulation on Intestinal Obstruction After Gastrointestinal Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants will be randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive TEAS or Blank treatment (acupoints selection are same with the experimental group, connect stimulator for patients, but not don't give stimulus). The randomization sequence will be computer-generated, and randomization will be performed in blocks and will be stratified according to participating center. TEAS will be treated from 30 minutes before anesthesia induction, ending when teh operation complete. Time of first fart and food-taking ,time of have normal diet after the transplantation will be recorded. The participation of each patient is scheduled for 30 days.</detailed_description>
