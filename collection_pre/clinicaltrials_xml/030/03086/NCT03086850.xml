	<brief_summary>Main objective: To assess the effect of the daily physical activity promotion with a pedometer during 12 months on the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) in patients with mild to moderate obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Study patients. Subjects 30-80 years old with diagnosis of mild-moderate OSA (AHI: 5-30 and predominance of obstructive events [&gt;80%)]. Design. Randomized, parallel and open-label clinical trial, controlled with conventional treatment. Intervention: Patients will be randomized (1:1) to control group [treatment and follow-up according to conventional clinical practice] or intervention group [in addition to conventional treatment and follow-up, the patients will receive a pedometer to measure the number of steps walked daily. Based on the cumulative step count for each day and the mean value since the last visit, patients will receive a task to increase their steps per day by the next appointment according to the next protocol (&lt;6000 steps/day: increase by 3000 steps/day; 6000 - 10000 steps/day: reach 10000 steps/day; and &gt; 10000 steps/day: maintain or increase steps). Measurements. At , 12, 24 and 52 weeks of randomization, the following determinations will be made: anthropometric characteristics; clinical evaluation (smoking history, sleep symptoms, comorbidities, current medication); questionnaires (ESS, FOSQ, SF-12, EuroQoL and iPAZ); heart rate and blood pressure; analytical determinations (HbA1c, HOMA index, cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, homocysteine, NT-proBNP and hsCRP); plasmatic biomarkers (8-isoprostane, IL1beta, IL6, IL8 and TNFalpha); and evaluation of daily physical activity using an accelerometer.</brief_summary>
