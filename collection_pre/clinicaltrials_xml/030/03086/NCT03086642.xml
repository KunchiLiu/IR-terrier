	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to find out which doses of talimogene laherparepvec (T-Vec) can be given safely to participants with pancreatic cancer that is either too big to be taken out by surgery or has spread to other parts of the body. The study will also see if T-Vec can cause tumor shrinkage or prevent its growth. To find out which doses are safe, all participants enrolled in this study will receive up to 4 injections of T-Vec. At least two doses will be evaluated in this study, depending on how many side effects are seen at each dose. Participants will not be able to pick the dose, as this will be determined based on the study experience with participants enrolled previously. T-Vec is called a study agent in this study. This is because the use of T-Vec in pancreatic cancer is still experimental and has not been approved by any regulatory health agency, like the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or European Medicines Agency (EMA), for use in people with pancreatic cancer. T-Vec however has been approved by the FDA for use in melanoma population.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Talimogene Laherparepvec in Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a phase 1 dose escalation study to evaluate the safety of talimogene laherparepvec in pancreas cancer. The primary endpoint is safety and determining the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Talimogene laherparepvec was previously established to be safe when administered endoscopically into pancreatic tumors at a dose of 10^7 PFU/ml at 3 week intervals.In the current study, all patients will first receive an endoscopic injection of 10^6 PFU/ml, performed in identical fashion to subsequent treatment doses. In the de-escalation cohort the first dose will be decreased to 10^5 PFU/ml. The first dose is lower because early phase I trials with talimogene laherparepvec showed that patients who are seronegative for herpes simplex virus (HSV) have higher toxicities if the first dose is above 10^6. Thus in all subsequent studies, to account for the fact that some patients may be HSV seronegative, the initial dose is lower than subsequent doses to allow those patients to seroconvert, allowing them to better tolerate the higher doses. The first cohort of 3 patients will receive an additional 10^7 PFU/ml talimogene laherparepvec every 3 weeks for a total of 3 additional treatments. If 2 or more dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) are observed, then the next cohort of 3 patients will receive an initial dose of 10^5 PFU/ml followed by 3 doses of 10^6 PFU/ml talimogene laherparepvec every 3 weeks. If in the second cohort less than 2 DLTs are observed, there will be will be expansion to 10 patients for safety analysis to establish the MTD at this lower dose level (ie. DLT frequency &lt;33% or ≤3 patients). Please see definition of DLT in section 9. Note that the DLT period is 60 days or 7 days following the final talimogene laherparepvec injection, whichever is longer, and that patients who do not survive the DLT period for unrelated reasons will be replaced. If 1 DLT is observed in the first cohort of 10^7 PFU/ml then this dose cohort will be expanded to six patients. If expansion occurs and no further DLTs are observed then we will move to the higher dose level. If 1 additional DLT occurs then we will expand to 10 patients to establish the MTD. If 2 or more DLTs are observed then the next 3 patents will de-escalate to receive 10^6 PFU/ml every 3 weeks. If 0 or 1 patients experience a DLT in the de-escalation cohort, there will be expansion to 10 total patients at that dose level to establish the MTD. If no DLTs are observed in the first cohort then we will escalate to 10^8 PFU/ml every 3 weeks in the next 3 patient cohort. If 0 or 1 DLT is observed, we will expand this cohort an additional 3 patients, and if 0 or 1 patients experience a DLT then further expand to 10 patients to establish the MTD. If 2 or more DLTs are observed then the next 3 patients will de-escalate to the first (lower) dose of 10^7 PFU/ml, and if 0 or 1 patients experience a DLT then this cohort will expand to 10 patients to establish the MTD.</detailed_description>
