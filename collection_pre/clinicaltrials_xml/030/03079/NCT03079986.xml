	<brief_title>Chyle Leak After Pancreatic Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>With an incidence of up to 11%, postoperative chyle leak (CL) is a frequent phenomenon after pancreatic surgery, where extensive lymph node dissections are indispensable. Postoperative CL is frequently treated with either medium-chain triglyceride diet (MCT-diet) or total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Ignoring CL and removing the surgical drains irrespective of CL may also be discussed. While dietary restrictions are known to hinder postoperative convalescence and prolong the length of stay at the hospital, recent retrospective data show that leaving CL untreated is not associated with an increased morbidity rate. More precisely, removing the surgical drains irrespective of CL does not result in an increased incidence of CT-guided drainages. However, prospective data on CL after pancreatic surgery do not exist in the literature. Accordingly, the present trial aims to compare treatment of CL with dietary restrictions to removing the surgical drains irrespective of CL.</detailed_description>
