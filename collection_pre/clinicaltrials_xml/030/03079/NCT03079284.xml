	<brief_summary>Ten infants undergoing therapeutic hypothermia for hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy will be enrolled in a new protocol that will allow mothers to hold their infants during the hypothermia treatment period. This is a safety study that will assess whether or not there is an increase in adverse event frequency in infants that are held during hypothermia. Parents and NICU nurses will be given a questionnaire after holding is complete investigating their feelings on maternal-infant bonding and safety of the holding protocol.</brief_summary>
