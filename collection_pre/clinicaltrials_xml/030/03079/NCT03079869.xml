	<detailed_description>PROTOCOL SUMMARY Title: Transition to Ferric Citrate among Hemodialysis and Peritoneal Dialysis Patients: A Phase 4 "Real World" Experience Study from Kaiser Permanente Southern California Short Title: FeCitrate Protocol Number: KP FeCitrate Study Phase: 4 Study Site(s): Los Angeles Kaiser Sunset Medical Center Number of Subjects: 55 Study Arms: 1 Indication: Hyperphosphatemia in end stage renal disease Primary Purpose: To evaluate the efficacy of ferric citrate for control of serum phosphorus levels and maintenance of adequate iron stores among dialysis-dependent patients before and after conversion from traditional phosphate binders in a "real world" environment Overview of Study Design: Prospective non-randomized cohort study of 6-9 months duration (active study period 6 months). Investigational Product Administration: One to two tablets of Ferric Citrate phosphorus binder administered by mouth before every meal to prevent dietary phosphorus absorption. Study Endpoint: Mean serum phosphorus levels and rate of successful phosphorus control (&lt;5.5mg/dl) 6 months before and after treatment with ferric citrate Statistical Methods: Not powered to detect statistical significance</detailed_description>
