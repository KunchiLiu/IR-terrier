	<brief_summary>The purpose of this multicentre, randomized, double blinded, single dose, two-way cross-over study, is to compare the pharmacokinetics (PK) of biosimilar eptacog alfa (activated) with Novoseven in 24 patients, adult and children (&gt;12 years), not bleeding, with inherited coagulation factor VII (FVII) deficiency (FVII &lt;1%). Patients will be randomized to receive either a single dose of eptacog alfa biosimilar 30 μg/kg and one single dose of NovoSeven 30 μg/kg, or vice versa, with doses separated by a washout period. All patients will be followed 12 months and will receive biosimilar eptacog alfa, on demand, for every bleeding episode that should occur - or - for prophylaxis, with the aim of monitoring of inhibiting antibody formation, lack of efficacy and collection of safety data. Additional 26 patients with the same inclusions and exclusions criteria will be included in this study (for a total 50 patients). These patients will not enter the PK phase of the study but they will be followed to receive biosimilar eptacog alfa, on demand, for every bleeding episode that should occur during 12 months - or - for prophylaxis, with the aim of monitoring of inhibiting antibody formation, lack of efficacy and collection of safety data. The modality of treatment with biosimilar eptacog alfa (on demand or prophylaxis) will be decided by the Investigator.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description />
	<mesh_term>Factor VII Deficiency</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Patients with a confirmed diagnosis of congenital, severe Factor VII deficiency (FVII &lt;1%), with &gt; 2 episodes of bleeding/year requiring treatment with FVII infusions, in non bleeding status. Patients for the Additional group for immunogenicity should be enrolled when in a bleeding episode requiring treatment with FVII. Male and female subjects Adult and children (&gt;12 years) Written informed consent. For minor patients, parent/legal guardian will provide consent and, when possible, patient assent will also be obtained. For compromised patients their designated proxy must provide informed consent. Any other type of congenital or acquired coagulopathy (except congenital Factor VII deficiency), such as: liver disease (hepatitis), vitamin k deficiency, uremia, malignancy. Antibodies against Factor VII Patients entering the PK Study Group who have not suspended prophylactic regimen with Novoseven or AryoSeven (biosimilar eptacog alfa) 3 days before starting the trial (receiving first dose of study medication). Patients entering the Additional Group for Immunogenicity study, only, who have been exposed to AryoSeven before starting study [patients who have received Novoseven (on demand or in prophylaxis) before starting study are allowed] Platelet count less than 100.000 platelets/μl (at screening visit) Patients who have received routine (prophylactic) treatment with rFVIIa in the period between screening visit (visit 1) and visit 2 of this study (first dose administration) Any clinical sign or known history of arterial thrombotic event or deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism HIV positive with current CD4+ count of less than 200/μl Liver Cirrhosis Known hypersensitivity to the study medication Parallel participation in another experimental drug trial. Parallel participation in another marketed drug trial that may affect the primary end point of the study.</criteria>
