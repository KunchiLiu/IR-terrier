	<brief_title>Basophile Activation Testing (BAT) in Hazelnut Allergy (Hazelnut BAT Study)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Accurate diagnosis of food allergy depends on food challenge outcome. The proposed study intends to compare the outcome of food challenge in hazelnut allergic patients with the outcome of basophile activation tests using hazelnut extract and components to evaluate the diagnostic utility of basophile activation testing. With a view towards improved in vitro diagnostic methods, the investigators intend to evaluate the diagnostic potential of basophile activation testing in patients with hazelnut allergy confirmed by a positive provocation or supported by a convincing history of anaphylactic reaction(s) to hazelnut in the past, patients with pollinosis but no symptoms of hazelnut allergy and non-atopic control subjects.</detailed_description>
