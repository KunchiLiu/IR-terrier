	<brief_summary>Double-blind, placebo controlled Phase III trial of erythropoietin for hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy in infants receiving hypothermia. The study aim is to determine whether Epo in conjunction with hypothermia in infants with moderate/severe HIE will improve neurodevelopmental outcomes at 2 years of age, without significant adverse effects, when compared to hypothermia alone.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PAEAN - Erythropoietin for Hypoxic Ischaemic Encephalopathy in Newborns</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A lack of oxygen (hypoxia) or low blood supply (ischaemia) before or during birth can destroy cells in a newborn baby's brain. The damage caused by the lack of oxygen continues for some time afterwards. One way to try to reduce this damage is to induce hypothermia cooling the baby or just the baby's head for hours to days. Erythropoietin (Epo) given in the first week after birth shows promise as a treatment that may also help. This study is to find out whether Epo plus induced hypothermia (cooling) of near-term newborn babies who have suffered from low blood or oxygen supply to the brain at birth reduces death and disability in survivors at two years of age. The target population is 300 newborn term or near term infants (greater than or equal to 35+0 weeks gestation) with hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy who are receiving, or planned to receive hypothermia and who are able to be recruited in time to allow study treatment to commence before 24 hours of age. This is a double blind, placebo controlled, parallel, 2 arm randomised, phase III multicentre trial, stratified by study site and by severity of encephalopathy at study entry. The treatment group of 150 infants will receive human recombinant Epo, 1000 IU/kg IV on days 1, 2, 3, 5 &amp; 7 of life. The control group will receive 0.9% sodium chloride as a placebo on days 1, 2, 3, 5 &amp; 7 of life. Families will be followed up every 6 months until the primary assessment of death and disability at 2 years of age.</detailed_description>
