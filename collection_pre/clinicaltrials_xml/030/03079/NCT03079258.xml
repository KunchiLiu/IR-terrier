	<detailed_description>The study will comprise of a randomised pilot trial to assess the effect of a moderate intensity exercise intervention on maternal and offspring vascular health. Participants will be recruited in the first trimester (T1, 10-12 weeks' gestation), and will be randomized to either a 24-week, structured and partially supervised, gym-based exercise intervention beginning in trimester 2 (T2) through to trimester 3 (T3), or a non-exercise control group who receive normal clinical care. The inclusion of this non-exercise control group is critical in allowing us to create an understanding of the adaptation of the vascular system during a normal (non-exercising) pregnancy, and also determining the physical activity and sedentary behaviour engaged in during normal healthy pregnancy. All participants will be asked to attend the laboratory at Liverpool John Moores University on 4 separate occasions synchronised with the end point of each trimester and then within four weeks of delivery. Maternal vascular health, physical activity, sedentary behaviour and fitness will be assessed during each time point throughout pregnancy while the fourth visit will comprise of an offspring vascular assessment. The investigators will also gain information on delivery outcomes including pre-term delivery, complications during labour, induction of labour, caesarean sections and post-partum haemorrhage via medical notes at the Liverpool Women's NHS Foundation Trust.</detailed_description>
