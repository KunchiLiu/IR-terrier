	<brief_title>Online Distance Learning Outcomes Compared to Traditional Classroom Learning in Medicine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects will be randomized into a "control" group attending a traditional classroom and a "trial" group of equal numbers participating in an online synchronous Internet streaming classroom. Main outcome measures: Pre and post multiple choice examinations of Vestibulo-Ocular Reflex (VOR), Movement, Head Turns, Head Tremor, Neurodegeneration, Inferior Olivary Complex, Collateral Projections, Eye Movement Training, Visual Saccades, Head Saccades, Visual Impairment, Walking Speed, Neuroprotection, Autophagy, Hyperkinetic Movement, Eye and Head Stability, Oscilllatory Head Movements, Gaze Stability, Leaky Neural Integrator, Cervical Dystonia, Interstitial Nucleus of Cajal (INC) and Head Tilts, Visual Pursuits, Optokinetic Stimulation, Vestibular Rehabilitation. Methods: All candidates will take a pretest examination of the subject material. Two 9-hour and one 8-hour sessions over 3 consecutive days will be given live in the classroom or synchronously in the online classroom using the Adobe Connect e-learning platform. Subjects randomized to the online classroom will attend the lectures in a location of their choice and will view the sessions live on the Internet. A posttest examination will be given to all candidates after completion of the course.</detailed_description>
