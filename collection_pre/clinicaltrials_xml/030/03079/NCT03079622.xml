	<brief_summary>The study titled, Manual Versus Electric Vacuum Aspiration for Pregnancy Termination Between 10-14 weeks: A Randomized Trial, is a randomized trial to compare procedure times for manual and electric vacuum aspiration for surgical abortion between 10 0/7 and 13 6/7 weeks gestation. Women presenting for surgical abortion between 10 0/7 and 13 6/7 weeks gestation will be randomized to either undergo manual vacuum aspiration (MVA) or electric vacuum aspiration (EVA). The investigators hypothesize that operative times will be increased when using manual vacuum aspiration, as compared to electric vacuum aspiration, for surgical abortion performed in the late first trimester (10 0/7 and-13 6/7 weeks).</brief_summary>
