	<brief_summary>OCTAV is a medical device class I, not CE marked, based on a new technique for high-resolution imager (cell) internal microstructures of all types of biological tissues in vivo or ex vivo, to a depth of penetration 800 .mu.m. It allows to explore the epidermis, the dermo-epidermal junction and middle dermis in a totally non-invasive (direct contact with the tissue without sampling).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>At the coming of the patient in Dermatology for resection / biopsy of the tumor (usual practice), for the study, an image of the tumor will be performed with the OCTAV device (about 5 minutes) for the study. Then, according to usual practice, resection / biopsy will be performed. This study aims to validate the clinical relevance of this device to characterize the 3 main skin cancers and to obtain the necessary data for the implementation of future clinical trials.</detailed_description>
