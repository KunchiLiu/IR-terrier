	<brief_summary>This is a pilot testing the feasibility of the 'REpurposing BOtulinum Toxin in Treatment of Obesity in Adolescents' trial (ReBOO-trial). The full-scale ReBOO will further investigate safety and efficacy of intragastric injections of botulinum toxin A into the antrum area of the stomach. These injections will be repeated every six months. The study sample will be adolescents with obesity who have not responded to standard conservative treatment.</brief_summary>
