	<brief_title>ERAS (Early Recovery After Surgery) Protocol After Laparoscopic Total Gastrectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There is strong evidence of the usefulness of the ERAS programs in patients undergoing colorectal surgery in terms of significantly reduced postoperative complications and shorter length of hospital stay, compared to the patients of conventional treatment. However, few studies exist about the implication of ERAS programs in the laparoscopic gastrectomy. The aim of this study was to compare the recovery rate, morbidity, and quality of life in the patients undergoing laparoscopic total gastrectomy for gastric cancer, receiving either ERAS protocol or conventional postoperative cares.</detailed_description>
