	<brief_summary>Introduction: Total hip arthroplasty has been increasingly used as a means of treating the various pathologies of this joint. However, this surgical reconstruction initially brings important deficits in subjects submitted, such as: inhibition of muscle strength, limitation of range of motion and functional deficit. Therefore, an immediate physiotherapeutic treatment is necessary in the short and long term, taking into account both biomechanical issues and the quality of life of these individuals. Objective: To evaluate the clinical evolution of individuals submitted to total hip arthroplasty in the ten year period. Method: Twenty individuals submitted to unilateral total hip arthroplasty will be evaluated by the medical group of hip surgeries of the Brotherhood of Santa Casa de Misericórdia of São Paulo, during a period of ten years. These individuals will undergo a primary clinical evaluation and after signing the consent form, will be evaluated functionally with the HARRIS HIP SCORE and WHOQOL-bref questionnaires and physically with the analysis of muscular strength through manual dynamometry to measure the strength level of the Muscles involved in the bilateral coxo-femoral joint, such as abductors, adductors, flexors, extensors, internal rotators, external rotators, knee joint, such as extensors and flexors, and ankle, plantar flexors. Finally, they will be referred to the kinematic gait analysis, to identify the functional characteristics of these individuals, through reflexive markers at specific anatomical points, where they will walk for 5 minutes on a treadmill at a speed of 1.5km per hour.</brief_summary>
