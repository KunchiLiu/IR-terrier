	<brief_summary>Virtual reality surgical simulators (VRSS) are gaining popularity for general surgery training, both for conventional laparoscopic and robotically-assisted surgery. Although numerous studies have analysed the impact of VRSS training on surgical skills, there is a lack of data regarding the comparison of robotic VRSS (RVRSS) and laparoscopic VRSS (LVRSS) training on conventional laparoscopic skills among subjects with no prior surgical experience. The hypothesis of the present study is that RVRSS could improve conventional laparoscopic skills as much as laparoscopic LVRSS among na√Øve subjects</brief_summary>
