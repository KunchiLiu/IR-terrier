	<brief_summary>Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is the only treatment option with a significant chance of healing in lymphoid hematological refractory or multiple relapses after chemotherapy. However, all patients with an indication of allo-HSC can not benefit because of two limitations: the toxicity of the treatment and graft shortage available. For patients refractory or in relapses with an indication of allo-HSC, used the combinaison of an SET followed by the reduced-intensity allo-HSC (RIC) has shown some interesting results. A post-transplant immune modulation with prophylactic injections of donor lymphocytes (PDLI) showed its effectiveness to decrease the risk of relapse while having a lower toxicity than chemotherapy</brief_summary>
