	<brief_summary>Dexlansoprazole modified release (MR), the R-enantiomer of Lansoprazole, is an FDA approved drug (2009) for the management of erosive esophagitis and nonerosive reflux disease 1. Dexlansoprazole has a unique dual delayed-release delivery system designed to address unmet needs that may accompany traditional proton pump inhibitors, with two separate pH-depended release phases, the first in the proximal duodenum and the second in the more distal small intestine. This dual release system extends the plasma concentration and pharmacodynamics effects beyond those of single-release PPIs, allowing for dosing at any time of the day without regard to meals 1. A study conducted by Fass et al. has shown that the use of dexlansoprazole MR 30 mg in patients with symptomatic GERD is significantly more effective than placebo in improving nocturnal heartburn, reducing GERD-related sleep disturbances, and consequently improving work productivity, sleep quality and quality of life 2. Because of its pharmacokinetic properties, Dexlansoprazole modified release (MR) may prove beneficial in optimizing the management of GERD and the associated burdens that often surface after the heavy evening and Suhur meals, such as increased nocturnal symptoms and poor sleep quality.</brief_summary>
