	<brief_summary>This study evaluates the effects of delivering training services via telehealth to educators in rural schools. The investigators hope to increase the accuracy with which educators implement functional behavior assessments in schools. During the study, participants will receive training on functional behavior assessments at different periods. When one school is receiving training, other schools will not be receiving training. The purpose will be to show increased accuracy of functional behavior assessments only occur following training.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Training Educators to Conduct Functional Behavior Assessment Via Telehealth</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Training services for educators typically occurs in-vivo with experts providing immediate feedback and modeling to shape behavior. These types of training experiences may not be accessible for all educators though. The current study will evaluate delivering behavioral skills training (e.g., feedback and error correction) via telehealth for educators conducting functional behavior assessments. The components of the functional behavior assessment that will be targeted are open-ended interviews, stimulus preference assessments, direct observations of problem behavior, and a functional communication training program. With at least three different schools, the investigators will introduce training delivered via telehealth one at a time to show that increases in acquisition of the various components of the functional behavior assessment only occur following telehealth-based training.</detailed_description>
