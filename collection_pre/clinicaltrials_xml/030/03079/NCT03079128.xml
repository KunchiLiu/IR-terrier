	<brief_summary>There is a body of evidence that has evaluated the effect of Weight Watchers, a commercially available weight loss program, on changes in body weight. The current investigation aims to add to this body of evidence by providing additional data on changes in body weight and enhance the current evidence-base in regards to evaluating other health-related outcomes. There is little evidence that demonstrates whether or not the weight loss as a result of the Weight Watchers program elicits changes in health-related functional outcomes such as aerobic capacity, flexibility, sleep, and other psychological measures. Additionally, within a scientific research protocol, measures of adherence and satisfaction will also be evaluated evaluated. This study will evaluate these outcomes beyond weight changes achieved across the 24-week program.</brief_summary>
