	<brief_summary>Results of recent systematic reviews suggest favorable results of embolization for the treatment of Pelvic Congestion Syndrome (PCS) compared with pre-procedure symptoms for several outcomes, including pain reduction, overall patient satisfaction, and technical feasibility. Reported complication rates appears relatively low. Pelvic vein embolization is a relatively new technology and the results may provide background for an evidence based decision to offer embolization of pelvic varicosities for women with PCS in Norway.</brief_summary>
