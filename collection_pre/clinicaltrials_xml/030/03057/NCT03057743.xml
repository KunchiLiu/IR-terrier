	<brief_summary>Pilot study using [18F]ISO-1 PET/CT to image sigma-2 receptor binding in metastatic breast cancer. Correlate baseline uptake and change in uptake after therapy with time to progression and standard and experimental pathology assays of biopsy or surgical tissue. The target population is up to 30 adult patients at least 18 years, with at least one site of disease outside the liver by at least one type of standard imaging.</brief_summary>
