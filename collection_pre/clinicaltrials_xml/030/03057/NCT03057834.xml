	<brief_summary>Investigators plan a prospective cohort study with an adaptive design based on physical function status. The design will involve tracking the number of women recruited with physical function impairment and those without any functional impairment. Investigators aim to recruit similar numbers of women in each group. If investigators find unequal numbers, they will adapt recruit strategies based on a woman's functional status.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Urinary Incontinence Treatment Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Investigators plan a prospective cohort study with an adaptive design based on physical function status. The design will involve tracking the number of women recruited with physical function impairment and those without any functional impairment. Investigators aim to recruit similar numbers of women in each group. If they find unequal numbers, they will adapt recruit strategies based on a woman's functional status. Investigators will compare changes in outcome measures within and between groups after 6 and 12 weeks of pelvic floor muscle exercises (PFME). The change in pelvic floor strength/efficiency will be assessed by repeating the pelvic floor PERFECT assessment and will be compared between groups. Changes in UI symptoms, symptom severity, and impact of UI symptoms on quality of life will be determined using standardized measures described above. Data analysis will define associations between changes in PERFECT measures and the change in UI episodes (based on 3-day voiding diary), severity, and type (based on QUID-7), and impact on quality of life (PFIQ-7) within and between groups. Objective measurement of lower-extremity strength will inform the relationship between lower-extremity strength, pelvic floor strength, and UI symptoms at baseline and the 6-week visit.</detailed_description>
