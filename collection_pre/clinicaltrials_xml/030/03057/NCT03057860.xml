	<brief_summary>Atopic dermatitis (AD) constitutes significant burden to patients, families, and healthcare systems. About 60% of all patients with AD are adults. Patients with moderate-to-severe AD cannot be sufficiently controlled with topical treatments alone and require intermittent or continuous treatment with systemic immunomodulating agents or UV-therapy. Systematic reviews indicate that although 12 different interventions for moderate-to-severe AD have been studied in clinical trials, strong recommendations are only possible for the short-term use of cyclosporin A (CSA). Methodological limitations in the majority of trials such as the choice of non-validated outcomes and outcomes that are not most relevant to patients prevent evidence-based clinical decision making. Pharmaceutical treatment of patients suffering from AD is diverse and frequently not in line with the current guidelines (for example S2-guideline in Germany). Systemic anti-inflammatory and immune-modulatory therapies include several conventional immunosuppressive agents such as glucocorticosteroids, CSA, methotrexate (MTX), azathioprine (AZA), interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG), and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) or mycophenolate acid. Dupilumab is the first biologic treatment for AD with very promising results in clinical trials. Other biologic treatments are currently being developed for the treatment of moderate-to-severe AD. Large head-to-head trials are missing so that long-term effectiveness of systemic interventions for moderate-to-severe AD is speculative. In this situation, clinical registries can provide valuable information for evidence-based clinical decision making. Objectives: Establishment of a national evidence-based clinical registry and research network with the following objectives: 1. Characterization of medical care and pharmaceutical therapies of adults suffering from moderate-to-severe AD. The perspective of the patient (utility, treatment goals, quality of life, and treatment satisfaction), sequence of treatments, and change of treatments will be a primary focus. 2. Investigation of comparative effectiveness, tolerability and safety of systemic therapies for moderate-to-severe AD. 3. Development of a platform for further investigations, such as pragmatic clinical trials, epidemiologic studies, outcomes research, immunologic and molecular research (given approval of responsible ethics commission).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>TREATgermany: German National Clinical Registry for Patients With Moderate-to-severe Atopic Dermatitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study procedures: No study related intervention will be performed. Included patients will be prospectively followed for at least 24 months. A maximum duration of follow-up is not intended. During the observation period standardized study visits are performed to prospectively document patient characteristics, clinical data, patient-reported outcomes, physician's reasons for treatment decisions, and satisfaction with treatment. The first study visit is scheduled at patient inclusion (baseline-visit; V1). The second and third study visits are scheduled 3 and 6 months after baseline, respectively. (V2 after 3 months, V3 after 6 months). Thereafter, study visits are scheduled after 3 months (if a new systemic treatment was initiated) or after 6 months (in case no new systemic treatment was prescribed). Data assessment: Prospective electronic documentation of disease course and severity, medical care and pharmaceutical treatment of AD. Pseudomized data will be stored at the registry center (Center for Evidence-based Healthcare, Dresden). Study assessments include: 1. A short physician report form to document patient history and clinical parameters such as the objective severity of clinical signs, affected body regions, physician's global assessment of disease severity, course of disease and medical treatment of AD including adverse events. 2. A patient report form to assess important subjective parameters, patient reported outcomes such as symptoms, quality of life, treatment satisfaction, patient's assessment of global disease severity, totally/partial well-controlled weeks.</detailed_description>
