	<brief_summary>This randomized clinical trial studies how well Lactobacillus plantarum works in preventing acute graft versus host disease in children undergoing donor stem cell transplant. Lactobacillus plantarum may help prevent the development of gastrointestinal graft versus host disease in children, adolescents, and young adults undergoing donor stem cell transplant.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lactobacillus Plantarum in Preventing Acute Graft Versus Host Disease in Children Undergoing Donor Stem Cell Transplant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine efficacy of orally-administered Lactobacillus plantarum (LBP) in preventing the development of gastrointestinal (GI) acute graft versus host disease (aGvHD) in children and adolescents undergoing initial allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine whether orally-administered LBP decreases the incidence of grade II-IV aGvHD following alloHCT. II. To determine whether LBP administration maintains intestinal integrity as measured by mean plasma citrulline levels and reduction in mucosal barrier injury (MBI) bacteremia. III. To measure the effects of LBP on the intestinal flora phylogenetic composition during and after alloHCT using 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) gene deep sequencing. IV. To measure effects of LBP on intestinal flora function during and after alloHCT using metagenomic and metabolite profiling. V. To measure proposed immunomodulatory effects of LBP in mean plasma levels of alloreactive-induced inflammatory cytokines (IL-2, IL-6, IL-12p70, IFNgamma, TNFalpha, etc) in patients receiving LBP compared to placebo. VI. To determine whether LBP administration reduces hospital days within the first 100 days post hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT). VII. To determine whether LBP administration reduces the incidence of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea in alternative donor HCT patients. VIII. To define the safety of orally administered LBP strains 299 and 299v in alternative donor HCT patients as measured by incidence of Lactobacillus plantarum bacteremia. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms. ARM I: Patients receive Lactobacillus plantarum strains 299 and 299v orally (PO) or through nasogastric (NG) or gastronomy (G) tube once daily (QD) on day 1 of transplant conditioning regimen to 56 days post alloHCT. Patients undergo alloHCT at day 0. ARM II: Patients receive placebo PO or through NG or G tube QD on day 1 of transplant conditioning regimen to 56 days post alloHCT. Patients undergo alloHCT at day 0. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 120 days.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patient must have a diagnosis that is managed with an allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant Patients must have a performance status corresponding to Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) scores of 0 or 1 (&gt;= 70% for Karnofsky/Lansky); use Karnofsky for patients &gt; 16 years of age and Lansky for patients =&lt; 16 years of age Hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) No previous history of HCT or other cellular therapy (e.g., chimeric antigen receptor [CAR]T cells, donor lymphocyte infusions) Patient must be undergoing a first allogeneic HCT and receiving cells from an first alternative donor defined as all donors except for 8/8 human leukocyte antigen (HLA)matched, related family members Patient must not have used a probiotic dietary supplement within the previous 30 days of starting the transplant conditioning regimen (consumption of yogurt products is allowed) If patient has diarrhea at the time of enrollment, the patient must be Clostridium difficile toxin negative Patients who develop diarrhea after enrollment should be evaluated for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) to ensure they are negative prior to the start of the conditioning regimen and day 1 of study dosing; if they are positive, they will be deemed ineligible Patient is not receiving antibiotics therapy for an active infection Patient has a history of severe GI tract insult including but not limited to previous bowel perforation, grade 4 neutropenic colitis or typhlitis, inflammatory bowel syndrome, short small bowel syndrome (Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis) or history of bowel resection Patient has significant concurrent disease, illness, psychiatric disorder or social issue that would compromise patient safety or compliance with protocol therapy, interfere with consent, study participation, follow up, or interpretation of study results Female patients who are pregnant are not eligible; women of childbearing potential require a negative pregnancy test prior to enrollment</criteria>
