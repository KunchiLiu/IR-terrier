	<brief_summary>Substance misuse is a common problem among HIV+ individuals. Research suggests that a Screening, Brief Intervention, and Treatment (SBIRT) model can be effective in reducing substance misuse in the general older adult population; however these findings have not been verified in the more vulnerable HIV+ older adult population. The present study seeks to address the problem of substance misuse in older HIV+ adults by piloting a SBIRT model for older HIV+ adults in a in a primary care setting.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Feasibility of SBIRT Among Underserved HIV+ Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The current project will pilot SBIRT with a peer navigator (SBIRT-PN) versus treatment at usual (TAU) to increase substance use treatment engagement among HIV-positive adults aged 50 years and older. We will recruit patients from the Southern HIV and Alcohol Research Consortium (SHARC) HIV primary care clinic network. Aim 1: Pilot effectiveness of SBIRT-PN versus TAU in HIV primary care clinics to improve substance-use treatment engagement and HIV appointment adherence among adults aged 50 and older. Hypothesis 1: Individuals randomized to SBIRT-PN will be more likely to engage in substance-use treatment, have fewer substance use days and have fewer HIV missed clinic appointments compared to those in TAU at 30 days, 3 and 6 month post-intervention follow-up. Aim 2: Describe the influence of demographic factors, depression and pain on substance-use treatment engagement outcomes. Hypothesis 2: Demographic factors, greater depression and greater pain at baseline will be associated with more substance use days and more missed HIV clinic appointments at 30 days, 3 and 6 month post-intervention follow-up. Aim 3: Examine and enhance feasibility (recruitment, dose, retention) of intervention uptake for a larger trial. We will randomly sample 15 patients from the intervention arm and do qualitative interviews in order to characterize intervention barriers and key intervention components that facilitate success.</detailed_description>
