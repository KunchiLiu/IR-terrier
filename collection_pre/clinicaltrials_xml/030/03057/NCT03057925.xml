	<brief_summary>Percutaneous microwave ablation(MWA) was reported as an effective modality for the management of thyroid nodules(TNs). This study aims to validate MWA as a feasible approach for patients with TNs for whom surgery is contraindicated or refused. Two groups of subjects with TNs(one group to treat with MWA and the other group to receive regular ultrasonic follow-up without any treatment) will be evaluated in term of TN volume, ultrasonic image and clinical symptoms.</brief_summary>
