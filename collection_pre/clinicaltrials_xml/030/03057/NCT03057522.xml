	<brief_summary>This will be a pilot study to determine if a 6 week home training program can increase preferred step rate (cadence) in recreational runners. Increase in step rate has been correlated with decreased stress at lower limb joints in runners. This has the potential of decreasing overuse injuries in this population. Research participants will have their preferred cadence evaluated at the beginning of the study. The athletes will be randomly assigned to two groups. One group will continue to train without intervention and the other group will train at a cadence of 10% higher than their preferred step rate. At the end of 6 weeks the participants will have their preferred cadence reevaluated using the same method as pre-participation cadence was determined. The investigators hypothesis the preferred running cadence of recreational runners following the intervention will be 5-10% greater than prior to the intervention and the increased cadence will be maintained for 6 months following the intervention.</brief_summary>
