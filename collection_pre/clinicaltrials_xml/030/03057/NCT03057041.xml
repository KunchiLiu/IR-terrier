	<brief_summary>Intranasal fentanyl has been found to be safe and effective in the reduction of pain among pediatric and adult populations. The investigators hypothesize that patients who receive 100 mcg of intranasal fentanyl for pain control before first-trimester uterine aspiration will report lower pain scores than those who receive placebo. The investigators will test this hypothesis using a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial comparing pain reported during uterine aspiration between patients who receive either intranasal fentanyl or intranasal saline prior to the procedure.</brief_summary>
