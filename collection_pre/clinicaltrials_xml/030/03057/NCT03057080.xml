	<brief_summary>The aim of our study was to evaluate the technical and clinical effectiveness of PTA in the management of ischemic foot ulcers. All consecutive patients presenting with a foot ulcer at the outpatient Vascular surgery clinic of our hospital were evaluated. If non-invasive parameters suggested peripheral arterial disease (PAD) anatomic imaging (CTA and/or DSA) was performed and a PTA was carried out when feasible during the same session. All patients were followed until healing, amputation, death, or for at least two years. Short-term and long-term clinical success of PTA was evaluated based on ulcer size and appearance. Patients with worsening ulcers after PTA underwent bypass grafting or amputation.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The aim of our study was to evaluate the technical and clinical effectiveness of PTA in the management of ischemic foot ulcers. Methods: All consecutive patients presenting with a foot ulcer at the outpatient Vascular surgery clinic of our hospital were evaluated. Preoperative evaluation included foot pulse assessment, ankle-brachial-index (ABI) and duplex scanning. If non-invasive parameters suggested peripheral arterial disease (PAD) anatomic imaging (CTA and/or DSA) was performed and a PTA was carried out when feasible during the same session. All patients were followed until healing, amputation, death, or for at least two years. Short-term and long-term clinical success of PTA was evaluated based on ulcer size and appearance. Patients with worsening ulcers after PTA underwent bypass grafting or amputation.</detailed_description>
