	<brief_summary>This is a phase I study designed to assess the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of pyrimethamine and provide the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for the treatment of intermediate/high-risk MDS that is refractory to or relapsed after treatment with azanucleosides.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pyrimethamine for Intermediate/High-risk Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) That Has Relapsed or Refractory to Azanucleosides</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective of this study is to determine the safety, dose tolerance, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of pyrimethamine in intermediate / high-risk / relapsed or azanucleoside-refractory MDS within the confines of a phase I study. Pyrimethamine self-administered by participants orally once per day in morning with food. Phase 1 study will start at dose of 50 mg once per day. (NOTE: For participants at dose level of 50mg, the dose reduction, if needed is 25 mg.) Intra-patient dose escalation is permitted (not beyond the highest dose allowed) if Complete Remission/Response (CR) is not reached in week 1 of Cycle 3 and there is no significant toxicity. (NOTE: In this study, the term "intra-patient" indicates within each participant and not between different participants; i.e., dose escalation will be done within each individual participant.) The decision to escalate intra-patient doses will be based on safety and dose tolerance assessments made at the end of one treatment cycle (28 days of continuous drug administration) for all 6 participants. Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) is defined as the occurrence of two consecutive grade 2 or 3 serious adverse events (SAEs) not recovered within 24 hours at a given dose. MTD will be defined as the dose where no DLT is observed among three consecutive participants, or no more than one DLT among six participants. Participants will be treated initially for one 28-day cycle followed by a toxicity evaluation - Toxicity and adverse effect assessments will be made on Day 1 and Day 28 of every cycle of therapy.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants at or above the age of 18 years ( ≥ 18 years) Diagnosis of MDS confirmed within 6 months, by review of patient chart, prior to study entry according to WHO (World Health Organization) criteria or FAB (FrenchAmericanBritish) classification MDS classified as intermediate1, intermediate2 or high risk as per IPSSR (International Prognostic Scoring SystemRevised) score with a confirmed diagnosis of MDS with cytogenetic abnormalities at diagnosis and bone marrow blast percentage between 10 to 30% (for patients with cytogenetic failure or dry tap) Potential participants must meet ONE of the following: Progression (according to 2006 IWG criteria; see Appendix C) at any time after initiation of azacitidine or decitabine treatment during the past 3 years; OR Failure to achieve complete or partial response or hematological improvement (according to 2006 IWG) after at least four cycles of azacitidine or decitabine administered during the past 3 years OR Relapse after initial complete or partial response or hematological improvement according to 2006 IWG criteria observed after at least four cycles of azacitidine or decitabine administered during the past 3 years OR Intolerance to azacitidine or decitabine defined by drugrelated ≥Grade 3 liver or renal toxicity leading to treatment discontinuation during the past 3 years Off all other treatments for MDS for at least 3 weeks. Filgrastim (GCSF) and erythropoietin are allowed before and during the study as clinically indicated Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0, 1 or 2 Willing to adhere to the prohibitions and restrictions specified in this protocol Patient (or patient's legally authorized representative) must signed an informed consent document indicating that the patient understands the purpose of and procedures required for the study and is willing to participate in the study Adequate organ and marrow function as defined below: total bilirubin within normal institutional limits AST(SGOT) and ALT(SPGT) ≤ 2.5 X institutional upper limit of normal creatinine ≤ 1.5 X institutional upper limit of normal At least one cytopenia (ANC ≤ 1800/µL or platelet count ≤ 100,000/µL or hemoglobin [Hgb] ≤10 g/dL) Women of childbearing potential and men with partners of childbearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation, and for 90 days following completion of therapy. If a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. A woman of childbearing potential is any female (regardless of sexual orientation, having undergone a tubal ligation, or remaining celibate by choice) who meets the following criteria: Has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or Has not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 12 consecutive months (i.e., has had menses at any time in the preceding 12 consecutive months) Male and Female patients meeting any of the following exclusion criteria at baseline will be excluded from study participation: Current or anticipated use of other investigational agents Participants who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 3 weeks prior to entering the study or those who have not recovered from clinically significant adverse events due to agents administered more than 3 weeks earlier. The Principal Investigator or treating investigator will determine if any abnormal laboratory values or toxicities are due to prior agents administered vs. disease and if they are clinically significant. History of allergic reactions or sensitivity to pyrimethamine Patients with a history of folic acid deficiency, currently on folic acid replacement therapy or a previous history of megaloblastic anemia thought related to folic acid deficiency Current use or anticipated need for treatment with any medications or substances that are inhibitors or inducers of CYP2C9. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements Pregnant or nursing. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because pyrimethamine is a class C agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. As pyrimethamine is also secreted in breast milk, lactating women are also excluded from the study. Because there is an unknown but potential risk of adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with pyrimethamine, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with pyrimethamine. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study. There is a potential for congenital abnormalities and for this regimen to harm nursing infants</criteria>
