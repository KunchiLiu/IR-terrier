	<brief_title>Use of 3M Cavilon Advanced Skin Protectant in the Management of Damaged Skin Around an Ostomy, Drain or Fistula</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a pilot study evaluating the product, 3M™ Cavilon™ Advanced Skin Protectant, for the management of skin around an ostomy, drain and/or fistula. All subjects will receive the product for up to 14 days. The primary site must have red skin with breakdown (i.e. skin erosion and denudation or denudation of skin alone). Secondary sites can have red skin with or without breakdown. Product will be applied twice/week or more frequently if additional applications are needed due to leakage, skin irritation or standard of care. Skin assessments (including photography) will be completed at baseline and at all follow-up visits.</detailed_description>
