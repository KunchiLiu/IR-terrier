	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the mass balance (that is, cumulative excretion of total radioactivity [TRA] in urine and feces) of pevonedistat following a single 1-hour infusion of 25 milligram per square meter (mg/m^2) [14C]-pevonedistat intravenous (IV) solution containing approximately 60 to 85 microcurie (mCi) (approximately 2.22-3.145 megabecquerel [MBq]) of TRA in participants with advanced solid tumors in Part A.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of [14 C]-Pevonedistat in Participants With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug being tested in this study is called Pevonedistat. Pevonedistat is being tested to treat people with advanced solid tumors. The study will enroll approximately 4 to 6 pharmacokinetics (PK)-evaluable participants in part A. After completion of the mass balance and absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion (ADME) assessment in Part A of the study, eligible participants will have the opportunity to continue into Part B at a secondary study site, which would begin in approximately 2 weeks of completion of Part A. - Part A: Pevonedistat 25 mg/m^2 - Part B (optional): Pevonedistat in combination with chemotherapy regimens (Pevonedistat 25 mg/m^2 + docetaxel 75 mg/m^2 or pevonedistat 20 mg/m^2 + carboplatin 20 mg/m^2 + paclitaxel 175 mg/m^2) All participants will receive study drug via intravenous route. This multi-center trial will be conducted in Hungary. Participants will remain confined to the study site for 9 to 14 days in Part A. Participation in Part B is optional, participants will be re-evaluated for inclusion/exclusion criteria before administrating treatment. Participants will undergo treatment in Part B for a maximum of 12 cycles (21 days cycle each) and will include approximately 36 weeks for Part A and B combined. Participants will attend an end of study visit 30 days after the last dose of study drug in both Part A and B.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Have a histologically or cytologically confirmed metastatic or locally advanced and incurable solid tumor that is felt to be appropriate for treatment with one of the 2 chemotherapy regimens in Part B of this study (carboplatin+paclitaxel or docetaxel), or have progressed despite prior standard therapy, or for whom conventional therapy is not considered effective. The tumor must be radiographically or clinically evaluable and/or measurable. 2. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 1. 3. Expected survival longer than 3 months from enrollment in the study. 4. Recovered (that is, less than or equal to [&lt;=] Grade 1 toxicity) from the effects of prior antineoplastic therapy. 1. Has irregular defecation patterns (less than 1 defecation per 2 days or excessive diarrhea) and/or has a history of changes in bowel habits with daily routine or environment changes. 2. Prior treatment with radiation therapy involving greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 25% of the hematopoietically active bone marrow.</criteria>
