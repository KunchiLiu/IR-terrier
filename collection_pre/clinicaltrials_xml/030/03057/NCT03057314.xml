	<criteria>1. Males and females, Age &gt; 18 years 2. Signed the informed consent 3. Late Stage Histologically proven advanced solid tumors for which no standard curative therapy exist, who failed or refused anticancer treatment 4. Performance Status : ECOG 01 5. No brain metastasis by CT or MRI 6. Life Expectancy : at least 2 months 7. Hormonal therapy is allowed if needed 8. Patient is on conservative treatment for relieving his symptoms 9. Subjects within normal range of serumcorrected albumin calcium 10. Acceptable haematology and biochemistry variables: WBC &gt; 3000/mm3 Absolute Neutrophil count &gt; 1500 /mm3 Platelet Count &gt; 100,000/mm3 Hemoglobin &gt; 9 g/dL Bilirubin &lt; 1.5 times ULN ALT and AST &lt; 2 times ULN PT/PTT &lt; 1.5 ULN 11. Subjects must be Vitamin D sufficient upon study entry, which is defined as 25(OH)D serum level &gt;20 ng/mL (50 nmol/L) according to a document composed by the Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine, USA. If the subject is Vitamin D insufficient or deficient, then a loading dose of Vitamin D3 will be administered as follows: 1. If the serum 25(OH)D level is 1220 ng/mL (3050 nmol/L) then a loading oral dose of 50,000 IU of Vitamin D3 should be administered twice with 35 days in between the doses. 2. If the serum 25(OH)D level is â‰¤ 12 ng/mL (30 nmol/L), then a loading oral dose of 50,000 IU of Vitamin D3 will be administered three times with 35 days in between the doses. Serum 25(OH)D levels will be checked 12 weeks following the last loading. 12. Regardless of Vitamin D levels, all subjects will receive a daily maintenance dose of 1000 IU Vitamin D3, which should be taken in the morning with breakfast. 13. Subjects receiving Denosumab or bisphosphonates are eligible provided treatment was initiated at least 2 weeks prior to study enrollment. 14. Negative Pregnancy Test 1. Concurrent treatment with acute anticancer therapy 2. Hypercalcemia 3. Any illness or condition deemed by the physician to contraindicate treatment with ACC or may interfere with the assessment of the therapy 4. Active History with Brain Metastases. 3. Clinical Significant Cardiovascular Disease 4. Known alcohol or drug abuse 5. Any psychiatric condition that would prohibit understanding or rendering of Informed Consent 6. Active Participation in Clinical Trial in the last 2 weeks prior to inclusion 7. Subjects receiving Denosumab or bisphosphonates are not eligible provided treatment was initiated less than 2 weeks prior to study enrolment 8. Persistent Toxicity related to prior therapy greater than 2 NCICTCAE v 4.0 9. Pregnancy</criteria>
