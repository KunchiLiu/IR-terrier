	<brief_summary>This study evaluates a novel collision warning device to help people with severe vision impairment or blindness avoid collisions with obstacles. The main hypothesis to be tested is that the device reduces the number of collisions with obstacles in everyday activities.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Collision Warning Device for Blind and Visually Impaired</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants with blindness or severe visual field loss (hemianopia or tunnel vision) will be trained to use a collision warning device that alerts them to impending collisions. Participants will use the device at home during everyday mobility for 2 months. The device is designed to supplement existing mobility devices, such as a long cane or dog guide. The device will provide warnings about potential collisions with mid- or high-level obstacles (which are typically not detected by a long cane).</detailed_description>
