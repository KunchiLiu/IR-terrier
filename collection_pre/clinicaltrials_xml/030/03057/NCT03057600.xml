	<detailed_description>CX-839-007 is an open-label Phase 2 study of the combination of CB-839 with paclitaxel in patients of African ancestry and non-African ancestry with advanced triple negative breast cancer. Multiple single-arm cohorts will be enrolled in which 800 mg BID CB-839 will be administered in combination with the full approved dose of paclitaxel. Patients will be enrolled into 4 cohorts, as follows: - Cohort 1: patients of African ancestry with 2 or more lines of prior therapy for metastatic disease - Cohort 2: patients of African ancestry with no prior lines of therapy for metastatic disease - Cohort 3: same as cohort 1 but in patients of non-African ancestry - Cohort 4: same as cohort 2 but in patients of non-African ancestry</detailed_description>
