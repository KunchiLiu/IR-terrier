	<brief_summary>This research trial studies late effects after treatment in patients with previously diagnosed high-risk neuroblastoma. Studying late effects after treatment may help to decide which treatments for high-risk neuroblastoma are better tolerated with less side effects over time.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Late Effects After Treatment in Patients With Previously Diagnosed High-Risk Neuroblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To estimate the prevalence of organ dysfunction, subsequent malignant neoplasm (SMN), growth impairment, abnormal pubertal development, and neurobehavioral dysfunction in a large cohort of representative 5-year survivors of high-risk neuroblastoma treated with modern therapy. II. To identify the demographic, clinical and treatment-related risk factors associated with increased risk of organ dysfunction, SMN, growth impairment, abnormal pubertal development and neurobehavioral dysfunction in long-term survivors of high-risk neuroblastoma. III. To explore the impact of new biologic therapies and diagnostics including immunotherapy, immunocytokines, isotretinoin (cis-retinoic acid) and iobenguane I-131 (131 I-MIBG) on the risk of late effects. IV. To determine the impact of impaired organ function, physical growth, pubertal development, and neurobehavioral function on health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in long-term survivors of high-risk neuroblastoma. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To establish a cohort of high-risk neuroblastoma survivors, with stored peripheral blood samples, who were treated with multi-modal therapies since the year 2000 as a resource for future investigation. OUTLINE: Patients undergo collection of blood and urine samples on day 1. Patients also undergo clinical assessments, laboratory, radiographic, and other ancillary studies on day 1.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must have been enrolled on COG neuroblastoma biology study ANBL00B1 Patient must have been diagnosed with highrisk neuroblastoma per ANBL00B1 definition Patient must have been diagnosed on or after January 1, 2000 At least 5 years must have elapsed since diagnosis Patients must have been treated for highrisk neuroblastoma Note: patients may have had any therapy for highrisk neuroblastoma, including second line or nonestablished therapies (for example in the setting of less than optimal initial response or concerns for high risk of relapse); patients may have received therapy for refractory or relapsed neuroblastoma, or treatment for an SMN; however all cytotoxic antineuroblastoma therapy should have been administered &gt;= 2 years of the enrollment date; SMN therapy may be completed or ongoing at the time of enrollment Patients must not be currently receiving active antineuroblastoma cytotoxic chemotherapy Patients must not have received antineuroblastoma cytotoxic chemotherapy within the last two years Note: cytotoxic therapies include (but are not limited to) chemotherapy (platinum agents, alkylators, anthracyclines, topoisomerases, vinca alkaloids, other cytotoxic chemotherapy), any kind of transplant, MIBG therapy, and/or radiation therapy Noncytotoxic (biologic/targeted/differentiating/other) therapies are permitted at the time of enrollment; for example, patients receiving oral differentiating agents, antiangiogenic therapy, immune modulators, holistic therapies, difluoromethylornithine (DMFO), other minimal residual disease (MRD) therapies/relapseprevention therapies are eligible Patients with current active neuroblastoma relapse are ineligible</criteria>
