	<brief_summary>This study will be an observational, prospective trial that will measure the cerebral oxygenation of infants scheduled to undergo general anesthesia at Boston Children's Hospital.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Newborn Project: Examining the Oxygenation of Brain Tissue During General Anesthesia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Data will be collected from the Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) monitor and the patient's medical record. When the NIRS sensor is attached to the patient's forehead the oxygenation of brain tissue will be continuously monitored. All other information will be routinely recorded as standard clinical care and this information will be obtained from the patient's medical record. The NIRS monitor data will by time synched to the anesthesia record and downloaded to a secured password protected file. In the post-operative period, patient data will be collected including: 1) any skin findings related to the placement of the NIRS or pulse oximetry probes 2) any unanticipated need for hemodynamic support, 3) laboratory values including hemoglobin levels, electrolytes, and blood gases, 4) new neurological findings (seizures etc.)</detailed_description>
