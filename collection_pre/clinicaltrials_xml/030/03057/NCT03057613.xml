	<brief_summary>A small group of skin cancers of the head and neck, called resected cutaneous squamous carcinomas, are more aggressive than most cancers of this type, even after being treated with standard therapy. This trial will use stronger treatment to look at the safety and effectiveness (efficacy) of combining a drug called Pembrolizumab with radiation after a cancer has already been treated to suppress secondary tumor formation in high risk cutaneous squamous cell cancer of the head and neck. Primary Objective To assess safety by looking at the people with dose limiting responses</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Addition of Pembrolizumab to Postoperative Radiotherapy in Cutaneous Squamous Cell Cancer of the Head and Neck</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objective: To assess safety and estimate 1-year PFS of postoperative radiation therapy (RT) + concurrent and adjuvant Pembrolizumab in high risk resected cutaneous squamous cell cancer of the head and neck (cSCC-HN). Secondary Objectives 1. To evaluate the relationship of baseline programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression by tumor and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) to preliminary efficacy . 2. To phenotype tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs), and investigate tumor suppressor populations including Tregs, myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8) suppressor cells and assess ex vivo for effector function by cytokine production and cytotoxicity assays as well as suppressor function in assays with autologous PBLs. 3. For those participants for whom tumor tissue is available, we will evaluate the tumor microenvironment (TME), and immune markers at the invasive margin of the tumor, including CD8, PD-1, PD-L1, T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin-domain containing-3 (TIM-3), galectin-9 or high-mobility group protein 1 (HMGB-1), B- and T- lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA) and herpes virus entry mediator (HVEM), as well as lymphocyte-activation gene 3 (Lag-3), cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) and others. 4. If sufficient tumor is available, we will also evaluate the genomic and/or transcriptomic profile of a subset of tumors using RNA-seq /Whole Transcriptome Shotgun Sequencing. Trial Design: This is a phase II trial evaluating the addition of concurrent and adjuvant fixed-dose pembrolizumab in combination with standard intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), in order to establish safety and estimate efficacy of this regimen to be tested in a subsequent randomized registration trial. Thirty seven patients will be enrolled.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologic diagnosis of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck that has been resected with no evidence of gross residual disease (margin positivity is acceptable) Patients must have undergone resection of the disease and demonstrate high risk pathologic features including: T4 Node positive disease T2/T3N0 disease with any 1 additional feature, including: Recurrent Disease Perineural invasion Lymphovascular space invasion Poorly differentiated histology Positive Margins Satellitosis or intransit metastases Patients are required to have computerized tomography (CT) neck and chest or positron emission tomography/computerized tomography (PET/CT) and have no documented evidence of distant metastases Patients must not have a history of the following immunosuppressive conditions: bone marrow transplantation, lymphoid malignancies, or organ transplants and/or chronic rheumatic conditions that require active immunosuppressive therapy. Patients may not have had prior therapy with a checkpoint inhibitor (e.g. antiCTLA4, antiPD1 or antiPDL1 therapy) Patients may not have had prior radiotherapy (&gt;30Gy) to the area requiring treatment that would result in any overlap of tissue in both fields Patients may have received chemotherapy or radiation for a previous, curatively treated malignancy provided at least 2 years have elapsed and there is no current evidence of disease (patients with previous or concurrent additional skin cancers are eligible) Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status 01 Female subject of childbearing potential should have a negative urine or serum pregnancy within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study medication. If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required. Female subjects of childbearing potential should be willing to use 2 methods of birth control or be surgically sterile, or abstain from heterosexual activity for the course of the study through 120 days after the last dose of study medication. Subjects of childbearing potential are those who have not been surgically sterilized or have not been free from menses for &gt; 1 year. Male subjects should agree to use an adequate method of contraception starting with the first dose of study therapy through 120 days after the last dose of study therapy. Patients must have adequate laboratory values Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mcL Platelets ≥ 100,00/mcL Hemoglobin ≥ 9g/dL or ≥5.6mmol/L without transfusion Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN) or measured creatinine clearance ≥60mL/min for subject with creatinine levels &gt;1.5 times institutional ULN Serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 times ULN or direct bilirubin ≤ ULN for subjects with total bilirubin levels &gt; 1.5 ULN Aspartate aminotransferase (AST (SGOT)) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT (SPGT)) ≤ 2.5 times ULN or ≤ 5 times ULN for subjects with liver metastases Albumin ≥ 2.5mg/dL International Normalized Ratio (INR) or Prothrombin Time (PT) ≤1.5 times ULN unless subject is receiving anticoagulant therapy as long as PT is within therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulants. Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT) ≤1.5 times ULN unless subject is receiving anticoagulant therapy as long as PT or aPTT is within therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulants Is currently participating and receiving study therapy or has participated in a study of an investigational agent and received study therapy or used an investigational device within 4 weeks of the first dose of treatment. Has a known history of active Bacillus Tuberculosis (TB) Hypersensitivity to pembrolizumab. Has a history of the following immunosuppressive conditions: bone marrow transplantation, lymphoid malignancies, or organ transplants and/or chronic rheumatic conditions that require active immunosuppressive therapy Has had a prior anticancer monoclonal antibody (mAb) within 4 weeks prior to study Day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e.≤ Grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier. Has had prior chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy, or radiotherapy within 2 weeks prior to study Day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e. ≤ Grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events due to a previously administered agent. Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment. Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin or a separate primary squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.

Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with cooperation with the requirements of the trial. Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the projected duration of the trial, starting with the prescreening or screening visit through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment.
