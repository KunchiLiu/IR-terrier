	<brief_summary>Title: Active surveillance for adverse events following immunization with the trivalent influenza vaccine (split virion and inactivated) produced at Butantan Institute. Rationale and background: Since 2013, IB has been performing passive pharmacovigilance activities related to TIV. Data sources for safety surveillance currently include data shared by the National Immunization Program and data collected from IB´s customer service channels. IB will implement this active surveillance study as part of our pharmacovigilance plan in order to better define the incidence of selected adverse events following immunization (AEFI) with TIV, while passive surveillance activities will continue. Obtaining pharmacovigilance data on TIV, via active surveillance, is being implemented in response to WHO requirements for pre-qualification of TIV. Prequalification of the vaccine will allow its use in multiple regions around the world. Study objectives: Primary objective: to characterize and estimate the incidence of solicited adverse events following immunization (AEFI) associated with administration of the trivalent influenza vaccine produced at Butantan Institute (TIV). Secondary objectives: 1) to characterize and estimate the incidence of overall (solicited and unsolicited) AEFI associated with administration of TIV; 2) to characterize and estimate the incidence of unsolicited AEFI associated with administration of TIV. Study Design: This is a prospective cohort study aimed at identifying and evaluating adverse events following immunization among individuals vaccinated with TIV during the national immunization campaign. The design will include active surveillance by phone contact and through visits to the study site. Health facilities will be designated and set up as sentinel sites to enroll individuals being vaccinated with IB TIV for active follow up of solicited AEFI occurring within the first 14 days post-vaccination, and unsolicited AEFI up to 6 weeks post-vaccination. Population: The following groups are targeted groups for the national immunization campaign and will be recruited for participation in this study: - children between six months and five years old; - pregnant women; postpartum women (mothers until 45 days after birth); - healthcare workers; and - elderly (people over 60 years old). Variables: Solicited AEFI to be monitored will include local reactions (erythema, pain, swelling, ecchymosis, pruritus and induration), systemic reactions (headache, fever, malaise, arthralgia, myalgia, rash, chills, pruritus, fatigue, sweating) and irritability and persistent crying (for children than 6 years). Unsolicited AEFI reported over the period up to 6 weeks post-vaccination will be recorded. All adverse events reported in the study will be MedDRA coded. Other variables of interest in the study are demographic information of study participants: date of birth, gender, age, ethnicity, as well as vaccination information including date of immunization, site, and vaccine lot. Data Sources: Study information including signs and symptoms following immunization with TIV will be recorded daily for 14 days post immunization, and will be recorded in the participant's study file. Study Size: A total of 900 individuals (300 health care workers, 300 elderly, 100 pregnant women, 100 post-partum women and 100 children between six months and five years old), presenting for immunization with IB TIV, and who agree to participate after providing Informed Consent, will be enrolled in the study by study staff. Data Analyses: Descriptive approaches will be used to meet the defined objectives described in the protocol, as well as formal statistical tests when appropriate. Incidence rates (IR) of AEFI with TIV will be calculated as the number of events divided by the total number of participants exposed to TIV in each of the targeted groups over the period of follow up. IR will be calculated based on total person time of follow-up, 95% confidence intervals will be calculated.</brief_summary>
