	<brief_summary>Introduction: Post-exercise recovery techniques have been extensively investigated in order to optimize the restoration of various body functions and consequently of performance. Massage represents approximately 45% of the time spent by a sports physiotherapist in the field, however, their mechanisms are not well established and studies present divergent results in the literature. Objectives: The objective of this study is to analyze and compare the effects of massage when applied immediately or 1 hour after physical exertion, on functional, clinical and metabolic variables. Design: A cross-over randomized clinical trial. Participants: Forty men aged 18 to 30 years, healthy and that fulfilling the eligibility criteria. Procedures: Participants will be randomized into five groups (n = 8 per group): (GA, GB, GC, GD and GE), which will perform the 5 stages of the study at randomized times, one stage per session. Stage 1: control; Stage 2: Participants will receive the massage protocol; Stage 3: physical exercise protocol; Stage 4: Participants will perform the physical exercise protocol and immediately after, will receive the massage; Stage 5: Participants will perform the physical exercise protocol and 1 hour after the end of the exercise they will receive the massage. Sessions will occur with a 1-week interval between them. Measurements. The primary outcome measures will be measured 2h after the start of each stage, and the secondary outcome measures will be measured at specific times during each stage. The primary outcome includes measures of functional performance, and the measures of secondary outcome includes clinical and metabolic variables.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Introduction: Post-exercise recovery techniques have been extensively investigated in order to optimize the restoration of various body functions and consequently of performance. Massage represents approximately 45% of the time spent by a sports physiotherapist in the field, however, their mechanisms are not well established and studies present divergent results in the literature. Objectives: The objective of this study is to analyze the magnitude of the effects of massage on functional, clinical and metabolic variables. The secondary objective is to compare the effect of manual massage as a post-exercise recovery technique applied at different times (1. Immediately after physical exertion; 2. 1 hour after the end of intense exercise) on the functional, clinical and metabolic outcomes of physically active subjects Design: A cross-over randomized clinical trial. Participants: After fulfilling the eligibility criteria, forty male participants will participate in the study. The inclusion criteria include: healthy male, aged between 18-30 years, with level of physical activity within the group average. The exclusion criteria include: presence of anemia, inflammatory process, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, alcoholics, smokers, users of illicit drugs, chronic users of anti-inflammatory drugs and occurrence of muscle injuries in the lower limbs and/or trunk in the last six months. Procedures: Participants will be randomized into five groups (n = 8 per group): (GA, GB, GC, GD and GE), which will perform the 5 stages of the study at randomized times, one stage per session. Stage 1: control; Stage 2: Participants will receive the massage protocol; Stage 3: physical exercise protocol; Stage 4: Participants will perform the physical exercise protocol and immediately after, will receive the massage; Stage 5: Participants will perform the physical exercise protocol and 1 hour after the end of the exercise they will receive the massage. Sessions will occur with a 1-week interval between them. Intervention: The first three stages of the study (E1, E2 and E3) will be performed to know the basal behavior of the study variables and / or before the two different stimuli (massage and physical exercise). In stages 4 and 5 will be performed the analysis of the effects of massage on post-exercise recovery, and the comparison of the effects of massage when performed immediately after exertion or 1 hour after exertion. The sequence of performance of the functional tests will always be the same, regardless of the stage of the study, being the following order: 1st Vertical Jump Test; 2ยบ Maximum Isometric Voluntary Measurements. The primary outcome measures will be measured 2h after the start of each stage, and the secondary outcome measures will be measured at specific times during each stage. The primary measures includes the Strength and power test, Maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) and Squat jump. The secondary measures includes the subjective pain assessment, perception of recovery, psychological questionnaire, belief questionnaire and de analysis blood lactate concentration. Analysis: The normality of the data will be evaluated through the Shapiro-Wilk test. For the analysis of the clinical, functional and metabolic parameters between the groups in the case of normal distribution, one-way ANOVA with post-test of Tukey and Kruskal-Wallis will be adopted with Dunn post-test if there is no normal distribution. For the analysis of these parameters, however, within the groups (moments of analysis) will be used ANOVA for repeated measurements with Tukey post-test for normal data and Friedman's test with Dunn post-test for non-normal data. The level of significance was set at p &lt;0.05 for all tests.</detailed_description>
