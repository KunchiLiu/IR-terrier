	<brief_title>A Safety and Efficacy Study of TALEN and CRISPR/Cas9 in the Treatment of HPV-related Cervical Intraepithelial NeoplasiaⅠ</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>HPV persistent infection is the major causal factor of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and cervical cancer. The important roles of E6 and E7 playing in HPV-driven carcinogenesis make them attractive targets for therapeutic interventions. Previous evidences showed that using designated TALEN and CRISPR/Cas9 as genome editing tool could produce disruption of HPV16 and HPV18 E6/E7 DNA, significantly decreasing the expression of E6/E7, inducing cell apoptosis and inhibiting cell lines growth. This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of TALEN-HPV E6/E7 and CRISPR/Cas9-HPV E6/E7 in treating HPV Persistency and HPV-related Cervical Intraepithelial NeoplasiaⅠ</detailed_description>
