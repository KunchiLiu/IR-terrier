	<brief_summary>OBJECTIVE: To determine the quality of life (QOL) and clinical outcome after conservative therapy, embolization (proximal versus distal) or surgery in patients with traumatic splenic injury. Secondary aims: (I) to examine therapy-related complications, (II) to establish the necessity of additional therapies, (III) the assessment of splenic function related to splenic morphology (MR imaging) after embolization and (IV) to find the prognostic factors for failure of non-operative management (NOM) in patients with splenic injuries. Finally, with the acquired data from this study a patient-oriented protocol will be provided for the management of traumatic splenic injury. HYPOTHESIS: The investigators expect that NOM is superior to surgery with regard to QOL, clinical outcome and splenic function. Embolization will need more additional therapies. Splenic morphology is related to splenic immune function. Expected prognostic factors are age above 40, ISS &gt;25 and a splenic injury grade of 3 or higher. STUDY DESIGN: A combination of a retrospective and a prospective multicentre cohort study. This protocol involves the prospective part of the study. STUDY POPULATION/DATASET: Patients who enter the participating hospitals between March 2017 and July 2018 with splenic injury will be asked to participate. The follow-up period will be one year with regard to QOL, clinical symptoms and imaging. INTERVENTION: All patients will complete a number of questionnaires at different time points. The patients who were treated with splenic artery embolization (SAE) will undergo an MRI one month and one year after treatment. OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome is QOL. Secondary outcomes are clinical symptoms and imaging. SAMPLE SIZE: Approximately 100 patients will be included per year during the inclusion phase. DATA ANALYSIS: With regard to the prospective data linear modelling will be performed. COLLABORATION/CONNECTION: Tilburg University, Erasmus medical center Rotterdam, Maasstad hospital Rotterdam, Albert Schweitzer hospital Dordrecht, Amphia hospital Breda. TIME SCHEDULE: Year 1: literature search and conducting the retrospective study and analyses. Years 1-3: inclusion prospective study and follow-up of patients. Year 4: finishing follow-up data collection and analysing.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Splenic injury after blunt abdominal trauma (confirmed by FAST and/or CT) The patient underwent NOM/SAE/splenectomy for the management of traumatic splenic injury The treatment took place in the period from March 2017 to July 2018 at one of the five selected hospitals 18 years or older. Insufficient knowledge of the Dutch language Patients who died during or after treatment are (of course) excluded for questionnaires and MRI, not for clinical outcomes Exclusion for MRI only: Patients treated with SAE: patients who do not want to or are not able to undergo an MRI abdomen (for example pregnant women or other contraindications for MRI). Patients excluded for MRI still need to fill out the questionnaires. Also, their clinical outcomes will be processed in the database.</criteria>
