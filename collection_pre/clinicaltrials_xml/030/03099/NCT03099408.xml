	<brief_title>Oral Metronidazole With Lactobacillus Vaginal Suppositories to Prevent Recurrence of Bacterial Vaginosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the most prevalent cause of symptomatic vaginal discharge in the U.S. and has been associated with complications including preterm delivery of infants, pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), urinary tract infections (UTI) and acquisition/transmission of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Control of BV has been advocated as a means of decreasing the prevalence of these complications. However, the etiology of BV remains unknown and the current treatment regimens are inadequate in terms of initial cure and recurrence rates. Based on currently national guidelines by using oral metronidazole 400 BID for 7 days, a high recurrence rate of BV were reported. We hypothesize that the Oral Metronidazole with Lactobacillus Vaginal Suppositories is better than Oral Metronidazole in Preventing the Recurrence of Bacterial Vaginosis</detailed_description>
