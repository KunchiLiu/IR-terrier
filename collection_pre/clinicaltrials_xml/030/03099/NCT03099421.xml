	<brief_title>Prostatic Artery Embolization for Benign Prostatic Obstruction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective study investigating the safety and efficacy of PAE for patients who refuse or are not eligible for surgery and who suffers from moderate-severe lower urinary tract symptoms or indwelling catheter secondary to benign prostatic obstruction due to benign prostatic hyperplasia. It may form the grounding for further research in the shape of a larger randomised clinical trial. Our hypothesis is that PAE will eliminate the need for indwelling catheter and improve IPSS 12 months post-procedure. 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months follow-up. Main outcome Ability to void after removal of indwelling catheter Secondary outcomes DAN-PSS International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) Quality of Life (QoL) International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) Prostate volume Peak void flow (Qmax) Post-void residual (PVR) Classify complications according to Society of Interventional Radiology (SIR) guidelines for reporting Prostate-specific antigen (PSA)</detailed_description>
