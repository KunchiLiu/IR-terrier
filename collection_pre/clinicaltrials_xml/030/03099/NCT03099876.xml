	<brief_title>A Study on Eradication Rate of Triple Therapy According to Treatment Period and CYP2C19 Polymorphisms in H.Pylori Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study compared efficacy and safety of basic triple therapy including Noltec(Ilaprazole) 10mg, Clapaxine(Clarithromycin) 500mg and Pamoxin Cap(Amoxicillin) 1000mg BID on the first line eradication treatment of H.pylori according to treatment period. Participants are defined as persons who have endoscopically confirmed on gastric or duodenal ulcer(including scar stage) and gastritis confirmed to be H.pylori positive patients in the UBT test. For 7 days or 10 days Participants treated as basic triple therapy including Noltec(Ilaprazole) 10mg, Clapaxine(Clarithromycin) 500mg and Pamoxin Cap(Amoxicillin) 1000mg BID. After treatment, The healing rate was evaluated in the UBT test at 49Â±5days from the first day dosing. The investigators would point out the impact of CYP2C19 genotypes on Clarythromycin-based first-line and rescue therapies.</detailed_description>
