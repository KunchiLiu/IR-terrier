	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: To document the tolerability of patients receiving study medication at 12-week of therapy in terms of the scoring system assessed by the investigator. Secondary Objectives: - To document drug safety at 12-week of treatment in terms of number of Adverse Drug Reaction or Serious Adverse Drug Reaction reported. - To describe the population treated as per the HOPE study indication in current clinical practice (demographics, cardiovascular risk-factors at treatment initiation, concomitant treatments patterns).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria : Man or woman, age 55 years old or more. Presence of a high risk of developing a major cardiovascular event, defined as at least one of the following underlying conditions: Clinical evidence of coronary artery disease (examples: previous myocardial infarction [MI], positive stress test or significant stenosis at coronary angiography, previous Percutaneous TransLuminal Coronary Angioplasty [PTCA], previous Coronary Arterial Bypass Grafting [CABG]); Clinical evidence of peripheral vascular disease (examples: history of intermittent claudication with positive Doppler or angiography, previous limb bypass surgery, previous percutaneous transluminal angioplasty, previous limb or foot amputation); Previous stroke; Diabetes (insulindependent or noninsulin dependent) with at least one of the following cardiovascular risk factors: hypertension (blood pressure [BP] &gt;140/90 mmHg, or patients on antihypertensive treatment); hypercholesterolemia (total cholesterol &gt; 5.2 mmol/L [&gt;200 mg/dL]); low HDL cholesterol (&lt; 0.9 mmol/L [&lt;3.5 mg/dL]); current cigarette smoking; documented microalbuminuria (30300 mg/24 hours); Evidence of previous vascular disease. Exclusion criteria: Patients with contraindications to ramipril use (as per the local Ramipril Product Information) hypersensitivity pregnancy, lactation bilateral renal stenosis Patients with clinically relevant concomitant disease that could compromise the patient's safety or follow up. The above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a patient's potential participation in a clinical trial.</criteria>
