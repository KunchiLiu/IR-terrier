	<brief_title>Withings Pulse Wave Velocity and Blood Pressure Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study population will be an estimated 300 healthy adult subjects from the United States. This population will be approximately 150 men and 150 women. In order to obtain a relatively diverse age range of users (with varying levels of arterial stiffness), we hope to enroll participants across three age ranges entered in the Withings application by the user: 18-40 years, 41-60 years, and &gt; 60 years. These spots will be filled by those that satisfy the inclusion/exclusion criteria on a first come, first served basis.</detailed_description>
