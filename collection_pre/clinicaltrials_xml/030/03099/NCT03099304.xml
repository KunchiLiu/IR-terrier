	<mesh_term>Vitiligo</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Clinical diagnosis of vitiligo. Vitiligo with depigmented areas including: at least 0.5% of the total body surface area (BSA) on the face (0.5% BSA is approximately equal to the area of the participant's palm [without digits]) AND at least 3% of the total BSA on nonfacial areas (3% BSA is approximately equal to the area of 3 of the participant's handprints [palm plus 5 digits]). Participants who agree to discontinue all agents used to treat vitiligo from screening through the final followup visit. Overthecounter preparations deemed acceptable by the investigator and nonocclusive camouflage makeups are permitted. Conditions at baseline that would interfere with evaluation of vitiligo. Participants who are receiving any kind of phototherapy, including tanning beds. Participants with other dermatologic disease besides vitiligo whose presence or treatments could complicate the assessment of repigmentation. Participants who have used skin bleaching treatments for past treatment of vitiligo or other pigmented areas. Participants who have received any of the following treatments within the minimum specified timeframes. Use of any biologic, investigational, or experimental therapy or procedure for vitiligo within 12 weeks or 5 halflives (whichever is longer) of screening. Use of laser or lightbased vitiligo treatments, including tanning beds, within 8 weeks of screening. Use of immunomodulating oral or systemic medications (eg, corticosteroids, methotrexate, cyclosporine) or topical treatments that may affect vitiligo (eg, corticosteroids, tacrolimus/pimecrolimus, retinoids) within 4 weeks of screening. Use of any prior and concomitant therapy not listed above that may interfere with the objective of the study as per discretion of the investigator, including drugs that cause photosensitivity or skin pigmentation (eg, antibiotics such as tetracyclines, antifungals) within 8 weeks of screening. Participants with a clinically significant abnormal thyroidstimulating hormone or free T4 at screening. Participants with protocoldefined cytopenias at screening Participants with severely impaired liver function. Participants with impaired renal function. Participants taking potent systemic cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors or fluconazole within 2 weeks or 5 halflives, whichever is longer, before the baseline visit. Participants who have previously received JAK inhibitor therapy, systemic or topical.</criteria>
