	<detailed_description>The Attain Stability Quad Clinical Study is a prospective, non-randomized, multi-site, global, investigational Device Exemption (IDE), interventional clinical study. The purpose of this clinical study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the Attain Stability™ Quad MRI SureScan LV Lead (Model 4798) in patients indicated for a de novo LV lead implant. This will be assess through a primary safety and primary efficacy endpoints. All subjects included in the study will be implanted with a Medtronic market released de novo CRT-P or CRT-D device and an Attain Stability Quad MRI SureScan LV Lead (Model 4798). Up to 471 subjects will be enrolled into the study and up to 471 Stability Quad MRI SureScan LV Lead (Model 4798) implanted, to ensure a minimum effective sample size of 400 Model 4798 leads implanted with 6 months post implant follow up visits (assuming 15% attrition). The study is expected to be conducted at up to 56 sites worldwide.</detailed_description>
