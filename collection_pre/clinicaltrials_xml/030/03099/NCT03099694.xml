	<brief_summary>The investigators compared advantages and disadvantages of two forms of noninvasive respiratory support —noninvasive high-frequency ventilation (nHFV) or nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) —as a primary mode of ventilation in premature infants with RDS．</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>NHFOV vs. NCPAP as a Primary Treatment to Neonatal Respiratory Distress Syndrome(NRDS)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators enrolled preterm infants at 8 neonatal intensive care units in China. Infants were eligible if they had a gestational age of less than 35 weeks and if they were RDS candidates for noninvasive respiratory support. Infants were excluded if they were diagnosed as white lung, had congenital abnormalities, or had hypercapnia. The parameters such as the concentration of inhalation oxygen (FiO2) were adjusted according to percutaneous oxygen saturation or blood gas analysis.The primary outcome was ratio of intubation if failed non-invasive ventilation, period of non-invasive ventilation if succeed non-invasive ventilation, morbidity of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.</detailed_description>
