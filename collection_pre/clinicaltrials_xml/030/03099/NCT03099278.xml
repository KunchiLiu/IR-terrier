	<brief_summary>Ezetimibe possesses pharmacophore features to inhibit NTCP, the receptor required for HBV and HDV hepatocyte entry that include two hydrophobes and one hydrogen bond acceptor. Therapy with Ezetimibe may lead to decline in hepatitis D virus levels. The aim of the study is to evaluate the utility of Ezetimibe in patients with chronic HDV infection</brief_summary>
