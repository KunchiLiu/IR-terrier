	<brief_title>Non Interventional Study of the Validation of the Ottawa Score in Cancer Patients With Venous Thromboembolism (VTE)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Ottawa score is a clinical predictive score aiming at stratifying thromboembolic recurrences in cancer patients according to identified clinical risk factors and histological type of the tumor. This score has never been validated externally in a prospective way in patients treated with tinzaparin. The objective of this observational prospective study is to enroll cancer patients with TED treated with tinzaparin for a planned period of 6 months and to collect data on thromboembolic recurrences, major hemorrhages, deaths and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia</detailed_description>
