	<brief_summary>The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the durability of Sustained virologic response (SVR) in participants who achieved SVR at last post-therapy visit of parent studies (LPVPS) with NCT Numbers NCT02569710 and NCT02765490.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Long Term Follow-up Study in Participants Treated in a Preceding Phase 2 or 3 Study With a Regimen Containing Odalasvir and AL-335 With or Without Simeprevir for the Treatment of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multicentre study will not provide any study treatment but collect follow-up data for up to 3 years to assess the long term durability of SVR achieved in one of the parent studies [phase 2 or 3 with AL-335 and Odalasvir (ODV) with or without Simeprevir (SMV]. In addition participants who failed to achieve an SVR in the parent study can be enrolled to assess the presence of resistance associated substitutions (RAS) and their persistance over time. It is expected that the vast majority of approximately 250 participants will enrolled in the study. Safety parameters and Liver disease status will be assessed in all participants over time.</detailed_description>
