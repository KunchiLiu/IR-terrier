	<brief_title>PET/CT-directed Hyperfractionated Radiation Dose Escalation in Stage III Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Concurrent chemoradiotherapy is the standard of care for unresectable stage III NSCLC based on the results of phase III randomised trials. The current standard radiation therapy dose has remained 60- Gy at -2 Gy/fraction for nearly four decades (60Gy), with local disease control rates of approximately 50% and a median overall survival of only 18 months.These results are suboptimal and more effective treatment regimens are needed. We hypothesize that hyperfractionated radiation dose escalation to residual tumor volumes after standard chemoradiotherapy as defined by positron emission tomography (PET) /computed tomography (CT) would improve local control and overall survival while reducing the acute and late normal tissue toxicity.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Patients must have FDGavid and histologically or cytologically proven nonsmall cell lung cancer. 2. Age 1 875. 3. Zubrod performance status 02. 4. Stage III ( American Joint Committee on Cancer AJCC, 7th ed.). 5. No prior radiation to the thorax that would overlap with the current treatment field. 6. Adequate bone marrow, renal and hepatic functions as assessed by the following: Hemoglobin &gt;/= 10.0 g/dl, Platelet count &gt;/= 1 00,000/mm^3,absolute granulocyte count (AGC) ≥2 × 10^9 cells/L,bilirubin and Aspartate transaminase ≤1.5 ×upper limit of normal (ULN), Creatinine &lt;/=1 .5 times ULN. 7. A signed informed consent must be obtained prior to therapy. 8. Induction chemotherapy is allowed. 9. Life expectancy more than 3 months. 1. Patients with any component of small cell lung carcinoma are excluded from this study. 2. Patients with evidence of a malignant pleural or pericardial effusion are excluded. 3. Prior radiotherapy that would overlap the radiation fields. 4. Uncontrolled concurrent illness including, but not limited to: Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease(COPD) exacerbation or other respiratory illness, serious uncontrolled infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure (CHF),unstable angina pectoris, uncontrolled hypertension,or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with the study requirements. 5. Known hypersensitivity to paclitaxel. 6. Any other condition or circumstance that would, in the opinion of the Investigator, make the patient unsuitable for participation in the study. 7. Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome. 8. Conditions precluding medical followup and protocol compliance.</criteria>
