	<brief_summary>This is an open-label multi-center trial designed to evaluate the efficacy as well as the safety of combining pembrolizumab with Yttrium-90 (Y90) radioembolization in subjects with poor prognosis (high risk) HCC not eligible for liver transplant or surgical resection with well compensated liver function. Treatment will consist of pembrolizumab 200mg IV every 3 weeks in conjunction with Y90 radioembolization performed one week after the first dose of pembrolizumab. If bilobar disease is present, a second Y90 radioembolization will be performed no later than 4 weeks after the first procedure to the contralateral hepatic lobe.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pembrolizumab Plus Y90 Radioembolization in HCC Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>If a second Y90 radioembolization treatment is required for bilobar disease, this should occur within 4 weeks of the initial procedure (between Cycles 2 and 3 of pembrolizumab). The next dose of pembrolizumab should be separated from the Y90 radioembolization by at least one week. Imaging will be obtained every 9 weeks (after every 3 pembrolizumab treatment) to assess for tumor response and to evaluate for progression. Subjects will remain on treatment until documented tumor progression, unacceptable toxicity, study withdrawal or death. Screening Angiography (shunt study): During screening, subjects will undergo angiography using technetium-99-labeled macroaggregated albumin to detect any uptake outside the liver via measurement of hepatopulmonary shunting. Prior to the angiography, a local anesthetic (to numb the area prior to catheter insertion) and sedation will be administered to the subject, as per institutional standards. This procedure is standard of care for subjects prior to Y90 radioembolization, and will be performed per institutional site standards. Hepatopulmonary shunting must be &lt; 20% for subject to meet eligibility criteria. Subjects will undergo a mandatory tumor biopsy on the same day as the screening angiography. Prior to administration of the first dose of pembrolizumab (i.e., Day 1 of Cycle 1), repeat laboratory tests will be obtained to ensure subject still meets eligibility criteria. Pembrolizumab 200mg IV (IV over 30 minutes) every 3 weeks Day 1 per 21 day cycle (3 weeks). Prior to administration of subsequent pembrolizumab doses, the following criteria must be met: ALT and AST: - Among subjects with baseline (screening) ALT/AST &lt;2×ULN: ALT/AST &lt; 5×ULN - Among subjects with baseline (screening) ALT/AST ≥2×ULN: ALT/AST &lt; 3× the baseline level - ALT/AST ≤ 500 U/L regardless of baseline level Total bilirubin: - Among subjects with baseline levels &lt; 1.5 mg/dL: a value of &lt; 2.0 mg/dL - Among subjects with baseline levels that are ≥ 1.5 mg/dL: a value &lt; 2× the baseline level - Total bilirubin ≤ 3.0 mg/dL regardless of baseline level Y90 radioembolization will be performed as standard of care via institutional standards. To be eligible for Y90 radioembolization, the following criteria must be met: ALT and AST: - Among subjects with baseline (screening) ALT/AST &lt; 2×ULN: ALT/AST &lt; 5×ULN - Among subjects with baseline (screening) ALT/AST ≥ 2×ULN: ALT/AST &lt; 3× the baseline level - ALT/AST ≤ 500 U/L regardless of baseline level Total bilirubin: - Among subjects with baseline levels &lt; 1.5 mg/dL: a value of &lt; 2.0 mg/dL - Among subjects with baseline levels that are ≥ 1.5 mg/dL: a value &lt; 2× the baseline level - Total bilirubin ≤ 3.0 mg/dL regardless of baseline level In addition, any non-hepatic toxicities from the prior dose(s) of pembrolizumab must have resolved to Grade ≤ 2.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subject must meet all of the following applicable inclusion criteria to participate in this study: Written informed consent and HIPAA authorization for release of personal health information prior to registration. NOTE: HIPAA authorization may be included in the informed consent or obtained separately ECOG Performance Status of 01 Locally advanced HCC as defined by: 1) tissue diagnosis OR 2) alphafetoprotein (AFP) &gt; 400 ng/mL with compatible mass on contrastenhanced imaging OR 3) compatible mass on dual phase CT or dynamic contrast enhanced MRI demonstrating both arterial hypervascularity and delayed washout Hepatopulmonary shunting &lt; 20% as documented via hepatic artery perfusion study No evidence of extrahepatic metastatic disease Subjects must be considered poor prognosis by the following parameters: 1) right or left portal vein involvement (NOTE: subjects with main portal vein involvement are excluded), 2) multifocal disease (more than 3 tumors regardless of size) AND/OR 3) diffuse disease considered amenable to liver directed therapy. Subjects with chronic infection by HCV who are untreated or who failed previous therapies for HCV are allowed on study. In addition, subjects with successful HCV treatment (defined as sustained virologic response [SVR] 12 or SVR 24) are allowed as long as 4 weeks have passed between completion of HCV therapy and start of study drug. If active HBV, viral load must be &lt;100IU/mL; if active HBV, subjects must be on antiviral medication for ≥ 3 months prior to study registration and remain on the same antiviral regimen throughout study treatment. NOTE: those subjects who are positive for Hepatitis B core antibody (antiHBc), negative for Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and negative for Hepatitis B surface antibody (antiHBs), and have an HBV viral load &lt;100 IU/mL do not require HBV antiviral prophylaxis. Not eligible for surgical resection or liver transplant or have refused such procedures. All disease must be amenable to embolization in one or two procedures ChildsPugh Cirrhotic Status A or B with a maximum score of 7 No evidence of clinically apparent ascites or active encephalopathy, and/or varices that have not been treated. Subjects with controlled ascites or encephalopathy are eligible so long as they meet ChildsPugh score criterion. Please note that controlled ascites and encephalopathy require scores of 2 each when calculating the CP score. No prior systemic therapy or radiotherapy (including Y90 radioembolization or cyberknife) for HCC. No prior TAE or TACE allowed. Previous liver resection and ablation therapy is permitted.
