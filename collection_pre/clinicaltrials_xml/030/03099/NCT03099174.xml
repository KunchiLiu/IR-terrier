	<brief_summary>For each dose finding cohorts (A, B, C and D): The primary objective of each dose finding cohort is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) / recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of xentuzumab in combination with abemaciclib with or without hormonal therapy (letrozole, anastrozole, fulvestrant). Dose limiting toxicities (DLT) will be assessed during the first treatment cycle to assess the MTD/RP2D. In case that no MTD is reached a RP2D dose will be determined taking into account safety data and other available information. This will be agreed with the Steering Committee. For each expansion cohorts (E and F): The objectives of the expansion cohorts are to assess the anti-tumour activity of xentuzumab in combination with abemaciclib in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (cohort E). Tentatively a cohort F may be opened to assess the anti-tumour activity of the triplet combination xentuzumab / abemaciclib and fulvestrant in a single-arm expansion group of patients with locally advanced / metastatic hormone receptor positive (HR+) breast cancer who have progressed following prior aromatase inhibitor therapy and prior CDK4/6 inhibitor treatment. Cohort F will only be opened if indicated by emerging data from ongoing clinical trials.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>This Study in Patients With Different Types of Cancer (Solid Tumours) Aims to Find a Safe Dose of Xentuzumab in Combination With Abemaciclib With or Without Hormonal Therapies. The Study Also Tests How Effective These Medicines Are in Patients With Lung and Breast Cancer.</brief_title>

For Cohort F only: patients should have at least one measurable lesion. Cohort B, C, D, F Must be eligible for the corresponding hormonal therapy (letrozole, anastrozole or fulvestrant). For Cohorts B and C previous treatment with fulvestrant or exemestane is allowed. For Cohort D and F prior therapy with non steroidal aromatase inhibitors (anastrozole, letrozole) or exemestane are permitted Cohort F only: Postmenopausal with locally advanced or metastatic HR+ breast cancer and refractory to aromatase inhibitors therapy and CDK4/6 inhibitor treatment (e.g., palbociclib or ribociclib) for locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer.Resistance to aromatase inhibitors therapy is defined as the following: disease recurrence while on, or within 12 months of end of adjuvant treatment with letrozole, anastrozole, or exemestane; or disease progression while on, or within one month of end of letrozole, anastrozole, or exemestane.
