	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of preladenant alone and in combination with pembrolizumab (pembro) in participants with advanced solid tumors that have not responded to prior therapy. This study will be done in 2 parts. Part 1 will identify and confirm the recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) of preladenant when given alone or in combination with pembrolizumab. Part 2 of the study will determine the safety and efficacy of preladenant in combination with pembrolizumab at the RP2D in participants with select solid tumors .</brief_summary>
