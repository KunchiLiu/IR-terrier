	<brief_summary>Postoperative urinary tract infections (UTIs) affect 20-30% of patients undergoing elective gynecologic surgery and have a significant socioeconomic impact and cost. Preoperative antibiotics, sterile operating techniques, postoperative antibiotic and non-antibiotic medical therapies have been utilized to attempt to decrease this rate with little improvement. Utilization of an intraoperative antibiotic cystoscopic irrigant may decrease postoperative UTIs. The investigators have designed a prospective randomized controlled study to evaluate the effectiveness of an antibiotic cystoscopic fluid in preventing postoperative urinary tract infections in women undergoing elective pelvic floor surgery with cystoscopy.</brief_summary>
