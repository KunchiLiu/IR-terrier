	<brief_summary>The study aims to exam whether sinew acupuncture can relieve pain and symptoms of KOA and improve functional movement by Visual Analog Scale (VAS), Western Ontario and McMasters University Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), Timed up &amp; Go Test (TUG) and 8-step Stair Climb Test (SCT) assessment, and Quality of life by Short Form-36 (SF-36). A randomized, sham acupuncture controlled, patient and assessor blinded, pilot study will be employed.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective: The proposal aims to examine the efficacy and safety of sinew acupuncture for knee osteoarthritis (KOA). Hypothesis to be tested: Sinew acupuncture can reduce pain intensity, and improve knee function and health-related quality of life without significant side effects for KOA subjects compared to a sham acupuncture treatment. Design: A randomized, subject- and assessor-blind, sham acupuncture-controlled clinical trial Participants: Subjects (N=86) will be randomized into sinew acupuncture or sham acupuncture group (in 1:1 ratio). Study instrument: Visual Analog Scale (VAS), Western Ontario and McMasters University Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), Timed up &amp; Go Test (TUG), 8-step Stair Climb Test (SCT) assessment, and the Short Form-36 (SF-36). Intervention: Sinew acupuncture group will receive 10 sessions of needling in 4 weeks. Sham group will receive the non-invasive treatment with the same procedures. All subjects are followed up for 6 weeks. Main outcome measures: VAS for knee pain intensity at week 4 serves as the primary outcome. VAS at other time points, WOMAC score, TUG, SCT and SF-36 will be analyzed as the secondary outcomes. Data analysis: Analysis will be on the 'intention to treat' principle. T-test and mixed-effect model analysis will be used to measure primary and secondary outcomes respectively. Expected results: Sinew acupuncture treatment can significantly reduce knee pain intensity, and improve knee function and quality of life without obvious side effects.</detailed_description>
