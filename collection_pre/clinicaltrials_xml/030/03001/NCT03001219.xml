	<brief_summary>This is a Phase 2 double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, parallel group, multicenter study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of RO7123520 as adjunctive therapy in participants with RA who are inadequately responding to standard-of-care (methotrexate and anti-TNF-alpha therapy). Part 1 of the study will evaluate safety. Part 2 will evaluate efficacy and safety. Part 3 will evaluate dose-ranging efficacy. Participants will have the option of continuing to the extension period of the study.</brief_summary>
