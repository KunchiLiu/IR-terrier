	<brief_summary>Preconditioning of regional skin is known to reduce post surgery complications due to increased perfusion and better skin condition. The aim of this study is to prove that local heating through a standardized device in patients with spinal cord injury induces no burnings or other relevant side effects. The investigators expect an increased regional perfusion, temperature and redness.</brief_summary>
