	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the outcomes of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy versus neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by minimally invasive esophagectomy on patients with locally advanced resectable esophageal squamous cell carcinoma(cT3-4aN0-1M0).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Between NCRT and NCT Followed by MIE for Treatment of Locally Advanced Resectable ESCC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It is a prospective randomized phase III clinical trial sponsored by Shanghai Zhongshan Hospital with other eight hospitals in China participating in. 264 patients with locally advanced resectable esophageal squamous cell carcinoma(cT3-4aN0-1M0) are recruited and randomly assigned into the neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy group (NCRT group) and the neoadjuvant chemotherapy group (NCT group) according to the proportion of 1:1.The safety,efficacy of protocols and prognosis of patients are compared between the two regimens.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Histologicallyconfirmed squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus; 2. Tumors of the esophagus are located in the thoracic cavity; 3. Pretreatment stage as cT34aN01M0 (AJCC/UICC 7th Edition) (In case of stage cT4a, curative resectability has to be explicitly verified by the local surgical investigator prior to randomization). 4. Age is between 18 years and 75 years, 5. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 01; 6. Adequate cardiac function. All patients should perform ECG, and those with a cardiac history or ECG abnormality should perform echocardiography with the left ventricular ejection fraction &gt; 50 %. 7. Adequate respiratory function with FEV1≥1.2L, FEV1%≥50% and DLCO≥50% shown in pulmonary function tests. 8. Adequate bone marrow function (White Blood Cells &gt;4x10^9 /L; Neutrophil &gt;2.0×10^9 /L; Hemoglobin &gt; 90 g/L; platelets&gt;100x10^9 /L); 9. Adequate liver function (Total bilirubin &lt;1.5x Upper Level of Normal (ULN); Aspartate transaminase(AST) and Alanine transaminase (ALT) &lt;1.5x ULN); 10. Adequate renal function (Glomerular filtration rate (CCr) &gt;60 ml/min; serum creatinine (SCr) ≤120 µmol/L)； 11. The patient has provided written informed consent and is able to understand and comply with the study; 1. Patients with nonsquamous cell carcinoma histology; 2. Patients with advanced inoperable or metastatic esophageal cancer; 3. Pretreatment stage as cT12N01M0 (AJCC/UICC 7th Edition); 4. Pretreatment stage as cN23 or cT4b(noncurativelyresectable verified by the local surgical investigator, AJCC/UICC 7th Edition); 5. Patients with another previous or current malignant disease which is likely to interfere with treatment or the assessment of response in the judgement of the local surgical investigator. 6. Any patient with a significant medical condition which is thought unlikely to tolerate the therapies. Such as cardiac disease (e.g. symptomatic coronary artery disease or myocardial infarction within last 12 months), clinicallysignificant lung disease, clinicallysignificant bone marrow, liver, renal function disorder; 7. Pregnant or lactating women and fertile women who will not be using contraception during the trial; 8. Allergy to any drugs; 9. Participation in another intervention clinical trial with interference to the chemotherapeutic or chemoradiotherapeutic intervention during this study or during the last 30 days prior to informed consent; 10. Expected lack of compliance with the protocol.</criteria>
