	<brief_summary>In the modern concept of Renin-angiotensin System, Angiotensin-(1-7) plays a key role and demonstrates promising therapeutic potential due to it is generally opposite effects to Angiotensin II. The aim is to evaluate the effect of Ang-(1-7) acute administration on systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP) and heart rate (HR) in healthy and hypertensive subjects.</brief_summary>
