	<brief_summary>The proposed study seeks to compare visual acuity, tomographic outcomes, biomechanical changes and inflammatory profile of normal eyes (matched for age, refraction and corneal thickness) undergoing iDesign and SMILE procedure. The hypothesis is that iDesign may deliver equivalent or better clinical outcomes than SMILE, by removing less tissue and correcting for higher order aberrations.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Next Generation Laser Techniques of Myopia Correction: iDesign vs. SMILE</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>iDesign is a promising new technique to treat myopia with astigmatism using ocular aberrations measured with a high resolution wavefront sensor.[1,2] Early studies with iDesign platform has established its safety and efficacy in correction of myopia with fewer patients reporting night vision problems.[1,2] In keratoconus, iDesign has also provided excellent outcomes following collagen crosslinking.3 SMILE is a recent technique that eliminates creation of flap and appears to achieve similar refractive outcomes as conventional LASIK but with less dryness, less inflammation and faster wound healing.[4,5] SMILE corrects lower order aberrations only.[4,5] Thus, a comparative assessment of iDesign and SMILE is necessary since iDesign can potentially give better visual outcomes with lower volume of tissue removal. If lower volume of tissue is removed, it is also hypothesized that the corneal would be more stable biomechanically.[5] Further, SMILE does not provide any correction of higher order aberrations. With the inclusion of higher order aberrations in the iDesign treatment plan, it is hypothesized that both short and long term outcomes will be better with iDesign than with SMILE.</detailed_description>
