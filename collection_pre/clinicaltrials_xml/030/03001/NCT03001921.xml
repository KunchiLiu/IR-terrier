	<brief_summary>The investigators are registering all HD patients at recruited hospitals and developing a HD database in China. Patients will be follow-up every 3 months, and both baseline and follow-up information will be entered into the registration system. The patient survival, technical survival, patency rate of access, quality of life and residual renal function for HD patients will be compared using the HD database.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigators are registering all end stage renal disease (ESRD) patients receiving hemodialysis (HD) treatment, and developing a HD database in China. Patients' demographic characteristics (including age, gender, height, weight, BMI, smoking, drinking, and education), clinical characteristics (including systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, primary cause of ESRD, and lab measurements of serum, urine, and access patency), complications, drug information and scores of quality of life at the baseline will be collected. Patients will be follow-up every 3 month, the demographic and clinical characteristics, complications and drug information of patients will be collected at each visit. The investigators also record the outcome at each visit, such as mortality (including all-cause mortality and cardiovascular disease mortality), technical survival, kidney transplantation, transfer to peritoneal dialysis, hospitalization, access failureï¼Œetc. The patient survival, technical survival, patency rate of access, quality of life and residual renal function for HD patients will be compared using the HD database.</detailed_description>
