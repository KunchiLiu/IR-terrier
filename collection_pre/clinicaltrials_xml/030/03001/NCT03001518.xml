	<brief_summary>The goal of this pilot study is to evaluate and describe the immunologic and overall outcomes of subjects who undergo routine pancreatectomy with or without irreversible electroporation (IRE) for pancreatic cancer. Immunologic markers in the blood will be measured at several time points before and after surgery to determine if surgical approach is associated with different immunologic responses. Secondary outcomes will include mortality and morbidity; operative time; blood loss and transfusion requirements; and oncologic outcomes such as: margin status, lymph node harvest, disease-free survival, and overall survival. Analysis of immune response will help the investigator determine whether to expand the pilot into a larger study.</brief_summary>
