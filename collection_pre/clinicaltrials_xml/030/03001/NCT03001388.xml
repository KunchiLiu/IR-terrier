	<brief_summary>To determine if transient elastography (TE), when combined with ultrasound (US) pattern characterization can improve the prediction of progression to a nodular pattern on US. To confirm the feasibility of obtaining TE measurements in children with Cystic Fibrosis (CF) To prospectively assess whether TE data are associated with conventional laboratory markers of hepatic fibrosis To determine the variability of TE measurements taken at different sites in the same patient</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Longitudinal Assessment of Transient Elastography in Cystic Fibrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A noninvasive assessment of hepatic fibrosis is desperately needed to advance the care of children with CF significant liver disease and to provide for measurements during clinical trials. That global assessment might serve as both a predictor/descriptor of disease course but also as a critical biomarker for clinical research. FibroScanÂ® measurement of liver stiffness has great potential to fill this void. The underlying hypothesis of this proposal is that elastography in addition to US can improved the prediction of the development of a nodular liver on US and development of portal hypertension over time in children and young adults with CF.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants enrolled in CFLD NET PUSH study in longitudinal follow up at centers with Fibroscan available (currently 8/11 centers) Entry criteria for that study were: CF as determined by sweat chloride &gt;60 meq/l Pancreatic insufficiency Age 312 years old at entry For entry into the longitudinal follow up subjects were in one of two groups A screening US pattern of nodular liver (CIR), heterogeneous increased echogenicity (HTG) or homogeneous increased echogenicity (HMG) A screening US pattern of normal (NL) matched to a HTG subject (2 NL:1HTG) by age, center and pseudomonas status Exited from the PUSH Study Unable / unwilling to sign consent</criteria>
