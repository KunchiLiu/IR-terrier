	<brief_summary>The aim of the RCT is to analyse clinical and histopathological particularities for excisional biopsies of fibrous hyperplasia in the buccal mucosa performed with Er:YAG laser, CO2 laser and scalpel. The primary outcome parameter is to evaluate the thermal damage zone on the excised specimens. Secondary parameters are time of surgery, intraoperative bleeding, the need for additional electrocoagulation or sutures and patient's postsurgical perception of pain, other postsurgical effects and use of analgesics.</brief_summary>
