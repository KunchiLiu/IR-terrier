	<brief_summary>This application proposes to extend an ongoing NHLBI clinical trial (NCT02342808) examining the efficacy of a lifestyle intervention combining the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet with caloric restriction and aerobic exercise to lower and control BP in individuals with RH. In the parent trial, participants with RH will be randomized to either: (1) a 4-month adjunctive lifestyle intervention designed to lower BP through exercise and diet (C-LIFE), or; (2) a standardized education and physician advice (SEPA) control condition. The current protocol will collect additional assessments of neurocognition (executive function, processing speed, and memory), endothelial function (brachial artery flow-mediated dilation), and cerebrovascular reserve (a measure of prefrontal cortex tissue oxygenation) in 120 participants at baseline, following completion of the 4-month intervention, and again after one year, in order to examine neurocognitive improvements and their potential mediators.</brief_summary>

In the absence of a specific RH diagnosis, individuals being treated for two or more weeks with at least 3 antihypertensive medications of different classes, including a diuretic, with clinic SBP ≥ 140 mm Hg or DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg, will be eligible. Individuals being treated with 4 or more antihypertensive medications (including a diuretic) with SBP ≥ 130 or DBP ≥ 85 mm Hg will also be eligible.
