	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to collect information about what happens when people pause, or temporarily stop taking, ART, and to collect blood samples from these people at frequent intervals. We will also study the safety of pausing ART under close observation.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Step 1 HIV1 infection, documented by any licensed rapid HIV test or HIV enzyme or chemiluminescence immunoassay (E/CIA) test kit at any time prior to study entry and confirmed by a licensed Western blot or a second antibody test by a method other than the initial rapid HIV and/or E/CIA, or by HIV1 antigen, plasma HIV1 RNA viral load. NOTE: The term "licensed" refers to a US FDAapproved kit, which is required for all IND studies, or for sites located in countries other than the United States, a kit that has been certified or licensed by an oversight body within that country and validated internally. For Cohort A participants, ART initiated during chronic infection (e.g., more than 6 months after estimated date of infection, or as determined by site investigator and/or available medical records). For Cohort B, diagnosis of acute HIV infection (AHI) (as defined by the criteria listed below) and initiation of ART within 45 days after AHI diagnosis (defined as earliest date of positive HIV1 RNA or antigen/antibody assay). 1. Documented diagnosis during Fiebig Stages IIIV. OR 2. Enzyme or chemiluminescence immunoassays (E/CIA) IgM positive, HIV1 RNA or p24 antigenpositive, and negative or indeterminate Western blot. OR 3. Diagnosis during Fiebig stages III, but ART initiated &gt;10 days after AHI diagnosis. Diagnosis of Fiebig stage III infection involves the following criteria: E/CIA negative, HIV1 RNA or p24 antigenpositive, and negative or indeterminate Western blot. NOTE: Candidates who were diagnosed with AHI based on this criterion ("c" above) must have had a positive HIV1 RNA test or subsequently have had a positive Western blot. Receiving continuous ART for at least 2 years and on any NNRTI, PI, or INSTIcontaining regimen. NOTE A: ART interruptions of up to 7 days and at least 90 days prior to entry are acceptable. NOTE B: Within and betweenclass changes in ART within the previous 2 years are acceptable. For candidates whose ART includes an NNRTI, willingness and ability to change to a PI or INSTIcontaining regimen for at least 4 weeks prior to ART interruption and the local availability of such a regimen. Nadir CD4+ cell count ≥200 cells/mm3. NOTE: Candidate recall or documentation is acceptable. CD4+ cell count ≥500 cells/mm3 obtained within 60 days prior to study entry in a US laboratory that has is compliant with Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) or its equivalent or in any network approved nonUS laboratory that operates in accordance with Good Clinical Laboratory Practices (GCLP) and participates in appropriate external quality assurance (EQA) programs. One documented plasma HIV1 RNA that is below the limit of detection of the FDAapproved assays (limit of detection: 75, 50, 40, or 20 copies/mL) between 12 and 24 months prior to the screening HIV1 RNA and one documented HIV1 RNA that is below the limit of detection of the FDAapproved assays (limit of detection: 75, 50, 40, or 20 copies/mL) collected fewer than 12 months prior to the screening HIV1 RNA. Plasma HIV1 RNA level of &lt;20 copies/mL obtained by the Roche TaqMan v2.0 assay or &lt;40 copies/mL obtained by the Abbott assay, within 60 days prior to entry. The following laboratory values obtained within 60 days prior to entry by any US laboratory that is compliant with CLIA or its equivalent or in any network approved nonUS laboratory that operates in accordance with GCLP and participates in appropriate EQA programs. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥750 cells/mm3 Hemoglobin ≥11.0 g/dL for men and ≥10.0 g/dL for women Platelet count ≥100,000/mm3 Creatinine ≤1.5 mg/dL Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (SGOT) ≤1.5x upper limit of normal (ULN) Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (SGPT) ≤1.5x ULN HCV antibody negative result obtained within 60 days prior to study entry or, if the HCV antibody result is positive, a negative HCV RNA result within 60 days prior to study entry and no positive HCV RNA result within 24 weeks prior to entry. Ability and willingness of participant to provide informed consent. Willingness to have blood samples collected and stored indefinitely and used for HIVrelated research purposes. For females of reproductive potential (women who have not been postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months, i.e., who have had menses within the preceding 24 months, or women who have not undergone surgical sterilization, specifically hysterectomy, or bilateral oophorectomy and/or bilateral salpingectomy), a negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 48 hours prior to study entry. NOTE: Acceptable documentation of hysterectomy and bilateral oophorectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, tubal microinserts, partner who has undergone vasectomy, and menopause is participantreported history. All participants must agree to use barrier protection (e.g., condoms, dental dams) for all sexual activity throughout the entire course of the study to prevent HIV transmission. All participants must agree not to participate in the conception process (e.g., active attempt to become pregnant or to impregnate, sperm donation, or in vitro fertilization). If participating in sexual activity that could lead to pregnancy, the participant/partner must use at least two reliable forms of contraceptives (e.g., condoms, with or without a spermicidal agent; a diaphragm or cervical cap with spermicide; an IUD; hormonebased contraception), with at least one being a barrier method, during the study. Site investigator anticipates that a fully active alternative ART regimen could be constructed and would be available in the event of virologic failure on the participant's current ART regimen. Absence of either active hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, indicated by a negative hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or HBV viral load assays within 60 days prior to entry or known chronic hepatitis B infection based on a previously positive HBV DNA or positive HBsAg without a subsequent positive hepatitis B surface antibody (HBsAb). Step 1 Any plasma HIV1 RNA at or above the limit of detection of the FDAapproved assays (limit of detection: 75, 50, 40, or 20 copies/mL) within 24 months prior to entry. NOTE: A single unconfirmed "blip" (i.e., plasma HIV1 RNA over limit of detection but &lt;200 copies/mL) is allowed if preceded and followed by values below the limit of detection and if the blip occurred more than 6 months prior to study entry. Currently breastfeeding or plans on breastfeeding during the course of the study or is pregnant. Active drug or alcohol use or dependence that, in the opinion of the site investigator, would interfere with adherence to study requirements. Acute or serious illness, in the opinion of the site investigator, requiring systemic treatment and/or hospitalization within 60 days prior to entry. Any history of an AIDSdefining illness using the current list on the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)'s website. Receipt of any studydefined prohibited medications within 6 months prior to entry. Prior history of difficulty establishing venous access or current contraindication for leukapheresis, in the opinion of the site investigator and based on assessments. Receipt of any vaccination within 1 week prior to entry. NOTE: The entry visit must be scheduled to ensure that 1 week has elapsed after any vaccination.</criteria>
