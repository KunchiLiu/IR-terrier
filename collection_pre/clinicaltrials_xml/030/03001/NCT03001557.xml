	<brief_summary>This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study of lemborexant (4 dose levels) or placebo taken daily for 4 weeks in approximately 125 male or female participants, ages 65 to 90 years, with mild or moderate Alzheimer's disease dementia (AD-D) who complain of disrupted sleep or multiple awakenings at night along with frequent periods of falling asleep during the day that impact the quality of life of the participant. The study is designed to determine whether at least one dose of lemborexant is superior to placebo based on change from baseline in actigraphy Sleep Efficiency and actigraphy Wake Efficiency during the last week of 4 weeks of treatment in participants with Irregular Sleep-Wake Rhythm Disorder and AD-D.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria for Participants: Male or female, age 65 to 90 years at the time of informed consent Able to provide informed consent. If a participant lacks capacity to consent in the investigator's opinion, the participant's assent should be obtained, if required in accordance with local laws, regulations and customs, and the written informed consent of a legal representative should be obtained (capacity to consent and definition of legal representative should be determined in accordance with applicable local laws and regulations). Documentation of diagnosis with Alzheimer's disease dementia (ADD) on the basis of the National Institute on Aging/Alzheimer's Association Diagnostic Guidelines Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) 18 to 26 at Screening Meets criteria for Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, Irregular SleepWake Type (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5th edition [DSM5]) and the 10th revision of the International Classification of Diseases, as follows: Complaint by the participant of difficulty sleeping during the night and/or excessive daytime sleepiness associated with multiple irregular sleep bouts during a 24hour period Frequency of complaint of sleep and wake fragmentation &gt;3 days per week Duration of complaint of sleep and wake fragmentation ≥3 months During the Screening Period, mean actigraphy Sleep Efficiency &lt;75% within the defined nocturnal sleep period and mean actigraphy Wake Efficiency &lt;87.5% during the defined wake period Confirmation of sufficient duration of time in bed at night, defined as at least 7 hours as determined by the sleep log Confirmation by actigraphy of a combination of sleep bouts of &gt;10 minutes during the wake period plus wake bouts of &gt;10 minutes during the sleep period, totaling at least 4 bouts per 24hour period, ≥3 days per week Ambulatory and living in the community or in a residence not classified as a skilled nursing facility Willing not to start a behavioral or other treatment program for sleep or wake difficulties and not to start a new treatment for other symptoms of ADD during participation in the study Has a reliable and competent caregiver who can accompany the participant to study visits, administer study medication on a nightly basis and provide information on the status of the participant For participants taking a cholinesterase inhibitor and/or memantine, dosing regimen must have been stable for at least 3 months. Inclusion Criteria for Caregivers: Able to provide informed consent Lives in the same home as the participant with the same approximate schedule as the participant Able to meet caregiver requirements Willing to provide information on himself/herself regarding sleep quality and caregiver burden Exclusion Criteria for Participants: A diagnosis of vascular dementia, dementia following multiple strokes, or any synucleinopathy/Lewy body disorder. This includes Dementia with Lewy Bodies and Parkinson's disease with or without dementia. A current diagnosis of moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), or current use of continuous positive airways pressure even if mild severity of OSA, restless legs syndrome, periodic limb movement disorder (with awakenings), or narcolepsy An ApneaHypopnea Index or equivalent ≥15 events/hour on diagnostic sleep study conducted prior to Baseline or within 6 months of Screening A clinically significant movement disorder that would affect the differentiation of sleep and wake by the actigraphy analytic algorithm Current symptoms or history during the past year of Rapid Eye Movement Behavior Disorder or sleeprelated violent behavior Probable Major Depression, as evidenced by a score &gt;10 on the Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia at Screening Unable to tolerate wearing the actigraph. At a minimum, participants must be able to wear the actigraph for 5 complete days out of 7 days' data. A day will be considered complete as long as data from 90% of the 24hour period are scorable. Excessive caffeine use that in the opinion of the investigator contributes to the participant's Irregular SleepWake Rhythm Disorder (ISWRD) History of drug or alcohol dependency or abuse within approximately the previous 2 years Reports habitually consuming more than 14 drinks containing alcohol per week or habitually consumes alcohol within 3 hours before bedtime and unwilling to limit alcohol intake to 2 or fewer drinks per day or forego having alcohol within 3 hours before bedtime for the duration of his/her participation in the study Known to be human immunodeficiency virus positive Active viral hepatitis (B or C) as demonstrated by positive serology at Screening A prolonged QTcF interval (QTcF &gt;450 milliseconds [ms]) as demonstrated by a repeated electrocardiogram (ECG) at Screening (repeated only if initial ECG indicates a QTcF interval &gt;450 ms) or evidence of bundle branch block Current evidence of clinically significant disease that in the opinion of the investigator(s) could affect the participant's safety or interfere with the study assessments Any history of a medical or psychiatric condition other than ADD that in the opinion of the investigator(s) could affect the participant's safety or interfere with the study assessments History of malignancy within the previous 5 years except for adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer or cervical carcinoma in situ Any suicidal ideation with intent with or without a plan, at the time of or within 6 months of Screening, as indicated by answering "Yes" to questions 4 and 5 on the Suicidal Ideation section of the electronic ColumbiaSuicide Severity Rating Scale (eCSSRS) Any lifetime suicidal behavior based on the eCSSRS History of violence toward the caregiver or others Scheduled for surgery during the study Used any prohibited prescription or overthecounter concomitant medications within 1 week or 5 halflives, whichever is longer, before starting actigraphy during Screening Used any modality of treatment for ISWRD between Screening and Randomization, including phototherapy (light therapy) Failed treatment with Belsomra® (efficacy and/or safety) following treatment with an appropriate dose and of adequate duration in the opinion of the investigator Transmeridian travel across more than 3 time zones between Screening and Randomization, or plans to travel across more than 3 time zones during the study Hypersensitivity to lemborexant or to its excipients Currently enrolled in another clinical trial Used any investigational drug or device before informed consent (i.e., within 30 days or 5× the investigational drug halflife whichever is longer or 6 months for potential diseasemodifying drugs) Previously participated in any clinical trial of lemborexant</criteria>
