	<brief_title>Study of Angiogenic Cell Therapy for Progressive Pulmonary Hypertension: Intervention With Repeat Dosing of eNOS-enhanced EPCs</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>SAPPHIRE will use autologous progenitor cell-based gene delivery to enhance lung microvascular repair and regeneration in patients with severe symptomatic PAH. A total of 45 patients will be enrolled in this multi-centre, phase II, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 3-arm protocol. Up to seven centres across Canada will participate. Consented study participants who meet all eligibility criteria during the screening period will be scheduled to undergo apheresis. Following successful apheresis collection and receipt of the cell samples by the cell manufacturing facility, randomization will take place though a web-based system. Manufacturing of the cell therapy product will then be performed by the cell manufacturing facility according to the assigned treatment allocation: Arm 1: Placebo (Plasma-Lyte A; 4 monthly IV infusions) in Course 1 (1st 6 months) followed by Autologous EPCs transfected with human eNOS in Course 2 (2nd 6 months; 4 monthly IV infusions) Arm 2: Autologous EPCs transfected with human eNOS in Course 1 (1st 6 months; 4 monthly IV infusions) followed by Placebo (Plasma-Lyte A) in Course 2 (2nd 6 months; 4 monthly IV infusions) Arm 3: Autologous EPCs transfected with human eNOS in Course 1 (1st 6 months; 4 monthly IV infusions) followed by a repeat dosing with Autologous EPCs transfected with human eNOS in Course 2 (2nd 6 months; 4 monthly IV infusions) Approximately 5-9 days later, the study product will be transported to the investigative site where the initial treatment will be delivered to the study participant in an outpatient setting which is equipped for continuous monitoring of vital signs and oxygen saturation. Participants will subsequently be monitored for a minimum of 1 hour and discharged from the clinic once judged by the study investigator to be clinically stable. Treatment and follow-up assessments will take place over a 12-month period (11 study visits in total). Once the 12-month trial data collection is completed, the trial will convert to a registry with the goal of collecting long-term safety information through annual telephone contacts for 10 years. Participants will be permitted to enroll in other clinical trials during the registry period.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age ≥ 18 years, ≤ 80 years Established diagnosis of pulmonary arterial hypertension due to the following: Idiopathic or hereditable PAH; Scleroderma associated PAH (limited or diffuse); Drugs (anorexigens) or toxins; Congenital heart defects (atrial septal defects, ventricular septal defects, and patent ductus arteriosus) repaired ≥ 1 years WHO functional class II, III, or IV on appropriate stable therapy for PAH for at least 3 months prior to the screening period and up until randomization, apart from modification of anticoagulant or diuretic dosages. Able to walk unassisted (oxygen use allowed). An average 6Minute Walk Distance (6MWD) of ≥ 125 meters and ≤ 400 meters on two consecutive tests during the Screening period. Previous diagnostic right heart cardiac catheterization (RHC) within the last five years with findings consistent with PAH: specifically, mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) ≥ 25 mmHg (at rest); pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) (or left ventricular end diastolic pressure) ≤15 mmHg, and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) &gt;5 WU. Echocardiography performed within 6 months prior to the Screening Period confirming a left atrial volume index (LAVI) of ≤ 34 ml/m2 and the absence of any clinically significant left heart disease including evidence of more than mild leftsided valvular heart disease, systolic or diastolic left ventricular dysfunction Ventilation and perfusion (VQ) nuclear scan performed within the last five years showing absence (i.e. low probability) of pulmonary embolism. Pulmonary function tests conducted within 12 months prior to the Screening Period to confirm: total lung capacity (TLC) ≥ 70% the predicted value; and forced expiratory volume at one second (FEV1) of ≥ 70% the predicted value. Must have a resting arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) ≥88% with or without supplemental oxygen as measured by pulse oximetry at the Screening Visit Must not be enrolled in an exercise training program for pulmonary rehabilitation within 3 months prior to the Screening Visit and must agree not to enroll in an exercise training program for pulmonary rehabilitation during the Screening Period and the first 6 months of the study. Participants enrolled in an exercise program for pulmonary rehabilitation 3 months prior to screening may enter the study if they agree to maintain their current level of rehabilitation for the first 6 months of the study. Women of childbearing potential (defined as less than 1 year postmenopausal and not surgically sterile) must be practicing abstinence or using two highly effective methods of contraception (defined as a method of birth control that result in a low failure rate, i.e., less than 1% per year, such as approved hormonal contraceptives, barrier methods [such as a condom or diaphragm] used with a spermicide, or an intrauterine device). Subjects must have a negative ßhCG pregnancy test during the Screening period and negative urine pregnancy test results at all other study visits. Willing and able to comply with study requirements and restrictions Pregnant or lactating. PAH related to any condition not covered under inclusion criteria, including but not limited to pulmonary venous hypertension, pulmonary venoocclusive disease, pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis, or chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. Evidence of more than mild interstitial lung disease on Chest CT within the last 5 years (last 3 years for patients with scleroderma associated PAH). Treatment with an investigational drug, device or therapy within 3 months prior to the screening period or is scheduled to receive an investigational drug, device or therapy during the course of the study. Any musculoskeletal disease or any other disease that would significantly limit ambulation. Unrepaired or recently repaired (&lt; 1 year) congenital systemictopulmonary shunt other than patent foramen ovale. Historical evidence of significant coronary arterial disease (CAD) by ANY ONE of the following: History of MI History of PCI Angiographic evidence of CAD (&gt;50% stenosis in ≥1 vessel) Positive Stress Test Previous CABG Stable angina If no significant CAD, participants with ALL THREE of the remaining AMBITION study HFpEF risk factors will be excluded: BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2, AND History of essential hypertension, AND Diabetes mellitus (any type) Creatinine clearance &lt;30 ml/min (using the CockroftGault formula) or requires hemodialysis. Inability to undergo the apheresis procedure due to poor venous access or laboratory tests that are not within acceptable ranges (not including INR for patients on Coumadin). ChildsPugh class C liver cirrhosis Previous atrial septostomy. Any other clinically significant illness or abnormal laboratory values (measured during the screening period) that, in the opinion of the Investigator, might put the subject at risk of harm during the study or might adversely affect the interpretation of the study data. Anticipated survival less than 1 year due to concomitant disease. History of cancer in the past 5 years (except for low grade and fully resolved nonmelanoma skin cancer) A history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or hepatitis B or C infection Systemic arterial systolic blood pressure &lt; 85 mm Hg Known allergy to gentamicin or amphotericin Patients who have participated in any gene therapy study or an angiogenic growth factor protein study Patients unable to provide informed consent and comply with the visit schedule</criteria>
