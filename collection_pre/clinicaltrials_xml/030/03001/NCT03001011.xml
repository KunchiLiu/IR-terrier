	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: To demonstrate efficacy of Renvela tablets in the reduction of serum phosphorus in hyperphosphatemia in patients with chronic kidney disease not on dialysis. Secondary Objectives: To document the efficacy of Renvela tablets in the reduction of serum lipids (total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C]) To document the efficacy of Renvela tablets in the reduction of calcium-phosphorus product. To document the efficacy of Renvela tablets in the reduction of intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH). To document the efficacy of Renvela tablets in proportion of patients reaching the target serum phosphorus level (4.6 mg/dL [1.47 mmol/L], inclusive). To evaluate safety of Renvela tablets.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: Patients with chronic kidney disease who have not been on dialysis, and are not expected to begin dialysis, or renal transplantation in the next 4 months from the screening visit. Have serum phosphorus measurement ≥5.5 mg/dL (1.78 mmol/L) at Screening Visit (if patients are not on phosphate binder[s] at Screening Visit) OR at the end of Washout Period (if patients are on phosphate binder[s] at Screening Visit). Have the following laboratory measurements at Screening Visit: 25hydroxy vitamin D ≥10 ng/mL. iPTH ≤800 pg/mL. Willing and able to sign written informed consent. Exclusion criteria: Men or women below 18 years of age. Is not of the level of understanding and willingness to cooperate with all visits and procedures, as described in the study protocol. Not yet received chronic kidney disease diet education before screening visit. Not willing and not able to avoid changes to diet during the study. Not willing or able to maintain screening doses of lipid lowering medication, 1, 25 dihydroxy vitamin D, and/or cinacalcet for the duration of the study, except for safety reasons. Not willing or not able to avoid antacids and phosphate binders containing aluminium, magnesium, calcium, or lanthanum for the duration of the study unless prescribed as an evening calcium supplement. Have participated in any other investigational drug studies within 30 days, or 5 half lives, whichever is longer, prior to screening visit. Have known hypersensitivity to sevelamer or any constituents of Renvela tablets. Have bowel obstruction, active dysphagia or swallowing disorder, or a predisposition to or current bowel obstruction, ileus, or severe gastrointestinal motility disorders including severe constipation.
