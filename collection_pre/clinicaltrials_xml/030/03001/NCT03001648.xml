	<brief_summary>This is a single centre retrospective study in repeated implantation failure patients: &lt; 39 years old, at least 4 D3 good quality embryos or 2 good quality blastocysts transferred without implantation, absence of known causes of implantation failures (uterine malformation, thrombophilia, severe male factor, uncontrolled thyroid disfunction, autoimmune disease). Patients scheduled for PGS underwent one or more stimulation cycles (oocyte or blastocyst banking) in order to maximize chances of embryo transfer. PGS cycles are analyzed globally. Aditionally, PGS cycles with a single stimulation cycle are analyzed in comparison to standard IVF cycles.</brief_summary>
