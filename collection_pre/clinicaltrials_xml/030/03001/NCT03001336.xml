	<detailed_description>Aims: We investigated the potential association between thyroid parameters and microalbuminuria in the euthyroid elderly subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Subjects: Elderly inhospital patients with T2DM who visited in the Department of Endocrinology at the Nanjing First Hospital from January 2011 to December 2012. Methods: Clinical factors, serum levels of glucose, lipids, free triiodothyronine (FT3), free thyroxine (FT4), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), thyroid autoantibodies,24h urine albuminuria and fluorescence fundus angiography are conducted. The relationships levels of thyroid function and diabetic complications are analysed.</detailed_description>
