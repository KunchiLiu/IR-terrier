	<brief_summary>Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is one of established treatments in the end stage renal disease patients. Volume overload is a predictor of mortality in PD patients. In this Randomized controlled trial, the investigators use the Body Composition Monitor (BCM), a multifrequency bioimpedance device, to measure the level of overhydration in PD patients and explore its value in fluid management in peritoneal dialysis patients as well as their prognosis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bioimpedance-guided Fluid Management in Chronic Peritoneal Dialysis Patients.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Optimal fluid management is one of the primary objectives of dialysis treatment, and there is significant concern that peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients can become progressively fluid-loaded with time on treatment, especially as residual kidney function declines. Body Composition Monitor (BCM) has the potential to enable better management of fluid balance. The investigators undertake a prospective, randomized, open-label, controlled trial to determine whether availability of longitudinal BCM measures help clinicians maintain stable fluid status over 24 months in 300 peritoneal dialysis patients.</detailed_description>
