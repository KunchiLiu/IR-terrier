	<detailed_description>The intervention is based on a method developed to facilitate closeness and human touch between parents and preterm infants in neonatal intensive care. Continuous skin-to-skin contact (SSC) means, in this study, that the late preterm infant is cared for skin-to-skin on the parents' chest, instead of in a heating-bed, 24 hours a day. The parents will take turns to care for the infant in SSC.</detailed_description>
