	<brief_title>Clinical Transcriptomics in Systemic Vasculitis (CUTIS)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study employs a multi-center approach to evaluate cutaneous vasculitis across several forms of idiopathic vasculitis. Patients with cutaneous manifestations of vasculitis will be evaluated by teams of primary vasculitis care providers and Dermatologists in order to facilitate optimal selection of patients and sampling of lesions. A punch skin biopsy at a site of active vasculitis will be the source of material for histopathologic and transcriptomic evaluation. The histopathology of cutaneous vasculitis will be characterized using a standardized approach.</detailed_description>
