	<brief_summary>The main purpose of this study is to integrate novel MRI techniques with positron emission tomography(PET) for the study of structural and molecular neuroplasticity in the brain of migraineurs, and its clinical association with changes in pain perception and modulation (e.g. allodynia). We will attempt to acquire images of the brain that may, in the future, assist doctors in better understanding how pain is felt and regulated in migraine sufferers.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>To investigate interictal opioid receptor (MOR) binding potential (BPND) changes in migraineurs as compared to age/gender-matched healthy controls. To demonstrate that frequency of the headache attacks and severity of cutaneous allodynia levels in migraineurs experienced over multiple attacks are correlated with levels of MOR BPND in specific brain regions. To investigate whether dysfunction of the pain regulatory endogenous opioid system of migraineurs is correlated with changes in the gray matter thickness in cortical areas associated with pain perception and modulation.</detailed_description>
