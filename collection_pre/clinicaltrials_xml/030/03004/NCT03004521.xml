	<brief_summary>LQD is a multicentre randomised clinical trial comparing the clinical and cost effectiveness of lithium versus quetiapine when used as add-on therapies to antidepressant medication for patients with treatment resistant depression. The Lithium versus Quetiapine in Depression (LQD) study will assess patients over 12 months to establish which (if any) treatment is more likely to improve TRD over a long duration of time. Professor Anthony Cleare is the Chief Investigator and recruitment is due to start in November 2016. Recruitment will begin in London, followed by additional sites in Newcastle and Oxford in early 2017.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lithium Versus Quetiapine in Treatment Resistant Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This 12 month parallel group, multi-centre, patient randomised, pragmatic, open label trial is comparing the clinical and cost-effectiveness of the decision to prescribe lithium versus quetiapine add-on treatment to antidepressant medication. There will be two parallel groups: 1) Quetiapine add-on to existing antidepressant medication; 2) Lithium add-on to existing antidepressant medication. 276 patients will be randomised 1:1 at baseline to the decision to prescribe either lithium or quetiapine, and treatment will then be undertaken by clinicians on a real world basis. The acute phase of treatment (8 weeks post-randomisation) will be conducted by trial clinicians with a decision as to then continue treatment as per standard care thereafter. All patients, regardless of their treatment status, will be followed up in the trial for one year. This is a superiority design whereby we hypothesise that quetiapine will be superior to lithium in terms of time to treatment discontinuation and average symptom burden (QID-SR) over 12 months.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Under the care of a GP and/or adult mental health services 2. Current episode of depression meeting DSM5 criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD) single or recurrent episode 3.17item HAMD score ≥ 14 this cutoff reflects a pragmatic minimum severity of depression as also chosen in comparable studies such as STAR*D (Rush et al 2006, Trivedi et al 2006) 4.Any gender and aged 18 years or over 5.Meet criteria for treatment resistant depression (Fekadu et al., 2009a; Cleare et al., 2015): current episode has not responded to at least two antidepressants given for at least 6 weeks at minimum therapeutic dose defined as fluoxetine ≥20mg/day, paroxetine ≥20mg/day, sertraline ≥50mg/day, citalopram ≥20mg/day, escitalopram ≥10mg/day, venlafaxine ≥75mg/day, duloxetine ≥60 mg/day, mirtazapine ≥30mg/day, tricyclic antidepressant ≥125mg/day, and dosage as guided by the national Maudsley Prescribing Guidelines or BNF for any other antidepressant. Please note, relapse whilst on an antidepressant also counts as a failed treatment trial 6.Current antidepressant treatment has remained unchanged for ≥6 weeks 7.Provision of written, informed consent. 1. Diagnosis of bipolar disorder (defined as meeting DSM5 criteria for bipolar 1 or bipolar 2) on the MINI 7.0 (as recommended treatments are different for bipolar depression) 2. Diagnosis of current psychosis (as recommended treatments are different for current psychosis antidepressants plus antipsychotics is the firstline treatment recommendation (NiCE, 2009; Cleare et al., 2015) 3. Use of lithium or quetiapine during current episode 4. Ongoing use of another atypical antipsychotic (discontinuation will be required before study entry i.e. any time prior to randomisation) 5. Known contraindication to use of either lithium or quetiapine: known hypersensitivity of lithium or quetiapine or any of their excipients; severe renal insufficiency / impairment; untreated hypothyroidism; severe cardiac disease / insufficiency; low sodium levels e.g. dehydrated patients or those on low sodium diets; Addison's disease; Brugada syndrome or family history of Brugada syndrome; the rare hereditary inborn errors of metabolism galactosaemia, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucosegalactose malabsorption; concomitant administration of cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors; or previously diagnosed QT prolongation. 6. We will not recruit any individual who is currently participating in a clinical trial of an investigational medical product (CTIMP). 7. Insufficient degree of comprehension or attention to be able to engage in trial procedures. 8. We will exclude women who are pregnant, actively trying for pregnancy, or currently breastfeeding. This will be based on verbal report of the subject. Otherwise the management will be as appropriate according to standard clinical practice within the context of a pragmatic, open trial, for example adequate contraceptive precautions decided on the clinical judgement of the prescriber.</criteria>
