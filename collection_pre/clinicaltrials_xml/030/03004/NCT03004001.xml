	<brief_summary>The study purpose is to determine the hypolipidemic effect of Alirocumab co-administered with atorvastatin on levels of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and LDL compared to monotherapy with atorvastatin in patients with dyslipidemia secondary to nephrotic syndrome.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of PCSK9-Antibody (Alirocumab) on Dyslipidemia Secondary to Nephrotic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The trial is randomized (1:1 alirocumab to placebo), double-blinded, placebo-controlled with a cross-over design. The trial will last 10 months and includes a 10 week washout period between study phases.Twenty adult subjects with dyslipidemia secondary to nephrotic syndrome and treated with atorvastatin will be recruited. Alirocumab or placebo will be co-administered biweekly. Safety, efficacy chemistries, vital signs, anthropometry and monitoring for adverse events also will done at each visit.</detailed_description>
