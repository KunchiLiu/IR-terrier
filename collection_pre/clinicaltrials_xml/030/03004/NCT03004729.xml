	<brief_summary>The Cow's Milk-related Symptom Score (CoMiSS) tool has been developed to define a score to recognize cow's milk related symptoms in infants and young children. Many infants and toddlers with symptoms that can be related to intake of cow's milk and cow's milk protein allergy (CMPA) are often not diagnosed due to the lack of specific markers. The goal of this trial is to validate the CoMiSS tool in infants suspected of CMPA and investigate if the CoMiSS tool could be an alternative to the open challenge test needed to confirm the diagnosis of Cow Milk Protein Allergy.</brief_summary>
