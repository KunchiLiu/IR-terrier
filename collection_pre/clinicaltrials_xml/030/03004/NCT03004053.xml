	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to obtain images (pictures) of normal oral tissue, which occur inside the mouth, using a special camera. These pictures will be used in our research to evaluate a new technology that uses a laser and takes pictures of the microscopic structure of tissue. The technology is called "reflectance confocal microscopy."</brief_summary>
