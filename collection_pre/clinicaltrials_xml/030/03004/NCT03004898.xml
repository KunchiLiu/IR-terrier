	<brief_summary>CKD is a global endemic disease with increased comorbidities and mortality. The prevalence and the incidence of the end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are extremely high in Taiwan. The prevalence of CKD remains high; however, the awareness remains low. Screening of unique risk factor and early diagnosis of CKD can improve outcome. Furthermore, data of renal education deep into the community remains limited. The aims of this study are: 1. Explore risk factors associated with CKD in the community 2. Establish multidisciplinary care model in the community 3. Investigate mechanistic mediators for CKD and multidisciplinary education approached in behavioral , physiological, immune and metabolomics aspects 4. Provide bio-specimen repository for future study</brief_summary>
