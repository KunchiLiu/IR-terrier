	<brief_summary>This study will be the first to evaluate whether the short- and long-term use of activity tracking devices improve short- and long-term weight loss in adolescents. The investigators will be the first to establish whether weight loss translates into a change in obesity-related biomarkers associated with adolescent obesity. In addition, the investigators will be the first to report outcomes after the implementation of activity tracking devices in conjunction with an intense adolescent weight loss program.</brief_summary>
