	<brief_summary>Orthodontic appliance causes increase in plaque accumulation, especially around brackets, wires and attachments. Advances in orthodontics in recent time have led to improved quality of appliance and treatment procedures ultimately resulting in improvised standard of patient care. These bacteria metabolize different kind of carbohydrates accumulated around orthodontic appliances and create acidic environment in the oral cavity leading to enamel demineralization around the brackets and white spot lesions. This study was carried out to evaluate and compare the efficacy of probiotic toothpaste and chlorhexidine mouthwash in patients undergoing orthodontic treatment with individuals who are not using them.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Efficacy Of Probiotic Toothpaste and Chlorhexidine Mouthwash To Reduce S.Mutans</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION - When the basic oral hygiene is poor, orthodontic appliances create areas where plaque gets accumulated, especially around brackets, bands, wires, and other attachments; this facilitates the development of white spot lesions. Probiotics act by competitively inhibiting the pathogenic bacteria because they have greater adhesion to the tissues while Chlorhexidine is often used as an active ingredient in mouthwash designed to reduce dental plaque around orthodontic appliances. AIM &amp; OBJECTIVE - The objectives of the study is to evaluate and compare the effects of the topical application of probiotic toothpaste and chlorhexidine mouthwash on the Streptococcus Mutans levels in the plaque of orthodontic patients hence improving the oral micro-flora of oral cavity by competitive inhibition of Streptococcus Mutans in plaque present around brackets. MATERIAL &amp; METHOD - The study consists of thirty randomly selected orthodontic patients undergoing fixed appliance treatment. The patients were divided into three groups - Control Group (Group 1), Probiotic Toothpaste Group (Group 2) &amp; Chlorhexidine Mouthwash Group (Group 3). Samples were collected at two times interval: before the study began (Phase 1) and after thirty days (Phase 2).</detailed_description>
