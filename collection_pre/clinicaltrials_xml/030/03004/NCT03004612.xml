	<brief_summary>Type 2 diabetes is a worldwide epidemic disease, and preventive strategies are needed to face this health problem. The goal of this clinical trial is to evaluate the effect of linagliptin + metformin vs metformin alone on physiopathological parameters, such as glucose metabolism, insulin resistance, insulin secretion and pancreatic beta cell function in patients with impaired fasting glucose plus impaired glucose tolerance, during 12 months.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Linagliptin + Metformin vs Metformin Alone in Patients With Prediabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The main goal of this clinical trial is to compare the effect of two different treatments during 12 months: 1. Lifestyle modification program + metformin 850mg twice daily 2. Lifestyle modification program + linagliptin (2.5mg) and metformin (850mg) twice daily on the following parameters, after 12 months of treatment: 1. Glucose metabolism, evaluated by the oral glucose tolerance 2. Insulin resistance, evaluated by the oral glucose tolerance in 100% of the patients and by hyperglycemic clamp in 10 % of the patients 3. Insulin secretion, evaluated by the oral glucose tolerance in 100% of the patients and by hyperglycemic clamp in 10 % of the patients 4. Pancreatic beta cell function, evaluated by the oral glucose tolerance in 100% of the patients and by hyperglycemic clamp in 10 % of the patients 5. Systemic inflammation and cardiovascular risk factors, evaluated by cytokines interlelukin-6 (IL6), C-reactive protein (PCR), and measurement of the intima media thickness by ultrasound. All the patients will have a basal evaluation with an oral glucose tolerance test, lipid profile, body composition, and IMT measurement by ultrasonography; and 10 % will be invited for the hyperglycemic clamp. After the basal evaluation, if the patients result with IMPAIRED FASTING GLUCOSE + IMPAIRED GLUCOSE TOLERANCE, they will be invited to the intervention phase where they will be randomized to one of the two treatment groups. Patients will have a follow-up visit every month to review the adherence to the lifestyle modification program and to the medication. After 12 months, patients will repeat the same evaluation performed as the basal evaluation.</detailed_description>
