	<brief_summary>This research compared the efficacy of two parenting interventions that vary according to the number and the nature of variables in reducing preschoolers' externalizing behavior (EB). The goal was to identify which parenting intervention format (one-variable versus two-variable) caused higher behavioral adjustment in children.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Stimulation of Parents' Self-efficacy Beliefs and Emotion Coaching Practices (H2M1)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The first format was a one-variable intervention manipulating parental self-efficacy beliefs.
