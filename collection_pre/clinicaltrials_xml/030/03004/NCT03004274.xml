	<brief_summary>The goal of this study is to assess whether running deep wound stiches will be superior to deep interrupted stiches in body contouring surgeries in massive weight loss patients. This is a split-wound study, thereby providing an internal control within each wound. Each side of the wound will be randomized to receive one of the two suturing techniques. Patients and raters will be blinded to the suture technique used in both wound-halfs.</brief_summary>
