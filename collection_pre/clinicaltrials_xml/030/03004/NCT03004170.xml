	<detailed_description>Estimated rates of condomless anal and vaginal intercourse among HIV-positive older adults remain high. Brief motivational interventions delivered face-to-face have demonstrated efficacy at reducing condomless sex in HIV-positive persons. However, these interventions are not contextualized to the unique sexual health needs of HIV-positive older adults. Further, many HIV-positive older adults have difficulty accessing face-to-face services due to transportation, stigma, and other barriers. Telehealth interventions represent one delivery approach that overcomes such barriers.</detailed_description>
