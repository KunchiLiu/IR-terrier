	<brief_title>Precise Local Injection of Anti-cancer Drugs Using Presage's CIVO™ Device in Soft Tissue Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a single arm, pilot study designed to test the feasibility of using the CIVO (Comparative In Vivo Oncology) system in patients with soft tissue sarcoma accessible for percutaneous injection. Patients who are scheduled for surgical biopsy or tumor resection surgery will be injected one to three days prior to surgery using the CIVO device. Minute volumes (up to 8.3 microliters) of saline (negative control) or microdoses of anti-cancer agents will be percutaneously injected in a columnar fashion through each of 8 needles into a single enlarged solid tumor. Following the patient's biopsy surgery or tumor resection surgery, the injected portion and a small uninjected portion will be used to determine the in situ drug response in the tumor. None of the data from this evaluation will be shared with patients or used to make clinical decisions. Study clinicians will have access to the patient's health record for 1 year after the study to monitor patient treatment responses. Such information will be used to help evaluate the correlation between clinical response and tumor response assessed via CIVO.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>18 years of age or over. At least one soft tissue sarcoma tumor that is considered accessible for percutaneous injection by the investigator and that is at least 3 cm in longest dimension. Prior surgical evaluation and plan for surgical biopsy or surgery to remove the tumor being injected. ECOG performance status of 02 (or a Karnofsky performance status of &gt;50%) (Appendix B). Labs required for enrollment (prior to microinjection): Absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1000/mm3 Platelet count &gt; 50,000/mm3 hematocrit &gt; 25% Creatinine &lt;3,0 mg/dl Total bilirubin &lt;4,0 mg/dl Bilirubin &lt;4,0 mg/dl, SGOT ≤ 1.5 times the upper limit of normal PT and PTT ≤ 1.5 times the upper limit of normal Any therapy that is potentially immunosuppressive or has anticancer activity in the 4 weeks prior to device microinjection. Subjects with active fungal, viral, or bacterial infections. Pregnant women. Inability to give informed consent. Current treatment with anticoagulation such as warfarin or lowmolecularweight heparin. Tumors near critical structures such as those located near or in the brain or spine. This judgement will be determined by the treating clinician.</criteria>
