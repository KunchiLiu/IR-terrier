	<brief_summary>Aim 1: To collect data on a Depression Care Transition (DCT) program's association with self-care behaviors as measured by medication adherence and clinic visit attendance, after discharge. Hypothesis 1: Compared with usual care, patients who receive the DCT intervention will have significantly greater medication adherence and clinic visit attendance, at 30, 90, and 365 days after discharge. Aim 2: To collect data on DCT's association with clinical/health outcomes as measured by depression severity, functional status, and overall physical and mental health, after discharge. Hypothesis 2: Compared with usual care, patients who receive the DCT intervention will have significantly larger improvements in depression severity, functional status, and overall physical &amp; mental health at 30, 90, and 365 days after discharge. Aim 3: To collect data on DCT's association with utilization outcomes as measured by readmissions, length of subsequent hospital stays, and cost of care, after discharge. Hypothesis 3: Compared with usual care, patients who receive the DCT intervention will have significantly lower hospital readmissions, shortened length of subsequent hospital stays and lower cost of care, at 30, 90, and 365 days of discharge. Leading the research team are a psychiatrist (Dr. IsHak - PI) and a hospitalist (Dr. Nuckols - Co-I) with an advanced and well-established track record of health services research/scholarship in the fields of depression, outcome measurement, and economic implications of improving the quality and safety of health care.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study will contribute to advancing the science of continuity of care delivery for depressed medical inpatients by collecting data on the impact of a modified evidence-based care transition model on clinical/health and utilization outcomes of depression in medically ill inpatients. The study could generate evidence to support the inpatient application of the USPSTF guidelines for screening adults for depression through staff-assisted depression care systems including follow-up and continuity of care. This study will add to the existing outpatient evidence for identification and treatment of depression in improving outcomes (Simon et al., 2001;O'Connor et al., 2013), the crucial aspect of inpatient evidence for depression identification, treatment, and continuity of care/care transitions in improving clinical/health and utilization outcomes.</detailed_description>
