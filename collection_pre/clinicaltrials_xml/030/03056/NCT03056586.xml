	<brief_summary>Genital prolapse is a common complain. 30-40% of women will complain of uterine prolapse or cystocele or rectocele, or mixed. About half of them will require surgical repair for the prolapse, with or without hysterectomy. Of these patients about 30-40% will have recurrence of the prolapse, which in some cases requires second operation. In this study the investigators want to investigate whether a vaginal pessary inserting in the end of the primary surgery, for 4 weeks, will reduce the recurrence rate.</brief_summary>
