	<brief_summary>This study will explore the impact of an exercise and nutrition (EX+NUTR) , relative to exercise alone (EX) intervention, on brain structure and function as well as blood biomarkers in older adults with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) and vascular risk factors. The overall hypotheses are that a combined EX+NUTR, relative to EX, intervention will evoke more positive changes in brain structure (e.g. hippocampal volume), neural activity (e.g. task associated functional activations monitored through fMRI), and cognitive performance. These changes will be associated with an improved metabolic profile, reductions in inflammatory cytokines and oxidative burden, and greater intervention compliance.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lifestyle, Exercise and Diet: The LEAD Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized control trial in which all participants will engage in supervised exercise sessions which are part of the standard Toronto Rehabilitation Institute's (TRI) Cardiovascular Prevention and Rehabilitation program, including aerobic training, resistance training and education/counseling. The active group will receive strategy training to simultaneously improve their diet in conjunction with our newly developed Brain Health Food Guide (EX+BHFG); the placebo control group (EX+BHEd) will receive brain health education to control for time and social participation. [NOTE All participants must also be enrolled in the SCD cohort of the CCNA and undergo the CCNA's COMPASS-ND assessment at the beginning of the trial.] The study is 6 months in duration and requires participants to attend 2.5 hr weekly sessions (1 hr supervised exercise, 0.5 hr exercise/stress education and 1 hr nutrition or brain health education) and to exercise on their own an additional 3-4 times per week. Participants are assessed on measures of cognition, brain health (MRI), functional status at baseline, post intervention and 6 month follow-up.</detailed_description>
