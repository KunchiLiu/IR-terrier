	<brief_summary>The current project will use the Complete Health Improvement Program (CHIP) as an intervention for patients with chronic pain. CHIP is a nationally recognized program that encourages a diet of whole plant-based foods, moderate exercise, stress reduction, and social support. Patients with chronic pain who enroll in CHIP classes will be monitored and compared to patients with chronic pain who are not enrolled in CHIP classes. It is hypothesized that patients who complete CHIP will have increased telomerase activity and longer relative telomere length at follow-up when compared to those who do not enroll in the program. Chromosomes consist of DNA that contains the genetic makeup of an individual; and telomeres are the caps on these chromosomes that protect them from damage. Telomere shortening occurs normally with aging and once they are too short to replicate cellular death occurs. Telomerase is a ribonucleic protein that counterbalances this shortening by extending the ends of chromosomes. Research has shown that patients with chronic pain may have shorter telomeres relative to others of the same age. This study will investigate this association further.</brief_summary>
