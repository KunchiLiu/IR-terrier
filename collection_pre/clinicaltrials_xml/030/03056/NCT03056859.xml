	<brief_summary>This is a single-arm observational trial of a device (Compass Vascular Access, Centurion Medical Products, Williamston MI). The device is a compact, sterile, single-use extravascular blood pressure transducer. This pressure measurement aids in confirmation of appropriate venous access. The investigators plan to enroll 40 consenting patients with BMI ≥35 who require central venous catheterization for clinical reasons independent of the existence of this study. The primary outcome is operator satisfaction.</brief_summary>
