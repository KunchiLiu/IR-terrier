	<brief_summary>The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of single-ascending intravenous (IV) infusions of BIIB076 in healthy volunteers and participants with Alzheimer's disease (AD). A secondary objective of the study for both healthy volunteers and participants with AD is to assess the serum pharmacokinetic(s) (PK) profile of BIIB076 after single-dose administration. Another secondary objective is to evaluate the immunogenicity of BIIB076 in serum after single-dose administration.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Key Inclusion Criteria Healthy Participants Must be in good health as determined by the Investigator, based on medical history and Screening evaluations. Key Inclusion Criteria Participants with Alzheimer's Disease (AD) Must have a clinical diagnosis of mild AD consistent with the following: Probable AD, according to the National Institute on Aging Alzheimer's Association workgroups on diagnostic guidelines for AD criteria [McKhann 2011]. CSF concentrations of AÎ²42 and ttau consistent with diagnosis of AD. Must have a MiniMental State Examination score between 20 and 26 (inclusive) at Screening. Key Exclusion Criteria Healthy Participants Brain MRI performed at Screening that shows showing evidence of acute or subacute hemorrhage, prior macrohemorrhage, cortical infract, &gt;1 lacunar infarct, history of diffuse whitematter disease or any finding that, in the opinion of the Investigator, might be a contributing cause of the participant's dementia, might pose a risk to the participant, or might prevent a satisfactory MRI assessment for safety monitoring. History of any clinically significant cardiac, endocrine, gastrointestinal, hematologic, hepatic, immunologic, metabolic, urologic, pulmonary, neurologic, dermatologic, psychiatric, or renal disease, or other major disease, as determined by the Investigator. Current enrollment in any other drug, biologic, device, or clinical study or treatment with an investigational drug or approved therapy for investigational use within 30 days (6 months for biologics) or 5 halflives, whichever is longer, prior to Day1. Contraindications to having a brain MRI (e.g., pacemaker; MRIincompatible aneurysm clips, artificial heart valves, or other metal foreign body; claustrophobia that cannot be medically managed). Contraindications to having an Lumbar Puncture (LP). Key Exclusion Criteria Participants with Alzheimer's Disease (AD) Any medical or neurologic/neurodegenerative condition (other than AD) that, in the opinion of the Investigator, might be a contributing cause of the participant's cognitive impairment (e.g., substance abuse, vitamin B12 deficiency, abnormal thyroid function, stroke or other cerebrovascular condition, Lewy body dementia, front temporal dementia, head trauma). Clinically significant psychiatric illness (e.g., uncontrolled major depression, schizophrenia, bipolar affective disorder) within 6 months prior to Screening. History of any clinically significant cardiac, endocrine, gastrointestinal, hematologic, hepatic, immunologic, metabolic, urologic, pulmonary, neurologic, dermatologic, or renal disease, or other major disease, as determined by the Investigator. Current enrollment in any other drug, biologic, device, or clinical study or treatment with an investigational drug or approved therapy for investigational use within 30 days (6 months for biologics) or 5 halflives, whichever is longer, prior to Day1. Contraindications to having a brain MRI (e.g., pacemaker; MRIincompatible aneurysm clips, artificial heart valves, or other metal foreign body; claustrophobia that cannot be medically managed). Contraindications to having an LP. NOTE: Other protocol defined Inclusion/Exclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
