	<brief_summary>Alcohol dependence is among the most common and costly public health problems affecting the nation. Among individuals with alcohol use disorder (AUD), those with (vs. without) a co-occurring anxiety disorder (AnxD) are as much as twice as likely to relapse in the months following AUD treatment. Dysregulation of biological stress-mood systems predict and correlate with AUD relapse and AnxD symptomatology. In contrast, stress system re-regulation correlates with improved AUD treatment outcomes but has not been examined with respect to AUD recovery and relapse in co-occurring AUD+AnxD. The objectives of the proposed research are to 1) evaluate the effect of co-occurring AnxD on the severity of biological stress-mood system dysregulations in AUD inpatients at pre-treatment, 2) evaluate the effect of co-occurring AnxD on the persistence of stress-mood system dysregulations in AUD inpatients in the months following treatment, 3) evaluate the effects of treatment on biological stress-mood system re-regulation among AUD patients with co-occurring AnxD, and 4) evaluate the effect of re-regulation change in biological stress-mood system function on AUD clinical outcomes.</brief_summary>
