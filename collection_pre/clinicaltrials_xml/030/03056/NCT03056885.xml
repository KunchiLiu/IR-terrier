	<brief_summary>This study evaluates the local cytokine inflammatory response during one lung ventilation in patients undergoing pulmonary lobectomy or wedge resection. We compare two different ventilation strategies: a conventional strategy with a protective strategy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Inflammatory Local Response During OLV: Protective vs Conventional Ventilation Strategy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One-lung ventilation (OLV) is a ventilation procedure used for pulmonary resection often causing lung injury. International guidelines have recommended for years the use of conventional ventilation (CV) with high tidal volume (VT) (8-10 ml\kg).A body of recent evidences have shown that conventional ventilation can reduce systemic oxygenation, increase inflammatory products and cause lung tissue damage. In this study we compare the conventional strategy , consisted of Vt 10 mL/kg, with the protective strategy, consisted of Vt 5 mL/kg. Both Vt were based on predicted body weight (PBW). Broncho-alveolar lavages (BAL) are selectively performed in the dependent (ventilated) lung before and at the end of the OLV. The levels of pro-inflammatory (IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, TNF) and anti-inflammatory (IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, INFγ) cytokines are evaluated. We also evaluate patients clinical outcomes in terms of incidence of postoperative respiratory complications and length of stay.</detailed_description>
