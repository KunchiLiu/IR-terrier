	<brief_summary>Investigators hypothesize that concurrent ribociclib treatment and chemotherapy will enhance the response to platinum-based therapy and maintenance therapy will slow ovarian cancer tumor growth leading to prolongation in progression free survival.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Women ≥18 years old with platinumsensitive recurrent ovarian, fallopian or primary peritoneal cancer (defined as recurrent disease &gt;6 months after completing last platinumbased chemotherapy) eligible to receive platinumbased doublet chemotherapy Must have had at least 1 prior line of platinumbased therapy ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group: Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group scoring system used to quantify general wellbeing and activities of daily life; scores range from 0 to 5 where 0 represents perfect health and 5 represents death.) 01 with life expectancy of ≥ 3 months Adequate organ function Screening ECG with QTcF interval at screening ≤450msec (using Fridericia's correction) and resting heart rate ≥ 50bpm Must be able to swallow ribociclib (LEE011) tablet/capsule Documented disease recurrence/progression based on GCIGRECIST Able to provide informed consent and comply with all study protocols Treated CNS (Central Nervous System) metastasis allowed if treatment is complete ≥4 weeks prior to enrollment and CNS disease is stable on repeat imaging To start maintenance therapy, the patient must meet the following criteria: ANC (Absolute Neutrophil Count) ≥1, hemoglobin ≥9 and platelets ≥50. Initiation of maintenance therapy may be delayed for hematologic count recovery but must start within 6 weeks from last dose of carboplatin + paclitaxel or patient will not be eligible for maintenance therapy. In women of childbearing potential (those who have had a menstrual cycle within the last year and have not had a tubal ligation or surgical removal of both ovaries and/or hysterectomy), two forms of contraception will be required Borderline or lowmalignant potential histology Platinumresistant disease (as defined as progressive disease within 6 months of completion of chemotherapy with a platinum agent) Grade 3 baseline neuropathy (severe symptoms; interfering with activities of daily living) History of anaphylaxis or serious allergic reaction to carboplatin or paclitaxel. Known hypersensitivity to any of the excipients of ribociclib (LEE011) Prior use of CDK4/6 inhibitors Congenital long QT syndrome or family history of unexpected sudden cardiac death Concurrent malignancy or malignancy within 3 years prior to starting study drug, with the exception of adequately treated basal or squamous cell carcinoma, nonmelanomatous skin cancer or curatively resected cervical cancer Gastrointestinal (GI) function or disease that may significantly alter the absorption of the study drugs Patient has any other concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled medical condition that would, in the investigator's judgment, cause unacceptable safety risks and contraindicate patient's participation in the clinical study or compromise compliance with the protocol Clinically significant, uncontrolled heart disease and/or cardiac repolarization abnormalities Use of prohibited medications that cannot be changed to an alternative therapy Patient is currently receiving or has received systemic corticosteroids ≤2 weeks prior to starting study drug, or who have not fully recovered from side effects of such treatment Patient is currently receiving warfarin or other coumadinderived anticoagulant for treatment, prophylaxis or otherwise. Therapy with heparin, low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or fondaparinux is allowed. Participation in a prior investigational study within 30 days prior to enrollment or within 5 halflives of the investigational product, whichever is longer Patient who has received radiotherapy ≤4 weeks or limited field radiation for palliation ≤2 weeks prior to starting study drug, and who has not recovered to grade 1 or better from related side effects of such therapy Patient has had major surgery within 14 days prior to starting study drug or has not recovered from major side effects (tumor biopsy is not considered as major surgery) 18. Patient has not recovered from all toxicities related to prior anticancer therapies to Grade &lt;1 (mild) Patient with a ChildPugh score B or C</criteria>
