	<brief_title>Metformin in Intrahepatic Cholestasis of Pregnancy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Intrahepatic cholestasis is a condition that affects pregnant women. It is characterised by itching, usually in the third trimester of pregnancy and is associated with an increase in the liver enzymes and bile salts. This can be associated with maternal and neonatal morbidity, and rarely perinatal mortality. The investigators propose to assess and compare the effect of Metformin versus Ursodeoxycholic acid on lowering liver enzymes and bile salts, improving maternal morbidity and improving neonatal outcomes. This study is a pilot study that will be conducted at 3 NHS hospital sites where patients will randomly assigned to receive either Metformin or Ursodeoxycholic acid. There will be 20 patient in each arm. Recruitment will commence in February 2017 and will run for an 18 month period.</detailed_description>
