	<brief_summary>This Clinical Trial is an open, non-randomized Phase Ib study to determine the maximal tolerable dose (MTD) of Vorinostat in Alzheimer disease (AD) patients between (including) 55 and 90 years with mild symptoms. The MTD in this study is defined as the dose that leads to maximum toxicity with Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) grade 1 symptoms.The safety and tolerability of Vorinostat in this group of study participants should be tested.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Trial to Determine Tolerable Dosis of Vorinostat in Patients With Mild Alzheimer Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The MTD of Vorinostat in the treatment of Alzheimer's patients is to be determined by using an open, non-randomized, multicentric dose-finding study with adaptive design. This Clinical Trial will take place in 2 parts. The first part will be performed as a dose escalation part in cohorts of three subjects. Possible dosages will be: one, two, three or four capsules (100 mg per capsule) once per day. The first cohort receives a dose of 100 mg per day. After the treatment, a Vorinostat-free follow-up phase will take place. For the following cohorts, dose increases, a repetition of the previous dose or a dose reduction are possible. After the dose escalation with a determination of the MTD, a dosage confirmation is carried out with additional subjects. The subjects are given a dose of Vorinostat of MTD over 4 weeks followed by a Vorinostat-free follow-up phase.</detailed_description>
