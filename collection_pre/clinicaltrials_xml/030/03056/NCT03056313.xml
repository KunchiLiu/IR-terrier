	<brief_summary>The duration of labor is decisive for maternal and fetal health. Poor progression often results in tired mothers, bad experience, delivery complications and a demand for cesarean section in next pregnancy. Proactive support of labor is a method originally from the Netherlands. The main idea is to define start of active labor earlier than the traditional "3-4 cm opening of the cervix and regular contractions" to be cervix &lt; 0.5 cm in length, and 1 cm opening and painful contractions. From this point, it is expected to be a progress of 1cm/hour opening of cervix. If not, progress is supported by amniotomy or stimulation of contractions. This method is embraced by several clinics with great enthusiasm. However, there are no randomized controlled trials to prove that this method is better than others.</brief_summary>
