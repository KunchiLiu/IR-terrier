	<brief_summary>To explore biological mechanisms in human model of induced dyspnea, in order to remove the source of dyspnoea, to modify cerebral impact and to allow the development of targeted therapies.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Biomarkers in Dyspnea</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of the study will be to identify a specific biology and immunology associated with dyspnoea. It will open therapeutic possibilities through a better understanding of the mechanisms of dyspnea. Healthy volunteers will underwent two types of dyspnea. The subjects will be first familiar with both types of dyspnea and dyspnea measurement scales. Different components of dyspnea will be measured. Blood tests will be performed at different times (before dyspnea, during dyspnea, 60 and 90 min after dyspnea)</detailed_description>
