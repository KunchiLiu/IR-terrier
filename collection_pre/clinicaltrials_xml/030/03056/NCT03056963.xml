	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to examine the efficacy of a guided imagery paradigm for reducing negative ways of thinking about the self. There will be at least 60 participants enrolled at the University of Texas at Austin. Participants will be randomly selected to receive one of two types of trainings, each over the course of two weeks. Participants will undergo the training exercises at home. The training exercises will help them to think differently about themselves. Participants will be able to determine if they are eligible, and then participate, by filling out a screening questionnaire online.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Guided Imagery Training and Self-Referential Processing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study uses a randomized controlled trial to compare two types of guided imagery. One intervention is an active intervention; the other is intended to be inert. These interventions were developed based on extensive research indicating the efficacy of using imagery in depression, and a perceived lack of treatments targeting biased self-referential processing. This protocol aims to develop a novel intervention which can be used on its own or as an adjunct to existing treatments. Common treatments for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) are diffuse; this paradigm instead aims to specifically target negative self-schema, a part of the cognitive model of MDD. This study focuses on participants with elevated depressive symptoms.</detailed_description>
