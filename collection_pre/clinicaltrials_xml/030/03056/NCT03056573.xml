	<detailed_description>Expand the indication of the Portico TF Delivery System and obtain approval of the Alternative Access Delivery System to place a Portico transcatheter aortic valve through an alternative access site, specifically subclavian/axillary or transaortic (TAo) in subjects with symptomatic severe native aortic stenosis who are considered high surgical risk</detailed_description>
	<mesh_term>Aortic Valve Stenosis</mesh_term>
	<criteria>1. Subject has provided written informed consent prior to uploading CT scan to core lab. 2. Subject is 65 years of age or older at the time of index procedure, and/or has comorbidities that, in the opinion of the Principal Investigator or the Subject Selection Committee, preclude surgical valve replacement. 3. Subject's aortic annulus diameter meets the range indicated in the Instructions for Use as measured by multislice CT conducted within 180 days prior to the index procedure. 4. Subject has senile degenerative aortic stenosis seen by echocardiography within 90 days of index procedure as measured by: mean gradient &gt;40 mmHg or jet velocity greater than 4.0 m/s or Doppler Velocity Index &lt;0.25, and an initial aortic valve area (AVA) of ≤ 1.0 cm2 (indexed EOA ≤ 0.6 cm2/m2). 5. Subject has symptomatic aortic stenosis as demonstrated by NYHA Functional Classification of Class II, or greater or other symptoms of aortic stenosis (e.g. syncope). 6. Subject is deemed high operable risk and preferred TAVI delivery route is alternate access (subclavian/axillary or direct aortic) per the medical opinion of the center's heart team. High risk is defined as an STS mortality &gt; 8% or documented heart team agreement ≥ high risk for SAVR due to frailty or comorbidities 1. Subject is unwilling or unable to comply with all studyrequired followup evaluations. 2. Subject has a documented history of a cerebral vascular accident (CVA) or transient ischemic attack (TIA) within 6 months (less than or equal to 180 days) prior to the index procedure. 3. Subject has carotid artery disease requiring intervention. 4. Subject has evidence of an acute STsegment elevation myocardial infarction (MI) within 30 days prior to patient index procedure (defined as: ST Segment Elevation as evidenced on 12 Lead ECG). 5. Subject has a native aortic valve that is congenitally unicuspid, bicuspid, quadricuspid or noncalcified as seen by echocardiography. 6. Subject has severe mitral valvular regurgitation. 7. Subject has severe mitral stenosis. 8. Subject has a preexisting prosthetic cardiac device, valve, or prosthetic ring in any position. 9. Subject refuses any blood product transfusion. 10. Subject has resting left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) less than 20%. 11. Subject has documented, untreated symptomatic coronary artery disease (CAD) requiring revascularization. 12. Subject has had a percutaneous interventional or other invasive cardiovascular or peripheral vascular procedure less than or equal to 14 days prior to index procedure. 13. Subject has severe basal septal hypertrophy that would interfere with transcatheter aortic valve placement. 14. Subject has a history of, or is currently diagnosed with, endocarditis. 15. There is imaging evidence of intracardiac mass, thrombus, or vegetation. 16. Subject is considered hemodynamically unstable (requiring inotropic support or mechanical heart assistance). 17. Subject is in acute pulmonary edema or requiring intravenous diuretic therapy to stabilize heart failure. 18. Subject with severe pulmonary disease as determined by STS score. 19. Subject is on chronic oral steroid therapy. 20. Subject has a documented hypersensitivity or contraindication to anticoagulant or antiplatelet medication. 21. Subject has renal insufficiency as evidenced by a serum creatinine greater than 3.0 mg/dL (265.5 µmol/L) or endstage renal disease requiring chronic dialysis. 22. Subject has morbid obesity defined as a BMI greater than or equal to 40. 23. Subject has ongoing infection or sepsis. 24. Subject has uncontrolled blood dyscrasias as defined: leukopenia (WBC&lt;3000 mm3), acute anemia (Hb&lt;9 mg/dL), thrombocytopenia (platelet count &lt;50,000 cells/mm3,). 25. Anatomy falling outside the recommended values in the IFU, unless specifically approved by the Subject Selection Committee. 26. Subject has an active peptic ulcer or has had gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding within 90 days prior to the index procedure. 27. Subject is currently participating in another investigational drug or device study, unless approved by the Sponsor. 28. Subject has/had emergency surgery for any reason within 30 days of the index procedure. 29. Subject has a life expectancy less than 1 year. 30. Subject has other medical, social or psychological conditions that, in the opinion of the Principal Investigator or the Subject Selection Committee, preclude the subject from study participation. 31. Subject is diagnosed with a state of dementia which would fundamentally complicate rehabilitation from the procedure or compliance with followup visits. 32. Subject has a documented allergy to contrast media that cannot adequately be treated, nitinol alloys, porcine tissue, or bovine tissue. Transaortic Subject Cohort Specific Exclusion Criteria 1. Subject has a chest condition (anatomical or otherwise) that prevents TAo access. 2. Subject has preexisting patent RIMA graft that would preclude access. 3. Subject has a porcelain aorta, defined as an extensive circumferential calcification of the ascending aorta that would complicate TAo access. Subclavian/Axillary Subject Cohort Specific Exclusion Criteria 1. Subject's access vessel (subclavian/axillary) diameter will not allow for introduction of the 18/19 Fr delivery system. 2. Subject's subclavian/axillary arteries have severe calcification and/or tortuosity. 3. Subject has a history of LIMA/RIMA graft that would preclude access</criteria>
