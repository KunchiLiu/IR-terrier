Patients who have clinically serious and/or unstable intercurrent infection, medical illnesses or conditions that are uncontrolled or whose control, in the opinion of the Investigator, may be jeopardized by participation in this study or by the complications of this therapy 14. Documented terminal illness or cancer or any concomitant disease process with a life expectancy of &lt;1 year 15. Patients already enrolled in another investigational drug trial or completed within 3 months or those who have received stem cells in the past 16.
