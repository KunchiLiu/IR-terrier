Subjects scheduled for VATS lobectomy in accordance with their institution's SOC; 3. Performance status 01 (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group classification); 4. ASA score &lt; 3; 5. No prior history of VATS or open lung surgery (on the lung in which the procedure will be performed); 6. Willing to give consent and comply with studyrelated evaluation and treatment schedule; and 7. 1875 years of age (inclusive). 1.
