	<brief_summary>Human Neutrophil Elastase (HNE) plays a pivotal role in innate immunity and in neutrophilic lung inflammation that characterized many diseases. CHF 6333 is a potent and 24h-durable inhibitor of HNE, developed as Dry Powder Inhaler (DPI) formulation. This study is designed to investigate the tolerability, safety and pharmacokinetics of inhaled CHF6333 DPI in healthy male subjects. The study will comprise two parts: Part 1 will consist of two alternated cohorts of healthy male subjects to assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of Single Ascending Dose (SAD) of CHF6333. Part 2 will consist of four sequential cohorts of healthy male subjects to assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of Multiple Ascending Dose (MAD) of CHF6333</brief_summary>
