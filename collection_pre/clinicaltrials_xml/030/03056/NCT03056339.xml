	<brief_summary>The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if giving genetically changed immune cells, called NK cells, after chemotherapy will improve the disease in stem cell transplant patients with relapsed (has returned) and/or refractory (has not responded to treatment) B-cell lymphoma or leukemia. Also, researchers want to find the highest tolerable dose of CAR-NK cells to give to patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell lymphoma or leukemia. The safety of this treatment will also be studied.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Gene Transfer: The process of changing the DNA (the genetic material in cells) of NK cells is called "gene transfer." NK cells will be separated out from frozen cord blood using a machine. Researchers then perform a gene transfer to change the NK cells' DNA, and then inject the genetically changed NK cells into the body of the patient receiving the transplant. Length of Study Participation You may be taking part in this study for up to 15 years. Your participation on the study will be over after the long-term follow-up visits described below. Tests Before Study Drug Administration: Before you receive study drugs, blood (about 4 tablespoons) will be drawn for research tests. This blood will be used as a baseline to study the immune system before starting treatment. Within 7 days before you receive study drugs: - You will have a physical exam. - Blood (about 4 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests. If you can become pregnant, part of the blood will be used for a pregnancy test. Study Drug Administration: You will receive fludarabine and cyclophosphamide to help prepare your body for CAR-NK infusion. These drugs may kill some cancer cells, but that is not the main goal for their use. The day you receive the CAR-NK cells is called Day 0. The days before you receive your CAR-NK cells are called minus days. The days after you receive the CAR-NK cells are called plus days. On Day -6, you will be admitted to the hospital and given fluids by vein to hydrate you. On Days -5, -4, and -3, you will receive fludarabine by vein over 1 hour and cyclophosphamide by vein over 3 hours. You will also receive mesna by vein over before and after the cyclophosphamide dose to lower the risk of side effects to the bladder caused by cyclophosphamide. On Days -2 and -1, you will rest. On Day 0, you will receive the genetically modified NK cells as a cell infusion by vein. If you have graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) or cytokine release syndrome after the NK cell infusion, you will receive AP1903 by vein and possibly steroids by mouth or by vein. GvHD occurs when donor cells attack the cells of the person receiving them. Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) occurs when a large amount of proteins are released into the blood. The risks of GvHD and CRS, some of which are serious, are described in greater detail below. Study Tests After the NK Infusion: On Day +2 and then at Weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12, and 16: °Blood (about 5 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, for chimerism tests (to see how well the transplant has taken), and for research tests. During Weeks 1, 3, 4, and 16: °You will have a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy to check the status of the disease and for research tests. To collect a bone marrow aspiration/biopsy, an area of the hip is numbed with anesthetic, and a small amount of bone marrow and bone is withdrawn through a large needle. Long-Term Follow-Up: For safety reasons, the FDA requires that patients who receive infusions of CAR-NK cells treated with a gene transfer procedure must have long-term follow-up yearly for at least 15 years after receiving the gene transfer. You will have blood tests performed to check to make sure you do not have a type of infection called the replication-competent retrovirus (RCR). For this test, blood (up to 4 teaspoons each time) will be drawn about 1, 3, and 6 months after the NK cell infusion, then again every 6 months for 5 years, and then once a year after that for 10 years. If the RCR test results during the first year after the NK cell infusion show that you do not have the RCR infection, the rest of your leftover blood samples (left over from RCR testing in Years 2-15) will be stored at Bellicum Pharmaceuticals for safety reasons. This is so researchers can study any changes in your blood (related to RCR) that may arise in Years 2-15. This is an investigational study. The making of and infusion of genetically changed NK cells and the drug AP1903 (if you receive it, explained below) are not FDA approved or commercially available for use in this type of disease. They are currently being used for research purposes only. The chemotherapy drugs in this study (fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and mesna) are commercially available and FDA approved. Up to 36 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>
