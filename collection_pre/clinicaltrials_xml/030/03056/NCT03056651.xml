	<detailed_description>The Day-Care Unit for Patients With Refractory Heart Failure (DayCare-HF) is a single-center observational study conducted in the 3rd Department of Cardiology, School of Medicine with the Division of Dentistry in Zabrze, Medical University of Silesia in Katowice, Silesian Centre for Heart Disease in Zabrze, Poland. The main objective of the DayCare-HF is to verify the hypothesis that comprehensive and multidisciplinary day-care management of patients with refractory heart failure (HF) is safe and beneficial in terms of hospital readmission due to HF and al cause mortality. The study population is formed by selected patients with heart failure, hospitalized in cardiology wards and intensive cardiac care unit of Silesian Centre for Heart Disease, who fulfilled eligibility criteria. During the scheduled visits comprehensive medical service is provided, including education, diagnostic tools (electrocardiography, transthoracic echocardiography, implanted cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) / cardiac resynchronization therapy device (CRT) interrogation and additional treatment (intravenous loop diuretic, dobutamine, vasodilators administration). The patients are under constant follow-up for major adverse events, heart transplantation, hospital readmissions due to HF and all cause mortality.</detailed_description>
