	<detailed_description>Patients scheduled to undergo laparoscopic preperitoneal or open inguinal hernia repair will be evaluated by means of scrotal/testicular ecocolordoppler ultrasound investigation before and after surgery in order to rule out the potential impact of the surgical procedure on testicular arterial and venous blood flow Ecocolordoppler will evaluate: 1. testicular arterial flow (Peak Systolic Velocity Testicular Artery - End-Diastolic Velocity Testicular Artery - Resistive Index testicular Artery) 2. venous impaired outflow using varicocele classifications (DUBIN - scale 1-3; HIRSCH scale 1-5) 3. testicular volume</detailed_description>
