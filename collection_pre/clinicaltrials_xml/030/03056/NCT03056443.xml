	<brief_summary>The study aimed to examine the effect of Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) initiation for newly diagnosed obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in hospitalized heart failure patients on reducing 30-day hospital readmission rate through a clinical trial.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Initiation of CPAP for Newly Diagnosed OSA in Hospitalized Heart Failure Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Following consent adult patients hospitalized with a medical history of heart failure and meeting study eligibility criteria will be screened for obstructive sleep apnea using the Ohio Sleep Medicine Institute Preoperative Questionnaire. If the probability of sleep apnea is high (Sleep apnea clinical Score &gt;15) then participants will complete the Epworth Daytime Sleepiness scale and the Minnesota Living with HeartFailure questionnaire. The patient will then be evaluated by the sleep medicine team with a portable polysomnography monitor which has been shown to be equivalent to standard in-laboratory polysomnography. All participants with apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) â‰¥ 5events/h in whom sleep disordered breathing is confirmed by sleep medicine physician will be eligible for randomization. Participants will be randomized into an auto-adjusting Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) group or standard of care (control) group. CPAP Arm (Intervention): Inpatient initiation and discharge with auto-adjusting Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) in addition to usual standards of clinical care for heart failure. The auto-CPAP group will be scheduled for follow-up with a phone call at 2 - 3 weeks post discharge, then in sleep medicine clinic at 1 month (+2 weeks) and 6 months (+2 weeks) to assess their progress on CPAP. Standard of Care Arm (Comparator): Those in the control group will go through the standard route of CPAP treatment for their OSA and standard heart failure therapy. Initiation of CPAP therapy will be based on insurance approval and DME (durable medical equipment) requirements. This group will be scheduled for follow-up with a phone call at 2- 3 weeks post discharge and then in sleep medicine clinic at 1 month (+2 weeks) and 6 months (+2 weeks) to assess their progress.</detailed_description>
