	<criteria>Patient must either: meet the PAH diagnostic criteria at Screening (based on a documented history of diagnosis as outlined in the American College of Chest Physicians [ACCP] 2004 EvidenceBased Clinical Practices Guidelines)15; or have elevated pulmonary pressure with a suspected PAH diagnosis based on a clinical referral at Screening for a RHC. Patient must have PAH as defined by a mean pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) &gt; 25 mmHg. Patient must have symptoms of pulmonary hypertension (PH) according to the World Health Organization (WHO) Functional Classification of Pulmonary Hypertension Class II through IV. Patient must consent to, be able to tolerate, and have adequate venous and arterial access for SwanGanz catheterization (SGC) and an arterial line. Clinically significant righttoleft intracardiac shunts based on Doppler echocardiography with bubble study. History of pulmonary venoocclusive disease or clinically significant aortic or mitral stenosis. History of sustained ventricular tachycardia (VTS) or ventricular fibrillation (VF) and cardiac arrest, or presence of atrial fibrillation. Active cardiac disease meeting the following criteria: Patient with elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressures (PCWPs) &gt; 25 mmHg. Patient with a history of myocardial infarction or coronary intervention within the last 60 days. Patient with a history of pacemaker, cardiac defibrillator, or biventricular pacemaker insertion within 4 weeks of Baseline. Patient who cannot be withdrawn from nitrate therapy.</criteria>
