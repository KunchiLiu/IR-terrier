	<brief_title>Phase II Bevacizumab, Gemcitabine and Carboplatin in Newly Diagnosed Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a open-label, phase 2, single-arm, multi-center study of bevacizumab combined with gemcitabine and carboplatin. This treatment is for newly-diagnosed advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), excluding squamous cell carcinoma. All subjects will receive 15 mg/kg bevacizumab every 3 weeks cycle, 1000 mg/m² of gemcitabine on day 1 and 8 every 3 weeks cycle and carboplatin (AUC= 5 ) every 3 weeks. Carboplasm will be administered 1 hour prior to the gemcitabine infusion, bevacizumab will be administered 1 hour following chemotherapy infusion. Subjects will receive a maximum of 6 cycles of chemotherapy, but treatment with bevacizumab may continue as long as patients have no evidence of progressive disease and no significant treatment-related toxicities.</detailed_description>
