	<brief_summary>This study has an open study design. The GFR will be measured using the renal clearance of inulin (Inutest) in volunteers with different stage of renal disease or without renal disease. A blood sample will be obtained for measuring serum creatinine in different laboratories.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Validation of Serum Creatinine Dosage and Renal Clearance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this study we will investigate the correlation between the GFR as measured by inulin clearance (golden standard) and the estimated GFR as measured by laboratories which used different serum creatinine assays in patients without renal disease and in patients with different stage of kidney failure.</detailed_description>
