	<brief_summary>This study will investigate whether the simplified regimen of a once daily fixed dose combination of Truvada (emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate [DF]) will be associated with a reduced rate of adverse events, seen with long term use of antiretrovirals, as well as improved adherence compared to a twice daily fixed dose combination of Combivir.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>SWEET: Once Daily Truvada Versus Twice Daily Combivir for the Treatment of HIV Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The success of HAART is largely dependant on an individual's ability to adhere strictly to an antiretroviral regimen. Regimen characteristics that affect adherence include dosing frequency and pill burden. Several studies have shown improved adherence with lower pill burden and a meta-analysis of the virological outcome in relation to pill burden has shown a significant correlation between lower pill burden and better virological outcome. A systematic review of studies across a range of medical specialties demonstrated that once daily therapy improves adherence relative to more frequent dosing although statistical significance was not demonstrated relative to twice daily regimens.</detailed_description>

Willingness to use effective contraception (such as barrier or coil methods) by both males and females while on study treatment and for 30 days following study drug completion. 8. The ability to understand and sign a written informed consent form, which must be obtained prior to initiation of study procedures. 1. Pregnant or lactating female. 2. History of AZT monotherapy. 3. Use of anabolic steroids, with the exception of testosterone for documented hypogonadism, within 90 days prior to the Baseline visit. 4. Documented parvovirus infection. 5.

Known history of resistance (including primary resistance) to any of the study medications tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), emtricitabine (FTC), AZT, 3TC, or EFV. 14. Patients receiving ongoing therapy with any of the following (administration of any of the following medications must be discontinued at least 30 days prior to the Baseline visit and for the duration of the study period): Nephrotoxic agents Probenecid Systemic chemotherapeutic agents (i.e. cancer treatment medications) Systemic corticosteroids Interleukin 2 (IL 2) Drugs that interact with efavirenz Dihydroergotamine Ergotamine Midazolam Triazolam Cisapride Rifampin Ergonovine Methylergonovine 15.

Patients who are currently taking part in any other clinical trial or have taken part in a clinical trial of a new chemical entity within 1 month prior to Screening. 18. Any other clinical condition or prior therapy that, in the opinion of the investigator, would make the patient unsuitable for the study or unable to comply with the dosing requirements. 19. Patients with cancer (except basal cell carcinoma). 20. Coinfection with hepatitis B virus</criteria>
