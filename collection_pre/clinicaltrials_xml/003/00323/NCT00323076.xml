	<brief_summary>Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is a Nuclear Medicine procedure that uses positron emitting radiolabeled tracer molecules to visualize biological activity. The presence of hypoxia (low oxygen) is associated with poor prognosis in a variety of tumour types and treatment strategies targeting hypoxic cells have been developed. The PET tracer [18]F-FAZA can identify hypoxic areas, and changes in uptake during treatment may predict tumour response.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Imaging Study in Patients With Cancer of the Head &amp; Neck, Lung, Renal Cell, Brain, Lymphoma and Neuroendocrine Tumours</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The proposed clinical trial will be a Phase I/II imaging, open label, single site study. In Phase I, one 18F-FAZA PET scan will be conducted in patients with known squamous cell carcinoma of the Head &amp; Neck, SCLC, NSCLC, lymphoma, GGM, neuroendocrine tumours or renal cell carcinoma. In Phase II, three 18F-FAZA PET scans will be done on patients with the above tumours as follows: one pre-treatment, one mid course and one post-treatment.</detailed_description>
