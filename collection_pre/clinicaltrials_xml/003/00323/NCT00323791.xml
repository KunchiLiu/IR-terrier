	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Imatinib mesylate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving gemcitabine together with imatinib mesylate may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying gemcitabine and imatinib mesylate to see how well they work compared with gemcitabine alone in treating patients with metastatic or unresectable kidney cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gemcitabine With or Without Imatinib Mesylate in Treating Patients With Metastatic or Unresectable Kidney Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Compare stable disease and objective response in patients with metastatic or unresectable renal cell carcinoma treated with gemcitabine hydrochloride with or without imatinib mesylate. Secondary - Evaluate the median survival, progression-free survival, and response rate in patients treated with gemcitabine hydrochloride and imatinib mesylate. - Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxic effects of this regimen in these patients. - Determine the expression of c-KIT and platelet-derived growth factor receptor-alpha protein expression in both tumor cells and associated endothelial cells using immunohistochemistry staining of paraffin-embedded tissue. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified by histology (clear cell vs nonclear cell) and prior therapy (immunotherapy/chemotherapy vs targeted agents). Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV on days 3 and 10 and oral imatinib mesylate on days 1-5 and 8-12. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving partial or complete response after 2 courses of treatment continue treatment with gemcitabine hydrochloride and imatinib mesylate in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with stable disease after 2 courses of treatment are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV on days 3 and 10. - Arm II: Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV on days 3 and 10 and oral imatinib mesylate on days 1-5 and 8-12. In both arms, treatment repeats every 21 days for at least 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Available archived tumor tissue samples are obtained for immunohistochemical analysis to quantify the expression of c-KIT and platelet-derived growth factor receptor-alpha protein expression. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 100 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
