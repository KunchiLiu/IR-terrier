	<brief_summary>The RTS,S/AS02A vaccine (or GSK 257049 vaccine), GSK Biologicals' candidate Plasmodium falciparum (P. falciparum) malaria vaccine is being developed for the routine immunization of infants and children living in malaria endemic areas. The vaccine would offer protection against malaria disease due to the parasite P. falciparum. The vaccine would also provide protection against infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV). This phase IIb trial is being carried out following the demonstration of efficacy of the candidate malaria vaccine in children in Mozambique: there, the vaccine demonstrated approximately 30% efficacy against clinical episodes of malaria and approximately 58% efficacy against severe malaria disease. In this study, the children from Mozambique (NCT= NCT00197041) are followed-up to assess the safety, immunogenicity and efficacy of the candidate malaria vaccine for a two year period commencing 21 months after Dose 1. This protocol posting deals with objectives &amp; outcome measures of the extension phase at year 2. During this extension study, no new subjects will be recruited and no vaccine will be administered. The Protocol Posting has been updated in order to comply with the FDA Amendment Act, Sep 2007.</brief_summary>
