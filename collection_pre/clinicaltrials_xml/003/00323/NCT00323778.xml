	<brief_summary>This study looks at the effect of an injectable medication called Hyalgan on the cartilage of the knee in people who have osteoarthritis ("wear and tear arthritis") of the knee. Hyalgan is a medication which is injected into the knee, and is FDA approved to treat knee arthritis. We will be using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and x-rays to look at knee cartilage to see how it responds over the course of a year to the injections. A comparison to patients taking oral pain medication will be made.</brief_summary>
