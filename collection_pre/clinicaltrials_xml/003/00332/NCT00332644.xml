	<brief_title>Smoking Cessation Medications: Efficacy, Mechanisms and Algorithms</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study will last for three years. The first year involves a comparison of smoking cessation medications (bupropion, nicotine patch, and nicotine lozenge), including medications used in combination. The results of this study may allow researchers and clinicians to decide which medications are best for helping people to quit smoking as well as what treatments work best for different people. In addition, the first year of this study may help to clarify how these medications work.The purpose of the second and third years of this research study will be to get long-term results on the physical health, mental health, lifestyle factors, and the overall quality of life of people attempting to quit smoking. The results of this study may help researchers and clinicians better understand the health improvements that come from quitting or not quitting smoking.</detailed_description>
