	<brief_summary>This is a two-part study in which Part A will assess the effects of GW679769 after 1 dose on the function of the nerves that supply the bladder. The technique for measuring the nerves function is called Neurometry. Part B will assess the effect of repeat doses of GW679769 on the bladder nerve function. Part B will also assess the effects of the drug on overactive bladder symptoms using a three-day patient diary.</brief_summary>
