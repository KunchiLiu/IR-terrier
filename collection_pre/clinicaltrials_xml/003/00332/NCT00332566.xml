	<brief_summary>This booster study will assess the immunogenicity, reactogenicity and safety of a booster dose of GSK Biologicals' DTPw-HBV/Hib Kft. vaccine versus DTPw-HBV/Hib vaccine, in healthy children, 18 to 24 months of age, who received the same vaccine for primary vaccination. Prior to the booster dose, this study will also assess the persistence of antibodies to the vaccine antigen components administered in the primary vaccination course. The Protocol Posting has been updated in order to comply with the FDA Amendment Act, Sep 2007.</brief_summary>

Major congenital defects or serious chronic illness. History of any neurologic disorders or seizures. Acute disease at the time of enrolment. Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products during the study period. Other conditions which in the opinion of the investigator may potentially interfere with interpretation of study outcomes.
