	<brief_summary>The muscarinic antagonist tolterodine is widely used treat urinary urge incontinence. Though acteylcholine is the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in the gastrointestinal tract, the phase III trials suggest that tolterodine infrequently causes constipation. Therefore, the objectives of this study are to assess if tolterodine affects the speed at which food travels through the stomach, intestines and colon (i.e., gastrointestinal and colonic transit) in healthy subjects.</brief_summary>
