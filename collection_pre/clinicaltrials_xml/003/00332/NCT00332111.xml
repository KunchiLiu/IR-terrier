	<brief_summary>The proposed protocol aims to characterize the infectious episodes in pancreas transplant recipients under the current medical care. Knowing these patients infectious risks, the types of infections that commonly affect them and the morbidity and mortality associated with it will provide valuable information in the evaluation of the safety and efficacy of the current practices. The information generated by this study will also serve as the basis for development of strategies targeting prophylaxis of infectious episodes.</brief_summary>
