	<brief_summary>The pragmatic issue at hand how to get physicians and nurses to use best practicesâ€¦ and how to measure consequences of their implementation. This is the science of "knowledge translation", which we are realizing is an "organic" entity. As part of our Critical Care Strategy our goal is to improve the quality and continuity of critical care within our health care system. Toward this goal we are implementing a program which links 16 Ontario hospitals through their critical care units in a Provincial Network.</brief_summary>
