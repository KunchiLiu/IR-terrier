	<brief_title>Efficacy Study of Oxygenated Glycerol Triesters to Treat Xerostomia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Xerostomia is due to inadequate (hyposialia) or inexistent (asialia) saliva secretion. There are may causes. Transitory xerostomia may occur in the presence of anxiety (stage fright, fear or dehydration). Prolonged xerostomia is most often related to a systemic disease, certain medicines or to radiotherapy of the head or neck. Salivation depends upon the autonomic (sympathetic and parasympathetic) nervous system for its production and on the central nervous system for stimuli-dependant excretion. Substances acting on alpha an beta sympathetic receptors, whether agonists or antagonists, may induce hyposialia. Atropine, the main antagonist of the parasympathetic system, is present in many medicines used for pulmonary, ophthalmic or neurological purposes, potentially causing hyposialia. Similarly, imipramine antidepressants, phenothiazine neuroleptics, antihistamines and disopyramide predispose to the onset of hyposialia. Xerostomia is often accompanied by buccal signs such as impaired sense of taste, halitosis and buccal ulcers and interferes with functions such as speech, chewing and swallowing. Because of reduced salivary secretion , there is a disturbance of the microbial colonization of the buccal cavity. Xerostomia has significant untoward effects on the buccal cavity and the quality of life of patients. The basis of the treatment of xerostomia involves the use of saliva substitutes and/or saliva stimulants. Oxygenated Glycerol Triesters is neither a replacement for nor stimulant of saliva. It is a lubricant and protective solution for endobuccal spray.</detailed_description>
