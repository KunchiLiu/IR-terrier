	<brief_summary>1. To demonstrate whether: i. Facet joint nerve blocks have therapeutic value beyond the duration of local anesthetic effect. ii. Adjuvant medications (Sarapin and Depo-Medrol) provide additional relief of cervical facet joint pain when used with facet joint nerve blocks. 2. To demonstrate whether or not there are clinically significant improvements in function of patients who receive cervical facet joint nerve block with or without Sarapin and Depo-Medrol (Group II) compared to patients randomized to Group I who receive only local anesthetic blocks. 3. To determine the adverse event profile in both groups.</brief_summary>
