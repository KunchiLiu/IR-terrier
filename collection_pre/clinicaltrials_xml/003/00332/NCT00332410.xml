	<brief_title>Intravenous Voriconazole in Patients With Renal Compromise</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to determine whether patients with compromised renal function (CrCl &lt; 50mL/min) receiving intravenous voriconazole experienced any adverse effects related to serum chemistries or other imaging studies of the kidney due to the potential accumulation of the vehicle cyclodextran. t has been previously shown by a large multi-centered, prospective, randomized study that voriconazole is superior to the then gold standard amphotericin B in the treatment of patients with invasive aspergillosis - a disease with significant morbidity and mortality. In patients with these infections who have severe renal insufficiency may be denied the best therapy due to the accumulation of a diluent with unknown clinical consequences. Qualifying and or quantifying these consequences are important to these patients so that potentially life-threatening therapy should not be unduly denied.</detailed_description>
