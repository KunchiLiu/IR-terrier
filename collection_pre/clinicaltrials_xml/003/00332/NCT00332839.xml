	<brief_summary>Calcineurin inhibitors (CNI), a potent immunosuppressive drug used in kidney transplant recipients to prevent graft rejection, may cause renal impairment. The aim of this study is to assess whether a CNI-free regimen with enteric-coated mycophenolate sodium and everolimus is as safe and well tolerated as a standard regimen consisting of enteric-coated mycophenolate sodium and cyclosporine microemulsion without a compromise in therapeutic efficacy while resulting in an improved renal function.</brief_summary>
