	<criteria>A diagnosis of Bcell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (BCLL); according to the National Cancer Institute Working Group (NCI WG) Criteria. World Health Organization (WHO) performance status of 0, 1, or 2. Life expectancy ≥ 12 weeks. Previous therapy with at least one but no more than 5 regimens (single agent or combination regimen). One therapy regimen is defined as consecutive, contiguous cycles of the same drug(s) with no treatment interruptions lasting &gt; 3 months. Patient requires treatment for CLL per the following criteria: Rai stage III or IV; Rai stage 0II with at least one of the following evidence of progressive marrow failure as manifested by the development of, or worsening of, anemia and/or thrombocytopenia; Massive (i.e. greater than 6 cm below the left costal margin) or progressive splenomegaly; Progressive lymphocytosis with an increase of greater than 50% over a 2month period or an anticipated doubling time of less than 6 months; Lymphocyte count &gt; 100*10^9/L; B symptoms. More than 3 weeks since prior chemotherapy. Patient must have recovered from the acute side effects incurred as a result of previous therapy. More than 3 weeks since using investigational agents. Patient must have recovered from the acute side effects incurred as a result of previous therapy. Serum creatinine and conjugated (direct) bilirubin less than or equal to 2 times the institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) unless secondary to direct infiltration of the liver with CLL. Female patients with childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test (serum or urine) within 2 weeks of first dose of study drug(s). All patients must agree to use an effective contraceptive method while on study treatment, if appropriate, and for a minimum of 6 months following study therapy. Signed, written informed consent (in the US, includes The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) authorization) Positive Coombs test and evidence of active hemolysis. Platelet count less than 50*10^9/L without splenomegaly. History of anaphylaxis following exposure to rat or mouse derived CDRgrafted humanized monoclonal antibodies. Previously treated with CAMPATH. Previous bone marrow transplant. Known central nervous system (CNS) involvement with BCLL Active infection, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive. Active second malignancy. Recent documented history (within 2 years) of active tuberculosis (TB), current active TB infection, currently receiving antituberculous medication (e.g., INH, rifampin, streptomycin, pyrazinamide, or others). Active hepatitis or a history of prior viral hepatitis B or hepatitis C, or positive hepatitis B serologies. Patients with a positive hepatitis B surface antibody (HBsAb) test with a documented history of prior hepatitis B immunization are eligible as long as other criteria are met (i.e. negative tests for: hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb) and hepatitis C virus antibody (HCVAb)). Other severe, concurrent diseases (e.g., cardiac or pulmonary disease), mental disorders, or major organ malfunction (liver, kidney) that could interfere with the patient ability to participate in the study. Pregnant or nursing women. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) positive by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (above the level of detection). A patient that is PCR positive will require treatment to reduce the viral load to a nondetectable level; but such a patient may be considered for study entry once the infection has been treated. Medical condition requiring chronic use of oral corticosteroids at a dose higher than physiologic replacement.</criteria>
