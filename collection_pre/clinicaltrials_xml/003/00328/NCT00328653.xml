	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is: - To assess the efficacy of Nova22007, a cyclosporine A (CsA), 0.05% and 0.1% versus vehicle in patients with vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC) after a 4-week treatment period. The secondary objectives of this study are: - To compare the safety and ocular tolerance of Nova22007 0.05% and 0.1%; - To assess the long term safety and ocular tolerance of Nova22007 0.05% and 0.1%; and - To assess the decrease in frequency of concomitant artificial tears use.</brief_summary>
