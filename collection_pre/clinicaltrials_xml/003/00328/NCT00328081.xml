	<brief_title>State of Obesity Care in Canada Evaluation Registry</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obesity currently affects over 15% of the adult population in Canada. The economic burden associated with obesity is estimated at $4.3 billion or 2.2% of the total health care costs in Canada. Despite increasing recognition as a public health problem, clinical management of obese patients in Canada has received little attention. This study will collect information on the current status, characteristics and management of subjects with obesity. The design of the study will mirror real-life management of these subjects.There are three goals in this study: the primary goal is to document appropriate obesity management strategies aimed at reducing and maintaining a healthy body weight by participating primary care physicians and specialists. The second goal is to explore factors that determine patients compliance and adherence to anti-obesity medication when prescribed. Obesity management is currently not a priority in tertiary care centres in Canada. An exception being the Bariatric Clinic located at McMaster University, which is one of the few academic centers dedicated to obesity management in Canada. The primary goal of the Bariatric Clinic Substudy is to evaluate the management, compliance and adherence of patients seen at a tertiary care obesity clinic compared to those of primary care physicians and specialists.</detailed_description>
