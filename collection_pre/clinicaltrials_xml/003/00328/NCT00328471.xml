	<brief_summary>The purpose of this randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to test the effectiveness of a comprehensive interdisciplinary post-discharge stroke care management intervention in improving the overall well-being of 190 stroke survivors as compared to 190 patients who receive usual post-discharge stroke care.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Post Discharge Intervention to Improve Stroke Outcomes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The major components of the model of post-stroke care being tested include equal emphasis on physical and psychosocial issues known to impact stroke outcomes, an Advanced Practice Nurse care manager (APN-CM), an interdisciplinary healthcare team, evidenced-based care plans, collaboration with the patient's primary care physician (PCP), and ongoing patient monitoring. The APN-CM will work as part of an interdisciplinary post-stroke consultation team (PSC-Team) that will review problems identified at an in-home patient assessment. The core PSC-Team will include a geriatrician, a community-based general internist, a Clinical Nurse Specialist from the acute stroke unit, the APN-CM, and a physical therapist. Extended team members will be available as-needed and will include a neurologist, pharmacist, physiatrist, social worker, speech therapist, occupational therapist, and dietitian. The PSC-Team will develop patient care plans specific to each problem identified by the APN-CM. A copy of the care plans, evidence-based guidelines, pertinent references, and a short paragraph providing "academic detailing" specific to the patient's problems will be given to the patient's PCP by phone and in writing. The APN-CM will work collaboratively with the PCP to implement the recommendations and provide ongoing monitoring.The primary outcome of overall well-being of stroke survivors will be obtained at 6 months.</detailed_description>
