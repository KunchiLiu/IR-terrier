	<brief_title>Effectiveness of Internet Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Intervention for Treating Insomnia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Insomnia is a disorder that is characterized by a perception or complaint of inadequate or poor-quality sleep. Symptoms of insomnia include difficulty falling asleep, waking frequently during the night and having difficulty returning to sleep, waking too early in the morning, and unrefreshing sleep. Insomnia may also cause problems during the day, such as tiredness, difficulty concentrating, and irritability. Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) has been found to have significant short- and long-term benefits for people with insomnia. Access to CBT for many people, however, is limited, due to the high cost of treatment and a lack of trained professionals in some locations. Delivering CBT via the internet could help make the treatment more widely available. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of an online CBT intervention in improving sleep, mood, and cognitive functioning in people with insomnia. Participants in this open label study will be randomly assigned to receive the online CBT intervention either immediately or after a 4-month waiting period. Participants will use the online program for 1 to 2 hours per week for 8 weeks. Participants will keep track of their sleep patterns for the first and last 2 weeks of a 4-month period by keeping a daily diary and wearing a wrist watch device that monitors movement. All participants will report to the study site for baseline evaluations before beginning treatment and for final evaluations upon completing the program, about 4 months after study entry.</detailed_description>
