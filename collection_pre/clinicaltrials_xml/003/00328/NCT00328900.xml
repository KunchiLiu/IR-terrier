	<brief_title>Measurement of Stress During Anesthesia With "Pain Detector" on Patients Receiving Atropine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Skin conductance (SC), in terms of numbers of skin conduction fluctuations (NSCF), amplitude and mean skin conductance level, reflect the activity in the sympathetic postganglionic cholinergic fibers which innervate the palmar and plantar sweat glands. Skin conductance, especially numbers of skin conductance fluctuations, may be a promising tool to monitor anesthesia. Atropine, an anticholinergic agent, acts as an antagonist on the muscarinic receptors of the sweat glands and inhibits their secretion in a dose-dependent way. The aim of this study was to find out to what degree SC is influenced by i.v. administration of atropine. Study hypothesis: SC is not influenced by i.v. administration of atropine.</detailed_description>
