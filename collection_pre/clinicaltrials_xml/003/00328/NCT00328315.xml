	<brief_title>Cardiac SPECT With Rotating Slant Hole Collimator</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Myocardial perfusion SPECT is recognized as an effective clinical diagnostic imaging technique in the assessment of myocardial perfusion and coronary artery diseases. It is the most important clinical application of SPECT imaging techniques. The goal is to conduct a clinical pilot study to evaluate the use of RMSSH SPECT in the detection of myocardial defects especially in very sick patients in the nuclear medicine clinics, emergence room, and intensive care units. Comparison of the clinical utilities of the cardiac RMSSH SPECT technique with conventional cardiac planar and SPECT with parallel-hole collimation will also allow us to evaluate the potential application of the technique to a wider patient population. The objective of this study is to test the hypothesis that quantitative 99mTc myocardial perfusion RMSSH SPECT provides similar diagnostic accuracy in patients with cardiac diseases as conventional SPECT imaging techniques.</detailed_description>
