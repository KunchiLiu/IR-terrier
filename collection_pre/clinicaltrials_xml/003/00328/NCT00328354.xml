	<brief_title>Mammography SPECT With Rotating Slant Hole Collimator</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal of this protocol is to develop and evaluate a novel SPECT imaging technique for imaging the breast using rotating multi-segment slant-hole (RMSSH) collimators. The motivation is the requirement of a low cost RMSSH collimator and a conventional LFOV camera. It is believed that RMSSH SPECT is particularly suitable for applications in breast imaging.</detailed_description>
