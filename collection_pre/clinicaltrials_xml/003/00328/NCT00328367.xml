	<brief_title>Aripiprazole Augmentation for Clozapine-Treated Patients With Refractory Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Clozapine is renowned for its efficacy in treating schizophrenia refractory to typical or atypical antipsychotics. Though the effectiveness of clozapine has been established, a considerable number of patients with schizophrenia are partially responsive or unresponsive to clozapine. In addition, long-term use of clozapine is associated with the development of obsessive-compulsive symptoms and metabolic syndrome. In order to overcome these short-comings and to increase efficacy, aripiprazole augmentation was implemented. Quantitative electroencephalogram will be used to monitor the occurrence of abnormal findings and to analyze the changes in electroencephalographic pattern with linear and non-linear methodology. Comparisons: Design of double-blind randomized placebo controlled study of patients at Refractory Schizophrenia Clinique in Department of Neuropsychiatry at Seoul National University Hospital.</detailed_description>
