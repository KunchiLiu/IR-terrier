	<brief_title>ZD1839 With Hypofractionated Radiation Therapy With an Immobilization Device for Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To estimate treatment-related esophageal, pulmonary, hematologic, and other toxicity of patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) receiving ZD1839 with hypofractionated thoracic radiotherapy (RT). All estimates of toxicity rates will be presented with corresponding confidence intervals using the exact method. The method of Atkinson and Brown will be used due to the two-stage sampling; the method of Conover will be used for tumor response. To estimate tumor response rates of this treatment regimen and identify the most effective RT dose level, defined as the level associated with the best response rate. Estimates of tumor response rates will be presented with corresponding confidence intervals using the exact method of Conover. Survival will be estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method.</detailed_description>
