	<brief_title>A Dose Ranging Study of Different Strengths of Spinosad Topical Creme in Subjects With Pediculosis Capitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There are millions of children and adults affected with head lice each year in the United States. It has become a major nuisance in school children resulting in many lost school days and frustrated parents. Lice and nit (ova) resistance to current OTC products has been reported. Compliance with product instructions is thought to be low. Therefore a safe and effective alternative to these products is desirable. Spinosad and its formulations have been approved by the Environmental Protection Agency as crop protection products in the US, Canada and Australia, and has received provisional approval in the UK, Spain and several other European Union countries. Spinosad is being formulated as a creme rinse using excipients that are widely used and are "generally regarded as safe" (GRAS). This study is intended to show the safety and efficacy of Spinosad 0.5% and 1.0%, as compared to the vehicle control in subjects 2 years of age and older with at least a mild infestation of pediculosis capitis.</detailed_description>
