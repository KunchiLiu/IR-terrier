Interferon-alpha subcutaneously on days 1 + 3 + 5 weeks 1 + 2 +6 + 7,11+12 at a dose of 6 MIU/d. Interleukin-2 subcutaneously on days 1 to 4 in weeks 3 + 4 +8 + 9,13+14 at a dose of 4.5 MIU/day. Group B Patients randomized to group B will receive treatment according to the same treatment schedule and at the same dosages without capecitabine.
