	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Extracranial stereotactic radiosurgery may be able to send x-rays directly to the tumor and cause less damage to normal tissue. PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of extracranial stereotactic radiosurgery and to see how well it works in treating patients with solid tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Extracranial Stereotactic Radiosurgery in Treating Patients With Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of extracranial stereotactic radiosurgery in patients with isolated tumors. (Phase I) - Determine the minimum dose required for local control. (Phase II) Secondary - Determine the radiographic response rate. - Determine the median time to progression of the treated tumor. - Evaluate the toxicity of treatment. - Evaluate the cause of death. OUTLINE: This is a phase I dose-escalation study followed by a phase II open-label study. Patients are stratified according to tumor size. - Phase I: Patients undergo stereotactic radiosurgery to one lesion. Cohorts of 3-6 patients undergo escalating doses of stereotactic radiosurgery until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which 33% of patients experience dose-limiting toxicity within 3 months of treatment. - Phase II: Patients undergo stereotactic radiosurgery to one lesion at the MTD or at the dose at which local control at 3 months is ≥ 80%, as determined in phase I. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 1 month, 3 months, and then every 3 months thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: At least 48 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
