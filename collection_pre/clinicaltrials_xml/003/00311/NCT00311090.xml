	<brief_summary>The three purposes of this study are the following: - To compare during a 6-month treatment the safety and effectiveness of idrabiotaparinux (SSR126517) with that of idraparinux (SR34006), taking into account new events of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), and bleeding risk; - To compare the activities of idrabiotaparinux and idraparinux directly in blood during and after a 6-month treatment; - To check the ability of avidin (SSR29261) to reverse the blood thinning activity of idrabiotaparinux at the end of a 6-month treatment period.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bioequipotency Study of Idrabiotaparinux and Idraparinux in Patients With Deep Venous Thrombosis of the Lower Limbs</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study consists in a 6-month treatment period followed by an observational period of 3 to 6 months with a month 9 visit and a phone/contact visit at month 12. All participants who complete the 6-month treatment period are re-randomized to either the idrabiotaparinux/idraparinux bioequipotency sub-study or the avidin neutralizing effect sub-study.</detailed_description>
