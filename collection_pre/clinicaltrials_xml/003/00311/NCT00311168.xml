	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the VIP™ feature (available in dual chamber Victory® devices) to reduce unnecessary RV pacing, and to determine if patients with implanted SJM pacemakers will benefit by using VIP™ rather than only a programmed AV/PV delay.</brief_summary>

	<mesh_term>Bradycardia</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Patient has been implanted with dual chamber SJM Victory® device with VIP™ for 1 month (± 2 weeks). At the time of pacemaker implant, VIP™ is programmed "OFF". At the time of enrollment, patient is paced in the RV ≤ 60% of the time. Patient is medically stable. Patient has evidence of complete AV block, such that ventricular pacing would be required as part of the patient's routine management. Patient is indicated for AF Suppression. Patient has persistent or chronic atrial fibrillation. Patient is unable to comply with the followup visits due to geographical, psychological, or any other reasons. Patient is currently participating in another device research study. Patient is younger than 18 years of age. Patient is pregnant. Patients life expectancy is less than 12 months.</criteria>
