	<brief_title>Trial of an Interactive CD-Program on 6 Months Readmission Rate in Patients With Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The prevalence of heart failure (HF) has increased in the western world and is a major concern due to increasing prevalence and rising health care costs. The prognosis remains poor despite improvement in survival due to treatment with ACE-inhibitors and beta-receptor antagonists. HF has a high rate of readmission and hospitalisation. Some readmissions are ascribed to patients’ lack of compliance, insufficient knowledge about diet, medication and symptoms of heart failure. Education of patients has become an important component in order to increase the patients’ self-care and compliance. Intense education and counselling of patients is recommended in both European and American guidelines for HF. Several systematic reviews of studies on strategies for improvement of outcomes of heart failure patients after discharge have been published, but very little emphasis has been put on methodological issues, e.g. methods of education. In most programs the methods and equipment used for education and information have only consisted of verbal and written material; computer-based tools seem to be relatively new. Interactive CD-ROM programs for HF patients can increase patients’ knowledge about heart failure and its treatment. However, no studies have examined the clinical outcome, e.g. rate of readmission. Comparison: Extra educated patients (interactive CD-ROM education) compared to standard educated patients on readmission rate or death during 6 months.</detailed_description>
