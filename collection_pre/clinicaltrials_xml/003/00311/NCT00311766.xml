	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate a treatment to enhance the healing of acute and chronic nonhealing cutaneous wounds, such as the erosions experienced by patients with Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB), by the known activity of thymosin beta 4 (Tβ4). Funding Source - FDA Office of Orphan Product Development (OOPD).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase 2 Study on Effect of Thymosin Beta 4 on Wound Healing in Patients With Epidermolysis Bullosa</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>EB is a group of genetic diseases characterized by skin-blistering and lesion-formation after minor trauma to the skin. This family of disorders, most of which are inherited, range in severity from mild to the severely disabling and life-threatening. Tβ4 is a synthetically-produced copy of a naturally-occurring 43 amino acid peptide that has wound healing and anti-inflammatory properties and can up-regulate the expression of laminin-5.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Informed Consent form signed by the patient or patient's legal representative; also, if the patient is under the age of majority but capable of providing assent, signed assent from the patient Diagnosis of junctional or dystrophic EB. Patients who present with HallopeauSiemens subtype may be enrolled. At least one active, unroofed EB erosion on the limb or on the trunk. Lesion size 5 to 50 cm2, inclusive. Stable lesion present for 1460 days before enrollment. More that one member in a family can be enrolled as long as that member is treated to a different cohort with an assurance that the study medication will not be shared. No clinically significant abnormalities (Grade 2 or higher on the National Cancer Institute [NCI] toxicity scale) on Screening laboratory tests, except for the following specific laboratory threshold result: albumin must be 2 g/dL or higher; hemoglobin must be 8 g/dL or higher. Clinical evidence of local infection of the index (targeted) lesion. Use of any investigational drug within the 30 days before enrollment. Use of immunotherapy or cytotoxic chemotherapy within the 60 days before enrollment. Use of systemic or topical steroidal therapy within the 30 days before enrollment.Inhaled steroids are allowed. Use of systemic antibiotics within the 7 days before enrollment. Current or former malignancy. Arterial or venous disorder resulting in ulcerated wounds. Diabetes mellitus. Pregnancy or breastfeeding during the study. (A serum pregnancy test will be performed at Screening for female patients of childbearing potential.)</criteria>
