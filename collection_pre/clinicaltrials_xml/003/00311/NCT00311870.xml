	<brief_summary>The aim of the study was to compare the renoprotective effect of a long acting calcium antagonist (nisoldipine) with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (lisinopril)in type 1 diabetic patients with diabetic kidney disease. In total, 51 patients were randomised to treatment with one of these drugs for 4 years. Changes in kidney function, blood pressure and urinary excretion of albumin were measured every 6 months</brief_summary>
