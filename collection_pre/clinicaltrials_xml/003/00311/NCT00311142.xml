	<brief_summary>The development of regular sleep-wake cycle is an important factor of the newborn maturation and it has influence on behavior .Factor that may influence the process of the maturation of the sleep-wake cycle is the delivery mode.nd growing. These various states could be detected and measured with actigraphy, using a wrist-watch like device that continuously measures and records the subject's movements.The present study aims to compare vacuum delivery with regular, elective and not elective caesarean sections. We hypothesize that the sleep of vacuum-delivered newborns will be more fragmented then newborns in other delivery modes.</brief_summary>
