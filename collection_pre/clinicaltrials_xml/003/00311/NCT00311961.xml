	<brief_summary>Treatment with systemic corticosteroids for acute exacerbations of COPD results in the improvement of clinical outcomes. The optimal route of administration has not been rigorously studied in COPD. Upon hospitalization, corticosteroids are administered intravenously in many hospitals. Oral administration is more convenient, though, because there is no need for intravenous access, less personnel is required for starting and monitoring therapy, and material costs are smaller. The investigators hypothesized that oral administration is not inferior to intravenous administration of prednisolone in the treatment of patients hospitalized for an acute exacerbation of COPD.</brief_summary>
