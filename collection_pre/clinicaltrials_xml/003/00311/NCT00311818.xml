	<brief_summary>Primary objective: - To compare efficacy of oral antidiabetics (OAD) combination therapy with either HOE901 insulin analogue once daily or Lispro insulin analogue at mealtime in terms of change in HbA1c (baseline to endpoint). Secondary objectives: - To compare the OAD combination therapy with either HOE901 insulin analogue once daily or Lispro insulin analogue at mealtime in terms of efficacy and safety.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subjects with Type 2 Diabetes mellitus for at least 1 year (no history of ketoacidosis) and treatment with oral antidiabetics (OAD) for at least 6 months prior to study entry Subjects poorly controlled with previous OAD treatment: any mono or combination therapy approved in combination with insulin according to local SPCs (summary of product characteristics), not including use of alphaglucosidase inhibitors, at a stable dose for least 3 month prior to study entry Poor metabolic control with HbA1c (glycosylated hemoglobin) values between 7.5 % and 10.5 % and FBG &gt; or = 120 mg/dl (6.6 mmol/l) Body mass index &lt; or = 35 kg/m2 Ability and willingness of a tight antidiabetic therapy under a stable lifestyle with regular meals and to perform blood glucose self monitoring and especially blood glucose profiles using a blood glucose meter at home, as evidence by daily FBG measurements and a complete 8point blood glucose profile obtained over a 24hour period Treatment with any insulin in the last 4 weeks prior to study entry Diabetes mellitus following pancreatectomy GAD positive (glutamic acid decarboxylase) Diabetic retinopathy with surgical treatment (laser photocoagulation or vitrectomy) in the 3 months prior to study entry or which may require surgical treatment within 3 months of study entry Pregnant or breastfeeding Women of childbearing potential who did not take adequate contraceptive protection such as systemic hormones (birth control pills, implant), intrauterine device, or a barrier method (diaphragm with intravaginal spermicidal, cervical cap, male or female condom) History of hypersensitivity to the study medication or to drugs with similar chemical structures Treatment with any investigational drug in the last 3 months before study entry Previous enrollment in a study involving HOE901 insulin analogue Likelihood of requiring treatment during the study period with drugs not permitted by the study protocol (e.g. noncardio selective betablockers, systemic corticosteroids) Clinically relevant cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, hepatic, neurologic, endocrine, hematological or other major systemic disease making implementation of the protocol or interpretation of the study results difficult History of drug or alcohol abuse Impaired hepatic function, as shown by, but not limited to,alanine aminotransferase (ALAT) or aspartate aminotransferase (ASAT) above 3x the upper limit of normal, if no lower values are required by the individually administered OAD Impaired renal function, as shown by, but not limited to, serum creatinine &gt; 177 mmol/l (&gt; 2 mg/dl), if no lower values are required by the individually administered OAD The above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a patient's potential participation in a clinical trial.</criteria>
