	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether immunosuppression by tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and prednisone compared to conversion to sirolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and prednisone affect the progression of atherosclerosis in renal transplant recipients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Comparing Effect On Carotid Atherosclerosis Following Conversion From Tacrolimus To Sirolimus Post-Transplant In Kidney Transplant Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A decision to terminate the study was taken in November 2011 and a communication to that effect sent to all participating sites on November 18. All sites were asked to have patients returned to the sites and have all end of study procedures performed by Dec 31, 2011. The decision to terminate this study was made following the conduct of an interim analysis which demonstrated that the study did not reach its primary endpoint. The termination of this study was not driven by any safety concerns and had no impact on subject safety and well-being.</detailed_description>
