	<brief_summary>We propose a randomised trial among pulmonary TB patients, examined and treated as part of the national TB control programme (WHO, 2003). The aim is to improve TB treatment outcome in high TB and HIV burden countries. The overall objective of the proposed trial is to assess the effect of nutritional support on TB treatment outcomes, and to assess the role of diabetes on risk and severity of TB, and TB treatment outcomes. The study will be conducted in Mwanza Tanzania. All patients will initially be examined for HIV and diabetes. A total of 500 found pulmonary TB smear-positive (PTB+) and HIV positive (HIV+) will be randomised to a daily supplement of 1 versus 6 energy-protein bars throughout treatment, both with full multi-micronutrient (MN) content. A total of 1500 found pulmonary TB smear-negative (PTB-, irrespective of HIV status) and PTB+ and HIV negative (HIV-) will be randomised to 1 daily energy-protein bar containing either low or high MN content.</brief_summary>
