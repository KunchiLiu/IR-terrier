	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as irinotecan and temozolomide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving irinotecan together with temozolomide works in treating young patients with recurrent neuroblastoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Irinotecan and Temozolomide in Treating Young Patients With Recurrent Neuroblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the response rate in pediatric patients with relapsed neuroblastoma (NB) treated with irinotecan hydrochloride and temozolomide. - Determine the toxicities associated with irinotecan and temozolomide in patients treated with this regimen. Secondary - Evaluate the impact of p53 loss of function on response rate and event-free survival from start of relapse therapy. - Collect data for ongoing analyses of UGT1A1 polymorphisms in these patients. - Collect and bank serum and nucleic acid specimen to facilitate future biomarker studies. - Evaluate the feasibility of collecting blood samples on a group wide basis for assessment of changes in circulating markers of angiogenesis. - Assess, preliminarily, the effects of irinotecan hydrochloride and temozolomide on circulating markers of angiogenesis. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to disease status (measurable disease [measured by conventional CT scan and/or MRI] vs evaluable disease [tumor detected by conventional morphologic analysis of bone marrow aspirate/biopsy AND/OR abnormal uptake at ≥ 1 site on MIBG scan]). Patients receive irinotecan hydrochloride IV over 1 hour on days 1-5 and 8-12 and oral temozolomide on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 10 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
