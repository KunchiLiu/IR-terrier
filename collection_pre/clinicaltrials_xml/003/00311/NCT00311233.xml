	<brief_title>Recurrent Abdominal Pain in Childhood -Characteristics and Course</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND: Recurrent abdominal pain (RAP), mainly constituted by functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID), affects a significant number of children, and is a result of a complex interaction between biopsychosocial factors. Despite the seemingly benign nature of RAP, in some children RAP is associated with school absenteeism, functional impairment and frequent doctor visits. Identification of the processes that maintain illness is important. These results may be important to identify children who need treatment. AIMS: The aims of this study are to characterize children with RAP (in four out-patient clinics) and their parents, describe outcome and determine predictors of persistent RAP in children. SAMPLE: 150 pediatric patients (4-15 years), their parents and teachers. Consecutive new patients referred to four pediatric out-patients clinics for evaluation of abdominal pain (primary complaint). Patients with RAP (abdominal pain at least once a month, in three consecutive months during the last year, and whose pains are severe enough to affect daily activity) are eligible. DESIGN: A prospective cohort study. MEASUREMENT: All pediatric patients will undergo a complete physical examination emphasizing diagnosing organic illness and FGID according to the international ROME classification. Routine laboratory will be done. A protocol to identify somatic causes is part of the study. In addition, parents will complete validated questionnaires regarding their child`s physical/psychological health, temperamental characteristics and social skills and also psychosocial conditions concerning them selves. Self-report regarding the same aspects will be obtained from children above 8-9 years.</detailed_description>
