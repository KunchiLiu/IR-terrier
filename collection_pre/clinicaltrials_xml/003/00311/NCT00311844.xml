	<brief_summary>This study was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over, single-center study of desloratadine 5 mg or placebo in subjects 18 years of age or older with a history of seasonal allergic rhinoconjunctivitis. This study was performed to examine the effects of desloratadine compared with placebo, on the signs and symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis induced by direct conjunctival challenges with a previously identified sensitizing antigen, in the eyes of a subject known to be sensitive to the antigen.</brief_summary>

Must agree to record symptom severity scores, medication times, concomitant medications, and adverse events accurately and consistently in a daily diary. At the Screening Visit, prior to the qualifying conjunctival allergen challenge, the subject must have an ocular symptom severity redness score of mild (&lt;=1) prior to exposure to allergen. Following allergen challenge, the subject must achieve ocular itching and redness scores of at least moderate (&gt;=2) in both eyes within 10 minutes of the last allergen challenge. For redness, the score must be &gt;=2 in 2 of the 3 vessel beds. (details in section 8.2.6 and 8.3.2 of the protocol) At the confirmation visit, the subject must have ocular itching scores in both eyes of &gt;=2 in 2 of the 3 timepoints (3, 5, and 7 minutes postchallenge). The subject must also have the following redness score bilaterally at 15 minutes postchallenge: &gt;=2 in at least 2 vessel beds and &gt;=6 composite oculare redness score A female who is pregnant, intends to become pregnant during the study or is nursing Subject has not observed the designated washout periods for prohibited medication as per protocol Section 7.2.
