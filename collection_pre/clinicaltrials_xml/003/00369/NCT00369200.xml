	<brief_summary>This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of AFP464 in treating patients with advanced solid tumors. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as AFP464, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>AFP464 in Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the dose-limiting toxicity and maximum tolerated dose of AFP464 in patients with advanced solid tumors. II. Assess the safety and tolerability of this drug in these patients. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Observe clinical response in patients treated with this drug. II. Characterize the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients. III. Determine the clinical significance of genetic polymorphisms on the genes coding metabolizing enzymes (e.g., CYP1A1, 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, and SULTA1) and on the disposition and efficacy/toxicity of AFP464 and AF. OUTLINE: This a dose-escalation, multicenter study. Patients receive AFP464 IV over 3 hours on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Cohorts of 2-6 patients receive escalating doses of AFP464 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which ≤ 1 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. An additional 10 patients whose tumor is amenable to biopsy are treated at the MTD. Patients undergo blood collection periodically for pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies. Patients treated at the MTD also undergo tumor tissue biopsies periodically for additional pharmacodynamic and correlative biomarker studies. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 4 weeks.</detailed_description>
