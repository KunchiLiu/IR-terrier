	<brief_title>VEGF Trap in Treating Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the antitumor activity of VEGF Trap, in terms of tumor response rate, in patients with metastatic breast cancer who have received =&lt; 2 prior chemotherapy regimens for metastatic disease, including a taxane and/or anthracycline. II. Assess the 6-month progression-free survival rate in patients treated with VEGF Trap. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Describe the adverse event profile (grade using the NCI CTCAE version 3.0) of VEGF Trap in these patients. II. Describe the progression-free survival times in patients treated with VEGF Trap. III. Describe the overall survival of patients treated with VEGF Trap. IV. Describe the duration of response in patients treated with VEGF Trap. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive VEGF Trap IV over 1 hour on day 1. Courses repeat every 14 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3-6 months for up to 5 years.</detailed_description>
