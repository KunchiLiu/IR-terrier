	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Studying samples of tumor tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors identify and learn more about biomarkers related to cancer. PURPOSE: This laboratory study is collecting skin biopsy specimens from patients receiving irinotecan or gemcitabine for advanced solid tumors and using them to study change in DNA due to this treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Skin Biopsies and DNA Analysis in Patients Receiving Irinotecan or Gemcitabine For Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the level of p-Chk1 and phospho-histone 2AX (p-H2AX), an indicator of DNA damage, and possibly downstream pathway markers in hair follicles from skin biopsies of patients treated with gemcitabine hydrochloride or irinotecan hydrochloride for advanced solid tumors. Secondary - Characterize the method for measurement (immunohistochemistry). - Measure inter- and intra-patient variability for the biomarker. - Partially characterize the dynamic time course of p-Chk1 and p-H2AX after administration of a DNA-damaging agent. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients undergo collection of 2 skin biopsies with hair follicles at 4 and 8 hours or at 4 and 6 hours after the start of irinotecan hydrochloride or gemcitabine hydrochloride treatment on day 1 of course 1. Repeat biopsies will be taken at 4, 6, or 8 hours after the start of irinotecan hydrochloride or gemcitabine hydrochloride on day 1 of 2 successive courses. Tissue is examined by immunohistochemistry and possibly other methods for changes in p-Chk1 and pH2AX. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
