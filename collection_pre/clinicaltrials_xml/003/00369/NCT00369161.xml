	<criteria>Inclusion criteria Male or female of 1865 years old Patient who has received a primary kidney transplant from a cadaveric, living unrelated or nonhuman leucocyte antigen (HLA) identical living related donor Recipient of a kidney with a cold ischemia time (CIT) &lt; 30 hours Recipient of a kidney from a donor 1065 years old Patient able to receive the first dose of tacrolimus within 24 hours from graft reperfusion Female capable of becoming pregnant must have a negative pregnancy test and is required to practice a medically approved method of birth control for the duration of the study and for a period of three months following discontinuation of investigational drug Patient willing and capable of giving written informed consent for study participation and able to participate in the study for 12 months Exclusion criteria Patient who has previously received an organ transplant Recipient of multiple organ transplants Recipient of a kidney transplant from a non heartbeating donor Recipient of donor specific transfusions Recipient of ABO incompatible transplant or Tcell crossmatch positive transplant Patient with current Panel Reactive Antibodies (PRA) level ≥ 50% Recipient of a kidney from a donor who tests positive for hepatitis B surface antigen or hepatitis C antibodies Patient who is human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive Patient who has a positive hepatitis C serology or who is hepatitis B surface antigen positive with evidence of liver injury as indicated by aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels ≥2.5 times upper limit of normal (UNL). Viral serology results obtained within 6 months prior to the administration of the first dose of Certican™ are acceptable Patient with severe hypercholesterolemia (350 mg/dL, 9.1 mmoL/dL) or hypertriglyceridemia ( 500 mg/dL, 5.6 mmoL/L) Patient with white blood cell (WBC) count 3,000/mm3 or with platelet count 75,000/mm3 Patient with any severe allergy requiring acute (within 4 weeks of baseline) or chronic treatment, or with hypersensitivity to drugs similar to Certican (e.g., macrolides) Patient who has been treated with an immunosuppressive drug or an investigational drug within 4 weeks prior to the administration of the first dose of Certican Patient with uncontrolled infection Patient with any surgical or medical condition, other than the current transplant, which in the opinion of the investigator, precludes enrollment in this trial Patient with a known malignancy or a history of malignancy within last 5 years other than successfully treated localized basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin Abnormal physical or laboratory findings of clinical significance within 2 weeks prior to the administration of the first dose of Certican™ which at investigator's discretion would interfere with the objectives of the study Breast feeding women Patient with symptoms of significant somatic or mental illness or with unresolved history of drug or alcohol abuse Patient unable to cooperate or communicate with the investigator</criteria>
