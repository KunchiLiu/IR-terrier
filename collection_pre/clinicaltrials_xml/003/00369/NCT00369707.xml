	<brief_summary>Bortezomib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the cancer. Monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab, can block cancer growth in different ways. Some block the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Others find cancer cells and help kill them or carry cancer-killing substances to them. Giving bortezomib together with rituximab may kill more cancer cells. This phase II trial is studying how well giving bortezomib together with rituximab works as first-line therapy in treating patients with low-grade B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial of VELCADE and Rituxan as Front-line Tx for Low-grade NHL</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multicenter, prospective study. - Induction therapy: Patients receive bortezomib IV over 3-5 seconds on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Patients also receive rituximab IV on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of course 1 and on day 1 of all subsequent courses. Treatment repeats every 35 days for 3 courses. Patients achieving a complete response, partial response, or stable disease proceed to maintenance therapy. - Maintenance therapy: Beginning 6-8 weeks after induction therapy, patients receive bortezomib IV over 3-5 seconds and rituximab IV on day 1. Treatment repeats every 60 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Blood and tissue samples are collected at baseline and periodically during study treatment. After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years.</detailed_description>
