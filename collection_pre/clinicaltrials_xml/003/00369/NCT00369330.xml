	<brief_summary>To investigate if in acute symptomatic atrial fibrillation (AF) the early (&gt;2 hrs but within 12 hrs of the beginning of the arrhythmia) electrical cardioversion leads to a longer recurrence-free interval than the delayed cardioversion (&gt; 36 hrs but &lt; 48 hrs after the beginning of the arrhythmia) within the first 3 months after cardioversion.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>KONVERT-AF - Relevance of Point in Time for Conversion of Acute Atrial Fibrillation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>So far it is unknown if early or delayed cardioversion is most beneficial for patient outcome and which strategy is best to prevent recurrence of AF. The KONVERT-AF trial investigates if in acute symptomatic AF the early (&gt;2 hrs but within 12 hrs of the beginning of the arrhythmia) electrical cardioversion leads to a longer recurrence-free interval than the delayed cardioversion (&gt; 36 hrs but &lt; 48 hrs after the beginning of the arrhythmia) within the first 3 months after cardioversion. Primary endpoint is the time to the first recurrence of AF. The KONVERT-AF trial will be conducted as prospective, randomized, non-blinded multicentre study. It is planned to include 380 patients in 10-20 recruitment centres.</detailed_description>
