	<brief_summary>L-[3-18F]-α–methyltyrosine (FMT) is amino-acid tracer for positron emission tomography (PET), and is used for tumor detection because malignant tumor cells accumulate 18F-FMT based on the increased expression of amino-acid transporter. This study was conducted to investigate a usefulness of 18F-FMT PET in combination with 18F-FDG PET for the diagnosis of sarcoidosis in patients with suspected malignancy.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Eligible patients were required to have histologically proven noncaseating epithelioid cell granuloma and at least one disease that the possibility of coexistent malignancy could not be excluded as follows; 1) extrapulmonary lesions mimicking malignant diseases including systemic lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenic involvement, or other lesions, 2) multiple nodular lesions mimicking pulmonary metastasis, 3) the occurrence of BHL in cancer patient. The patients that PET imaging using 18FFDG and 18FFMT was performed before establishment of the final diagnosis of sarcoidosis, patients undergoing treatment for sarcoidosis before the PET study, and patient having diabetes mellitus.</criteria>
