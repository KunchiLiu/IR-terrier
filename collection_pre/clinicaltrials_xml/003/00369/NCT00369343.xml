	<brief_summary>Desvenlafaxine succinate (DVS) is a potent and selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI). The sustained-release (SR) formulation, DVS SR, is being studied in the development program for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD), for vasomotor symptoms (VMS) associated with menopause, and for pain associated with peripheral diabetic neuropathy, as well as for the treatment of fibromyalgia syndrome. This study will investigate the safety, efficacy, and tolerability of DVS SR in women with MDD who are peri- and postmenopausal.</brief_summary>
