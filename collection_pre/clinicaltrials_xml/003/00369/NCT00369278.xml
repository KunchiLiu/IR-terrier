	<brief_summary>This study will assess the association of an initially intensified dosing regimen of enteric-coated mycophenolate sodium (EC-MPS) during the first 6 weeks post renal transplantation with acute rejections relative to the rapid achievement of an MPA (mycophenolic acid) exposure of â‰¥ 40 mg*h/L compared to a standard dosing regimen of EC-MPS. Additionally, this study will assess safety and tolerability of the intensified dosing regimen of EC-MPS. This study will be conducted in 2 stages (Stage I and Stage II).</brief_summary>
