	<brief_summary>The primary purpose of this study is to determine whether converting from calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) therapy to sirolimus therapy will be more effective than continuing calcineurin inhibitor therapy with respect to renal function in cardiac transplant recipients with mild to moderate renal dysfunction.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Cardiac transplant recipients age 18 years or older receiving cyclosporine or tacrolimus since the time of transplant. 12 months after cardiac transplantation but less than 96 months posttransplantation. Multipleorgan transplant recipients (such as heartlung, heartkidney, or heart after kidney transplant recipients). Prior or current use of sirolimus or everolimus unless administration was part of a "CNI holiday" lasting no more than 10 days. History of acute rejection within the last 3 months, malignancy within the last 5 years (except for adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patients.</criteria>
