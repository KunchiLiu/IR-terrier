	<brief_summary>This study will collect blood and DNA samples from patients with inherited eye diseases to be used in research to identify genetic factors responsible for these conditions. In recent years, nearly 500 genes that contribute to inherited eye diseases have been identified. Disease-causing mutations are associated with many eye diseases, including glaucoma, cataracts, strabismus, corneal dystrophies and a number of forms of retinal degenerations. As a result, gene-based therapies are being pursued to treat eye genetic diseases that were once considered untreatable. The National Ophthalmic Genotyping Network (eyeGENE ) is creating a national tissue repository to further advance genetic research on inherited eye disease, while at the same time providing clinically-useful information back to patients and physicians who request it.. Physicians in collaborating institutions will recruit patients to participate in the study. Patients will provide a blood sample and undergo a standard eye examination. The blood sample and clinical information will then be sent to the NEI for testing, processing and storing in the tissue repository. Patients are given the option to receive results back and/or to be re-contacted in the event of future clinical studies. Information supplied to the testing laboratories includes a unique identification number, the patient gender, and the patient date of birth. The stored samples will be made available to researchers along with information about the patient's disease, but without patient identifiers.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Molecular genetics has the potential to revolutionize the diagnosis and treatment of inherited eye diseases. Progress in research on inherited eye disease would be augmented by the availability of patient DNA coupled to robust, anonymous phenotypic information. The National Ophthalmic Genotyping and Phenotyping Network (eyeGENE ) has been created to answer this need. We propose the creation of a national DNA and blood repository for inherited eye disease. These samples will be gathered from clinical centers around the nation and will be coupled to anonymous, phenotypic descriptors. If requested, a portion of the sample submitted by a clinician will be used for appropriate, CLIA-certified molecular diagnostics that can be used in patient care. Once a sufficient repository is created, researchers will be able to request aliquots for their laboratory experiments. Participants will be provided the option to be re-contacted if an approved clinical study for which they might qualify is offered. Researchers will be able to request aliquots for their laboratory experiments or ask the eyeGENE Coordinating Center to re-contact participants to inform them about the possibility to participate in a clinical study</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA: To participate in this protocol: 1a. The participant must present with characteristics that meet minimal clinical criteria established by eyeGENE, as determined by the referring clinician. OR 1b. The participant must be a relative of an affected participant if analysis would help with the interpretation of an affected participant's test results or to obtain some useful information as decided by the eyeGENE Research Study Group. 2. The participant must be willing and able to provide a suitable blood sample. EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Severe systemic disease that compromise the ability of the referring clinician to obtain an adequate eye examination. Any disease or condition that makes it unsafe for a subject to provide a blood sample of at least 5 ml for children and at least 15ml for adults. Inability to cooperate with phlebotomy and clinical examination. Those with impaired decisionmaking capability who do not have a legallyauthorized representative. If clinical criteria information, consent forms, or a blood sample can not be provided by the doctor or participant after one year of submitting a blood sample to eyeGENE .</criteria>
