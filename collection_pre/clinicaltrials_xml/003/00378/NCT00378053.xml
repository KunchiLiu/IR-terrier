	<brief_title>A Prospective Study of Radiation Exposure to Surgeons</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to measure the amount of radiation over a specific period of time that Orthopaedic Surgeons are exposed to while using the mini c-arm fluoroscopy machine. The amount of radiation that the Surgeons will be exposed to will be recorded by a ring dosimeter located on the Surgeons' hand, and two badge dosimeters (one above the scrub collar, and one underneath a lead gown at waist level).</detailed_description>
	<criteria>This study will only enroll the Surgeons of the Vanderbilt Hand and Upper Extremity Center. There will be no inclusion/exclusion criteria for the type of surgery that will be monitored, nor the patients that are having surgery. If a mini carm fluoroscopy is used the amount of radiation received by the Surgeon's hand for that surgery will be monitored by a gassterilized radiation ring dosimeter. The amount of scatter radiation the Surgeon will be exposed to will be recorded by a badge dosimeter located on the Surgeon's scrub collar, and one badge dosimeter that will be located under the required lead gown worn by the Surgeon.</criteria>
