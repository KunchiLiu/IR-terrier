	<brief_summary>Life-threatening infection impairs bloodflow to the gut, thereby causing less delivery of oxygen. This leads to increased formation of different inflammatory and infectious markers. The investigators hypothesize, therefore, that there is a significant difference in the concentrations of inflammatory and infectious markers in the rectal mucosa between patients with septic shock and healthy controls.</brief_summary>
