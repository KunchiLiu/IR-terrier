	<brief_summary>The objective of the study is to examine whether a 7-day high protein intake from either milk or meat in healthy, prepubertal children can increase fasting levels of serum IGF-I, IGFBP-3 and IGF-I/IGFBP-3 as well as insulin, glucose and HOMA insulin reststance, HOMA beta cell function and amino acids.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The objective of the study is to examine whether a high protein intake (PI) from either milk or meat, at a level often seen in late infancy, in healthy, prepubertal children can increase fasting levels of serum IGF-I, IGFBP-3 and IGF-I/IGFBP-3 as well as insulin, glucose and HOMA insulin reststance, HOMA beta cell function and amino acids. IGF-I levels are positively associated with growth velocity in children and some studies suggest that a high animal PI can stimulate growth. During protein deprivation IGF-I decrease, but it is unknown whether a high PI can increase s-IGF-I in well-nourished children. Insulin is also a growth factor, and studies have found that postprandially, milk possess some insulinotrophic effect not related to its carbohydrate content. However, the effect on fasting insulin in children is unknown. Design: Twenty-four 8-y-old boys are asked to take either 1.5 l of skimmed milk (n=12) or the same amount of protein as 250 g low fat meat (n=12) daily for seven days. The remaining diet they can choose freely. At baseline and after seven days, anthropometrical variables are measured, diet is registered (3-d weighed records), and the blood analytes are determined after fast.</detailed_description>
