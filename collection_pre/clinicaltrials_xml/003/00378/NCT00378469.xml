	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of muscular exercise on iron metabolism in healthy volunteers. Fourteen healthy male subjects will have to pedal on an ergocycle for 45 minutes, and urine and blood samples will be collected regularly to measure hemojuvelin, hepcidin, iron and transferrin levels.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of the Effects of Muscular Activity on Iron Metabolism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hemojuvelin has been described as interfering with hepcidin, a key regulator of iron homeostasis. Hemojuvelin is mainly produced by muscle, and the relationship between exercise and iron metabolism can be questioned about. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of muscular exercise on iron metabolism in healthy volunteers. Fourteen healthy male subjects will be investigated at two periods according to a cross-over design after: 1. 45 minutes of exercise on the ergocycle; and 2. no physical exercise. Urine and blood samples will be collected at both periods regularly to measure hemojuvelin, hepcidin, iron and transferrin levels.</detailed_description>
