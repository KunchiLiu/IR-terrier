	<brief_summary>The primary objective is to evaluate a knewly developed blade (for intubating patients about to undergo surgery) and compare it to the traditional Macintosh blade</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Laryngoscope Prototype Tested Against the Traditional Macintosh Blade</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Intubation of patiens can be difficult, even impossible. It can result in different complications as damage to the teeth, lacerations of the mucosa, bleeding, fractures/luxations, hypoxia, hypercapnia, reflex bradycardia and in worst case braindamage and death. The more difficult the intubation is the more frequent complicationrate. We believe to have developed a laryngoscopeblade that hopefully eases the intubationproces and thereby reduces the complicationrisk. The patients included in this study is patients who are undergoing elective surgery requering intubation.</detailed_description>
