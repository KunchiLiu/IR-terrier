	<detailed_description>This is a randomized, multicenter observational study to assess the impact of the EDCS in a rheumatology clinical practice setting on patient satisfaction with patient-physician communication using the Health Tracker electronic data capture system . Patients will be randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to the Health Tracker-user or non-user groups, respectively. The primary outcomes of this study will be the impact that information gathered and analyzed by an electronic data capture system has on patient satisfaction with arthritis care and patient physician interactions in clinical practice. Patient satisfaction will be assessed using a questionnaire developed specifically for this study. This study does not involve the use of any investigational drugs, and the protocol does not mandate the treatment regimen patients will receive. Physicians will prescribe antirheumatic medications in accordance with usual clinical practice. The planned duration of subject participation is 12 months</detailed_description>
