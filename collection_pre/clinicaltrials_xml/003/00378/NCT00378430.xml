	<brief_summary>Aim - To better understand expectations and attitudes of first generation immigrants from India to USA. Background - The is large difference in healthcare system as practiced in India and in USA. Most people who have lived in India for certain period of their life have basic understanding of health-care system in India. In general it is the physician who makes choices for patients there , also the concept of health screening is less prevalent. After immigrating to USA these immigrants are exposed to new healthcare system. We donot have any data showing their attitudes to some specific questions and physician preference in general. We also have significant concentration of these ethnic group in the central valley. With this questionnaire study we hope to get better understanding of their beliefs and expectations. We have tried to keep the questions simple and straightforward.</brief_summary>
