	<brief_summary>IgA nephropathy( IgAN) is the most common primary glomerulonephritis worldwide. Since the etiology of the disease is not clearly understood, no specific therapeutic strategies was defined for IgAN. Both ACEi/ARB and steroid was found to be effective in slowing the rate of disease progression, but the use of steroid was restricted because of its side effects. However, there is no evidence from RCT on the question of whether combined use of steroid with ACEi/ARB can bring more benefit to IgAN patients than ACEi/ARB alone. We therefore undertook a randomized, multicenter study to investigate the efficacy and safety profile of combined use of ACEi/ARB plus steroid compared with ACEi/ARB alone in the treatment of patients with IgAN.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>IgA nephropathy( IgAN) is the most common primary glomerulonephritis worldwide. Since the etiology of the disease is not clearly understood, no specific therapeutic strategies was defined for IgAN. In the many studies on the treatment of IgAN, both ACEi/ARB and steroid was found to be effective in slowing the rate of disease progression, but the use of steroid was restricted because of its side effects, and ACEi/ARB was considered to be the first line therapy. However, there is no evidence from RCT on the question of whether combined use of steroid with ACEi/ARB can bring more benefit to IgAN patients than ACEi/ARB alone. We therefore undertook a randomized, multicenter study to investigate the efficacy and safety profile of combined use of ACEi/ARB plus steroid compared with ACEi/ARB alone in the treatment of patients with IgAN.</detailed_description>
