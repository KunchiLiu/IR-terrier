	<brief_summary>EUROTRANSFER Registry is a prospective, international, web-based European Registry on Patients with ST-Elevation MI Transferred for Mechanical Reperfusion (PCI) with a Special Focus on Upstream Use of Abciximab. This registry is designed to collect data on approximately 1800 patients during a 12 month enrollment period in up to 20 interventional cardiology centres with hospital transfer networks from all over Europe. Analysis of this registry should allow to monitor transfer timelines of patients arriving to the cath-lab from the regional hospital with or without upstream start of abciximab and scheduled for mechanical reperfusion (PCI) as well as to monitor regional differences across Europe in regard to the impact that time of various stages of the treatment chain may have on clinical outcomes.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>PATIENTS: All consecutive STEMI patients &gt;=18years arriving to the Cath Lab hospital (invasive facility center) from transfer. Transfer with respect to this registry is defined as patients that reach the Cath Lab hospital: 1. transferred from a surrounding regional community hospitals that the Cath Lab hospital has an established referral pattern with or 2. after being pickedâ€“up by an ambulance which is equipped/staffed to provide specific medical therapy (like prehospital thrombolysis or upstream abciximab). Usually these have a physician or specifically trained nurse on board. CENTRES: Provide 24 hour/7 days on duty PCI service. Has an established regional hospital referral network with &gt;=8 patients/month arriving from transfer (as defined above). A rate of &gt;=10% of these transfer patients who receive upstream abciximab before or during transfer to the Cath Lab hospital. Start of abciximab in the ER or CCU of the Cath Lab hospital will not be considered as upstream start of abciximab. Patients who arrive to the Cath Lab from other pathways than those specified above (a. and b.), e.g. those who come by ambulances that do not provide specific medical therapy or arrive directly to the ER of the Cath Lab hospital by own feet/car will not be included in this registry. Patients from controlled clinical trials shall be included as long as their actual treatment is fully known. Thus, participants from randomized trials with blinded treatment cannot be included in this registry.</criteria>
