	<criteria>Patients must be 18 years of age or greater. Histologically or cytologically proven nonsmall cell lung cancer that is either metastatic or recurrent and failed at least one prior platinumbased chemotherapeutic regimen. Patients who have recurred after previous surgery and/or radiation may participate in this trial. Patients may have had prior neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy. Patients with known brain metastases are eligible for this clinical trial if their disease has been treated and they are clinically stable and documented by a stable or improved pretreatment CT or MRI scan of the brain to evaluate for CNS disease within 28 days prior to registration. Measurable OR nonmeasurable disease documented by CT, MRI, Xray or nuclear exam (FDGPET). Measurable or nonmeasurable disease must be present outside the area of surgical resection. Pleural effusions, ascites and laboratory parameters are not acceptable as the only evidence of disease. Progression after at least one prior platinumbased chemotherapy. Greater than 3 weeks since surgery and must have recovered from all associated toxicities at time of registration. ANC ≥ 1,500/µl and platelet count ≥ 100,000/µl obtained within 28 days prior to registration. Adequate hepatic function documented by a serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 times institutional upper limit of normal and liver enzymes (SGOT or SGPT) ≤ 2.5 x the institutional upper limit of normal obtained within 28 days prior to registration. Patients requiring lung radiation must have an FEV1 of &gt; 1000 liters obtained within 28 days prior to registration and must have pulmonary function tests with DLCO. Zubrod Performance Status of 0,1 or 2. No prior singleagent, weekly Docetaxel chemotherapy. Peripheral neuropathy ≥ Grade 1. Prior malignancy except for the following: adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, in situ cervical cancer, adequately treated Stage I or II cancer from which the patient is currently in complete remission or other cancer from which the patient has been diseasefree for 5 years. Pregnant or nursing women.</criteria>
