	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Comparing results of three different thermometers used to measure body temperature may help doctors find the most accurate thermometer to detect fever and plan the best treatment. PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying three different types of thermometers to measure temperature in young patients with fever and without fever.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Three Different Types of Thermometers in Measuring Temperature in Young Patients With Fever and Without Fever</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine agreement between three different types of temperature-measuring instruments: the temporal artery scanner, the digital oral thermometer, and the infrared tympanic thermometer calibrated to an oral setting, in pediatric patients who are febrile and afebrile. Secondary - Determine similarities or differences in the percent of fevers detected with oral, ear, and temporal artery monitoring in these pediatric patients. - Determine differences in agreement of the various temperature devices in non-neutropenic pediatric patients versus neutropenic pediatric patients. OUTLINE: This is a prospective study. During an afebrile episode, the patient's temperature is measured twice using the following 3 devices: a temporal artery scanner, a digital oral thermometer, and an infrared tympanic thermometer calibrated to an oral setting (total of 6 temperature measurements per afebrile episode). During a febrile episode, the patient's temperature is measured twice using all 3 devices as above, and then at 2 and 4 hours after administration of an antipyretic medication (total of 18 temperatures per febrile episode). Patients' temperatures are recorded for a maximum of 3 afebrile or febrile episodes. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 32 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
