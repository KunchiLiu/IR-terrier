	<brief_title>REVEAL: Reduction of Infarct Expansion and Ventricular Remodeling With Erythropoietin After Large Myocardial Infarction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>REVEAL is a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, parallel phase II clinical study that will evaluate the effects of erythropoietin administration on infarct size, left ventricular remodeling and circulating endothelial progenitor cells in patients with large myocardial infarctions (MI). The study will be conducted in two phases: a dose-escalation safety phase and a single dose efficacy phase. Eligible patients who present to the hospital with an acute ST-elevation MI and who agree to participate in this study will be randomly assigned to receive a single infusion of study medication consisting either of erythropoietin or placebo. The size of the infarction and the dimensions of the heart will be assessed by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) within 2-6 days of the infusion of the study medication, and again approximately 3 months later.</detailed_description>
