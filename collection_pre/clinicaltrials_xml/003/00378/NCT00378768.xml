	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Biological therapies, such as antithymocyte globulin, may stimulate the immune system in different ways and stop cancer cells from growing. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well antithymocyte globulin works in treating patients undergoing stem cell transplant for multiple myeloma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Antithymocyte Globulin in Treating Patients Undergoing Stem Cell Transplant for Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the response rate at 4 weeks in patients with multiple myeloma treated with anti-thymocyte globulin at least 4 to 6 weeks prior to undergoing conditioning therapy for allogeneic or autologous stem cell transplantation. Secondary - Determine the toxicity of this drug, in terms of formation of antirabbit antibodies, in these patients. OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study. Patients receive anti-thymocyte globulin IV over 6 hours on day 1 and over 4 hours on days 3 and 5. Treatment begins 4 to 6 weeks prior to undergoing conditioning therapy for autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplantation. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 28 days. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
