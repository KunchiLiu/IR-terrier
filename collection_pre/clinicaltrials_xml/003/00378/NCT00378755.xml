	<brief_summary>1. Primary Objective To assess the response rate of sequential VAD (Vincristine, Adriamycin, Dexamethasone) and VTD (Velcade, Thalidomide, Dexamethasone) induction therapy as a first line treatment for the patients with multiple myeloma 2. Secondary Objectives 1. To assess the progression free survival, duration of response, and overall survival of patients given sequential VAD and VTD induction followed by high dose therapy with autologous stem cell transplantation and maintenance treatment with Velcade 2. To assess the toxicities of sequential VAD and VTD induction chemotherapy, high dose therapy with autologous stem cell transplantation, and of maintenance treatment with Velcade.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1. Overview of study design This study aims to assess the efficacy and toxicities of sequential VAD and VTD induction followed by high dose therapy with autologous stem cell transplantation and maintenance treatment with velcade as a first line treatment for the patients with multiple myeloma. This study will be conducted as an open, multi-center, single arm, prospective phase 2 study. 2. Sample size determination The expected response rate of sequential VAD and VTD induction chemotherapy as a first line treatment for the patients with multiple myeloma is 80%. By using Flemming’s single stage design ( error: 0.05,  error : 0.2), 55 evaluable patients are needed to prove this hypothesis. If withdrawal rate is 10%, enrollment of total 62 patients will be needed. 3. Duration of the Study One year of enrollment will be needed (2006.03.1-2007.02.28). At least 24 months of follow-up for the patients who are to be enrolled last time is needed.</detailed_description>
