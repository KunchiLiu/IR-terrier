	<brief_summary>Patients scheduled for a tonsillectomy need postoperative pain treatment. Some of the most widely used postoperative analgetics (NSAIDs) sometimes cause rebleeding in the postoperative period, and another often used analgetic, morphine, causes nausea and vomiting. The researchers therefore will investigate new combinations of postoperative analgesics in hopes of improving pain and the need for opioids during the postoperative period.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Paracetamol, Pregabalin and Dexamethasone on Pain and Opioid Requirements in Patients Having a Tonsillectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We will investigate the effect of paracetamol versus paracetamol combined with pregabalin versus paracetamol combined with pregabalin and dexamethasone on pain and morphine requirements in the first 24 hours postoperatively. Outcomes include amount of morphine and ketobemidone used, and pain measured on a VAS scale. Side-effects, e.g., PONV, dizziness and sedation are also measured.</detailed_description>
