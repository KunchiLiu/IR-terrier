	<brief_summary>Over 80% of HIV-1 infected persons are also seropositive for HSV-2. Increasingly, clinical and epidemiologic evidence show the role of HSV in increasing HIV infectiousness. The evidence suggests that that HSV is an important cofactor in HIV transmission. The trial's purpose is to assess the reduction in HIV shedding associated with valacyclovir for suppression of HSV-2 reactivation. This proof-of-concept, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled crossover trial of 20 HIV/HSV-2 co-infected men, assessed the effects of daily valacyclovir on HIV-1 levels in the plasma and rectal mucosa secretions.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>HSV-2 Suppression to Reduce HIV-1 Levels in HIV-1, HSV-2 Co-infected Men.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) is common among HIV infected persons. HSV-2 reactivation is associated with increased plasma and genital HIV-1 levels, and in vitro, HSV-2 upregulates HIV transcription. The trial assessed whether HSV-2 suppression reduces rectal and plasma HIV-1 levels in HIV-1, HSV-2 co-infected men who have sex with men (MSM). Conducted in Lima Peru, 20 antiretroviral naive HIV-1 and HSV-2 seropositive MSM with CD4 &gt;200 were randomly assigned to receive valacyclovir 500 mg bid or placebo for 8 weeks, than a 2 week washout period, followed by the alternative regimen for 8 weeks. Men collected daily home anogenital swabs for HSV DNA PCR, had three weekly anoscopy procedures for collection of rectal mucosal secretions for HIV-1 RNA, HSV DNA, and weekly plasma HIV-1 RNA by PCR. Outcomes were plasma and rectal HIV-1 levels by study arm.</detailed_description>
