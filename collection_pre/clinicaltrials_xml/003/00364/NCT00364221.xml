	<brief_summary>The metabolic syndrome is a collection of health risks that includes obesity, high blood pressure, high triglycerides, high blood sugar, low good cholesterol, and resistance to insulin. The purpose of this study is to find out if the medication, rosiglitazone, influences levels of fat cell proteins and alters insulin resistance in nondiabetic persons with the metabolic syndrome. This is an early step to see if a medication, such as rosiglitazone, will be beneficial in people who have the metabolic syndrome.</brief_summary>
