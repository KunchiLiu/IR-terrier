	<brief_title>Effect of Rosuvastatin in Intracerebral Hemorrhage</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a frequent problem of health, with high morbid-mortality. In addition it originates expensive expenses in health care systems. ICH produces damage by mass effect, then by biochemical ways which are activated and they carry to secondary damage. Many studies have been conducted for explaining secondary injury, now we know there are ischemic changes related maybe with changes in cerebral flow and metabolism, in addition to activate inflammatory ways. Many drugs and measures has been ineffective for getting best outcome, without success. Statins or inhibitors of HMG CoA reductase are drugs used in dyslipidemia, frequently for reduction in LDL. Experimental and clinical studies in stroke and ICH have shown improvement in outcome. The toxicity related to statin is myopathy and hepatopathy, both with low incidence without fatal cases. Rosuvastatin has been postulated be the most powerful with longest life and toxicity similar to another statins. We have designed this study to demonstrate if the administration of rosuvastatin in the first 24 hours and by 14 days has improvement in outcome.</detailed_description>
