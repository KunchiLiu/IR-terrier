	<brief_title>Longitudinal Registry for Advanced Heart Failure Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This objectives of this observational registry are: to assess changes in patient quality of life as a function of medical management and disease progression as measured by the rate of death and rehospitalization, and assist with the optimization of heart failure (HF) management by providing information on the use of therapies proven to be effective and to describe practices of standard of care for chronic treatment of symptoms of HF outside the hospital and during hospitalization for acute episode with intravenous vasoactive medication (drugs which affect the blood vessels and muscle of the heart). Additional information which will be gathered include patient characteristics (age, sex, race, medical history, symptoms), infusion setting, type of medication, dose and frequency of medication and worsening of congestive heart failure disease. Participants in the study receive an unique patient-specific identifier and all available data will be analyzed. Observational Study - No investigational drug administered</detailed_description>
