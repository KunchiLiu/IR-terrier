	<brief_title>Probiotic Prophylaxis for Immunosuppressant Associated Diarrhea (IAD) Following Kidney Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Immunosuppression following organ transplantation is associated with a myriad of gastrointestinal complications including severe diarrhea. Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) is the immunosuppressant most often associated with this plaguing symptom. A retrospective study of patients from 10 US transplant centers receiving MMF immunosuppression after kidney transplantation showed that nearly 50% of patients suffered from at least one gastrointestinal symptom within the first 6 months after transplantation. (Tierce 2005) The majority of these patients have diarrhea. However, Immunosuppression Associated Diarrhea (IAD) is often observed in association with other immunosuppressive agents as well. It is the investigator's observation that IAD is equally problematic whether the immunosuppressive regimen includes MMF or not. When IAD is severe it can be difficult for the recipient to maintain adequate levels of immunosuppression. Not infrequently, IAD is so distressing that a recipient's immunosuppressive medications are tapered, changed or stopped. During these times of drug manipulation, patients are at risk for early acute rejection. Approximately 30% of renal transplant patients who have their MMF regimen adjusted or discontinued suffer an episode of acute rejection. Reversing a rejection episode is expensive and adds significant risks for the recipient and long-term allograft survival. Thus, a strategy to support and maintain normal healthy bowel function moderating or obviating IAD is highly desirable. Repopulation of the normal intestinal microflora in kidney transplant patients after kidney transplantation may maintain normal bowel function. This study is designed to test the hypothesis that the administration of a food supplement probiotic consisting of high amounts of six strains of lactic acid bacteria normally found in the human colon will favorably support and maintain bowel function moderating or obviating IAD.</detailed_description>
