	<brief_summary>An hematocrit of 21-25% is supposed to perform the best organ protection during cardiopulmonary bypass for cardiac surgery. The investigators want to establish the best timing for a transfusion (in patients with a predicted low hematocrit during cardiopulmonary bypass) and the efficacy of preprocedural hemodilution (in patients with a predicted high hematocrit during cardiopulmonary bypass) in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.</brief_summary>
