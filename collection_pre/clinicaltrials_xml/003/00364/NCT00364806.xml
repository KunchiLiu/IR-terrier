	<brief_title>A Clinical Trial Comparing Two Different Medications to Determine Which One is Better for Patients With an Acute Migraines in the Emergency Department</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One-third of the five million headache patients who present to US Emergency Departments (ED) annually have a migraine headache. The anti-emetic dopamine receptor antagonists have proven efficacy for migraines, are at least as well-tolerated as triptans, and enjoy wide-spread use in North American EDs. However, it is not yet clear which medication within this class and which dosage is optimal. Therefore, we propose a randomized clinical trial to compare the efficacy and tolerability of two standard medications for migraine. Specific Aim: To compare the efficacy of metoclopramide versus prochlorperazine for the emergency department treatment of migraine headaches. Both of these medications will be combined with diphenhydramine to prevent extra-pyramidal side effects. Patients will be enrolled as participants if they present to one of the participating EDs and consent to participate. Medications will be administered as an intravenous drip over 15 minutes. Rescue medication will be administered, if needed, after one hour. A follow-up phone call will be conducted 24 hours after the ED visit.</detailed_description>
