	<brief_title>Development of Gourmet Medical Cooking Workshop for Lifestyle Changing and Its Affect on Perimenopausal Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants will be randomly assigned to a dietary consultation-only control group or to a gourmet medical cooking workshop. The workshop will consist of 9 lessons with the following lessons: introduction, fats, phytoestrogens, carbohydrates and fibers, calcium and low calorie diet, party's recipes, shopping and farewell dinner. All the lessons will start with half an hour theoretical introduction, followed by a 2.5 hours "hands on" session under supervision of a medical chef. The study population will include healthy women attending the menopause clinic. 72 patients will be recruited and will be randomly divided into two groups: an intervention group of 36 will commence the workshop during 2007 and a control group of 36 who will take part in dietitian consulting sessions only. During 2008 the control group will commence the workshop and will add to the study group.</detailed_description>
