	<brief_summary>Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha has been strongly implicated as a major contributing factor for the development of radiculopathy. In animal studies, the application of TNF-alpha to nerve roots results in pain behavior indicative of radiculopathy. The use of TNF-alpha inhibitors (etanercept and infliximab) have been shown to prevent this pain behavior. Open-label studies in humans have shown both etanercept and infliximab provide excellent, long-term relief in patients with acute radiculopathy from herniated disc. However, a recent placebo-controlled study failed to demonstrate any significant difference from placebo. The investigators have already established the safety of neuraxial etanercept in a trial that has just been completed (not yet published). The objective of this study is to determine whether small doses of epidural etanercept, an anti-TNF-a medication, is an effective treatment for LBP caused by nerve root irritation (i.e., radiculopathy).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy of Epidural Etanercept in the Treatment of Sciatica</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>As per the wishes of the Dept. of the Army and Walter Reed Army Medical Center Dept. of Clinical Investigation, patients will be randomized in a 3:1 ratio to receive 2 transforaminal epidural etanercept or saline injections at 2-week intervals. Both patients and physicians will be blinded as to the injectate and treatment group. There will be 3 study groups. Group I will receive either 2 mg of etanercept or saline per injection. Group II will receive either 4 mg of etanercept or saline per injection. Group III will receive either 6 mg of etanercept or saline per injection. In each group there will be 8 patients: 6 who receive etanercept and 2 who receive saline. As per a previous study we just completed, etanercept doses will not be escalated until all 6 patients have completed their 1-month follow-up visits without any evidence of toxicity or complications.</detailed_description>
