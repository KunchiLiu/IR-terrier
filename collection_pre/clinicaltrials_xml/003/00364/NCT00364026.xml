	<brief_summary>This is a research study of a new experimental drug called darusentan. Darusentan is not currently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in the United States, which means that a doctor cannot prescribe this drug. The purpose of this study is to determine if darusentan is effective in reducing systolic blood pressure in subjects with resistant systolic hypertension, despite treatment with full doses of three or more blood pressure lowering drugs, including a diuretic.</brief_summary>
