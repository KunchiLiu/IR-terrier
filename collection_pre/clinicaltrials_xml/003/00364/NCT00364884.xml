	<brief_title>Keto-/Amino Acid Supplemented Low Protein Diet in Patients With Chronic Kidney Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fifty patients will be included into the study. The study comprises 9 visits. The treatment period covers 6 months, preceded by a 2-week screening period and a 1 month run-in period. Patients are required to visit the investigator two times before the start of active treatment. All patients who are qualified for this study will then be randomised by receiving their medication/introduction of dietary management using the standard simple randomization method.Group I patients will receive keto-/amino acid (Ketosteril) supplemented low protein diet during the active treatment period while Group II patients will receive non-supplemented low protein diet during the same period. The daily dose of keto-/amino acid for each Group I patient is one tablet every 5 kg body weight. The total daily dose will be divided into three times a day.</detailed_description>
