	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to obtain human heart tissue after treatment with Anginera to determine its effect on a variety of things that might indicate improvement in heart function. Patients who will have a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implanted while they wait for a donated heart will be treated with Anginera. At the time of heart transplant, their diseased heart which is removed will be analyzed by microscopic examination to see what effect Anginera had.</brief_summary>
