	<brief_summary>The long-term use of calcineurin inhibitors in the maintenance phase after kidney transplantation is associated with typical adverse effects, such as potential contribution to progressive impairment of renal function, hypertension, and metabolic abnormalities. This 15 month study with a safety follow up is undertaken to evaluate the potential benefit of an alternative treatment strategy to the chronic use of CNI. It will establish, through a comparative design, the superior protection of kidney function provided by chronic usage of basiliximab over tacrolimus early post-transplantation using EDC kidneys.</brief_summary>
