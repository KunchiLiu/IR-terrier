	<brief_title>B195: Effect of Diet-Induced Energy Deficit and Body Fat Reduction on Inflammatory Markers in Obese Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: Previous epidemiological studies have associated elevated levels of acute phase proteins, mainly C-reactive protein, with cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and cardiac death. Levels of several cy-tokines and acute phase proteins as CRP, haptoglobin and fibrinogen have been found associated with elevated body fat and the risk of diseases associated to the metabolic syndrome. Method: Thirty-six otherwise healthy obese subjects (BMI: 34.23.2 kg/m2, age: 43.410.5 y) participated in a 20-week controlled dietary intervention divided into 4 periods. Weight reduction was induced by an 8-week low caloric diet (LCD) (3.4 MJ/d) followed by a 4-week weight stable maintenance program (M1). Subsequently, they underwent another 4-week LCD (4.2 MJ/d) followed by a final 4-week weight stable maintenance diet (M2). Blood samples and anthropometrical measures were assessed at baseline and after each of the four periods (8, 12, 16 and 20 weeks).</detailed_description>
	<criteria>41 participants (20 men, 21 women) were included in the study.
