	<brief_title>Therapeutic Effect of Immunoadsorption for Patients With Lipoprotein Glomerulopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lipoprotein glomerulopathy is characterized by nephritic syndrome glomerular protein thrombi and lipid abnormalities, particularly with an elevated level of plasma apoprotein E (apoE).There are no efficiency way to treat lipoprotein glomerulopathy. We firstly successfully treat 2 patients by protein A immunoadsorption with remarkable decreased urine protein and reduction of lipoprotein thrombi on repeated renal biopsy.</detailed_description>
