	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the Binding Potential in subjects with ADHD and adults without ADHD: the intent being to demonstrate that C-11 Altropane PET can be used to differentiate adults with ADHD from healthy control subjects.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Open Label Phase I/II Study of the Safety and Dopamine Transporter Binding Properties of C-11 Altropane in Normal Human Subjects and in Subjects With ADHD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This protocol seeks to replicate and extend our investigation of DAT binding in adults with ADHD with specific aims: 1. To examine dopamine transporter (DAT) receptor binding potential in adults with ADHD, using PET scanning with 11C altropane as the ligand. We hypothesize that compared to adults without ADHD, adults with ADHD will have greater DAT binding that will not be accounted by psychiatric comorbidity or age. 2. To examine the relationship of DAT binding to clinical features of ADHD. We hypothesize that DAT binding will be positively correlated with a) severity of ADHD symptoms and b) neuropsychological and interpersonal dysfunction. 3. To examine the relationship between DAT binding and genetic risk factors. We hypothesize that DAT binding will be specifically associated with homozygosity of the DAT (480) gene in adults with ADHD and not with other ADHD-associated genetic markers (e.g., DRD4-7, D2, DBH).</detailed_description>

Subject must be off any investigational drug for at least 4 weeks prior to the start of the study. 7. Exposure to dopamine receptor antagonists, including stimulant medications (e.g. methylphenidate) or buproprion within the previous three (3) months to the start of the study. 8. Exposure to nonstimulant ADHD medications (e.g. atomoxetine) within the previous 4 weeks to the start of the study. 9. Exposure to radiopharmaceuticals within four (4) weeks prior to PET scan. 10. Subjects receiving psychotropic medication. 11. Any clinically significant abnormality in the screening laboratory tests, vital signs, or 12lead ECG, outside of normal limits. 12. Any woman of childbearing potential who is seeking to become pregnant or suspects that she may be pregnant. 13.
