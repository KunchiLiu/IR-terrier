	<brief_title>Changes in Brain Activity (Functional MRI Study) Before and After Behavioral Therapy of Height Phobia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of in vivo exposure therapy on the functional brain activity of subjects with height phobia using a fear provocation paradigm. We expect differential activation of the fear circuitry in height phobics compared to non-phobic controls, and that successful behavioral therapy will normalize the heightened fear response in height phobia.</detailed_description>
