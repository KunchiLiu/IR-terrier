	<brief_summary>Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is the most common inflammatory arthritis and a major health problem. The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and effectiveness of lovastatin for controlling inflammation in mildly active RA.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lovastatin for the Treatment of Mildly Active Rheumatoid Arthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>RA is characterized by persistent inflammation of peripheral joints, causing pain, stiffness, swelling, and warmth. The inflammation may cause progressive joint damage and destruction, resulting in deformity and loss of function. Both traditional and biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) have been prescribed for RA patients to control existing inflammatory symptoms and affect long-term prognosis. However, DMARD use is expensive, and the long-term safety of DMARDs is unknown. Lovastatin is an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (also known as a statin) used to lower levels of cholesterol and other fats in the blood. The purpose of this study is to examine the safety and efficacy of lovastatin in controlling inflammation in individuals with RA who have mildly active RA disease despite treatment. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two study arms (Experimental or Placebo). There will be four study visits over 12 weeks. At each visit, a physical exam, vital signs measurement, medication history, a pregnancy test (if applicable), and blood collection will occur. Additional safety blood testing will occur at Week 2. Tender and swollen joint counts and a Physician Global Assessment will occur at study entry and Week 12. Participants will also be asked to complete self-assessments at study entry and Week 12.</detailed_description>
