	<brief_title>Tacrolimus Treatment of Patients With Idiopathic Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary FSGS is a leading cause of end stage renal disease in adults, with complete loss of kidney function in 50% of patients over 10 years. Steroids, which are currently used to treat the disease, are effective in part of patients. Over the past decade, a number of studies have reported therapeutic efficacy for treatment with Cyclosporine-A (CSA) in patients with FSGS. Recent studies suggest that immunosuppressive therapy targeted against the calcineurin pathway of T-helper cells, for example, tacrolimus, may be effective in the treatment of primary FSGS. The experience with Tacrolimus (FK506) in the treatment of patients with FSGS has been limited to uncontrolled trials in adult patients.</detailed_description>
