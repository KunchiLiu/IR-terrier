	<brief_title>B181: Stimulation of Thermogenesis by Bio-Active Food Ingredients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: Long-term weight maintenance of a weight loss is often unsuccessful. Often a weight regain is observed in most studies that could indicate that most subjects are not able to change their eating habits. There is a need for simple and safe methods to prevent weight gain and re-gain i.e. by increasing thermogenesis and decrease spontaneous energy intake (EI). Studies have shown that nutritional and food-related non-nutritional factors influence the adjustment of EI and EE as the compounds can enhance the diet-induced thermogenesis (DIT) and suppress appetite. Method: The present study was designed as a 4-way crossover, randomised, placebo controlled, dou-ble-blind study. Each treatment was separated by &gt;3 d washout period. All treatments were administered as tablets containing either 500 mg green tea extract (whereof 125 mg cate-chins), 400 mg tyrosine, 50 mg anhydrous caffeine, or placebo. on each test day body weight and composition was assessed. All participants underwent a 4.5-h assessment of energy expenditure by indirect calorimetry in a ventilated hood. Energy intake recorded of an ad libitum pasta salad brunch served after the last hood measurement Subjects: Twelve healthy lean (20&lt;BMI&lt;25) weight stable non-smoking subjects between 18-40 years of age were tested 4 times each with a wash-out period of at least 3 days.</detailed_description>
