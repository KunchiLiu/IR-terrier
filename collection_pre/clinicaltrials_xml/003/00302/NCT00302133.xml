	<brief_title>Optimizing Pharmacotherapy for Bipolar Alcoholics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bipolar disorder has the highest rate of association with alcohol and other substance use disorders. This complex clinical presentation is asociated with severe disabilities,morbidity and heightened risk for suicide. There is a significant gap in our knowledge regarding effective treatment interventions for this high risk clinical population. This proposal will test the efficacy of a promising pharmacological approach for the treatment of comorbid alcohol dependence and bipolar disorder. We propose a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled 12-week trial to test the efficacy of valproate plus naltrexone vs. valproate alone in decreasing alcohol use and stabilizing mood symptoms among patients with comorbid alcohol dependence and bipolar disorder. All participants receive supportive psychosocial treatment.</detailed_description>
