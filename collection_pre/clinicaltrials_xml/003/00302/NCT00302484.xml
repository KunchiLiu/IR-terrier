	<brief_summary>Patients with a terminal chronic liver disease have a disordered bone metabolism resulting in a higher risk of falling ill with osteoporosis. Although liver transplantation restores liver function, immunosuppressive therapy (especially corticosteroids) after transplantation increases again the risk of osteoporosis and bone fragility. Zoledronate, a bisphosphonate, slows down the destruction of bone. The purpose of this study is to determine whether bisphosphonates are effective in the prevention of osteoporosis following immunosuppressive therapy after liver transplantation.</brief_summary>
