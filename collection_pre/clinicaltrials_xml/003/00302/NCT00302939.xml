	<brief_title>Etiology of Anemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is being done to determine if the range of causes of anemia changes with advancing age. The goal of this study is to apply research methods to see if causes of anemia can be determined in patients where a clear cause is not found with routine clinical testing available to all patients in physician offices. Participants in this study will be evaluated at the NIA-ASTRA unit at Harbor Hospital in Baltimore. Testing will consist of both diagnostic and research blood and urine testing along with history and physical exam. An optional bone marrow aspirate or aspirate and biopsy may be performed if the patient permits and it is indicated for either research or clinical diagnostic purposes. All study information supporting a specific diagnosis will be provided to the patient and, at their request, to their primary care physician if specific treatment is indicated.</detailed_description>
