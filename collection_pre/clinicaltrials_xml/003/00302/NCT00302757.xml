	<brief_summary>The study evaluates the additional use of radioimmunotherapy with a 90-Yttrium labeled monoclonal antibody targeting lymphoma cells in two dose reduced conditioning regimens for allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation from human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-identical donors. Radioimmunotherapy should allow an increased anti-lymphoma effect of the conditioning while the allogeneic grafts may confer potent graft versus lymphoma effects and rescue from potential hematopoietic side effects of the radioimmunotherapy. The study evaluates the feasibility and toxicity of such approach and will also analyze disease response and survival of the patients treated.</brief_summary>
