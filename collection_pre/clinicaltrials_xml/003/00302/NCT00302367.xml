	<brief_summary>The specific aim of this study is to document the pharmacokinetics of DAT receptor occupancy of OROS and immediate release (IR) MPH using PET scanning with C-11 altropane as the ligand. We hypothesize that the time to maximal receptor occupancy and the degree of receptor occupancy of immediate release (IR) MPH will be shorter and greater (respectively) than with an equipotent dose of OROS MPH.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Open Label Phase I/II Study of Dopamine Transporter Receptor Occupancy With OROS and Immediate Release Methylphenidate as Measured With C-11 Altropane in Human Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This protocol seeks to document the pharmacokinetics of DAT receptor occupancy of OROS and immediate release (IR) MPH using PET and C-11 altropane. The main target of MPH in the brain is the dopamine transporter (DAT). We have an exquisitely sensitive methodology to measure DAT occupancy using C-11 Altropane and Positron Emission Tomography (PET). This research will provide novel and unique information toward a better understanding of the mechanism of action of long-acting stimulant formulations to enable new drug development and an estimation of the relative abuse potential of the current formulation.</detailed_description>
