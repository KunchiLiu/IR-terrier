	<brief_summary>More than 1,000 obese people are screened for genetic mutations (MC4R). Those with positive screenings as well as 320 randomly selected people without MC4R mutations are randomized to 2 consultation types: one including recommendations for eating and physical activity behavior, the other with an additional part on genetic determinants and actions in obesity. It is hypothesized that obese people with obesity-specific genetic mutations, and obese people with a family history of obesity, benefit more if the consultation includes additional elements on genetic determinants.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of Consultation Including Genetic Aspects of Obesity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>More than 1,000 obese people are screened for genetic mutations (MC4R). Those with positive screenings as well as 320 randomly selected people without MC4R mutations are randomized to 2 consultation types: one including recommendations for eating and physical activity behavior, the other with an additional part on genetic determinants and actions in obesity. Their results are compared to a control group (n&gt;100). It is hypothesized that obese people with obesity-specific genetic mutations, and obese people with a family history of obesity, benefit more if the consultation includes additional elements on genetic determinants. The following variables are used: BMI, SCID interview for mental disorders, Stunkard's body silhouttes for participants and their parents and siblings, Restraint Eating Scale, PANAS, Well-being scale, body acceptance, shame and guilt, coping with obesity, participant's satisfaction with consultation. Assessment Points: before consultation, after consultation, 6 months later.</detailed_description>
