	<brief_summary>This phase II trial studies the side effects and how well sunitinib malate works in treating patients with cervical cancer which cannot be cured by standard therapy. Sunitinib malate may stop the growth of cervical cancer by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sunitinib Malate in Treating Patients With Uterine Cervical Cancer That is Stage IVB, Recurrent, or Cannot Be Removed By Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the efficacy (objective response rate) of sunitinib (sunitinib malate) given orally daily for 4 out of every 6 weeks in patients with unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic carcinoma of the cervix. II. To assess the toxicity of sunitinib in patients with unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic carcinoma of the cervix. III. To document time to progression, early objective progression rate, and, if objective responses are observed, response duration. OUTLINE: Patients receive sunitinib malate orally (PO) daily for 4 weeks. Treatment repeats every 6 weeks for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) may receive 2 courses after CR or PR is reached. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4 weeks and then every 3 months thereafter.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed squamous cell carcinoma or adenosquamous carcinoma of the cervix; patients with adenocarcinoma of the cervix will also be included since, although infrequent, their management in general is similar to those with squamous tumors Patients must have advanced (stage IVB) recurrent or persistent disease unsuitable for curative treatment by surgery and/or radiation therapy Presence of clinically and/or radiologically documented disease; at least one site of disease must be unidimensionally measurable as follows: Xray, physical exam &gt;= 20 mm Spiral computed tomography (CT) scan &gt;= 10 mm Nonspiral CT scan &gt;= 20 mm All radiology studies must be performed within 21 days prior to registration (within 28 days if negative) Patients must have a life expectancy of at least 12 weeks Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 or 1; performance status (PS) 2 patients are eligible if, in the opinion of the investigator, they are suitable for inclusion in the study and are likely to be compliant with the study procedures (in particular the recommendations for supportive care and dose modifications) Patients may have had neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy Patients may have had concurrent chemoradiation; this is not considered neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment Patients may have had no more than one prior chemotherapy regimen for recurrent metastatic disease; patients must be at least 28 days since last chemotherapy treatment and must have recovered from toxic effects Patients may have had prior radiation therapy, including external beam and/or intracavity radiation; a minimum of 28 days must have elapsed between the end of radiotherapy and registration onto the study; patients must have recovered from any acute toxic effects from radiation prior to registration; radiation must have involved &lt; 30% of functioning bone marrow and there must be measurable disease outside the previously irradiated area (patients whose sole site of disease is in a previously irradiated area are ineligible UNLESS there is evidence of progression, or new lesions have been documented, in the irradiated field) Previous major surgery is permitted provided that it has been at least 28 days prior to patient registration and that wound healing has occurred Granulocytes (AGC) &gt;= 1.5 x 10^9/L Platelets &gt;= 100 x 10^9/L Bilirubin =&lt; upper limit of normal (ULN) Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) =&lt; 2.5 x ULN Calcium =&lt; 3 mmol/L Serum creatinine =&lt; ULN or creatinine clearance &gt;= 60ml/min if creatinine is &gt; ULN; creatinine clearance to be measured directly by 24 hour urine sampling or as calculated by Cockcroft Formula Patient consent must be obtained according to local institutional and/or University Human Experimentation Committee requirements; it will be the responsibility of the local participating investigators to obtain the necessary local clearance, and to indicate in writing to the National Cancer Institute of Canada (NCIC) Clinical Trials Group (CTG) study coordinator that such clearance has been obtained, before the trial can commence in that center; because of differing requirements, a standard consent form for the trial will not be provided; a copy of the initial full board Research Ethics Board (REB) approval and approved consent form must be sent to the central office; the patient must sign the consent form prior to randomization or registration; please note that the consent form for this study must contain a statement which gives permission for the NCIC CTG and monitoring agencies to review patient records Patients must be accessible for treatment, response assessment and followup; patients registered on this trial must be treated and followed at the participating center; this implies there must be reasonable geographical limits (for example: 1 Â½ hour's driving distance) placed on patients being considered for this trial; investigators must assure themselves the patients registered on this trial will be available for complete documentation of the treatment, adverse events, and followup In accordance with NCIC CTG policy, protocol treatment is to begin within 2 working days of patient registration; exceptions may be made however, regarding the washout period timing for prohibited medications History of other malignancies, except: adequately treated nonmelanoma skin cancer or other solid tumors curatively treated with no evidence of disease for &gt;= 5 years Patients with known brain metastases; (a head CT is not necessary to rule out brain metastases, unless there is clinical suspicion of central nervous system [CNS] involvement); patients with known brain metastases will be excluded from this trial due to their poor prognosis and their likelihood of developing progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to sunitinib Patients receiving concurrent treatment with other anticancer therapy or other investigational anticancer agents Patients who have received prior treatment with any other antiangiogenic agent or multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors (e.g., bevacizumab, sorafenib, pazopanib, thalidomide, AZD2171, AZD6474, AMG706, PTK787, vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF] Trap, etc.) are ineligible Corrected QT (QTc) prolongation (defined as a QTc interval equal to or greater than 500 msec) or other significant electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities;
