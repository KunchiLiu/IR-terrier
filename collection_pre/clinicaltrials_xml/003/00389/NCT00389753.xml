	<brief_title>Aruba Aloë Formula F-BC-096 in the Treatment of Split Thickness Donor Sites After Wound Closure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with two equal donor sites will be selected for inclusion. After wound healing one donor site will be treated with Aruba Aloë Formula F-BC-096 while a control product will be applied to the second site. If pressure garments are applied they must be equal for both donor sites. During follow-ups objective methods will be used to evaluate elasticity and colour of the scar.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Patients must have two similar donor sites, identical in depth and wound treatment. Healing time of both donor sites may differ by 3 days maximum. Flux values determined by Laser Doppler Imaging before commencement of the therapy must be approximately similar. If possible, the donor sites to be compared must have the same location. Patient compliance with therapy in relation to the protocol is necessary. In case of pediatric patiënts this depends on collaboration of the parents. For the two donor sites to be compared, the entire aftertreatment concerning pressure garments or eventual silicone sheets must be equal for both donor sites. Patients must be available for regular and necessary followup. Possibility to finish all measurements during followup visits. Written authorisation of the patient, family or parents is required. Donor sites are not similar (not identical in: depth, wound treatment, healing time and flux values) Children requiring sedation for LDI of donor sites Not following the complete treatment schedule or missing some evaluations during the followup period Patient has any condition(s) that seriously compromises the patient's ability to complete this study. Patient has participated in another study utilizing an investigational drug or device within the previous 30 days Patient has one or more medical condition(s), diabetes, including renal, hepatic, hematologic, neurologic, or immune disease that in the opinion of the investigator would make the patient an inappropriate candidate for this study Patients wish to terminate the study No informed consent before start of the trial</criteria>
