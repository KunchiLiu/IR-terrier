	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Vaccines made from gene-modified tumor cells may help the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells. Giving booster vaccinations may make a stronger immune response and prevent or delay the recurrence of pancreatic cancer. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects and how well vaccine therapy works in treating patients with pancreatic cancer that has been removed by surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy in Treating Patients With Pancreatic Cancer That Has Been Removed by Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the safety of primary and boost vaccinations with lethally irradiated allogeneic pancreatic tumor cells transfected with sargramostim (GM-CSF) gene vaccine in patients with surgically resected adenocarcinoma of the head, neck, or uncinate of the pancreas. Secondary - Correlate specific in vivo parameters of immune response (e.g., mesothelin, prostate stem cell antigen, and mutated k-ras-specific T-cell responses) with clinical response in patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the efficacy, in terms of overall and recurrence-free survival, of this regimen in these patients. - Correlate serum GM-CSF levels with longevity of an allogeneic vaccine after semi-annual boosting in these patients. - Determine the psychosocial (e.g., demographics, quality of life, hope, trust, social support, decision control, and advanced directives) and symptom (e.g., pain, anorexia, fatigue, and mood state) profiles in these patients and explore changes over time. OUTLINE: This is a open-label study. Patients are stratified according to prior vaccination with allogeneic sargramostim (GM-CSF)-secreting pancreatic tumor cell vaccine (yes [stratum I] vs no [stratum II]). - Stratum I: Patients receive booster vaccination comprising allogeneic GM-CSF plasmid DNA pancreatic tumor cell vaccine subcutaneously (SC). Treatment repeats every 6 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. - Stratum II: Patients receive priming vaccinations SC once a month for 3 months and then receive booster vaccinations as in stratum I. Patients complete self-reported psychosocial (including quality of life, hope, and trust) and symptom (including pain, fatigue, anorexia, and mood) questionnaires at day 0 and day 28. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at day 28 and then annually for 15 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 100 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
