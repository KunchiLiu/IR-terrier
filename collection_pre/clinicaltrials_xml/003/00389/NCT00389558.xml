	<brief_summary>The purposes of the study are: 1. To compare the local efficacy (skin colonization) of 2 commercialized antiseptics used for the disinfection of the dressing application for an epicutaneocavous catheter (EPI). 2. To evaluate whether the bacteria responsible for nosocomial infection is comparable to the flora diagnosed at the EPI site.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Antiseptic Use and Dressing Application</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Epicutaneocavous catheter is a significant risk factor for nosocomial infection in newborn infants. These infections have been related to local bacterial colonisation. Therefore thorough disinfection should lower the risk of nosocomial infection. However, the local efficacy of antiseptic use has not yet been clearly evaluated in this situation.</detailed_description>
