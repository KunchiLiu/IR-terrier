	<brief_summary>Interstitial cystitis (also called painful bladder syndrome, or chronic pelvic pain syndrome) is a common condition with no known cure. Twin studies and family accounts have suggested that the condition may be genetic and passed down (or inherited) from one generation to the next. In this study, we are collecting genetic material and medical information from families in North America in an attempt to identify genetic factors that may cause Interstitial Cystitis. We are enrolling families and individuals with IC/PBS/CPPS and their family members (both family members with and without IC like symptoms).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Genetic Studies in Interstitial Cystitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To fully describe the phenotype of interstitial cystitis (IC)/painful bladder syndrome (PBS)/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CPPS), in adults and children, and to correlate the phenotypic information to the genotypic findings utilizing linkage analysis and candidate gene studies. A North American cohort and a Bulgarian cohort will be recruited. Both individuals and families with IC/PBS/CPPS symptoms will be recruited to give a DNA (from saliva) and urine sample.</detailed_description>
