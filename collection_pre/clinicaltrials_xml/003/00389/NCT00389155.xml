	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to test an investigational drug, vinflunine (BMS-710485), in combination with gemcitabine in patients with Transitional Cell Carcinoma who cannot be treated with cisplatin. This study will help to determine whether vinflunine in combination with gemcitabine will extend the time period until further growth of the tumor more than gemcitabine alone.</brief_summary>
