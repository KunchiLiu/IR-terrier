	<detailed_description>Overweight and obesity affect over 15 million adult women in the United States. Postpartum weight retention has been shown to be one factor contributing to weight retention, obesity and possible development of type 2 diabetes. African-American women and other minority women are at especially high risk for the development of obesity and type 2 diabetes. We propose to pilot a six-month postpartum-specific lifestyle intervention among urban-based, postpartum African-American women.</detailed_description>
