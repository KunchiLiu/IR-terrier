	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Stereotactic radiation therapy can send x-rays directly to the tumor and cause less damage to normal tissue. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. It is not yet known whether stereotactic radiation therapy is more effective with or without whole-brain radiation therapy in treating patients with brain metastases. PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying stereotactic radiation therapy and whole-brain radiation therapy to see how well they work compared with stereotactic radiation therapy alone in treating patients with brain metastases.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Stereotactic Radiation Therapy With or Without Whole-Brain Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Brain Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Compare the overall survival of patients with 1 to 3 cerebral metastases treated with stereotactic radiosurgery with vs without whole-brain radiotherapy. Secondary - Compare time to CNS (brain) failure in patients treated with these regimens. - Compare quality of life, duration of functional independence, and long-term neurocognitive status of patients treated with these regimens. - Compare post-treatment toxicity in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to age (18 to 59 vs 60 and over), extracranial disease (controlled for â‰¤ 3 months vs controlled for &gt; 3 months), and number of brain metastases (1 vs 2 vs 3). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients undergo stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). - Arm II: Patients undergo SRS as in arm I. Within 14 days, patients then undergo whole-brain radiotherapy 5 days a week for 2.5 weeks. Quality of life, functional independence, and neurocognitive status are assessed at baseline, at the beginning of each treatment, at weeks 6 and 12, and then at 6, 9, 12, 16, 24 , 36, 48, and 60 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 238 patients will be accrued for this protocol.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Diagnosis of cerebral metastases meeting the following criteria: One to three presumed brain metastases Metastases must be from a histologically confirmed extracerebral site (e.g., lung, breast, prostate) Histologic confirmation may have been from the primary tumor site, from another metastatic site (e.g., osseous metastasis, adrenal metastasis), or from the metastatic brain lesion(s) Each lesion must measure less than 3.0 cm by contrast MRI of the brain performed within the past 21 days Lesions must not be within 5 mm of the optic chiasm or within the brainstem Eligibility for treatment with gamma knife or linear acceleratorbased radiosurgery confirmed by a radiation oncologist No primary germ cell tumor, small cell carcinoma, or lymphoma No leptomeningeal metastases Hormone receptor status not specified PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Male or female Menopausal status not specified ECOG performance status 02 Not pregnant Negative pregnancy test Fertile patients must use effective contraception Male patients must continue to use contraception for 3 months after the completion of radiotherapy No pacemaker or other MRIincompatible metal in the body No known allergy to gadolinium PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: More than 7 days since prior and no concurrent chemotherapy No prior cranial radiotherapy No prior resection of cerebral metastases Concurrent hormonal agents, steroids, and/or anticonvulsants allowed</criteria>
