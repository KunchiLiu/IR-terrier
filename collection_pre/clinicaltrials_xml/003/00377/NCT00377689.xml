	<brief_title>Evaluation of an Intervention Program Targeted at Improving Balance and Functional Skills After Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Many people with stroke experience a deterioration in balance and a functional decline due to hemiplegic muscle strength. This tend to restrict the persons activity in daily life and also leads to a low falls self efficacy. High intensity exercise have shown to be effective for improving strength and balance for older people in general living in residential care facilities. It is interesting to see if this high intensity exercise also is applicable in the older stroke population. Comparison: An intervention group receives three training sessions per week and one theory session per week during 5 weeks, compared to a control group that receives one theory session per week during 5 weeks.</detailed_description>
