	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy Study of Catumaxomab to Treat Ovarian Cancer After a Complete Response to Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A multi-center, phase II study of catumaxomab in ovarian cancer patients who experience a complete response to chemotherapy. Each eligible patient will receive four ascending doses of catumaxomab, administered intraperitoneally via an indwelling catheter or port. Catumaxomab will be administered as a 3-hour constant rate infusion with a dosing interval of 3-4 days. Each patient will participate in this study for up to 4 months (includes the baseline screening period, 11 to 21 days treatment period, and up to 90 days/3 months follow-up), with post-study follow-up every 3 months for 2 years. Catumaxomab is a trifunctional antibody targeting epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) on tumor cells and CD3 (cluster of differentiation 3) on T cells. Trifunctional antibodies represent a new concept for targeted anticancer therapy. This new antibody class has the capability to redirect T cells and accessory cells (e.g. macrophages, dendritic cells [DCs] and natural killer [NK] cells) to the tumor site. According to preclinical data, trifunctional antibodies activate these different immune effector cells, which can trigger a complex anti-tumor immune response.</detailed_description>
