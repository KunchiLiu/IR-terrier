	<brief_summary>Aim Primary percutaneous coronary intervention efficacy improvement by DIVER CE thrombectomy system leading to thrombus reduction. Study design: Multicenter, prospective, opened, randomized. Primary endpoints: ST resolution &gt;70% 60 minutes after PCI Secondary endpoints: Thrombectomy system efficacy/passing trough lesion with thrombus reduction according do TIMI thrombus scale ≥ 1 TIMI 3 flow after PCI MBG 3 CMR – infarct size, measurement of left ventricular end-diastolic EDV and end-systolic volumes ESV and ejection fraction (EF) ECHO: measurement of left ventricular end-diastolic EDV and end-systolic volumes ESV, ejection fraction (EF) and wall motion score index (WMSI) Major cardiac events /cardiac death, reMI, rePCI (TVR, TLR, non infarct involved vessel) or CABG/ 6 month follow up Rate of composite angiographic adverse events including: distal embolisation, transient no-reflow or slow flow, final TIMI &lt;3, need of bail out GpIIb/IIIa inhibitors or adenosine or nitroprosside, final thrombus score &gt;1</brief_summary>
