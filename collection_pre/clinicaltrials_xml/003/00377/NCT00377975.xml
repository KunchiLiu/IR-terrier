	<brief_summary>This study compares four treatments to see which one causes the most weight loss, fat loss, loss of abdominal fat and improvement in blood tests like cholesterol. The four treatments are: Placebo, Ephedrine plus caffeine, Pioglitazone, Combined pioglitazone and ephedrine plus caffeine</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>"Pecos" B-adrenergic and PPAR-G Stimulation Upregulates Lipid Metabolism in Human Subcutaneous Fat</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The sympathetic nervous system, via the intracellular messenger cAMP and MAPK activation, and thiazolidinediones via PPARÎ³ control lipid metabolism have been implicated in body weight regulation. The present study was undertaken to determine whether the simultaneous activation of these two signaling systems might synergize to exert beneficial effects on the expression of key genes involved in lipid metabolism and mitochondrial biogenesis in subcutaneous fat in healthy, non-diabetic subjects. Fifty seven non-diabetic women and men were randomized into four groups: 1) placebo/placebo (PP); 2) ephedrine plus caffeine/placebo (ECP); 3) placebo/pioglitazone (PPio); 4) ephedrine plus caffeine/pioglitazone (ECPio). Adipose tissue samples were obtained after 12 weeks of treatment to determine gene expression by real time RT-PCR.</detailed_description>
