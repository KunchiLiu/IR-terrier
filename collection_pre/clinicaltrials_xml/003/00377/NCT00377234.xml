	<brief_summary>This 2 arm crossover study will evaluate patient reported preference for either once monthly Boniva (150mg p.o.) or once weekly risedronate (35mg p.o.). Patients with post-menopausal osteoporosis will be randomized to receive Boniva for 3 calendar months or risedronate for 12 weeks; they will then cross over to receive the alternative treatment for a further 12 weeks/3 months. The anticipated time on study treatment is 3-12 months, and the target sample size is 100-500 individuals.</brief_summary>
