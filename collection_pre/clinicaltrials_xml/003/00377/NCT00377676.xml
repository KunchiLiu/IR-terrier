	<brief_summary>Cycloset, a new quick-release oral formulation of bromocriptine mesylate, effectively reduces blood sugar by the proposed mechanism of reversing many of the metabolic alterations associated with insulin resistance and obesity by resetting central (hypothalamic) circadian organization of monoamine neuronal activities. The primary analysis of this study will test the hypothesis that the rate of all-cause severe adverse events for those receiving usual drug therapy for diabetes management plus Cycloset is not greater than that for usual drug therapy plus placebo by more than an acceptable margin. While the primary purpose of this study is to establish the safety profile of Cycloset in type 2 diabetes, any potential positive cardiovascular benefits will be evaluated as well.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Tolerability Study of Cycloset in Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bromocriptine mesylate, an ergot derivative, is a sympatholytic dopamine D2 receptor agonist that can exert inhibitory effects on serotonin turnover in the central nervous system. It has been proposed that bromocriptine can reverse many of the metabolic alterations associated with insulin resistance and obesity by resetting central (hypothalamic) circadian organization of monoamine neuronal activities. While Cycloset has demonstrated efficacy by reducing HbA1c, fasting and post-prandial glucose and fasting and post-prandial triglycerides, the relatively small numbers of individuals treated for type 2 diabetes during the controlled Phase III clinical trials of Cycloset did not allow for a full evaluation of the safety profile. Since persons with diabetes are already at higher risk for cardiovascular disease, it is important to examine more fully the spectrum of potential adverse or positive effects from Cycloset in a large sample of persons with diabetes. Accordingly, the present study is designed to investigate the clinical safety of treatment with Cycloset in a broad population of persons with type 2 diabetes. To determine in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus receiving Usual Diabetes Therapy (UDT) consisting of either diet, oral hypoglycemic agents (OHA) (no more than 2), or insulin (with or without no more than 1 OHA) plus either Placebo or Cycloset: 1. Whether add-on therapy with Cycloset results in all-cause rate of serious adverse events, which are not higher than add-on therapy with Placebo. 2. Whether add-on therapy with Cycloset results in disease-specific rate of serious cardiovascular adverse events, which are not higher than add-on therapy with Placebo. While the primary purpose of this study is to establish the safety profile of Cycloset in type 2 diabetes, any potential positive cardiovascular benefits will be evaluated as well. Other clinical measures: 3. The impact (either positive or negative) of Cycloset on HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose, weight, triglycerides lipids, blood pressure and patient tolerability after 12 months of therapy. Furthermore, Hba1c changes from baseline to 24 weeks between Cycloset and Placebo among subjects with a baseline Hba1c of &gt;= 7.5% among the following subgroups: A. Treated at baseline with any Oral hypoglycemic agent (OHA) including injectable insulin secretagogues B. Metformin plus or minus one OHA or injectable insulin secretagogue C. Sulphonylurea plus or minus one OHA or injectable insulin secretagogue D. Treated at baseline with Metformin and one sulphonylurea</detailed_description>

Subject who had received any experimental drug or used an experimental device in the 30 days prior to the first screening visit or would do so during the study. Subject who was pregnant or lactating women or women planning to become pregnant during the study. Women of childbearing potential had to have a negative pregnancy test at screening. Women who became pregnant were discontinued from the study. Subject who had given donations of blood during the 30 days prior to the screening visit. Donation of blood also was prohibited during the study and for 30 days after completion of the study.
