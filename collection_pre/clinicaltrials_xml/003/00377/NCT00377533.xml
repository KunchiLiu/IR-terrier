	<brief_summary>Currently available wheelchairs are often fitted with conventional rear anti-tip devices (C-RADs) to prevent wheelchair rear tips. The limitations of C-RADs have provided an incentive for the design of rear anti-tip devices that permit more rear tip without compromising safety (Arc-RADs). The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that caregivers handling occupied wheelchairs equipped with Arc-RADs have higher success rates on RAD-relevant skills than caregivers handling wheelchairs equipped with C-RADs.</brief_summary>
