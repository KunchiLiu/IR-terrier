	<brief_summary>This study will assess the relative bioavailability of ganciclovir from the pro-drug valganciclovir in lung transplant recipients with or without cystic fibrosis. Each patient will receive 900mg valganciclovir daily for the period specified at their center, starting as soon as possible after the transplant. Pharmacokinetic assessments will be made provided that steady-state kinetics of ganciclovir and immunosuppressive drugs have been obtained (&gt;=4 days of drug therapy). Blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis will be taken up to 24h post-dose on one occasion. The anticipated time on study treatment is 3-12 months, and the target sample size is &lt;100 individuals.</brief_summary>
