	<brief_title>Stress Management Therapy in Patients Receiving Chemotherapy for Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine if a self-administered stress management intervention is effective in improving quality of life and decreasing psychological distress (anxiety and depression) in Hispanic and non-Hispanic patients receiving cancer chemotherapy. Secondary - Determine if the degree of acculturation in Hispanics influences the observed helpfulness of the intervention. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to participating center, use of psychotropic drugs (yes vs no), and ethnicity (Hispanic vs non-Hispanic). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms. - Arm I (self-administered stress management training plus usual psychosocial care): Patients receive a video DVD, audio CD, and brochure that provides information and instruction in 3 stress management training techniques (progressive muscle relaxation training and guided imagery, abdominal breathing, and coping skills training) to use during chemotherapy. Patients also receive usual psychosocial care. - Arm II (usual psychosocial care only): Patients receive usual psychosocial care. Patients complete questionnaires to assess mood, quality of life, and other factors at baseline and before chemotherapy courses 2, 3, and 4. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 442 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
