	<brief_summary>Chronic achilles tendinopathy is a common disease especially in adults. The golden standard in treatment has up to now been excentric exercises but with varying success. A new hypothesis is that this chronic pain is due to neo vascularisation. In a pilot study sclerosing injections with polidocanol have had a successful efficacy. Our aim is to study the efficacy of polidocanol as a treatment in a randomised controlled setting on a larger scale.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Efficacy of Polidocanol Injections as a Treatment of Chronic Achilles. Tendinopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>48 patients with chronic achilles tendinopathy for more than 3 months who have tried excentric exercises without success will be randomised to either polidocanol or lidocaine injections if having ultrasound verified neo-vascularisation.</detailed_description>
