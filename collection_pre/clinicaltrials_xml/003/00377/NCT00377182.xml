	<brief_summary>This 4 arm study will compare the safety and tolerability of HCV polymerase inhibitor pro-drug in combination with PEGASYS +/- COPEGUS with the standard of care therapy of PEGASYS + COPEGUS, in treatment-naive patients with CHC, genotype 1. Patients will be randomized to receive 1500mg or 3000mg po bid of HCV polymerase inhibitor pro-drug + PEGASYS, 1500mg of HCV polymerase inhibitor pro-drug + PEGASYS + COPEGUS or PEGASYS + COPEGUS for 4 weeks. All patients who receive at least one dose of study medication will receive open label PEGASYS + Copegus for an additional 44 weeks after the 4 week experimental period. The anticipated time on study treatment is 3-12 months, and the target sample size is &lt;100 individuals.</brief_summary>
