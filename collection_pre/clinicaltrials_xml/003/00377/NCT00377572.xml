	<brief_title>Inner-City Anti-IgE Therapy for Asthma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is testing a medication called omalizumab for the treatment of asthma. Immunoglobulin E (IgE) is produced when one is exposed to allergens and it can cause inflammation in the lungs. Omalizumab can reduce inflammation and asthma attacks by blocking IgE. Unlike other medications for asthma, omalizumab is not an inhaler medication or pill. Instead, omalizumab is dissolved in a liquid and given by injection. Studies indicate that people living in the inner-city areas are more likely to be exposed to indoor allergens that are difficult to avoid than people living in other areas. The purpose of this study is to find out if adding omalizumab to standard asthma treatment results in a safer, more effective, and longer lasting asthma treatment strategy than standard treatment alone. This study will recruit inner-city children and adolescents with moderate to severe allergic asthma. This study will last about 1.5 to 2 years. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either omalizumab or placebo injections once every 2 or 4 weeks. The injection schedule will be determined based on the participant's weight and total IgE. Both groups will receive standardized specialist care and basic asthma education including environmental control measures. Participants must have some form of health care insurance to cover the costs of asthma controller medications prescribed during the study. Participants will complete a series of questionnaires about topics including perceived stress, home environment, physical activity, diet and nutrition, smoking habits, and quality of life. At study entry and monthly throughout the study, participants will complete questionnaires about their asthma symptoms and medical resource utilization. Some visits will include a physical examination, vital signs measurement, lung function tests, asthma medication evaluation, and an asthma action plan. Blood collection is required up to eight times during the study for safety labs.</detailed_description>
