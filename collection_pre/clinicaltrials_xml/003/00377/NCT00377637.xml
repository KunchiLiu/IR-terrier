	<brief_summary>This 2 arm study assessed the efficacy of Mycophenolate Mofetil (MMF; CellCept) compared to cyclophosphamide in inducing a response in patients with lupus nephritis, and the long term efficacy of MMF compared to azathioprine in maintaining remission and renal function. Patients were randomized to receive either MMF (1.5 g twice daily [bid]) or cyclophosphamide (0.5-1.0 g/m^2 in monthly pulses) in the induction phase. Those patients meeting criteria for response were re-randomized for entry into the maintenance phase, to receive either MMF (1 g bid) or azathioprine (2 mg/kg/day).</brief_summary>
