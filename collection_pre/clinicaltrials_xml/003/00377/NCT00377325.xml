	<brief_title>The Effectiveness of Lower Cyclosporine Doses for Psoriasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease. It is believed to be caused by an overactive immune system that speeds the growth of skin cells. This abnormal skin growth results in patches of inflamed skin, which can itch, crack, and bleed. Cyclosporine is an immunosuppressant drug that is used in more severe cases of psoriasis to slow down the growth of skin cells. However, cyclosporine use is associated with several side effects, including kidney damage, high blood pressure, and skin sensitivity. This study will evaluate whether lower doses of cyclosporine can cause fewer side effects and still produce the same beneficial results that are seen with the standard administration of cyclosporine. Participants in this study will receive treatment with cyclosporine for up to 30 weeks. Study visits will occur every 2 weeks and will include a physical exam, a psoriasis symptom evaluation, blood collection, and various questionnaires on quality-of-life issues. Participants will be followed for 2 years.</detailed_description>
