	<brief_summary>Primary objective: to assess the effect of AVE1625 on weight loss over a period of 24 weeks in abdominally obese patients with atherogenic dyslipidemia. Secondary objectives: - To assess the dose effect relationship of AVE1625 on HDL-cholesterol and triglycerides plasma levels over a period of 24 weeks - To assess the efficacy of AVE1625 on secondary parameters such as waist circumference and other metabolic parameters over a period of 24 weeks - To assess the safety and tolerabillity of AVE1625 over a period of 24 weeks.</brief_summary>
