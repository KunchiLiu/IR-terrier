	<brief_title>A Comparison of Three Different Formulations of Prednisolone Acetate 1%</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Overall Study Design: Structure: This is a randomized, double-masked prospective study. The study medications will be masked and randomized by the outpatient pharmacy at Indiana University Hospital. Duration: Treatment duration: The duration of each subject's participation will be for up to 2 months after surgery. One hundred and two subjects will be enrolled over a twelve-month time span. Controls: Examiner, staff, and subjects are masked. Parallel group comparison. Dosage/Dose Regimen/Instructions: Subjects scheduled for glaucoma and/or cataract surgery will be recruited. Subjects may not be currently on any steroid or ophthalmic non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) therapy for a minimum of 6 weeks prior to surgery. Subjects will be randomized to receive a dose of Pred Forte 1% (Allergan), Econopred Plus 1% (Alcon) or prednisolone acetate 1% (Falcon) four times a day starting immediately after finishing the surgery for two weeks, then twice a day for two more weeks. After 1 month of therapy subjects will stop or continue steroid treatment based on clinical findings. No other subconjunctival steroid or ointment will be used intra-operatively or post-operatively. The eye drop will be instilled per labeling instructions.</detailed_description>
