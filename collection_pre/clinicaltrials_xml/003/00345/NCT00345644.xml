	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to compare risedronate 35 mg and placebo with respect to the percent change at 12 months for distal radius trabecular bone volume (BV/TV) in osteopenic postmenopausal women, as measured by three-dimensional peripheral quantitative computed tomography (3D pQCT). The secondary objectives are to compare the percent change from Screening/Baseline between the 2 treatment groups for the following measurements: - Bone mineral density of the lumbar spine, femoral neck, femoral trochanter, and total proximal femur using a dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan at 12 and 24 months; - 3D pQCT analysis of distal radius and distal tibia bone microarchitecture data at 6, 12, and 24 months; and - Bone turnover markers (BTMs) of: - fasting serum carboxyterminal cross linking telopeptide of type 1 bone collagen (CTX 1); - serum aminoterminal propeptide of type 1 procollagen (PINP); and - urine N-telopeptide cross-links (NTX) at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months.</brief_summary>
