	<brief_summary>Cystic fibrosis(CF) is an inherited disease affecting children, adolescents and young adults with dysfunction of secretory glands.It is caused by mutations in the protein-coding gene which function as the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR), responsible for the secretion of chloride ions in epithelial cells, adenocytes, sweat gland cells, pancreatic ducts,alimentary and respiratory tracts and eye. Assessment of the relationship between the inflammatory processes and apoptosis in the eye in the course of cystic fibrosis will allow determination of immunological exponents which may facilitate diagnosis.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The aim: To assess the role of chosen parameters of immunological response in the induction of ocular changes in cystic fibrosis patients, particularly chosen chemokine concentrations in the tear fluid and analysis of chosen apoptotic markers expression on conjunctival epithelial cells.</detailed_description>
