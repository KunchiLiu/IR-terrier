	<brief_summary>This is a Phase II, open-label, multicenter, randomized, non comparative study consisting of two concurrent single-arms. Approximately 160 subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to Arm 1 (bevacizumab alone) or Arm 2 (bevacizumab + irinotecan).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Signed Informed Consent Form Age ≥ 18 years Histologically confirmed GBM in first or second relapse Radiographic demonstration of disease progression following prior therapy Bidimensionally measurable disease with a minimum measurement of 1 cm (10 mm) in one diameter on MRI performed within 14 days prior to first treatment (Day 0) An interval of ≥ 4 weeks since prior surgical resection Prior standard radiation for GBM Prior chemotherapy: firstrelapse subjects Prior chemotherapy: secondrelapse subjects Recovery from the effects of prior therapy, including the following: 4 weeks from cytotoxic agents (except 6 weeks from nitrosoureas, 3 weeks from procarbazine, 2 weeks from vincristine); 4 weeks from any investigational agent; 1 week from noncytotoxic agents; 8 weeks from radiotherapy to minimize the potential for MRI changes related to radiation necrosis that might be misdiagnosed as progression of disease, or 4 weeks if a new lesion, relative to the preradiation MRI, develops that is outside the primary radiation field Prior therapy with gamma knife or other focal highdose radiation is allowed but the subject must have subsequent histologic documentation of recurrence, unless the recurrence is a new lesion outside the irradiated field Karnofsky performance status ≥ 70 Life expectancy &gt; 12 weeks Use of an effective means of contraception in males and in females of childbearing potential Ability to comply with study and followup procedures Prior treatment with irinotecan, bevacizumab, or another VEGF or VEGFRtargeted agent Prior treatment with prolifeprospan 20 with carmustine wafer Prior intracerebral agents Need for urgent palliative intervention for primary disease (e.g., impending herniation) Evidence of recent hemorrhage on baseline MRI of the brain with the following exceptions: Presence of hemosiderin; Resolving hemorrhagic changes related to surgery; Presence of punctate hemorrhage in the tumor Received more than two treatment regimens for Grade III and/or Grade IV glioma Blood pressure of &gt; 150 mmHg systolic and &gt; 100 mmHg diastolic History of hypertensive encephalopathy New York Heart Association (NYHA) Grade II or greater CHF History of myocardial infarction or unstable angina within 6 months prior to Day 0 History of stroke or transient ischemic attack within 6 months prior to study enrollment Significant vascular disease (e.g., aortic aneurysm, aortic dissection) or recent peripheral arterial thrombosis within 6 months prior to Day 0 Evidence of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy History of abdominal fistula, gastrointestinal perforation, or intraabdominal abscess within 6 months prior to Day 0 History of intracerebral abscess within 6 months prior to Day 0 Major surgical procedure, open biopsy, or significant traumatic injury within 28 days prior to Day 0, anticipation of need for major surgical procedure during the course of the study Minor surgical procedures (excluding placement of a vascular access device), stereotactic biopsy, fine needle aspirations, or core biopsies within 7 days prior to Day 0 Serious nonhealing wound, ulcer, or bone fracture Pregnancy (positive pregnancy test) or lactation Known hypersensitivity to any component of bevacizumab History of any other malignancy within 5 years (except nonmelanoma skin cancer or carcinoma in situ of the cervix) Pregnant or nursing females Unstable systemic disease, including active infection, uncontrolled hypertension, or serious cardiac arrhythmia requiring medication Subjects unable to undergo an MRI with contrast</criteria>
