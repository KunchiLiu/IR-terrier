	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and activity of DC/PC3, a dendritic cell vaccine used as immunotherapy for prostate cancer. The vaccine is made with each participants' own immune cells obtained through blood donation. Dendritic cells are known to activate other immune cells such as T cells, that are able to mount an attack against cancer cells. The dendritic cell vaccine will be administered as injections every 2 weeks over a course of 2 months.</brief_summary>
