	<brief_title>Efficacy Study of Extended-Release Niacin/Lovastatin Versus Usual Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Both LDL and HDL are important contributors in the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease (CAD); however, HDL is often ignored in primary care. The combination of niacin extended-release (ER)/lovastatin in a single tablet formulation (AdvicorÂ®) may be the most effective therapeutic option for simultaneously correcting both of these lipoprotein abnormalities to reduce CAD risk. The purpose of this study is to investigate the benefits of combination niacin ER/lovastatin in patients receiving standard care who are not at LDL goal per ATP III guidelines.</detailed_description>
