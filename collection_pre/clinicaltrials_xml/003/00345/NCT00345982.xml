	<brief_title>Augmenting Clozapine With Sertindole - SERCLOZ</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Around 20 % of patients with schizophrenia are treatment-resistant. Clozapine is still the drug of choice for these patients but 2/3 will not respond adequately to clozapine. In the study clozapine treatment is augmented with sertindole. Patients are randomized to either clozapine or sertindole for 12 weeks and continue in a open-label study with sertindole for 12 weeks. The purpose of the open-label study is to determine whether clozapine dosage can be reduced due to the addition of sertindole.</detailed_description>
