	<brief_summary>Umbilical cord often becomes encircled around portions of the fetus, usually the neck. The incidence ranges from 1 loop in 21% to 3 loops in 0.2%. In this study we wish to assessed the practice of severing the cord, which was encircled once around the neck of the fetus, after delivery of the anterior shoulder and prior to extraction of the body. The study and the control groups will include 30 women, each one. After diagnosis of cord around the neck during labor by ultrasound, the women will inter a randomization process. After delivery of the head, it will be cut intentionally in the study group and left intact in the control group. Neonatal outcome will be assessed.</brief_summary>
