	<brief_summary>This project involves evaluation of post operative contrast sensitivity and wavefront aberration results among patients implanted with standard monofocal lenses (Acrysof SN60AT/SN60WF) and the new presbyopic correcting multifocal lens (Acrysof ReSTOR). Higher Order aberrations are visual phenomena such as glare and haloes. They are more prevalent after cataract surgery and can affect night driving.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Higher Order Aberrations and Contrast Sensitivity Between Acrysof SN60AT, SN60WF and Restore Intraocular Lenses</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Project involves evaluation of contrast sensitivity and higher order aberrations in patients implanted with SN60AT, SN60WF and ReSTOR intraocular lenses. Patients in the department of Ophthalmology will be asked to participate in the study on a routine postoperative visit at least 3 months after cataract surgery. Patients will be asked to sign a consent form prior to participation. Wavefront analysis involves the patient resting their chin in a device similar to a slit lamp; they focus on a distant light and the machine performs the measurements in mesopic and scotopic conditions (light and dark). Contrast sensitivity is a measure of how faded or washed out an image can be before it becomes indistinguishable from a uniform field; it involves the patient identifying patterns on a chart. Wavefront analysis and contrast sensitivity are noninvasive tests that do not employ sedation or anesthesia and does not expose the patient to x-rays or microwaves. The proposed research will not alter usual standard postoperative care and can be done on a routine office visit.</detailed_description>
