	<brief_summary>The aim of this project is to use both multimodal MRI and behavioral measures to investigate how changes in frontostriatal neural systems contribute to the development and persistence of Bulimia Nervosa (BN). Findings from this study will have wide-ranging importance for our understanding of the development and treatment of BN.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An fMRI Study of Self-regulation in Adolescents With Bulimia Nervosa</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with Bulimia Nervosa (BN) have difficulty regulating impulsive behaviors as suggested by their binge-eating and purging, as well as the high incidence of drug abuse and shoplifting in this population. Understanding dysfunction in the frontostriatal circuitry that mediates self-regulatory control processes will aid development of new therapeutics for the impulsivity associated with BN. We are conducting a longitudinal study to better understand the development and persistence of BN. Participation in this study includes 4 sections: Neuropsychological Tests, Diagnostic interviews, Pregnancy Test, and MRI scan. All efforts are made to coordinate procedures into one day, and they require between 4 and 5 hours of the participant's time. The option of splitting participation into two study days is also offered for participants who find it more convenient. Participants are compensated with $100 in the form of a check, which is mailed to their home address. Participants will be invited back for follow-up visits.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Current or prior DSM IV diagnosis of Bulimia Nervosa or Subthreshold Bulimia Nervosa (those who meet all DSMIV criteria for BN, but engage in subjective bingeeating episodes and binge/purge at a frequency of at least once per week for 3 months, whereas meeting full DSMIV criteria for BN requires binge eating and purging twice per week for 3 months) Major Depression For control adolescents, no current or past history of an eating disorder Ferromagnetic implants (e.g., pacemaker) Metal braces or retainers IQ less than 80 Any other current major Axis I disorder, other than major depressive disorder (MDD) History of concussion, seizure disorder, or other neurological illness Claustrophobia Pregnant</criteria>
