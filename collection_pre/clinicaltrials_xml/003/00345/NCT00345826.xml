	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Dasatinib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects of dasatinib in treating patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia or acute lymphoblastic leukemia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dasatinib in Treating Patients With Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia or Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the long-term safety and tolerability of dasatinib in patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia or acute lymphoblastic leukemia resistant or intolerant to imatinib mesylate. Secondary - Describe any hematologic or cytogenetic response in patients treated with this drug. - Determine the duration of hematologic and cytogenetic response in patients using this drug during trial UCLA-0303035. - Determine the progression-free survival and overall survival of patients treated with this drug. OUTLINE: This is an open-label, roll-over study of protocol UCLA-0303035. Patients receive oral dasatinib once or twice daily for 5, 6, or 7 days. Treatment repeats every 7 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 5 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 54 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
