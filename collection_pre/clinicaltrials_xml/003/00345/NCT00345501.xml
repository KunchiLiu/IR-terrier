	<brief_summary>The prevention of contrast-mediated nephropathy (CMN), which accounts for considerable morbidity and mortality, remains a vexing problem. Contrast induced renal vasoconstriction is believed to play a pivotal role in the CMN mechanism. The aim of this study is to examine the efficacy of the prostacyclin analogue iloprost (dose 1ng/kg/min) in preventing CMN in high-risk patients undergoing a coronary procedure.</brief_summary>
