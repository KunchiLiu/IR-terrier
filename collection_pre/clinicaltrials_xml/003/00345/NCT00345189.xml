	<brief_title>Study of Oral CNF2024 (BIIB021) in Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is an ubiquitous molecular chaperone protein that is involved in folding, activation, and assembly of many proteins, including key mediators of signal transduction, cell cycle control, and transcriptional regulation. In cancer cells that are dependent upon Hsp90 client proteins, the degree to which clients are inhibited correlates closely with induction of growth inhibition and apoptosis with Hsp90 inhibitory drugs. The active pharmaceutical ingredient of CNF2024, CF1983 mesylate, is a synthetic, new chemical entity designed to inhibit Hsp90. CF1983 hada strong affinity for tumor derived Hsp90 and weaker affinity for Hsp90 isolated from normal cells or recombinant Hsp90.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Histologically or cytologically confirmed solid tumor which has failed standard therapies (surgery, radiotherapy, endocrine therapy, chemotherapy) or for which effective therapy is not available At least 18 years of age Hematology: Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt; 1500 cells/mm3, platelet count &gt; 100,000 cells/mm3 and hemoglobin &gt;= 9 gm/L Hepatic: Bilirubin &lt; 1.5 X upper limit of normal (ULN); alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &lt; 2.5 X ULN. Patients with known liver metastases or liver neoplasms: alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &lt; 5.0 X ULN. Renal: Serum creatinine levels &lt; 2.0 mg/dL or creatinine clearance &gt; 60 mL/min Coagulation: international normalized ratio (INR) &lt; 1.5 times normal Adrenal: Normal plasma cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) levels Normal electrocardiogram (ECG) with QTc &lt;= 450 msec for men and &lt;= 470 msec for women Estimated life expectancy of at least 3 months as determined by the Investigator Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status &lt;= 2 Male and female patients of childbearing potential must practice effective doublebarrier contraception during the study and continue contraception for 3 months after their last dose of study drug. Male patients must agree to not have intercourse with pregnant or nursing women during the study and for 3 months after their last dose of study drug, unless using doublebarrier contraception. The only exceptions to doublebarrier contraception are: Patient or partner is surgically sterile,female patient is postmenopausal for at least 1 year before screening or patient abstains from sexual intercourse, at the discretion of the Investigator Pregnant or nursing women, women of childbearing age not using reliable means of contraception. Radiotherapy or chemotherapy within the previous 28 days. Recovery to Grade 1 or less from chemotherapyinduced toxic effect, except alopecia, is required. Participation in any investigational drug study within 28 days prior to CNF2024 administration Active infection requiring intravenous antibiotic treatment Patients with second malignancy requiring active treatment (except hormonal therapy) Concurrent severe or uncontrolled medical disease (i.e., systemic infection, diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure) Active symptomatic fungal, bacterial and/or viral infection including active HIV or viral (A, B or C) hepatitis Problems with swallowing or malabsorption Chronic diarrhea (excess of 23 stools/day above normal frequency) Gastrointestinal diseases including gastritis, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, or hemorrhagic coloproctitis Major surgery of the stomach or small intestine Adrenal dysfunction &gt; Grade 2 Patients with diabetes (your doctor will discuss if you are eligible for this study)</criteria>
