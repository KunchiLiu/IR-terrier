	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to test the following hypotheses: - that the function and/or regulation of AQP2 and/or ENaC in the principal cells is abnormal in essential hypertension. - if an abnormal function of the principal cells is present in essential hypertension, this will become more pronounced at high and low sodium intake.</brief_summary>
