	<brief_summary>Objectives are to evaluate whether idrabiotaparinux sodium (SSR126517E) is as least as effective as a standard warfarin treatment to prevent recurrence of venous thromboembolic events (VTE) in patients with symptomatic pulmonary embolism (PE) with or without symptomatic deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and to assess its safety (bleedings) versus warfarin.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Study Assessing Idrabiotaparinux Sodium Injections Once-weekly in Pulmonary Embolism Therapeutic Approach</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Treatment with a therapeutic dose of any low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or unfractioned heparin (UFH) or fondaparinux is allowed only within the 36 hours immediately preceding randomization. Randomization is performed as soon as the diagnosis of PE (and DVT if concomitant suspected symptomatic DVT) is confirmed. Allocation to treatment is done centrally by Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS) and stratified by (1) center, (2) intended treatment duration, ie, 3 months or 6 months. At randomization, the planned duration of treatment (3 or 6 months) is prespecified by the Investigator and determined on the assessment of risk of VTE recurrence. Participants are randomized to either idrabiotaparinux + placebo of warfarin, or warfarin + placebo of idrabiotaparinux, with an initial treatment of at least 5 days with enoxaparin in both treatment groups. Participants in the 3-month stratum have an additional 13-week observational period after cessation of study treatment. Participants in the 6-month stratum have a 13-week up to 26-week observational period.</detailed_description>
