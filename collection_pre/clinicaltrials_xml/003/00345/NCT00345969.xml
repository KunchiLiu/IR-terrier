	<brief_title>Exercise and Testosterone Therapy in Elderly Men With Physical Frailty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Decreases in physical abilities, including losses of strength, endurance, balance, and coordination are major causes of disability and loss of independence in older men. Such individuals are at high risk for injurious falls, hospitalization, and use of supportive services. Age-associated testosterone deficiency may contribute to deficits in muscle mass and strength that are common in this patient population. The purpose of this study is to determine, in older men with physical frailty, whether exercise training combined with testosterone replacement therapy can improve physical function, muscle mass, bone density, and quality of life, to a greater degree than exercise training alone. Comparison: Men age 65 years and older who meet criteria for physical frailty and have a serum testosterone level below 350 ng/dl are randomly assigned to one of two groups: 1) exercise training + testosterone replacement therapy for six months vs. 2) exercise training + placebo for six months.</detailed_description>
