	<brief_summary>The protein composition of nutrition may affect the rate of gastric emptying and gastric fysiology. This is espesially important in children with neurologic impariment, who commonly rely on tube feedings, have feeding problems, nausea, vomiting, gastroesophageal reflux and delayed gastric emptying. We aim to find out whether 4 different protein sources affect the rate of gastric emptying and electrofysiology in this group of children.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Protein Composition on Gastric Emptying</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Several factors in nutrition are known to affect gastric emptying rate, such as energy content, temperature, viscosity etc. In infants the protein composition affects gastric emptying. Children with cerebral pasly commonly have foregut dysmotility - with nausea, vomiting, feeding intolerance and gastroesophageal reflux. Tube feedings, usually based on cows milk are commonly used. Our hypothesis is that the source and thus protein composition of feeding affects gastric emptying rate and electrofysiology. Using four different tube feedings, standardized for content of fat, glucose and calories, we will measure gastric emptying rate using C13 octanoic acid as well as electrogastrography will be recorded. The protein modules are derived from casein, whey/casein mixture, hydrolyzed whey and aminoacids. Children with cerebral paresis and gastrostomy will be included. Each serves as his / her own control. The primary endpoint is gastric emptying rate, the secondary endpoint electrogastrography.</detailed_description>
