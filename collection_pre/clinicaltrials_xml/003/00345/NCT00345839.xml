	<brief_title>E.V.O.L.V.E. Trial™: EValuation Of Cinacalcet Hydrochloride (HCl) Therapy to Lower CardioVascular Events</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Secondary HPT is common in people with CKD. Patients with secondary HPT often have high parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels and may develop large parathyroid glands in the neck. Patients with secondary HPT may have bone disease (osteodystrophy). This bone disease may cause bone pain, fractures, and poor formation of red blood cells. Other problems from secondary HPT may include increases in blood levels of calcium and phosphorus. These may cause calcium to deposit in body tissues. Calcium deposits can cause arthritis (joint pain and swelling), muscle inflammation, itching, gangrene (death of soft tissue), or heart and lung problems. New evidence suggests that secondary HPT is associated with cardiovascular disease and increased death risk. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of cinacalcet (cinacalcet HCl or Sensipar®/Mimpara®) on cardiovascular events (having to do with the heart and its blood vessels) and death in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism (HPT) who are receiving dialysis. These events include death from any reason, heart attack and episodes where the heart does not get enough oxygen, peripheral vascular disease (narrowing of vessels that carry blood to the legs, arms, stomach or kidneys), and heart failure (a condition that occurs when the heart is unable to pump enough blood to meet the need's of the body's tissues)</detailed_description>
