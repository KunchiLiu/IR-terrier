Subjects must be stable for 3 months or more of treatment with olanzapine at baseline. There will be 2 treatment arms in this study, approximately 60 subjects per arm. After randomization and blinding, each subject will either remain on olanzapine or switch to bifeprunox. Assessments, including body weight and waist measurements, will be made at each study visit.Subjects will participate in the study for approximately 11 weeks. After a screening period of 6 to 14 days, eligible subjects will be treated for 8 weeks. Subjects who do not enter the long-term extension will return for a follow-up visit 7 days after discontinuing the use of test article. Subjects who do enter the long-term extension will have a 7-day taper/titration period after the 8 weeks of double-blind treatment.</detailed_description>
