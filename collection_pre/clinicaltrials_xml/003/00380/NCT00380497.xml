	<brief_title>Pico-Salax Versus Poly-Ethylene Glycol for Bowel Cleanout Before Colonoscopy in Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Good bowel cleanout before colonoscopy is commonly associated with significant discomfort that children do not tolerate well. Many pediatric centers in North America use Poly-Ethylene Glycol and electrolyte solution (PEG-ELS, GolytelyÂ®) for bowel lavage administered in a large volume, often causing nausea, vomiting and bloating. This is often poorly tolerated by children who usually require the insertion of a nasogastric tube and a day admission. Recently, Pico-Salax was approved in Canada for bowel cleanout in children. It is administered in two divided doses, each in one cup of water; it is palatable and does not have to be given in hospital. However, no controlled study in children compared it with the current standard of care. Our preliminary experience and previous literature suggest that it is effective and well tolerated. We propose to study whether colon cleanout for colonoscopy with Pico-Salax is better tolerated than Golytely in children, by a single blinded randomized controlled trial. Positive results of this study will facilitate a better tolerated regimen for bowel clean out in children.</detailed_description>
