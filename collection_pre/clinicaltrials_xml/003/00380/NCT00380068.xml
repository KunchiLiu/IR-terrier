	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ambrisentan in a broad population of participants with pulmonary hypertension (PH). Secondary objectives of this study were to evaluate the effects of ambrisentan on other clinical measures of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), long-term treatment success, and survival.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy Study of Ambrisentan in Subjects With Pulmonary Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study was to enroll up to 200 participants with PH due to the following etiologies: 1) PAH including idiopathic and familial PAH and PAH associated with collagen vascular disease, congenital systemic-to-pulmonary shunts (including Eisenmenger's syndrome), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, drugs and toxins, thyroid disorders, glycogen storage disease, Gaucher disease, hemoglobinopathies, and splenectomy (WHO Group 1); 2) PH associated with lung diseases and/or hypoxemia, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), interstitial lung disease (ILD), sleep-disordered breathing, and alveolar hypoventilation disorders (WHO Group 3); 3) PH due to proximal or distal chronic thromboembolic obstruction (WHO Group 4); and 4) PH due to sarcoidosis (WHO Group 5). Participants with left heart disease or left heart failure were excluded (WHO Group 2). Participants could be receiving prostacyclin or sildenafil therapy at baseline, and participants who previously discontinued either bosentan, sitaxsentan, or both, due to liver function test abnormalities were eligible.</detailed_description>

Female participants of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test and must agree to use a reliable double method of contraception until study completion and for at least four weeks following their final study visit. 6. Male participants must be informed of the potential risks of testicular tubular atrophy and infertility associated with taking ambrisentan and queried regarding his understanding of the potential risks as described in the Informed Consent Form. Summarized 1. Participation in a previous clinical study with ambrisentan 2. Bosentan or sitaxsentan use within four weeks prior to the screening visit 3.
