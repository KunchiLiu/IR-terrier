	<brief_summary>The purpose of this trial is to describe the immunogenicity, the safety, and tolerability of FluLaval™ TR and Fluarix®, the latter serving as active comparator. The results will be compared to a standard immune response criteria, for both young and elderly populations.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Immunogenicity of FluLaval™ TR and Fluarix® (Influenza Vaccines) in Young and Older Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomized trial will assess the immune protection offered at Day 21 by FluLaval™ TR, Fluarix® being the comparator. In both groups, immune response will be assessed through a blood test before and 21 days following vaccination. The safety and tolerability of the study vaccine will be contrasted to the comparator vaccine over a period of 42 days following vaccination.</detailed_description>
