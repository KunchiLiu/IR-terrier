	<brief_summary>The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the long term effects of the polymer-based slow-release paclitaxel-eluting stent (TAXUS; Boston Scientific), with or without prior rotablation, in an angiographically well defined group of patients with complex calcified coronary lesions.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Rotational Atherectomy Prior to Taxus Stent</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Calcification is an essential part of all atherosclerotic plaques. Its extent increases with the progression of atherosclerotic disease. Heavily calcified lesions form a particular threat to DES; both damage to the polymer coating during vigorous advancement and inadequate diffusion of the drug to the subintima through extensive calcium arcs could contribute to the ineffectiveness of DES when implanted into such lesions, or may lead to primary stent delivery or expansion failure. Rotational atherectomy can effectively ablate calcified plaques. In the DES era, data concerning rotational atherectomy are scarce. DES implantation following rotablation seems a rational combination, but is only poorly supported by controlled studies. In the present study, we are using the polymer-based slow-release paclitaxel-eluting stent (TAXUS; Boston Scientific), with or without prior rotablation, in an angiographically well defined group of patients with complex calcified coronary lesions. This prospective, randomized, controlled study aims at evaluating the long term effects of both strategies in this complex cohort of patients.</detailed_description>
