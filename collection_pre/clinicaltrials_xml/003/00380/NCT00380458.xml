	<brief_title>Study to Evaluate Recovery From Postoperative Pain After Sleep Apnea Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective clinical study is designed to assess whether tonsillectomy and UPPP performed using the study device to treat OSA symptoms in an adult population is associated with less postoperative pain during the 21-day postoperative recovery period compared to electrocautery dissection. The amount of post-operative pain will be assessed daily over the 21-day post-operative recovery period using two general measures: 1) self-reported pain intensity and 2) self-reported pain medication administration, including frequency of use and dose. Further, timing of self-medication will be analyzed separately.</detailed_description>
