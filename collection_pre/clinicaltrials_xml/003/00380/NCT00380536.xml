	<brief_title>Medical Self-Management for Improving Health Behavior Among Individuals in Community Mental Health Settings</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>People with serious mental disorders tend to have shorter life expectancies and elevated rates of unhealthy behaviors and chronic illnesses. Peer-led medical illness self-management programs have been shown to be effective in improving the health and health behaviors of people with chronic medical conditions. This type of intervention, however, has yet to be systematically tested in individuals with mental disorders. Community mental health centers provide care to many people of low socioeconomic status who lack medical insurance. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of a medical illness self-management program in improving the health and health behaviors of people who are receiving care at a community mental health center. Participants in this study will be randomly assigned to either partake in peer-led medical illness self-management group sessions or receive care as usual. Participants assigned to care as usual will continue to receive any services they would have otherwise been offered, but will not receive any additional services through the study. Participants assigned to the medical illness self-management program will attend group sessions once a week for 6 weeks. Sessions will focus on medical self-management, healthy behaviors, and effective use of the general medical system.</detailed_description>
