	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: Subject is current smoker or exsmoker with a smoking history of at least 10 pack years (number of pack years = [number of cigarettes per day/20] x number of years smoked). The patient has serum CRP â‰¥ 3 mg/L at screening Subjects able to understand and comply with protocol requirements, instructions and protocolstated restrictions. Exclusion criteria: Any clinically relevant abnormality identified on medical assessment, laboratory examination, or 12lead ECG which in the opinion of the investigator, will lead to an unacceptable increase in the risk of study participation or will call into question the validity of the outcome measures. Subjects who are obese, defined as having a BMI &gt; 40 Subject has a diagnosis of asthma that is confirmed by the investigator. Subject has poorly controlled COPD, defined as the occurrence of any of the following in the 2 weeks prior to visit 1: acute worsening of COPD that is managed by the subject at home by selftreatment with corticosteroids or antibiotics, or that requires treatment by a physician. Subject has active tuberculosis, lung cancer or clinically overt bronchiectasis. Symptoms of "cold or flu" or any respiratory infection/symptoms at the start of the study Subject has cardiac, gastrointestinal, neurological, renal, endocrine or psychiatric disease that is uncontrolled on permitted medication Subject has history of allergic rhinitis. Subjects with a history of any type of malignancy with the exception of successfully treated basal cell cancer of the skin. Subjects with rheumatoid arthritis, connective tissue disorders and other conditions known to be associated with chronic inflammation (e.g. Inflammatory Bowel Disease). Subjects with chronic infections such as gingivitis, periodontitis, prostatitis, gastritis, and urinary tract infections. Subjects with history of hepatic disease. History of increased liver function tests (ALT, AST) above upper limit of normal in the past 6 months and/or liver function tests (bilirubin, ALT, AST) above upper limit of normal at screening. History of positive HIV, Hepatitis B /C antibody test result, a positive Hep B/C result at screen or a risk factor for these diseases. History of drug or other allergy, which, in the opinion of the Investigator precludes participation in the study.</criteria>
