	<brief_summary>Managed detoxification is a first and necessary step prior to treatment and rehabilitation. Detoxification can be a major obstacle for some patients, and the availability of managed and safe withdrawal is a prerequisite for long-term treatment. In our clinical practice we have felt the need for a standardised and safe detoxification treatment regimen for our opioid addicts, as dependence on multiple drugs is so common. Objectives 1. To assess whether a novel standardised treatment regimen - Buprenorphine (BPN) combined with Valproate (VPA) - will result in fewer withdrawal symptoms during detoxification of opiateâ€“polydrug users than the existing treatment regimen, i.e. Clonidine (CLN) combined with Carbamazepine (CBZ). 2. To determine whether there are differences in treatment retention between the BPN/VPA and the CLN/CBZ groups. 3. To assess differences in clinical side-effects and biochemical interactions between the two treatment regimens.</brief_summary>
