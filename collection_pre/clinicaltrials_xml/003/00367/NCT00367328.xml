	<brief_title>To Determine the Efficacy of a Laser Device for the Treatment of Hidradenitis Suppurativa</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hidradenitis Suppurativa is a chronic, scarring disease. The treatments available for this condition are not very effective and work only for some patients. Recently, a 1320nm laser device has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of acne and facial rejuvenation. Given the positive results seen with the use of this laser in the treatment of acne it is reasonable to hypothesize that a similar effect may be seen with the treatment of Hidradenitis suppurativa. The specific aim of the study is to determine the efficacy of this device for the treatment of hidradenitis suppurativa as it relates to the patient's established treatment. The investigators are trying to determine the efficacy of a laser for the treatment of hidradenitis suppurativa. Patients will: - be examined and interviewed - have photographs taken of the treatment site - have a 4mm punch biopsy performed - have wound culture swabs performed</detailed_description>
