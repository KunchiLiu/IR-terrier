	<brief_summary>The objective of this trial is to compare an individually optimized dose of the lisuride TTS patch against placebo and against an individually optimized dose of oral ropinirole (active- and placebo-controlled design) in idiopathic and uremic RLS patients with regard to efficacy, safety, and quality of life.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Transdermal Lisuride: a Trial for the Treatment of Patients With Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 300 patients will be randomized to receive either lisuride, ropinirole or placebo in a 2:1:1 fashion. After completion of 12 weeks of double-blind treatment, eligible patients will have the option to continue treatment with the lisuride patch for further 36 weeks in an open-label extension of the study. Primary outcome: Changes in the total score of the International Restless Legs Severity Scale (IRLS) from baseline to end of double-blind treatment (12 weeks) will be used as primary efficacy outcome measure. Secondary objectives are to evaluate quality of life, safety and tolerability. After the double-blind period, long-term efficacy of lisuride will be assessed for further 36 weeks in an open-label extension of the study.</detailed_description>
