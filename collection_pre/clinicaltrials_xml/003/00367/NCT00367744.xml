	<brief_title>Rosiglitazone Effect on Mitochondria and Lipoatrophy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a phase II, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of rosiglitazone for the treatment of HIV-associated lipoatrophy. Subjects will receive blinded study treatment for 48 weeks. This study will examine the effect of rosiglitazone on limb fat and mitochondrial indices in HIV-1-infected subjects receiving stable antiretroviral therapy that does not contain d4T or AZT. The study also will assess the safety and tolerability of rosiglitazone in this population, and its effect on carotid IMT, prevalence of metabolic syndrome, lipid parameters and glucose metabolism.</detailed_description>
