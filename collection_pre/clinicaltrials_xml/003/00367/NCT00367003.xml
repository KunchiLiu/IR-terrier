	<brief_summary>The purpose of the proposed study is to evaluate the safety, feasibility and efficacy of chronic, high frequency stimulation of the subgenual cingulate white matter (Cg25WM) using the ANS Totally Implantable Deep Brain Stimulation System as an adjunctive treatment for severe treatment-refractory Major Depression in twenty TRD patients, and to investigate potential mechanisms of action of this intervention.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Deep Brain Stimulation for Treatment Resistant Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Major Depression is one of the most common and costly of all psychiatric disorders. While depression can be effectively treated in the majority of patients by either medication or some form of evidence-based psychotherapy, up to 20% of patients fail to respond to standard interventions. For these patients, trial-and-error combinations of multiple medications and electroconvulsive therapy are often required (Kennedy and Lam 2003; UK ECT Review Group 2003). For patients who remain severely depressed despite these aggressive approaches, new strategies are needed. Specific Aim 1. To asses the safety and tolerability of acute and chronic Cg25-DBS. Specific Aim 2. To assess the antidepressant efficacy of active Cg25-DBS in treatment-resistant depressed patients.</detailed_description>
