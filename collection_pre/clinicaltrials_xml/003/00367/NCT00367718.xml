	<brief_summary>This study seeks to test the Efficacy in terms of rates of disease response in metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma of the standard dose of velcade 1.3 mg/m2 given at the day 1,4,8,and 11 every 21 days schedule. The study uses a Simons 2 stage design and will enroll between 15-25 patients. Secondary endpoints studied include Pharmacokinetics, toxicities, EBV viral load and molecular characterization of EBV in plasma.</brief_summary>
