	<brief_summary>Mohs Micrographic Surgery is a well established method for treatment of cutaneous malignancies. Part of this technique requires marking skin surrounding the tumor. There are two ways of marking the tissue, lightly scoring it with a scalpel or marking it with a surgical marker. This study is to determine if there is a noticeable difference in outcome between patients who have their tissue lightly scored with a scalpel or marked with a surgical marking pen.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Mohs Micrographic Surgery is a well established method utilizing microscopic margin controlled excision for treatment of cutaneous malignancies (See Appendix A). It has the highest cure rate of any of the methods used to treat common cutaneous malignancies and is a proven safe outpatient procedure. Part of the technique requires marking skin surrounding the tumor to correspond with tissue that has been removed and divided into pieces for processing and microscopic examination. Currently there are two established ways of marking the tissue; lightly scoring it with a scalpel or marking it with a surgical marker. Scoring tissue is faster, more accurate, and there is no risk of having the marking washed or rubbed away.</detailed_description>
