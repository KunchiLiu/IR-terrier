	<brief_summary>The Wellness Interventions after Transplant (WIAT) Trial has reached its enrollment target. This trial is no longer recruiting new patients. Those currently enrolled will be followed for a year to evaluate trial outcomes. The purpose of this trial is to determine if training in Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction can reduce symptom distress and improve quality of life in solid organ transplant recipients. Primary study outcomes are depression, anxiety and insomnia symptoms, measured by well-validated self-report scales. The impact of this program on objectively measured sleep outcomes, use of health care resources and costs will also be evaluated.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Pharmacologic options for managing symptoms increase the risks of side effects and drug interactions, and may reduce adherence by complicating an already challenging medication regimen. In contrast, mind-body based complementary therapies may be ideal to treat distressing symptoms and negative emotions after transplantation. Our long-range objective is to develop evidence-based recommendations for non-pharmacologic strategies that provide symptom relief to transplant recipients, and are safe, practical and cost-effective. Potential participants are recruited by mail, screening by clinic staff and provider referrals. Interested persons are screened by telephone and mailed informational study brochures. Informed consent is conducted by face-to-face interview, where a diagram of the study design is used to explain the 2-stage randomization and study requirements.</detailed_description>
