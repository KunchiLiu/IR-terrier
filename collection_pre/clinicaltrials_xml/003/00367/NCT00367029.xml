	<brief_summary>Individuals who are not physically active are at risk for developing heart disease, stroke, and diabetes. Using motivational print materials is one way to encourage individuals to increase their physical activity. This study will evaluate the effect that an enhanced version of an individualized, print-based motivational program has on increasing physical activity among sedentary individuals.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Individualized Motivational Print Materials to Encourage More Physical Activity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently, only 32% of adults in the United States participate in regular physical activity. Several healthcare organizations, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institutes of Health, and the American Heart Association recommend that adults engage in a minimum of 2 ½ hours of physical activity each week. In a previous study, individuals who received motivational print materials in the mail increased their weekly physical activity more than individuals who received no motivational materials or who received motivational support over the telephone. However, about half of those who were mailed the print materials still did not reach the recommended goal of 2 ½ hours of physical activity per week. The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of an enhanced version of an individualized, print-based motivational program versus a previously tested print-based motivational program at increasing physical activity levels in sedentary individuals. This study will enroll healthy, sedentary individuals. Participants will be randomly assigned to either a print-based, individually tailored motivational program or an enhanced version of the same program. All participants will attend a baseline study visit, which will include body measurements, physical activity assessments, and health and psychological questionnaires. A select group of participants will also take part in an exercise test. Participants will then document their monthly physical activity. Study researchers will use this information, as well as the completed questionnaires, to develop individualized reports, manuals, and tip sheets that include feedback and strategies for increasing physical activity for each participant. Materials will be mailed to participants 14 times throughout the year. Participants in the enhanced intervention will receive additional materials that focus on increasing social support, self regulation, and outcome expectations, as well as materials on how to effectively monitor physical activity levels. They will also attend one study visit to assess their goals with the research staff. At Months 6 and 12, baseline evaluations will be repeated and all participants will be interviewed to assess physical activity levels.</detailed_description>
