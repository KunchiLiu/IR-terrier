	<brief_title>Safety, Toleration and Efficacy of CP-741,952 for the Treatment of Obesity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Following review of the preliminary data from completed study A7081004, the development program for CP-741,952 was terminated on 15 March 2007. Primary reasons for program termination included a lack of significant efficacy at all doses investigated and an increased incidence of mild to moderate elevations in serum transaminases, primarily alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and liver fat content, in treated compared to placebo subjects. A synopsis will be created and will include greater detail on these findings.</detailed_description>
