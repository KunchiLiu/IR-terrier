	<detailed_description>Background: Toxoplasmic encephalitis (TE), caused by Toxoplasma gondii, is common in AIDS patients. TE can result in tissue destruction via massive inflammation and brain abscess formation. METHODS: Randomized controlled trials were performed in AIDS patients to assess which drug regimen was optimally effective for the treatment of TE. AIDS patients with TE were randomly divided into 3 groups that received a 6-week course of either pyrimethamine (50 mg/ day or 100 mg/day) plus sulfadiazine (4 g/day) and folinic acid (25 mg/day) or trimethoprim (10 mg/kg/day) plus sulfamethoxazole (50 mg/kg/day) (TMP-SMX), and results were evaluated with respect to clinical response, mortality, morbidity, and serious adverse events. The primary outcome was defined as death in the first 6-week period. The secondary outcome was successful treatment within 6 weeks without severe adverse events, bone marrow suppression, drug-induced rash, or any other event that caused a change in the treatment regimen. RESULTS: The results from this study showed that in AIDS patients, TE was most successfully treated with the combination of pyrimethamine (50 mg/day) plus sulfadiazidine (4 g/day) and folinic acid (25 mg/day); failure rates were not significantly different among the 3 treatment groups. Conclusions: Available data suggest that of the currently available options, treatment of TE with pyrimethamine at 50 mg/day plus sulfadiazidine at 4 g/day provides the best primary outcome for AIDS patients with TE; however, because this study was terminated prematurely, we suggest that treatment with intravenous TMP-SMX be further evaluated to determine its efficacy.</detailed_description>
