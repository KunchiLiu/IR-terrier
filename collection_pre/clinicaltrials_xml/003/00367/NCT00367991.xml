	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to see if a naturally-occurring hormone called erythropoietin changes the action of platelets in the blood. Patients with heart attacks are treated with medicines to reduce the clotting action of platelets. This study is trying to determine whether erythropoietin alters the clotting action of platelets in patients receiving anti-platelet medicines. It is important to understand the effects of erythropoietin on platelets since preliminary studies in animals suggest that erythropoietin may protect the heart from damage during a heart attack.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Recombinant Human Erythropoietin on Platelet Function in Patients With Acute Myocardial Infarction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Anti-apoptotic effects of erythropoietin in experimental myocardial infarction (MI) and ischemia-reperfusion injury suggest potential for therapeutic benefit in patients with acute MI. Before the therapeutic potential of recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEpo) in acute MI can be tested in large clinical trials, more information on the effects of short-term rHuEpo on platelet function are needed. Accordingly, the current proposal aims to determine the effects of rHuEpo (at a dose previously shown not to inhibit the anti-platelet effects of aspirin and clopidogrel in healthy subjects) on platelet function and other safety measures and measure of infarct size in patients with acute coronary syndromes receiving clinically-indicated standard anti-platelet therapy with aspirin, clopidogrel and glycoprotein Iib-IIIa inhibitors. Specific Aim 1: To determine the effects of intravenous rHuEpo 400 U/kg daily for 3 days vs. placebo on in vivo and in vitro platelet function in patients with acute MI undergoing percutaneous revascularization. Specific Aim 2: To obtain pilot data to estimate the effects of administration of rHuEpo 400 U/kg daily for 3 days vs. placebo on biochemical markers of myocardial infarction size and left ventricular ejection fraction in patients with acute MI undergoing percutaneous revascularization</detailed_description>
