	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab, can block cancer growth in different ways. Some find cancer cells and kill them or carry cancer-killing substances to them. Others interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Giving rituximab before chemotherapy may be an effective treatment for B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well rituximab works in treating young patients who are planning to receive chemotherapy for B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Rituximab in Treating Young Patients Who Are Receiving Chemotherapy for B-Cell Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma or B-Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the response rate in children and adolescents with B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (B-NHL) or B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) treated with rituximab monotherapy as upfront window therapy before chemotherapy. - Evaluate the effect of rituximab on different histological subtypes of childhood mature B-NHL or B-ALL in patients treated with this regimen. - Investigate the rituximab response in patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the toxicity profile of rituximab in these patients. - Collect pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data from patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive rituximab IV on day 1. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 79 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
