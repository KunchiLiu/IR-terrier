	<brief_summary>This randomized phase III trial studies chemotherapy and bevacizumab to see how well they work compared to chemotherapy alone in treating patients with stage IB, stage II, or stage IIIA non-small cell lung cancer that was removed by surgery. Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more tumor cells. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Bevacizumab also may stop the growth of non-small cell lung cancer by blocking the growth of new blood vessels necessary for tumor growth. It is not yet known whether chemotherapy is more effective with or without bevacizumab in treating non-small cell lung cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Chemotherapy With or Without Bevacizumab in Treating Patients With Stage IB, Stage II, or Stage IIIA Non-small Cell Lung Cancer That Was Removed By Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate overall survival with chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab used in the adjuvant setting in patients with resected stage IB (&gt;= 4 cm) - IIIA non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate disease-free survival and toxicity with chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab used in the adjuvant setting in patients with resected stage IB (&gt;= 4 cm) - IIIA NSCLC. II. To perform analyses of tissue and blood to establish factors that predict clinical outcome in patients receiving chemotherapy, with or without bevacizumab, for resected early stage NSCLC. III. To determine whether smoking status is linked to outcome for patients with resected stage IB (&gt;= 4 cm) - IIIA NSCLC treated with chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab in the adjuvant setting. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. ARM I (adjuvant chemotherapy without bevacizumab): Patients receive 1 of 4 chemotherapy regimens. REGIMEN 1: Patients receive vinorelbine ditartrate intravenously (IV) over 10 minutes on days 1 and 8 and cisplatin IV over 60 minutes on day 1 immediately following vinorelbine ditartrate administration. REGIMEN 2: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 1 and cisplatin over 1 hour on day 1 immediately following docetaxel administration. REGIMEN 3: Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8 and cisplatin IV over 60 minutes on day 1 immediately following gemcitabine administration. REGIMEN 4 (non-squamous histology only): Patients receive pemetrexed disodium IV over 10 minutes and cisplatin IV over 1 hour on day 1 immediately following pemetrexed disodium administration. In all regimens, treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. ARM II (adjuvant chemotherapy with bevacizumab): Patients receive chemotherapy as in Arm I. Patients also receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1. Treatment with bevacizumab repeats every 21 days for up to 1 year. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for 10 years.</detailed_description>
