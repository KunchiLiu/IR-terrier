	<brief_summary>The trial is a phase II trial in adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC), a rare malignancy with poor prognosis. It will provide results leading to the establishment of the effect of the included drugs. The regimen consists of cisplatin plus taxotere. Over a period of 1-2 years this national trial will include 19-36 patients with advanced ACC from different centres in Denmark. Patients not responding to the first line treatment will be switched to the alternative regimen. The primary objective of this trial is to investigate response rate. Secondary endpoints are survival, time to progression, best overall response rate and duration of response.</brief_summary>
