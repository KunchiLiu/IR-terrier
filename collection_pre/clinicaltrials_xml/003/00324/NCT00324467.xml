	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess whether patients who are likely to fail R-CHOP, as predicted by a mid-treatment PET scan, can have an improved outcome if switched to a standard salvage regimen R-ICE (rituximab, ifosfamide, carboplatin, etoposide). Patients who have a negative PET scan after 4 cycles of R-CHOP have an excellent prognosis (&gt;85% chance of cure) and should complete treatment with 6 cycles of standard R-CHOP. Patients who have a positive PET scan after 4 cycles of R-CHOP have a very poor prognosis (~10% chance of cure) and may have an improved outcome if switched to a non-cross resistant chemotherapy combination R-ICE.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tailoring Treatment for B Cell Non-hodgkin's Lymphoma Based on PET Scan Results Mid Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a phase II trial investigating tailoring first-line therapy for advanced stage diffuse large B-cell NHL (DLBCL) based on a mid-treatment 18F-FDG- positron-emission tomography (PET) scan result. More than half of all patients with DLBCL can be cured with 6-8 cycles of standard R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone). Patients who are not cured with R-CHOP have a very poor prognosis. This study will assess whether patients who are likely to fail R-CHOP, as predicted by a mid-treatment PET scan, can have an improved outcome if switched to a standard salvage regimen R-ICE (rituximab, ifosfamide, carboplatin, etoposide). Objectives: - To assess the efficacy of tailoring first-line therapy based on a mid- treatment PET scan result for patients with advanced stage DLBCL. - To assess the progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with advanced stage DLBCL who have a negative mid-treatment PET scan and receive standard therapy with six cycles of CHOP-R and patients with a positive mid-treatment PET scan who receive four cycles of CHOP-R followed by four cycles of R-ICE chemotherapy. - To assess the overall survival (OS) in patients with advanced stage DLBCL who have a negative mid-treatment PET scan and receive standard therapy with six cycles of CHOP-R and patients with a positive mid-treatment PET scan who receive four cycles of CHOP-R followed by four cycles of R-ICE chemotherapy.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>18 years of age or older newly diagnosed histologically proven CD20 positive diffuse large B cell lymphoma by tissue biopsy, listed under peripheral Bcell neoplasm according to the WHO/REAL classification (diffuse large Bcell lymphoma, mediastinal large Bcell lymphoma, Tcell rich Bcell lymphoma, intravascular large Bcell lymphoma) Advanced stage disease defined as patients with stage III or stage IV disease; or patients with stage I or stage II disease with one of the following additional criteria: Bsymptoms, or disease that is not radio encompassable within a single involved field, or not a candidate for brief chemotherapy and irradiation, or the presence of bulky disease (any single mass =&gt; 10 cm) Previously untreated or treated with up to 3 cycles of standard dose 3 weekly RCHOP chemotherapy prior to enrollment (i.e. patients may be enrolled prior to initiation of the fourth cycle of RCHOP chemotherapy) ECOG Performance Status 0,1 or 2 at time of enrollment No evidence of progressive disease while on RCHOP chemotherapy The patient must sign the consent form prior to registration Patients with a history of any other lymphoproliferative disorder, including prior history of indolent NHL Patients with a history of prior or concurrent malignancies within 5 years of the current diagnosis, except adequately treated non melanoma skin cancer, and curatively treated insitu cancer of the cervix Known HIV infection Known hepatitis B virus infection Pregnancy or lactation. Men and women of childbearing age must be using adequate contraception. Significant renal insufficiency (serum creatinine &gt; 200 mmol/L), unless due to lymphoma Significant hepatic insufficiency (serum total bilirubin &gt; 30 mmol/L), unless due to lymphoma Cardiac contraindication to doxorubicin therapy (e.g. abnormal contractility on echocardiography). If history of cardiac disease, ejection fraction must be within normal limits for age. Neurologic contraindication to vincristine (e.g. peripheral neuropathy) Absolute neutrophil count &lt;1.5 x 109/L (unless due to bone marrow involvement with lymphoma or due to initiation of RCHOP chemotherapy) Platelet count &lt; 100 x 109/L (unless due to splenomegaly, bone marrow involvement with lymphoma or due to initiation of RCHOP chemotherapy) Evidence of active systemic infection Any medical condition that in the opinion of the investigator would compromise treatment delivery, add toxicity or impair assessment</criteria>
