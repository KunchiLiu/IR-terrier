	<brief_title>Post-Operative Drainage Following Lymph Node Dissection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: Fibrin sealant has been used for many years in clinical practice and has a wide range of applications including the control of lymphatic leaks and haemostasis. The physiological mechanism of action of fibrin was first described by Morawitz in 1905; fibrin sealant was first marketed in 1983. Lymph node dissection is undertaken for the control of malignant disease - frequently malignant melanoma or squamous cell carcinoma. Following groin or axillary dissection, excessive post operative drainage may necessitate the presence of wound drains for 10 days or more. This may prolong hospital stay in some patients, and may be associated with an increased complication rate (such as wound infection). Hypothesis: the use of fibrin sealant prior to wound closure following either groin or axillary dissection may reduce post-operative wound drainage. Comparison: patients who require an elective groin or axillary dissection who either undergo standard wound closure or those who have fibrin sealant instilled into the surgical wound prior to wound closure.</detailed_description>
