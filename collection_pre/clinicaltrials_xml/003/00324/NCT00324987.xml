	<brief_summary>This randomized phase III trial studies imatinib mesylate and bevacizumab to see how well they work compared to imatinib mesylate alone in treating patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumor that has spread to other parts of the body or cannot be removed by surgery. Imatinib mesylate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. It is not yet known whether imatinib mesylate and bevacizumab are more effective than imatinib mesylate alone in treating gastrointestinal stromal tumor.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Imatinib Mesylate With or Without Bevacizumab in Treating Patients With Metastatic or Unresectable Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine whether treatment with imatinib (imatinib mesylate) plus bevacizumab leads to improved progression free survival (PFS) versus treatment with imatinib alone in first-line treatment of incurable gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To compare response probabilities (confirmed and unconfirmed complete response [CR] and partial response [PR] for subset of patients with measurable disease), overall survival, and central-review based progression-free survival (CRb-PFS) in patients treated with imatinib and bevacizumab versus those treated with imatinib alone. II. To compare the frequency and severity of toxicities associated with imatinib plus bevacizumab versus imatinib alone. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To explore the association between soluble vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), VEGF-factor D (VEGF-D), VEGF receptor (VEGFR)-1, VEGFR-2, angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2), platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR)-AA and PDGFR-BB levels, positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and immunohistochemistry for cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (p16), VEGF and VEGFR, with kinase mutation status and clinical outcomes. II. To explore imatinib pharmacokinetics with single nucleotide polymorphisms involving the adenosine triphospate (ATP)-binding cassette, sub-family G (WHITE), member 2 (ABCG2) and cytochrome P450, family 3, subfamily A, polypeptide 4 (CYP3A4) genes, as well as other genes that are reported to influence the absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination of imatinib. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. ARM I (CLOSED TO ACCRUAL 10/1/2009): Patients receive imatinib mesylate orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21 and bevacizumab intravenously (IV) over 30-90 minutes on day 1. ARM II (CLOSED TO ACCRUAL 10/1/2009): Patients receive imatinib mesylate PO QD on days 1-21. In both arms, courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 1 month, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually for 5 years.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>REGISTRATION # 1 Patient must have a biopsy proven diagnosis of gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) that is distantly metastatic or unresectable; patients must be determined to be unresectable for cure Patient may have measurable and/or nonmeasurable disease; computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) used for measurable disease must have been completed within 28 days prior to registration; CT or MRI used for nonmeasurable disease must have been completed within 42 days prior to registration; PET scans are not sufficient for disease assessment; all disease must be assessed and documented on the Baseline Tumor Assessment Form CT/MRI scans must be performed and submitted for central review; archived tissue must be submitted as outlined Institutions must seek additional patient consent for PET scans as outlined; if patient consents to the submission of PET scans, the patient must also be registered to Registration #2 Patient must not have known brain metastasis Patient must have a Zubrod performance status of 0 3 Patient must have resolution of transient toxicities from any prior chemotherapy, radiation therapy or surgery to =&lt; grade 1 (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE] version 3.0) Patient may have previously received traditional chemotherapeutic agents in any setting, provided at least 28 days have elapsed since completing chemotherapy and they have recovered to =&lt; grade 1 from all druginduced toxicities Patient must not have received prior treatment with bevacizumab or other agents targeting VEGF, VEGFR, or PDGFR for advanced disease; those agents may have been used in the adjuvant setting if the patient did not recur for at least 12 months following the completion of treatment; patients may be receiving imatinib for advanced disease prior to registration provided they meet ALL of the following criteria: Patient must not have received more than 30 days of imatinib treatment prior to registration Patients have not been restaged; (baseline disease assessments prior to initiation of imatinib must fulfill requirements) Patients must have no clinical signs of progression Prior radiotherapy is allowed, provided at least 28 days have elapsed since the last treatment and there is evidence of progressive disease within the radiation field or disease outside the radiation field Patient must not have had a major surgical procedure, open biopsy, or significant traumatic injury within 28 days prior to registration, or anticipation of need for major surgical procedure during the course of the study;
