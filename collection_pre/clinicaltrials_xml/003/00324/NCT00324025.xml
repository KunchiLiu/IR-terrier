	<brief_summary>This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter efficacy and safety trial to evaluate Mycograb®. Subjects will be randomized to receive either Mycograb® (dosed 1 mg/kg) or placebo during the first week of induction therapy (amphotericin B plus 5-flucytosine) via a central line or peripheral venous line twice daily for 7 consecutive days. The total duration of the study will be approximately 24 months.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of Mycograb as Adjunctive Therapy for Cryptococcal Meningitis in Patients With AIDS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group clinical trial is designed to evaluate Mycograb® versus placebo as adjunctive therapy to antifungal induction therapy (amphotericin B plus 5-flucytosine) in subjects who have acute cryptococcal meningitis associated with AIDS. After pre-study screening and baseline assessments and meeting all inclusion criteria, on Day 1 subjects will be randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms: Amphotericin B (conventional at 0.7 mg/kg, i.v. once daily) plus 5-flucytosine (100 mg/kg orally daily, divided QID), with placebo. Amphotericin B (conventional at 0.7 mg/kg, i.v. once daily) plus 5-flucytosine (100 mg/kg orally daily, divided QID), with Mycograb®. Study medication will be administered via a central line or peripheral venous line twice daily for 7 consecutive days (Days 1-7). A lumbar puncture with CSF culture colony counts, India ink microscopy, and measurement of cryptococcal antigen (CrAg) will be performed at Baseline, Days 3, 7, and 14,. CSF will also be assayed for concentrations of Mycograb® on Days 3, 7, and 14. The primary efficacy parameter will be the proportion of subjects considered cured at day 14 (combined clinical AND mycological outcome). A complimentary clinical trial will be run in parallel with this study in South America and South Africa. The protocol used will be essentially as described here except that there will be an additional (3rd) treatment arm (Amphotericin B [conventional at 0.7 mg/kg, i.v. once daily}with Mycograb®).. An interim analysis will be performed after 30 patients (US and/or non-US) have completed Day 14, for the following reasons: To evaluate the safety of Mycograb® by reviewing the adverse events classified by the investigator as possibly related to the study drug To adjust the proposed sample size if necessary. A Safety Monitoring Committee and an independent expert will assess the safety profile of Mycograb®. A total of 40 completed patients are planned for the US. It is estimated that enrollment will require 54 screened and 48 enrolled to achieve 40 completed patients. The total duration of the trial will be approximately 24 months. If the recruitment rate is low in the US, the number from the US may be reduced, having been replaced by patients outside the US where cryptococcosis is more prevalent.</detailed_description>
