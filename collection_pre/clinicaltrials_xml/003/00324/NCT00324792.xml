	<brief_title>I3LTE4: Intensive Insulin Therapy and Production of LTE4 in Patients With Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Our group has recently reported the results of a preliminary cross-sectional study, which demonstrated that the urinary LTE4 excretion is increased in patients with type 1 diabetes. With regard to recent human genetic studies showing that polymorphisms in the 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) promoter and FLAP haplotypes is linked to cardiovascular disease susceptibility our data suggested the potential interest of LTE4 as a non-invasive biomarker of cardiovascular risk. In diabetes mellitus, further studies are required to evaluate the 5-LO pathway after improvement of glucose control and concomitantly with established inflammatory cardiovascular biomarkers. The secondary objectives are: Before and after 3-month intensive insulin therapy- Relationship between a marker of platelet activation (urinary 11-dehydro-thromboxan B2 :11-dehydroTXB2) and urinary LTE4- Relationship between inflammatory plasma markers of cardiovascular risk (hs-CRP and fibrinogen) and urinary LTE4- Relationship between a plasma marker of endothelial dysfunction (sICAM-1) and urinary LTE4- Changes in LTE4 according to patient subgroups (patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus)</detailed_description>
