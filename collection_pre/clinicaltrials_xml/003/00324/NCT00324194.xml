ECOG performance status of 0, 1, or 2. Age â‰¥18 years. Laboratory requirements. Patients or their legal representative must be able to read, understand, and sign a written informed consent (approved by the IRB/EC) prior to study entry. Patients with other active malignancy except basal cell carcinoma or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN / cervical in situ). Patients with suspicion of CNS involvement (tests are not required to rule out CNS involvement in the absence of signs or symptoms). Pregnant or lactating women. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test documented within 7 days prior to registration on study. Patients and their partners, if either are of childbearing potential, not using adequate birth control measures throughout the course of the study. Both men and women enrolled on study must agree to use a medically acceptable effective form of contraception during the study and for 90 days following the last dose of study medication. An effective form of contraception is an oral contraceptive or a double barrier method, such as condom with diaphragm. Patients with serious illnesses, medical conditions, or other medical history, including laboratory results, which, in the investigator's opinion, would be likely to interfere with a patient's participation in the study, or with the interpretation of the results. Patients who have been treated with any investigational drug within 30 days prior to study initiation (an investigational drug is one for which there is no approved indication), or who are receiving concurrent treatment with other experimental drugs or anticancer therapy. Known hypersensitivity to any of the components of MGCD0103. Known HIV or Hepatitis B or C (tests do not need to be performed to rule out any of these infections).
