	<brief_title>Web-Based Follow-Up Using Cellular Phone in Type 1 Diabetic Patients Under Insulin Pump Therapy : The PumpNet Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We aim at comparing conventional follow-up of type 1 diabetic patients treated with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) (face-to-face visits) with an intensive coaching using the Web and the cellular phone network for data transmission and Short Message Service (SMS). This telecommunication device is called GlucoNet. The specific objectives are to measure the efficiency of GlucoNet in improving metabolic control, reducing health care costs and improving the quality of life of patients.</detailed_description>
