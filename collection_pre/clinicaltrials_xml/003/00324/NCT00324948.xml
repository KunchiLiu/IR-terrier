	<brief_title>Topical Alprostadil for Female Sexual Arousal Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-design study involving about 300 women who are 21-60 years of age inclusive, who have undergone a hysterectomy (with or without oophorectomy), and who have a primary diagnosis of FSAD. The diagnosis of FSAD will be made based on a medical and sexual history and confirmed using a structured interview by trained personnel. Study subjects will undergo a 2-month non-treatment run-in period followed by a 6-month period of blinded study therapy. Study drug is applied topically to the genitalia 30-60 minutes prior to initiation of sexual activity. Study subjects will complete several questionnaires at various times during the study and will complete a daily diary. The study endpoint is based on the FSEP and other standard questionnaires, as well as safety and tolerability of study drug.</detailed_description>
