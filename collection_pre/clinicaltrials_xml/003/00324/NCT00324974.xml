	<brief_title>The Use of Lansoprazole to Treat Infants With Symptoms of Gastroesophageal Reflux</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will be conducted by approximately 20 investigative sites in the U.S. and Poland. Participants who qualify will be randomized in equal proportions to receive either lansoprazole Pediatric Suspension (0.2-0.3 mg/kg/day in infants &lt;10 weeks of age or 1.0-1.5 mg/kg/day in infants &gt;10 weeks of age) or Placebo. This study consists of three periods: Pretreatment Period of 7-14 days, Double-Blind Treatment Period of 4 weeks (Dosing), and the Post-Treatment Period of 30 days (Follow-Up).</detailed_description>

Coexisting esophageal disease (e.g., eosinophilic esophagitis, viral, bacterial or fungal infection) or caustic or physiochemical trauma to the esophagus. Any congenital anomaly of the upper gastric intestinal tract that might interfere with gastrointestinal motility, pH, absorption, or active or known history of necrotizing enterocolitis that has been surgically corrected. Use of a proton pump inhibitor within 30 days prior to Dosing Day 1. Use of H2 Blockers (i.e. Zantac) within 7 days prior to Dosing Day 1. Allergy to proton pump inhibitors (i.e. Prilosec, Prevacid). Use of prokinetics (e.g., metoclopramide) unless on a stable dose for at least 3 days prior to entering the Pretreatment Period. Unable to obtain stable drug levels after continuous treatment with required drugs including theophylline derivatives, digoxin, phenytoin, phenobarbital, or carbamazepine within the 7 days prior to Dosing Day 1.
