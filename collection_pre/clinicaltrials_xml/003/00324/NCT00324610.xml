	<brief_summary>Standard administration of capecitabine use a 14 days administration. Routine practice in several intitution leads to use a 5 out of 7 days regimen, with less toxicity. Purpose : to compare the pharmacokinetics of capecitabine, administered 5 days out of 7, as compared to the standard administration (14 days out of 21). The second end point is to compare toxicity with either regimen. Method : Randomized study with two groups : one with standard administration , the second with 5/7 days regimen</brief_summary>
