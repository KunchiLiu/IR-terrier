	<brief_title>Levosimendan in Acute Heart Failure Following Acute Myocardial Infarction.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Double blind placebo-controlled study with parallel groups in patients with acute PCI treated myocardial infarction complicated with decompensated heart failure. The study include a prospectively defined subgroup of patients in cardiogenic shock. Treating acute myocardial infarction with PCI restores blood flow, but decreased contractility remains for hours and days due to stunned myocardium. Levosimendan has both inotropic and vasodilatory effects which could support the failing heart after treating the acute myocardial infarction with PCI and may improve myocardial stunning and decrease pro-inflammatory cytokines. Levosimendan could improve myocardial contractility, symptoms and outcome without adverse effects. The aims of the study are to investigate whether a 24 hour infusion with levosimendan could improve regional contractility measured by echocardiography, improve BNP levels, reduce the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and improve symptoms in patients with acute decompensated heart failure during the first 24 hours after acute PCI.</detailed_description>
