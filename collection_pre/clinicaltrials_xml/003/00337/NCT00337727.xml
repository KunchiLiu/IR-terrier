	<brief_summary>The study will test aprepitant for the prevention of CINV in patients receiving their initial cycle of Moderately Emetogenic Chemotherapy (MEC). Patients receiving more then one cycle of chemotherapy may opt to participate in an optional second cycle during which the patient will receive the same antiemetic regimen as cycle 1, except that an IV formulation of aprepitant will be given in place of the oral formulation on study day one. Study drug administration on subsequent days will be given orally as in cycle 1.</brief_summary>
