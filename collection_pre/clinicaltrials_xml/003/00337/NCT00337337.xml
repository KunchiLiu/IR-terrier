	<brief_summary>We aim to investigate the beneficial effect of adding grain fiber to daily rice meal in type 2 diabetic patients. We anticipate this intervention will improve glycemia and lipid profile in these patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Multiple Grain in Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Resistance of insulin-mediated glucose transport is a fundamental early defect in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). It has been found that high fiber concentration in meal is frequently associated with low GI. In many single-blind cross-over study, short term consumption of high fiber meal has been shown to enhance postprandial insulin sensitivity in healthy subjects. We presume that increasing daily consumption of fiber would improve the insulin resistance and therefor glycemic parameters patients with DM. Patients with type 2 diabetes with stable dose of hypoglycemic medication control will be recruited, two types of meals will be given, type A is a general Asian rice-meal and type B consists of the same rice with multiple-grain-fiber added. Both type of meals will be consumed for 3 months by each patients.</detailed_description>
