	<brief_summary>Corticosteroid therapy is usually regarded as a risk factor for the development of posterior subcapsular cataracts but prospective studies on this topic and accurate assessment of this potential adverse effect are lacking. We will evaluate changes of lens transparency after administration of systemic corticosteroid therapy for at least one year with Scheimpflug photography and quantification of lens autofluorescence.</brief_summary>
