	<brief_title>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Pathological Gambling</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects will be assigned to counseling or be given a referral list of available Gamblers Anonymous meetings at the first visit based on answers to questions. Assignment to counseling or Gamblers Anonymous will be randomly selected (i.e. chance) with an equal chance of receiving either one. For those assigned to counseling, you will meet with the therapist for 60 minutes weekly. You will receive 5 sessions of counseling. All subjects will be assessed with gambling questionnaires twice during the 5-week period and again at 3 and 6 months following the 5-week period. For those assigned to Gamblers Anonymous, they will be offered 5 weeks of counseling at the end of the 6-month follow-up.</detailed_description>
