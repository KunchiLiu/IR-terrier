	<brief_title>Computer-Based Training for Cognitive Enhancement: In Home Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The computer-based training program is focused on speech reception to strengthen an individual's memory for speech. This type of training program was chosen because speech perception and memory are crucial elements of human communication and losses in this area are often the first signal of overall cognitive decline. Subjects meeting eligibility criteria and providing written, informed consent are randomized to three groups; two 40-session, computerized training programs or a no contact control group.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>A)Participants must be at least 60 years old B)Participants must have a MiniMental State Exam (MMSE) score of 24 or higher to ensure that participants do not meet common criteria for dementia C)Participants must be a native English speaker D)Participants must be able to see well enough to read the consent form E)Participants must be able to hear well enough to understand ordinary spoken conversation in a slightly noisy room F)Participants must be willing to commit to the time requirements of the study and not have any scheduled trips or absences for more than 1 week during the training. Exclusion Criteria A)Participants must not be planning to begin cholinesterase inhibitor (AChEI) therapy or to change their dosing levels. Subjects currently using AChEI will be included if they have an established steady dosing history at least one month prior to the study and are expected to continue at the same dosage throughout the study. B)Participants must not have had a head trauma that caused them to lose consciousness. C)Participants must not have had a stroke within the past year; or have had a stroke that has left them with expressive or receptive language problems. D)Participants must not have any central nervous system disorder that could contribute to cognitive impairment. E)Participants must not have a tremor preventing the use of a computer mouse or other pointing device. F)Participants must not currently be active in another clinical trial.</criteria>
