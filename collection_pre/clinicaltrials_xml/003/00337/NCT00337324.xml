	<brief_title>Electromagnetic Stimulation (FREMS) in Patients With Painful Diabetic Neuropathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The stuy was designed as a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over trial. Each patient received two series of ten treatments of either FREMS or placebo in random sequence, with each series lasting no more than three weeks. Primary outcomes (daytime and night-time pain scores) an secondary outcomes (Motor and sensory nerve conduction velocity, sensory tactile perception, foot vibration perception threshold, quality of life, cutaneous microvascular flow, partial tissue tension of oxygen and carbon dioxide) were measured at baseline, after FREMS/placebo series and after 4 months follow-up.</detailed_description>
