	<brief_summary>This study will determine which, if any, allelic variants of mycophenolic acid (MPA) metabolizing enzymes, drug transporters and drug targets are associated with the observed variation in pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic outcomes observed with CellCept usage. Patients participating in study ML17225 will be eligible for this pharmacogenetic investigation, and will have one additional blood sample taken during the study. The anticipated time on study treatment in study ML17225 is 1-2 years, and the target sample size is 500+ individuals.</brief_summary>
