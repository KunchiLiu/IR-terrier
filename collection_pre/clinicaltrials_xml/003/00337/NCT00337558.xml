	<brief_title>A Study of Solifenacin With Bladder Training Versus Solifenacin Alone in Patients With Overactive Bladder (SOLAR)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects are screened between day -14 and day -1. At day 0 subjects will enter a randomized, parallel group study. After fulfilling all selection criteria, subjects will be randomized to one of two treatment arms, solifenacin 5mg with bladder training or solifenacin 5mg alone. After 8 weeks of treatment subjects will be sub divided; subjects on solifenacin 5mg with bladder training will be given the option to increase dose and be divided into solifenacin 5mg with bladder training or solifenacin 10mg with bladder training. Subjects on solifenacin alone, will also be given the option to increase dose and be divided into solifenacin 5mg alone and solifenacin 10mg alone. There are 5 visits in total: visit 1(screening), visit 2 (randomisation), visit 3 (week 4), visit 4 (week 8), telephone visit (week 12) and visit 5 (week 16) All subjects receive medication in the form of solifenacin succinate 5mg tablets (two tablets for 10mg) (Company code: YM905, Company serial number: RVG29151) Subjects randomized to bladder training will receive a single sheet of instructions for bladder training.</detailed_description>
