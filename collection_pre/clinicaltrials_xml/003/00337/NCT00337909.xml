	<brief_title>Computer-Based Training for Cognitive Enhancement: Classroom Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to test the new progressions design of a computer-based training program and to demonstrate the effectiveness of this refined cognitive training regimen on participants' performance on normed neuropsychological measures. Subjects meeting eligibility criteria and providing written, informed consent will complete 40 one hour sessions of a computer based training program.</detailed_description>
