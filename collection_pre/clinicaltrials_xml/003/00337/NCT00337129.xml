	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as E7389, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well E7389 works in treating patients with metastatic or recurrent head and neck cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>S0618 E7389 in Treating Patients With Metastatic or Recurrent Head and Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Evaluate the response probability (confirmed, complete, and partial responses) in patients with metastatic or recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck treated with E7389. - Estimate progression-free and overall survival probability in these patients. - Evaluate the qualitative and quantitative toxicities of this treatment regimen. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive E7389 IV on days 1 and 8. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 3 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
