	<brief_summary>This is a randomized double blind trial of the use of the use of colloids vs crystalloid solutions for resuscitation of patients after cardiac surgery. Patients are managed with an algorithm driven protocol that is based on the flow response to fluid challenges. The hypothesis is that the use of a colloid solution will result in less use of catecholamines at 8:00 the morning following surgery. Secondary end-points include total use of catecholamines, time in the ICU, return to the ICU, and safety issues including bleeding and renal function.</brief_summary>
