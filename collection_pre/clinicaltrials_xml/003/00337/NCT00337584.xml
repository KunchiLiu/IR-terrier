	<brief_summary>We are studying whether providing patients undergoing day surgery the opportunity to have their medical history reviewed by an hospital internist before surgery leads to better results after surgery. These doctors are internal medicine specialists who are experienced in assessing patients going to surgery, making sure they are "fine-tuned" before their operation. We believe this will ensure the safest and best surgical outcomes. The study involves the patient filling out a 3 page questionnaire for review by the internist prior to surgery. Additionally, patients will receive a follow-up phone call one week after surgery asking about the experience at the hospital and a questionnaire in the mail three months later to see if the patient had any medical problems after leaving the hospital.</brief_summary>
