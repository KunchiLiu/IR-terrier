	<brief_summary>The study will be extended for subjects who received all three doses of vaccine in Finland, Denmark and Estonia to determine long-term safety and immunogenicity of the HPV-16/18 vaccine. Human Papilloma virus (HPV) are viruses that cause a common infection of the skin and genitals in men and women. Several types of HPV infection are transmitted by sexual activity and, in women, can infect the cervix (part of the uterus or womb). This infection often goes away by itself, but if it does not go away (this is called persistent infection), it can lead in women over a long period of time to cancer of the cervix. If a woman is not infected by HPV, it is very unlikely that she will get cervical cancer. This study will evaluate the consistency of consecutive vaccine lots and the non-inferiority of modified manufacturing processes of GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals HPV-16/18 vaccine and the vaccine safety, over 12 months, in young adolescents and women of 10-25 years of age at study start.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>A female who enrolled in the HPV012 (NCT00337818) study in Denmark, Estonia and Finland, received three doses of vaccine and completed Visit 4 (Month 7). Written informed consent obtained from the subject prior to enrolment (for subjects below the legal age of consent, written informed consent must be obtained from a parent or legally acceptable representative (LAR) and, in addition, the subject must sign and personally date a written informed assent). Exclusion criteria Use of any investigational or nonregistered product (drug or vaccine) or planned use during the study period. Concurrently participating in another clinical study, at any time during the study period, in which the subject has been or will be exposed to an investigational or a noninvestigational product (pharmaceutical product or device). Chronic administration of immunosuppressants or other immunemodifying drugs occurring less than three months prior to blood sampling. Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the three months preceding blood sampling.</criteria>
