	<criteria>Subjects with a combination of DM (type I or II) and renal impairment (RI), defined as SCr ≥150 µmol/L (1.7 mg/dL) for men and ≥133 µmol/L (1.5 mg/dL) for women or creatinine clearance (CrCl) ≤50 mL/min calculated according to CockroftGault formula, referred for coronary angiography with or without PCI. Concurrent administration of potentially nephroprotective or nephrotoxic drugs is not allowed. Subjects undergoing dialysis or kidney transplantation or with CrCl &lt; 20 mL/min will not be included.</criteria>
