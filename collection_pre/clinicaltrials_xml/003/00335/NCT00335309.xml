	<detailed_description>Effectiveness of maxillary sinus saline irrigation in conjunction with systemic antibiotic therapy versus systemic antibiotic therapy alone in the management of chronic rhinosinusitis. A prospective randomized controlled trial is being conducted in Carmel Medical Center, Haifa, Israel. Patients are being randomized into one of two arms. One arm receives sinus irrigation with saline in conjunction with IV antibiotics, the control arm receives the same regimen of IV antibiotics without the sinus irrigation. Quality of life, CT scans and nasal endoscopy parameters are collected before and after treatment.</detailed_description>
