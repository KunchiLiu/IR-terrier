	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy of AV608 in Subjects With Idiopathic Detrusor Overactivity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of AV608 in subjects with idiopathic detrusor overactivity. Female subjects between 18 and 65 years of age with a diagnosis of Overactive Bladder Syndrome and urodynamic observation of involuntary detrusor contractions during the filling phase will be eligible for the trial. Eligible subjects will complete a baseline urodynamic assessment. All subjects who participate in the study will receive 3 weeks of treatment with AV608 or placebo. At the end of the treatment period, subjects will complete a second urodynamic assessment.</detailed_description>
