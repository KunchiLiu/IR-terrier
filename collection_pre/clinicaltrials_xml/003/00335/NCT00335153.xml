	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study will be to provide further evidence of the long-term safety and tolerability of levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel (DuodopaÂ®) over 12-months in participants with advanced Parkinson's disease (PD) and severe motor fluctuations.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study was composed of a screening period followed by 3 sequential on-treatment periods, as follows: - Screening Period (up to 28 days): determination of eligibility and discontinuation of antiparkinsonian disease medications other than levodopa-carbidopa immediate release (LC-oral) prior to nasojejunal (NJ) tube placement. - NJ Test Period (2 to 14 days): first hospitalization period, Baseline assessments, placement of NJ tube, and optimization of levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel (LCIG) treatment via NJ tube and infusion pump (participant was hospitalized for NJ tube placement but hospitalization was not required for entire duration of LCIG treatment optimization). - PEG-J Period (2 to 14 days): second hospitalization period; placement of PEG-J tube; further optimization of LCIG treatment. - Post PEG-J Long-Term Treatment Period (Day 28 to Day 378): LCIG administration via a permanent PEG-J tube and infusion pump, with dosage adjusted according to clinical condition.</detailed_description>
