	<brief_summary>The study aims to evaluate the changes in mitochondrial DNA (mDNA) by means of the mDNA/nuclearDNA (nDNA) ratio as a marker of mitochondrial toxicity following the interruption of nucleoside analogues.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study on the Effect of Kaletra + Nevirapine as Maintenance Bitherapy Compared to a Triple Therapy Including Kaletra + Analogues in HIV Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>At the moment it is known that mitochondrial toxicity is the main pathogenic mechanism of toxicity associated with nucleoside analogues, including lipoatrophy, which at facial level is a stigmatising factor for patients with HIV infection. The primary outcome measure of the design of an "NTRI-sparing" bitherapy is to retard the onset of mitochondrial toxicity or reverse it, mainly with regard to the loss of subcutaneous fat or lipoatrophy. Lopinavir/ritonavir and nevirapine are two antiretrovirals with different mutation patterns and with high antiviral potency. Their combination therefore guarantees antiviral success. The NEKA study endorses efficacy immunologically and virologically (Negredo E. et al, NRTI-sparing regimen. XIV International AIDS Conference. Barcelona 2002. LB PeB9021). Similarly, the protective effect of nevirapine on lipid metabolism would counteract the negative impact attributed to lopinavir/ritonavir, reducing cardiovascular risk in these patients.</detailed_description>
