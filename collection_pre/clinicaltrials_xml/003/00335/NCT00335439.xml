	<brief_summary>The study will evaluate the efficacy of prophylactic administration of the topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) ketorolac tromethamine 0.5% (AcularÂ®) on cystoid macular edema (CME) in patients having undergone cataract surgery. CME is the most frequent cause of decreased vision after uncomplicated cataract surgery and can result in irreversible sight reduction. The investigation will involve a comparison arm and a treatment arm with both sets of patient populations being evaluated for CME with ophthalmologic examinations and optical coherence tomography (OCT) measurements. The objective is to elucidate the role of NSAID drops in preventing CME after cataract surgery.</brief_summary>
