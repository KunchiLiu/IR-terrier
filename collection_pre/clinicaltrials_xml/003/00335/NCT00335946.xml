	<brief_title>A Pilot Investigational Study: Treatment of Anxiety With Non-Needle Electro-Acupuncture</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Persistent and unrelenting stress is defined as anxiety. Anxiety disorders are among the most common mental disorders in society. The NIH estimates that nearly 200 million Americans suffer from anxiety. Anxiety disorders are associated with a lower quality of life, functional impairment and disability, and are also associated with co-morbid physical illness. Acupuncture, one form of complementary and alternative medicine, has been used to treat anxiety. Non-needle acupuncture is one of the safest methods, with none to rare side effects. This method has been studied in China (Han 1986) and America (Ulett 1998) Pre-intervention testing, then three treatments within one week, will be followed by post intervention testing.</detailed_description>
