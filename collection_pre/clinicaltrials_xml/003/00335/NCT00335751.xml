	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Diagnostic procedures, such as PET scan and CT scan, may help doctors determine the extent of cancer and predict a patient's response to treatment and help plan the best treatment. PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well PET scan combined with CT scan evaluates treatment response in patients undergoing treatment for bone cancer or soft tissue sarcoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PET Scan Combined With CT Scan in Evaluating Treatment Response in Patients Undergoing Treatment for Bone Cancer or Soft Tissue Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine whether an FDA-approved device that combines fludeoxyglucose ^18F positron-emission tomography (FDG-PET) and CT scanning (FDG-PET/CT) can accurately locate and determine the extent of disease in patients who are undergoing treatment for bone or soft tissue sarcoma. - Determine whether FDG-PET/CT scanning is effective in evaluating the response of sarcoma to treatment. - Determine whether the new FDG-PET/CT device improves the ability to evaluate treatment response early and accurately. - Correlate changes in glucose metabolic activity early and late after treatment with overall and progression-free survival. - Correlate changes in glucose metabolic activity early and late after treatment with degree of tumor necrosis at the time of surgery. OUTLINE: This is a prospective, pilot study. Patients are stratified according to disease (high-grade soft tissue sarcoma vs low-grade soft tissue sarcoma vs osteosarcoma). Patients undergo fludeoxyglucose ^18F positron-emission tomography (FDG-PET)/CT scanning at baseline and then within 2 weeks and 12 weeks after the start of treatment (total of 3 scans). PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 120 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
