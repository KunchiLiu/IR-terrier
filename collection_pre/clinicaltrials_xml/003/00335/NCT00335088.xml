	<brief_summary>The hypothesis is that povidone iodine alone is sufficient for sterilization of the lacrimal sac and eye lids before intraocular surgeries. Patients admitted for various intraocular surgeries will be randomly allocated to prophylactic local therapy with either moxifloxacin and povidone iodine or povidone iodine alone before surgery. Lacrimal sac and eye lid cultures will be obtained before the local therapy and just before surgery.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Over all 500 patients admitted for various intraocular surgeries will be included in the study. The study will be prospective, double blind, placebo controlled, and randomized. Patients will be randomly allocated to prophylactic local therapy with either moxifloxacin and povidone iodine or povidone iodine alone before surgery. For patients treated with povidone iodine alone a placebo will also be given. Lacrimal sac and eye lid cultures will be obtained before the local therapy and just before surgery. All patients will be followed for 6 weeks for symptoms and signs of infection. Bacterial and fungal culture results will be compared between the 2 groups.</detailed_description>
