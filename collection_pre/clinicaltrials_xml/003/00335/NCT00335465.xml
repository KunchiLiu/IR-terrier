	<brief_summary>The primary objective of the present study is to assess changes of myocardial glucose uptake (MGU) during clamp studies using positron emission tomography (PET) scanning in patients with type 2 diabetes and idiopathic left ventricular dysfunction (LVD). The secondary objectives of the study are: assessment of changes of myocardial microcirculation at rest and during adenosine stimulation using PET; assessment of changes in myocardial structure and function evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); assessment of glycaemic control by measurement of HbA1c, fasting blood glucose and insulin levels; assessment of safety (adverse event profile, laboratory data).</brief_summary>
