	<brief_summary>1.Study rationale:There is no standard regimen for the advanced and/or metastatic gastric cancer patients who relapsed after adjuvant chemotherapy or failed to first systemic chemotherapy. 2.Primary Objectives:To evaluate overall response rate according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors criteria and To investigate time to response 3.Design:single-center, Open label, Phase II study. docetaxel 75mg/m2 administered on day 1 as intravenously combined with intravenous Epirubicin 60mg/m2 given day 2 every 3 weeks. 4.Primary endpoints: 1. Efficacy:overall response rate according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors criteria, time to response, duration of response, and time to treatment failure. 2. Safety-Adverse events and laboratory tests, graded according to the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Effects (version 3.0).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Male and female outpatients ≥ 18 years, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status below 1, with histologically confirmed as gastric adenocarcinoma with inoperable and/or metastatic disease. Patients must have at least one target lesion with a minimum lesion size as per the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors criteria (at least 1 unidimensional measurable lesion ≥ 20 mm in diameter by conventional CT or MRI scan, or ≥ 10 mm in diameter by spiral CT scan). Creatinine clearance ≥ 60ml/min (estimated creatinine clearance must be calculated at baseline for all patients.) Adequate major organ function : Hematopoietic function: white blood cell &gt;4,000/mm3 or absolute neutrophil count &gt; 2,000/mm3, Platelet count ≥ 100,000/mm3, Hepatic function: Bilirubin &lt; 1.5 X upper normal limit, aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase levels &lt;2.5 X upper normal limit, alkaline phosphatase &lt; 5 x upper normal limit (except in case of bone metastasis without any liver disease) Renal function: Creatinine &lt;1 x upper normal limit or creatinine clearance ≥ 60ml/min. Patients must not have previously received systemic treatment (cytotoxic chemotherapy or active/passive immunotherapy) for advanced or metastatic disease. Adjuvant or neoadjuvant treatment for nonmetastatic (M0) disease is allowed if completed at least 6 months prior to initiation of study treatment. The following laboratory values: neutrophils ≤1.5 X 109 /L, platelet count&lt;100 X 109 /L serum bilirubin ≥ 1.5 X upper normal limit, aspartate aminotransferase , alanine aminotransferase &gt; 2.5 X upper normal limit or &gt; 5 X upper normal limit in the case of liver metastases Alkaline phosphatase &gt; 2.5 X upper normal limit or 5 X upper normal limit in the case of liver metastases or &gt; 10 X upper normal limit in the case of bone disease. Prior therapy with Taxotere or Epirubicin is excluded.</criteria>
