	<brief_summary>This study will compare atorvastatin (Lipitor) with a placebo (inactive pill) to see if this drug reduces heart rhythm abnormalities (arrhythmias) or lung inflammation after thoracic surgery. Preliminary results suggest that cholesterol lowering drugs (statins) may reduce problems after surgery such as arrhythmias or lung inflammation which may be serious. This study will be randomized and double blind, meaning that patients are placed in groups purely by chance, like flipping a coin. Neither the patient or doctor will know which group the patient is in.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Atorvastatin Versus Placebo to Reduce Cardiopulmonary Complications After Thoracic Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypothesis: Statins attenuate perioperative inflammatory and oxidative mechanisms that contribute to the initiation and severity of cardiopulmonary complications after thoracic surgery. Aim 1. To determine whether prophylactic administration of atorvastatin attenuates the inflammatory and oxidative response to surgery and significantly reduces the composite risk of cardiovascular morbidity (atrial fibrillation (AF), acute coronary syndrome, myocardial infarction (MI), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), pulmonary embolism) and mortality within 30 days after thoracic surgery. Aim 2. To explore whether prophylactic administration of atorvastatin attenuates the inflammatory and oxidative (CRP, IL-6, TNF, and MPO) response to surgery and significantly reduces the overall risk of pulmonary complications (atelectasis, pneumonia, pneumonitis, acute respiratory failure) after thoracic surgery. Aim 3. To explore the association of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) changes in genes linked to atrial fibrillation and inflammatory markers and development of pulmonary morbidity after thoracic surgery. Aim 4. To explore whether an imbalance between metalloproteinase (MMP)-1 and its inhibitor (TIMP) is associated with postoperative atrial fibrillation risk and/or development of pulmonary morbidity after thoracic surgery.</detailed_description>
