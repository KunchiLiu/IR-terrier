	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to compare messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression of various genes in lymphocytes between glaucoma patients and sex and age-matched healthy subjects. A secondary objective is to analyze the impact of different forms of glaucoma or of a vasospastic propensity on the findings.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>mRNA Expression in Lymphocytes of Glaucoma Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness world-wide. Chronic primary open-angle glaucoma is the most common form among Caucasian patients. The glaucoma patients will be divided into four groups: (1) high tension glaucoma, (2) normal tension glaucoma, (3) pseudoexfoliation glaucoma, and (4) juvenile glaucoma. Healthy subjects are separated into two age groups. Vasospastic propensity will be assessed with a questionnaire: patients and subjects answering yes to the questions: "do you have always cold hands, even during summer time?" and "do other people tell you that you have cold hands?" will be classified as vasospastic, and as normals if they deny a history of cold hands. Blood will be drawn from an arm vein, lymphocytes will be isolated and mRNA of following genes will be assessed in these lymphocytes: Nuclear proteins: NF-kappa B, XPGC, P53, XIAP; Multi-drug resistance proteins: ABC 1, ABC 8, MDR 3; Adhesion protein: ICAM 1; Blood brain barrier breakdown protein: P2Y; Energy metabolism proteins: Adrenodoxin, Adrenodoxin-reductase, Cytochrome p450, Cytochrome-reductase, Alcohol-dehydrogenase; Tissue remodeling proteins: MMP 9, MMP 8, MMP 14, TIMP 1, TIMP 2, TIMP 3, TIMP 4.</detailed_description>
