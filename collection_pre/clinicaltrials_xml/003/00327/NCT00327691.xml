	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to determine the degree of additional reduction in cardiovascular risk that was accrued to patients by lowering their LDL-C beyond the currently accepted minimum target level for patients with pre-existing CHD. Secondary objectives include the safety profile of this treatment strategy, its cost-effectiveness, effect on other atherosclerotic-related events and procedures, and total mortality.</brief_summary>
