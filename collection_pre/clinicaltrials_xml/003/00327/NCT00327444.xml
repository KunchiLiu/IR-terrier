	<brief_summary>This study was designed to characterize the effect of aflibercept in participants with advanced chemoresistant ovarian cancer. Primary objective: Compare the effect of aflibercept (ziv-aflibercept, AVE0005, VEGF trap, ZALTRAPÂ®) to placebo treatment on repeat paracentesis in symptomatic malignant ascites in participants with advanced ovarian cancer Secondary objectives: Safety, tolerability, paracentesis-related parameters, participant-reported outcome.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of the Effect of Intravenous AVE0005 (VEGF Trap) in Advanced Ovarian Cancer Patients With Recurrent Symptomatic Malignant Ascites</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study included: - A Thirty (30)-day screening phase - The double blind treatment period for a minimum of 60 days. Day 1 of the double-blind treatment period was defined as the date of the qualifying paracentesis (ie, withdrawal of &gt;= 1 Liter of ascitic fluid). Participants were randomized after adequate recovery from the qualifying paracentesis (The first dose was administered on Day 1 or Day 2). - The optional open-label extension (until treatment discontinuation criteria were met) - A posttreatment follow-up phase lasting 60 days. Criteria for discontinuation included: 1. Participant or his legally authorized representative request discontinuation 2. In the Investigator's opinion, continuation of treatment would be detrimental to the participant's well being, such as disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, noncompliance, or logistical considerations 3. Sponsor request 4. Intercurrent illness that prevented further administration of investigational product(IP) 5. More than 2 IP dose reductions 6. Unacceptable adverse events (AE) not manageable by symptomatic therapy, dose delay, or dose modification 7. Arterial thromboembolic events, including cerebrovascular accidents, myocardial infarctions, transient ischemic attacks, new onset or worsening of preexisting angina 8. Radiographic evidence of intestinal obstruction (for example, dilated loops of bowel accompanied by air-fluid levels) or gastrointestinal perforation (for example, presence of extraluminal gas) requiring surgical intervention</detailed_description>
