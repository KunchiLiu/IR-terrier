	<detailed_description>The primary outcome: Mortality during the 28 day period after randomization. The secondary outcomes: Evaluation of SOFA score, ventilator-free days, dialysis free days, catecholamine free days, days of hospitalisation, incidence of nosocomial infections. The albuminemia of all patients is requested before the treatment until Day 4 post treatment. The treatment is: Vialebex 20% 100ml every 8 hours during 3 days versus saline 100ml every 8 hours during 3 days. The first patient will be in July 2006, the last patient expected is on July 2009.</detailed_description>
