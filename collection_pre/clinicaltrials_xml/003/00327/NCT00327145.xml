	<brief_summary>This study is designed to provide additional efficacy and safety data for a treatment strategy based on the combination valsartan with amlodipine in hypertensive patients previously treated with monotherapy and remaining uncontrolled. A naturalistic approach will be taken comparing two different doses, i.e. 160mg of valsartan with amlodipine 5mg and 10mg with possible addition of HCTZ</brief_summary>
