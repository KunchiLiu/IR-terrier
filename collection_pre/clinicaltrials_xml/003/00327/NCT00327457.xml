	<detailed_description>The investigators aim to use a randomized design to test the effects of 1) tailored physician recommendations, relative to non-specific recommendations, and 2) coordinated physician office management systems on patient adherence to colorectal cancer screening recommendations. To accomplish these aims, the investigators propose 1) to use existing physician practice-based computerized patient registration systems to define populations of 50 to 79 year-old pri-mary care patients, 2) to use mailed questionnaires to determine colorectal cancer risk factor status and prior colorectal cancer screening history, 3) to use responses from mailed questionnaires to identify persons not adhering to colorectal cancer screening guidelines, 4) to use computer driven algorithms to help physicians prepare and deliver individually tailored and written colorectal cancer screening recommendations, and 5) to develop, implement, and evaluate a centralized service for delivering high quality screening flexible sigmoidoscopy.</detailed_description>
