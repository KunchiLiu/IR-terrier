	<brief_summary>This study evaluated outcomes in participants with advanced ovarian epithelial adenocarcinoma receiving aflibercept. The primary objective was to compare the objective response rate of Aflibercept (ziv-aflibercept, AVE0005, VEGF trap, ZALTRAPÂ®) 4.0 mg/kg and 2.0 mg/kg, administered intravenously (IV) every 2 weeks with historical control in participants with advanced ovarian epithelial (including fallopian tube and primary peritoneal) adenocarcinoma resistant to platinum and topotecan and/or liposomal doxorubicin. The secondary objectives was to further assess efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics, potential biological and pharmacogenomic markers of study drug activity, and health-related quality of life. This study employed an Independent Review Committee (IRC) for radiological tumor assessments. For all tumor assessment-related efficacy variables, two analyses were performed: the primary analysis was based on Independent Review Committee (IRC) reviewed data and the secondary analysis was based on Investigator evaluation. If an endpoint was evaluated by the IRC, the IRC reviewed data is reported for this study.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study included: - A screening period for 21 days - Randomization at baseline (Treatment was initiated with 5 days of randomization) - A treatment period with 14-day study treatment cycles until a study withdrawal criterion was met - A follow-up period up to 60 days after the end of treatment Withdrawal criteria that led to treatment discontinuation were: - The participant or their legally authorized representative requested to withdraw - In the investigator's opinion, continuation of the study would be detrimental to the participant's well being, due to reasons such as disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, noncompliance, or logistical considerations. - A specific request by the Sponsor - Participant had intercurrent illness that prevented further administration of study treatment - Participant had more than 2 aflibercept dose reductions - Participant had arterial thromboembolic events, including cerebrovascular accidents, myocardial infarctions, transient ischemic attacks, new onset or worsening of pre-existing angina - Participant had radiographic evidence of intestinal obstruction (e.g., dilated loops of bowel accompanied by air-fluid levels) or gastrointestinal perforation (e.g., presence of extraluminal gas) requiring surgical intervention - Participant was lost to follow-up After discontinuing treatment, participants remained on the study until the last post-treatment visit or until recovery of drug related toxicities, whichever was later.</detailed_description>
