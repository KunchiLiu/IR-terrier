	<brief_summary>AMP-005 is a Phase 1b/2 clinical trial designed to evaluate whether the new drug, imexon, can be administered in combination with the approved drug, dacarbazine (DTIC), for the treatment of patients with stage III or IV inoperable melanoma. The Phase 1b part of the study is designed to determine whether the two drugs can be safely combined together, and the Phase 2 part of the study is designed to provide additional safety data and to gain an understanding of whether adding imexon to DTIC can improve the outcome for melanoma patients versus the findings from prior clinical studies of DTIC alone.</brief_summary>
