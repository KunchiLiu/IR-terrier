	<brief_title>Comparing Imatinib Standard Dose With Imatinib High Dose Induction in Pretreated Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) Patients in Chronic Phase</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with CML not achieving or losing a major cytogenetic response on whatever palliative treatment for CML, are at high risk to progress to accelerated phase and blast crisis. A new promising treatment with Imatinib (Glivec®), a tyrosine-kinase inhibitor, has been introduced recently. High rates of hematologic and cytogenetic responses can be achieved with Imatinib (Glivec®) at &gt; = 300 mg/day in chronic phase CML patients that are refractory, resistant or intolerant to interferon-alpha. However, about 10 – 20% of these high risk patients will lose their response to Imatinib (Glivec®) within 1-2 years. Therefore, improvement of the treatment is warranted. Since cytogenetic response rate is correlated to survival and the resistance to Imatinib (Glivec®) might be caused by mutations in the receptor, a more rapid decrease could lead to longer survival and/or less resistance development. In the initial 6 months of treatment, monotherapy with Imatinib (Glivec®) with a dose of 800 mg/day (high dose) should be more effective in the reduction of a high leukemic tumor burden, thereby allowing the residual normal progenitor and stem cells to expand. In addition, high dose Imatinib (Glivec®) should further improve the induction of a molecular response, as determined by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), reducing the risk of relapse from residual malignant BCR-ABL positive cells. This study will investigate the efficacy and tolerability of a short (6 months) high dose therapy followed by a standard dose compared to a continuous treatment with a standard dose of Imatinib (Glivec®). In addition, the dynamics of the molecular and cytogenetic response will be investigated. Finally, the study will investigate the effect of this induction-maintenance concept on time-to-progression (TTP).</detailed_description>

Major surgery within the last 14 days. 6. Known to be HIV positive. 7. Unstable medical disorder (except for indication) that excludes the patient in the opinion of the investigator. 8. Patient has received any other investigational agents within 28 days of first day of study drug dosing. 9. Patients with a WHO performance status score &gt; 3 10. Patients with Grade III/IV cardiac problems as defined by the New York Heart Association criteria (i.e., congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction within 6 months of study). 11.
