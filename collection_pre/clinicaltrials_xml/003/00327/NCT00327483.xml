	<brief_title>Web Based Renal Transplant Patient Medication Education</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Transplant recipients are particularly vulnerable to medication errors because of the large number of chronic drugs needed to prevent rejection and treat comorbidities. Compliance failures directly compromise patient safety through acute immunologic events and premature graft loss. For society, the loss of invested fiscal and organic (organs) resources is catastrophic. As the unique constant in the chain of people who provide, modify and consume prescription medications, health information technology should be focused on empowering the patient to prevent medication errors. Our principal clinical hypothesis is that HIT can be proven to improve patient safety by minimizing medication errors. Specific aims address the creation of new knowledge and evidence ( in a renal transplant population) of benefits of widely applicable HIT tools. Web enabled education of two groups, new (&lt;6 months) and established (&gt; 6 months), kidney transplant recipients is proposed.</detailed_description>
