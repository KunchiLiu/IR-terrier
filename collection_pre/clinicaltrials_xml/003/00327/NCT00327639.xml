	<brief_summary>Treatment of patients with beta thalassemia in North America has altered dramatically during the past 40 years, with improvements in transfusion therapy and introduction of iron chelation therapy. Thalassemia patients now enjoy an increased life expectancy to the fifth and sixth decades of life, with fertility and childbearing becoming important issues. Data regarding this important topic remain limited, without clear data regarding iron control including serial assessment of hepatic iron concentration, the need for assistance in becoming pregnant, and use of iron chelating agents during pregnancy. As the life expectancy increases and overall health improves in thalassemia, clear data on fertility, pregnancy complications, and the effect of pregnancy on maternal health in thalassemia patients are necessary since these will have a direct impact on patient care, quality of life, and patient expectations.</brief_summary>
