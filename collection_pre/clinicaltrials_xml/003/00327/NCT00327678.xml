	<brief_summary>This study is a multicenter trial of treatment for young ALL patients. All ALL patients will receive the same steroid pre-phase in order to evaluate sensitivity or resistance. Then, patients will be included into 3 specific trials according to biological features (immunophenotype, cytogenetics, and molecular biology). Group for Research on Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (GRAALL) 2005: - T ALL or B ALL non Ph (N=810 patients planned). - GRAALL 2005 R: B ALL non Ph CD20+ (N=220 patients planned). - GRAAPH 2005: ALL Ph+ (N=270 patients planned)</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>GRAALL 2005: T ALL or B ALL non Ph Randomization between standard versus intensified cyclophosphamide administration during a 4-drug, 4 week chemotherapy and late intensification. (N=810 patients planned) GRAALL 2005 R: B ALL non Ph CD20+ Randomization between standard versus intensified cyclophosphamide administration during a 4-drug, 4 week chemotherapy and late intensification. Randomization between Mabthera (rituximab) or no Mabthera during all induction and consolidation courses.(N=220 patients planned) Allogenic transplantation will be performed depending on unfavourable risk factors. GRAAPH 2005: ALL Ph Randomization between an imatinib-based induction and a chemotherapy + imatinib induction. (N=270 patients planned) Allogenic transplantation will be systematically performed in the presence of related or unrelated donors. Autologous transplantation could be performed in the absence of a donor in case of Molecular Residual Disease (MRD) â‰¤ 10-4. Consolidation therapy will be performed in the absence of a donor in case of MRD &gt; 10-4.</detailed_description>
