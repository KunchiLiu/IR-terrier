	<brief_summary>The purpose of this primary vaccination phase is to demonstrate the non-inferiority of two doses of Biologicals' Hib-MenC conjugate vaccine when given with Infanrix™ penta to infants (at 3 &amp; 5m) compared to NeisVac-C™ given with Infanrix™ hexa. The purpose of the booster vaccination phase is to evaluate the immunogenicity, safety and reactogenicity of a booster dose of the Hib-MenC vaccine given with Infanrix™ penta at 11 m of age versus NeisVac-C™ given with Infanrix™ hexa, as well as the antibody persistence prior to the administration of the booster doses. The Protocol Posting has been updated in order to comply with the FDA Amendment Act, Sep 2007.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Primary &amp; Booster Study in Infants to Demonstrate Non-inferiority, Persistence &amp; Immunogenicity of Hib-MenC Vaccine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multicenter study is open and consists of a primary and a booster phase. The study has 2 treatment groups with NeisVac-C™ + Infanrix™ hexa as active controls. In the primary phase, one blood sample will be collected from all subjects for immunogenicity analyses- one month after the second vaccination dose. In the booster phase, two blood samples will be collected: prior to and one month post booster vaccination.</detailed_description>
