	<brief_title>Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass Versus Laparoscopic Biliopancreatic Diversion (BPD)- Duodenal Switch for Superobesity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Surgery is the only treatment of morbid obesity that has proven to result in efficient and long lasting weight loss. There are few studies comparing different surgical techniques, especially in a randomized setting. Superobesity (BMI &gt; 50 kg/m2) demands an efficient surgical approach to result in satisfying weight loss. Laparoscopic techniques have been established to perform Roux-en-Y Gastric bypass and Biliopancreatic Diversion with Duodenal Switch which both are good options for treating superobesity. This study aims to compare the outcome after surgery in a broad perspective (weight loss, metabolic normalization, gastro-intestinal side effects, eating patterns, body composition, health economics). Patients will be randomized to either surgical procedure and will be followed for five years.</detailed_description>
