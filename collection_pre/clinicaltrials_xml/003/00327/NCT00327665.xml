	<brief_summary>As the licensed pneumococcal vaccine is not always satisfactory in elderly, new investigational pneumococcal vaccines are evaluated in the healthy elderly population. Note: The study consists of the primary phase (106068): vaccination and follow-up and the extension (106072) of the primary phase: 1 year follow-up. This protocol posting details the procedures of both the primary &amp; extension phase.</brief_summary>
