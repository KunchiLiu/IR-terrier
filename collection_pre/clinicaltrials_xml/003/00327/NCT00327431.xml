	<brief_summary>Research suggests that blood pressure is influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. The goal of this study is to find genes that play a role in blood pressure and understand how they interact with life events (such as job stress) to influence blood pressure. We hypothesize that the gene for endothelin-1 is associated with increased blood pressure. Further, we predict that this genetic relationship is moderated by psychosocial stress factors, specifically job strain and marital cohesion.</brief_summary>
