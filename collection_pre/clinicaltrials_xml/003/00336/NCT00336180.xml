	<detailed_description>Recent estimates of the incidence of HIV among South African youth reveal rates to be among the highest in the world. Research shows that the sexual behaviors that put youth at increased risk for HIV often occur in the context of substance use. Consequently, effective prevention programs will most likely target both types of risk behavior. Research and theory also suggest that a positive youth development approach may be an useful way to reduce risk behavior. Therefore, our study involves the implementation of a classroom-based leisure, life-skill, and sexuality education curriculum, HealthWise: Learning Life Skills for Young Adults. This program is designed to reduce substance use and sexual risk behavior and to increase healthy leisure behavior and intra- and interpersonal skills. Students from 4 high schools are currently receiving the HealthWise lessons in the 8th and 9th grades; students from 5 other schools serve as controls. Participants complete survey assessments on PalmPilots twice per year, until they leave school. Three cohorts of students are participating in this trial. Our hypothesis is that HealthWise participants will engage in less risk behavior than controls. This will be tested using various statistical methodologies, including multiple regression, structural equation modeling, and growth modeling.</detailed_description>
