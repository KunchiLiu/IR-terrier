	<brief_summary>In order to improve the clinical result of high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation for B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Zevalin will be added to the conditioning regimen. Investigators expect this radioimmunotherapy of Zevalin plus busulfan, cyclophosphamide and etoposide regimen will improve survival of relapsed or poor-risk B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Zevalin Plus BuCyE High-dose Therapy in B-cell Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Title: Combining 90Y-Ibritumomab tiuxetan (Zevalin) with high-dose chemotherapy of BuCyE and autologous stem cell transplantation in patients with relapsed, refractory, or high-risk B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma - an open-labeled phase II study. Study design: Prospective, multicenter, open-labeled, phase II trial. Study objectives: - Primary: event-free survival time following autologous stem cell transplantation with 90Y-Ibritumomab tiuxetan and BuCyE high-dose chemotherapy in patients with relapsed, refractory, or high-risk B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma - Secondary: overall survival response rate toxicity of the treatment combination Treatment: Z-BuCyE Regimen - Day 21: rituximab, 250 mg/m2, I.V. - Day 14: rituximab, 250 mg/m2, I.V. 90Y-Ibritumomab tiuxetan, 0.4 mCi/kg, I.V. - Day 7, 6, 5: busulfan 3.2 mg/kg I.V. - Day 5, 4: etoposide 200 mg/m2 I.V. every 12 hours - Day 3, 2: Cytoxan 50 mg/kg I.V. - Day 0: autologous stem cell infusion</detailed_description>
