	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to compare investigator and patient-assessed gastroesophageal reflux disease symptoms in patients with erosive GERD or endoscopic-negative GERD (enGERD). An endoscopy will be performed at study start and study end. During the study, the patients will complete a patient-orientated, self-assessed reflux questionnaire (ReQuestâ„¢ questionnaire). The study duration consists of a baseline period (8 days) and treatment period (28 days). Pantoprazole (tablet) will be administered once daily at one dose level. The study will provide further data on safety and tolerability of pantoprazole.</brief_summary>
