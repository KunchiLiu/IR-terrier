	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as S-1 and tegafur-uracil, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving S-1 or tegafur-uracil after surgery, chemotherapy, biological therapy, and/or radiation therapy may kill any remaining tumor cells. It is not yet known whether S-1 is more effective than tegafur-uracil in treating head and neck cancer. PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying S-1 to see how well it works compared with tegafur-uracil in treating patients with previously treated stage III or stage IV head and neck cancer.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Compare the disease-free survival rate in patients with definitively treated stage III or IV squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck treated with adjuvant chemotherapy comprising S-1 vs tegafur-uracil (UFT). OUTLINE: This is a randomized, controlled, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to primary site, disease stage, type of prior definitive treatment, and participating center. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients receive oral S-1 once daily on days 1-14. Courses repeat every 21 days for 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. - Arm II:Patients receive oral tegafur-uracil (UFT) once daily on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 21 days for 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 500 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
