	<brief_summary>This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of vorinostat when given together with azacitidine in treating patients with nasopharyngeal cancer or nasal natural killer T-cell lymphoma that has recurred (come back) at or near the same place as the original (primary) tumor, usually after a period of time during which the cancer could not be detected or has spread to other parts of the body. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as vorinostat and azacitidine, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Vorinostat and azacitidine also may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving vorinostat together with azacitidine may kill more cancer cells.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vorinostat and Azacitidine in Treating Patients With Locally Recurrent or Metastatic Nasopharyngeal Cancer or Nasal Natural Killer T-Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Define toxicity profile of escalating doses of suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) given in conjunction with a fixed dose of 5 Azacytidine (5AC) (azacitidine) in patients with locally recurrent and metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma and natural killer (NK)-T cell nasal lymphoma. II. Define the biologically optimal dose of SAHA given in conjunction with a fixed dose of 5AC in patients with locally recurrent and metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma and NKT cell nasal lymphoma based on evidence of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) lytic induction in tumor biopsies and plasma. III. Study the effect of 5AC on the pharmacokinetic of SAHA in patients with locally recurrent and metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma and NK-T cell nasal lymphoma. IV. Assess the effect of SAHA on histone acetylation as measured in tumor and peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients with locally recurrent and metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma and NK-T cell nasal lymphoma V. Assess the effect of 5AC on EBV promoter demethylation as measured in tumor patients with locally recurrent and metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma and NK-T cell nasal lymphoma. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of vorinostat (SAHA). Patients receive azacitidine subcutaneously (SC) on days 1-10 and vorinostat orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-14. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with responding disease may continue treatment at the discretion of the principal investigator. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of SAHA until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined.</detailed_description>
