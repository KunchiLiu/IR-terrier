	<brief_summary>This proposal examines the impact of an augmented competency based approach to training of home visitors and supervisors for delivery of the Nurse Family Partnership (NFP) on staff performance, fidelity to the program model, and family outcomes relative to child maltreatment and early behaviors associated with youth violence. The central premise underlying the proposed study is that the augmented competency based curriculum and clinical consultation to supervisors will improve nurses' knowledge and skills in working with families, which in turn, will lead to greater fidelity to the home visit guidelines (i.e., quality implementation), which in turn, will result in better maternal and child health outcomes.</brief_summary>
