	<brief_title>Study Comparing the Safety and Efficacy of Cethromycin to Clarithromycin for the Treatment of Community-Acquired Pneumonia (CAP)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lower respiratory tract infections remain one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Increasing rates of antibiotic resistance and newer, more pervasive pneumonia-causative pathogens contribute to this statistic. Currently available macrolide antibiotics for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia are slowly losing effectiveness, resulting in the need to develop newer drugs to fight resistant infections. In this study, we compare the safety and efficacy of a common macrolide, clarithromycin, to a new ketolide, cethromycin.</detailed_description>
