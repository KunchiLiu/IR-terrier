	<brief_summary>This study examines the effect of intravitreally administered VEGF Trap in patients with wet AMD. The purpose of this trial is to assess the ocular and systemic safety and tolerability of repeated intravitreal doses of VEGF Trap in patients with subfoveal choroidal neovascularization (CNV) due to AMD.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy of Repeated Intravitreal Administration of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) Trap in Patients With Wet Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a double masked, prospective, randomized study in which five groups of approximately 30 patients meeting the eligibility criteria will be randomly assigned in a balanced ratio to receive a series of intravitreal (IVT) injections of VEGF Trap into the study eye at 4- or 12 -week intervals over a 12-week period. After Week 12, patients will be evaluated every 4 weeks. Patients will remain on study or may be eligible to enter a long-term extension study, in which they will continue to receive VEGF Trap.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subfoveal CNV secondary to AMD. Central retinal (including lesion) thickness ≥ 300 µm as measured by Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT). Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) bestcorrected visual acuity of 73 letters to 34 letters. History of any vitreous hemorrhage within 4 weeks prior to Day 1. Aphakia. Significant subfoveal atrophy or scarring. Prior treatment with the following in the study eye: Subfoveal thermal laser therapy. Submacular surgery or other surgical intervention for the treatment of AMD. Extrafoveal laser coagulation treatment within 12 weeks prior to Day 1. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) within 12 weeks prior to Visit 2 (Day 1). Pegaptanib sodium (Macugen) within 8 weeks of Visit 2 (Day 1). Juxtascleral steroids or anecortave acetate within 24 weeks (6 months) prior to Visit 2 (Day 1). Intravitreal administration of triamcinolone acetonide or other steroids within 24 weeks prior to Visit 2 (Day 1), unless no visible residue of drug substance can be seen in the vitreous cavity using indirect ophthalmoscopy. Prior systemic or intravitreal treatment with VEGF Trap, ranibizumab (Lucentis) or bevacizumab (Avastin). Presence of any other condition or laboratory abnormality, which, in the opinion of the Investigator, would interfere with the assessment of disease status/progression or jeopardize the patient's appropriate participation in this Phase II study.</criteria>
