	<brief_title>ILF With/Without Cisplatin for Advanced Gastric Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Irinotecan, in combination with 5-FU or cisplatin, clearly demonstrated efficacy against gastric cancer. A previous randomized study of ILF regimen versus IP in patients with AGC showed that the ILF produced an overall response rate of 42% and a median survival of 10.7 months, which were significantly better than the results with IP regimen [Pozzo C, et al. Ann Oncol 2004]. However, since cisplatin is still considered one of the key drugs for the treatment of gastric cancer, a combination of these four drugs (irinotecan, leucovorin, FU and cisplatin) seemed to be a promising strategy for advanced AGC. We desinged this randomized phase II study to compare the combination of irinotecan, leucovorin and 5-FU (ILF) with ILF plus cisplatin (PILF) as first-line chemotherapy in patients with measurable metastatic gastric cancer.</detailed_description>
