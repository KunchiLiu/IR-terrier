	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and feasibility of BXT-51072 as a cardioprotective agent in diabetics undergoing elective angioplasty / percutaneous intervention (PCI), a procedure to "open" coronary arteries. BXT-51072 belongs to a class of drugs called "glutathione peroxidase mimics." BXT-51072 works by imitating a substance produced in various tissues in the body, which prevents damage of the heart and blood vessels.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase 2 Study to Determine the Effects of BXT-51072 in Diabetic Patients Undergoing Angioplasty (PCI)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Following screening, baseline measurements and informed consent, patients will receive BXT-51072 40 mg or placebo in a 2:1 ratio, 30 minutes before their scheduled PCI and then three times per day for 2 days. There will be 5 treatment visits and 3 follow-up visits. Blood samples will be obtained for CK-MB, troponin and routine chemistry. A 24-hour continuous electrocardiogram will be obtained following the PCI and regular electrocardiograms will be obtained during the study and follow-up period.</detailed_description>
