	<brief_title>Motion Characteristics of the Foot and Ankle as Measured by Durometer Readings</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will assess and establish the motion characteristics of the foot and ankle with the use of a durometer as a measure of motion patterns. The durometer is a device commonly used in materials testing that measures displacement through the use of a piezoelectric sensor configured to detect motion a in the form of a reflected wave back from the surface being tested.</detailed_description>
