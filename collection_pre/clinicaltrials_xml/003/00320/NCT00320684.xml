	<brief_title>Serotonin Transporter Concentrations in Women With a History of Anorexia Nervosa</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a serious eating disorder that is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Despite being dangerously underweight, people with AN believe that they are overweight, and frequently exhibit symptoms of depression and anxiety. Other symptoms of AN include the following: resistance to maintaining a healthy body weight; fear of gaining weight or becoming overweight; and denial of the seriousness of one's current low body weight. Relapse rates for AN are extremely high. Serotonin is a neurotransmitter, or chemical messenger, that affects mood, impulse control, and appetite. A serotonin transporter is a specialized protein that allows cells to communicate with each other by using serotonin. Disturbances in the serotonergic system, the network of nerve cells that uses serotonin as its neurotransmitter, may contribute to the behaviors that are characteristic of AN. This study will compare women with a history of AN who are now maintaining a normal weight to healthy women of normal weight in terms of the concentration of serotonin transporter in their brains. Participants in this observational study will undergo one positron emission tomography (PET) scan and one magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. Both will be used to measure the concentration of the serotonin transporter. A radioactive tracer will be used for the PET scan, and will be administered via an intravenous catheter line. No treatment will be provided in this study.</detailed_description>
