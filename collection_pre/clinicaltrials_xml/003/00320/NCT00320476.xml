	<brief_summary>Multiple Myeloma is a incurable disease. Recently developed targeted therapy gave new hope for the patients with multiple myeloma. Velcade in combination with other agents are currently in trials for the newly diagnosed patient, we designed sequential treatment with VTD and MPT for the patients who are not transplant candidates. This would be expected to result in maximal tumor control, and thus, in maximal survival benefit, equivalent to high dose therapy with autologous transplantation in younger population</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>VTD Followed By MPT Maintenance As a First Line Treatment For The Patients With MM Who Are Non-Transplant Candidates</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The two effective and non-cross resistant regimens, VTD and MPT, will be applied sequentially to the patients with multiple myeloma who are not transplant candidates. This would be expected to result in maximal tumor control, and thus, in maximal survival benefit, equivalent to high dose therapy with autologous transplantation in younger population</detailed_description>
