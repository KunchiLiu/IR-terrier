	<brief_title>Irinotecan Discontinuation and Reintroduction for Advanced Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For medically-fit patients with advanced colorectal cancer, the current standard approach is chemotherapy with FOLFIRI or FOLFOX. Although a strategy of using sequential 5-FU, irinotecan and oxaliplatin has been thought to maximize overall survival in such patients, significant toxicity remains a problem. It has been suggested feasible that chemotherapy can be discontinued after 2-3 months and restart same treatment on progression in patients with chemosensitive colorectal cancer. Thus we designed this pilot phase II study to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of first-line FOLFIRI discontinuation after initial 8 cycles and reintroduction after progression.</detailed_description>
