	<brief_summary>The purpose of this trial is to assess the ocular and systemic safety and tolerability of a single intravitreal injection of VEGF Trap in patients with subfoveal choroidal neovascularization (CNV) due to AMD.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Tolerability Study of Intravitreal VEGF-Trap Administration in Patients With Neovascular AMD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study consists of three parts, Part A, Part B and Part C. Part A is a dose escalation. Part B was terminated early. The (one) subject who received Macugen is not discussed in this website. Part C had subjects receive one of two doses of VEGF Trap (0.15 mg or 4.0 mg). This is the first study in which human subjects received intravitreal injections of VEGF Trap in a study eye.</detailed_description>
