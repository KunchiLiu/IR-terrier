	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of dasatinib with that of high-dose (800-mg) imatinib in participants with chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia who achieved only a suboptimal response after at least 3 months of monotherapy with 400-mg imatinib. The safety of these treatments will also be evaluated.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Dasatinib in Patients With Chronic Phase Chronic Myeloid Leukemia and a Suboptimal Response to Imatinib</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants were randomized 2:1 to dasatinib or high-dose imatinib, respectively. Randomization was stratified by a suboptimal response, defined as a hematologic response less than a complete hematologic response after at least 3 months of monotherapy with 400-mg imatinib; a cytogenic response (CgR) less than a partial CgR (PCgR) after at least 6 months of monotherapy with 400-mg; a PCgR after at least 12 months of monotherapy with 400-mg imatinib; or less than a major molecular response with a complete CgR after at least 18 months of monotherapy with 400-mg imatinib. Participants received either dasatinib or imatinib for 12 months or until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, consent withdrawal, or study discontinuation. After 12 months, who had a confirmed major molecular response and were still receiving dasatinib, 100 mg, or imatinib, 800 mg, were eligible to extend treatment for an additional 12 months. Participants permanently discontinuing treatment before 12 months were considered treatment failures and withdrawn from the study.</detailed_description>
