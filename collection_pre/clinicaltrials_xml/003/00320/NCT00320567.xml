	<brief_title>The Effect of Norgestimate/Ethinyl Estradiol on Bone Density in Pediatric Subjects With Anorexia Nervosa</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although oral contraceptives are prescribed in an effort to prevent bone loss in adolescents with anorexia nervosa, there have been no previous definitive placebo-controlled studies evaluating the effectiveness of oral contraceptive treatment on bone mineral density in pediatric females with anorexia nervosa. This is a randomized (patients are assigned different treatments based on chance), multicenter, double-blind (neither the patient nor the physician knows whether drug or placebo is being taken, or at what dosage), placebo-controlled study to evaluate the bone mineral density in pediatric patients with anorexia nervosa following treatment with norgestimate/ethinyl estradiol or placebo for 13 consecutive 28-day cycles. Norgestimate/Ethinyl Estradiol is packaged in a 28-day blistercard. Each tablet contains the following: a) Days 1-7 0.180 mg norgestimate/0.035 mg ethinyl estradiol b) Days 8-14 0.215 mg norgestimate/0.035 mg ethinyl estradiol c) Days 15-21 0.250 mg norgestimate/0.035 mg ethinyl estradiol d) Days 22-28 inactive tablets;One tablet is to be taken once daily by mouth. After 28 days, the next cycle is started the following day without interruption. Color-matched placebo tablets are identically pack</detailed_description>
