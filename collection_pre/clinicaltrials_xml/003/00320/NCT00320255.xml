	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to learn whether apixaban is well-tolerated and acceptable as anticoagulant therapy, when administered to patients with advanced or metastatic cancer and at increased risk for venous thromboembolic events. Demonstration of a favorable benefit:risk profile could lead to significant reduction in this serious and sometimes fatal complication of ongoing cancer and its treatment.</brief_summary>
