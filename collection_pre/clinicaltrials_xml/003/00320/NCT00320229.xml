	<brief_summary>The aim of our study was to demonstrate that, during a percutaneous coronary intervention, even smaller amounts of abciximab than standard dose, injected locally, could achieve a rapid thrombus resolution and clinical improvement without concomitant differences in hemorrhagic complications</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Half-Dose Intracoronary Abciximab Bolus Improves the Mortality Outcome Compared to Standard Intravenous Regimen</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients both with acute myocardial infarction and unstable angina are prone to extensive intracoronary thrombosis, leading to acute deterioration during percutaneous coronary intervention or thrombosis of the device despite therapy. Intracoronary use of abciximab has reported favourable results. We randomly assigned 84 patients to intracoronary half abciximab bolus (group A) and to standard regimen (group B).</detailed_description>
