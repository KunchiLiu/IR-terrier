	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate and conduct an exploratory comparison of the efficacy and safety of indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) guided photodynamic therapy (PDT) and fluorescein angiography (FA) guided PDT for exudative age-related macular degeneration (AMD) accompanied with polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PDT Study for Exudative AMD With PCV</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PDT with verteporfin has been proven beneficial for patients with AMD. The laser spot size is decided based on FA finding (FA guided PDT). ICGA is needed to detect PCV lesions, such as polypoidal lesions or abnormal network vessels. In clinical practice, PDT based on ICGA (ICGA guided PDT) has and is being conducted for the treatment of AMD with PCV. However, there are no reports on the outcomes of prospective research of PDT for PCV in Japanese patients. Furthermore, there are no reports comparing FA guided PDT and ICGA guided PDT. We propose to conduct this clinical research in order to investigate the efficacy and safety of PDT for PCV in Japanese patients, and to compare results of FA guided PDT and ICGA guided PDT.</detailed_description>
