	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Chemoprevention is the use of certain drugs to keep cancer from forming, growing, or coming back. The use of nitric oxide-releasing acetylsalicyclic acid may prevent colorectal cancer. PURPOSE: This randomized phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of nitric oxide-releasing acetylsalicyclic acid in preventing colorectal cancer in patients at high risk of colorectal cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nitric Oxide-Releasing Acetylsalicyclic Acid in Preventing Colorectal Cancer in Patients at High Risk of Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Evaluate the effects of nitric oxide-releasing acetylsalicyclic acid on aberrant cryptic foci (ACF) in patients at high risk for colon cancer. Secondary - Determine the pharmacokinetic profile of this drug in these patients. - Determine the presence or absence of ACF in these patients. - Determine the expression of PGE2, COX-1, COX-2, NF-kB, and β-catenin in colon tissue. - Determine the safety and tolerability of long-term nitric oxide-releasing acetylsalicyclic acid in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group study. Patients are stratified according to gender and race (black vs non-Hispanic white vs Hispanic white vs Asian). Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients receive oral nitric oxide-releasing acetylsalicyclic acid twice daily for 6 months. - Arm II: Patients receive nitric oxide-releasing acetylsalicyclic acid twice daily for 6 months at a higher dose than in arm I. - Arm III: Patients receive oral placebo twice daily for 6 months. Patients undergo sigmoidoscopies at baseline and at the completion of study treatment. Biopsies of aberrant cryptic foci (ACF) and non-ACF sites are collected at both sigmoidoscopies. Tissue is examined for biomarkers (PGE_2, COX, NF-kB, β-catenin). After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 240 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
