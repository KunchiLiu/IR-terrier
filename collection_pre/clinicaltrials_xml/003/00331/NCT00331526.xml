	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Biological therapies, such as cellular adoptive immunotherapy, may stimulate the immune system in different ways and stop tumor cells from growing. Aldesleukin may stimulate the white blood cells, including lymphokine-activated killer cells, to kill tumor cells. Giving cellular adoptive immunotherapy during or after surgery may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well cellular adoptive immunotherapy works in treating patients with glioblastoma multiforme.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cellular Adoptive Immunotherapy in Treating Patients With Glioblastoma Multiforme</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the feasibility, side effects, and toxicity associated with intracranial cellular adoptive immunotherapy comprising aldesleukin-stimulated lymphokine-activated killer cells in patients with glioblastoma multiforme. - Determine progression-free and overall survival of these patients. - Compare survival of these patients to that of contemporary and historical controls. OUTLINE: Patients undergo therapeutic craniotomy. Patients undergo leukapheresis to obtain lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells 3-7 days before therapeutic craniotomy OR 4-6 weeks after therapeutic craniotomy. Patients receive cellular adoptive immunotherapy comprising aldesleukin-stimulated LAK cells intracranially at the time of therapeutic craniotomy OR via an Ommaya reservoir (placed during craniotomy) no sooner than 4-6 weeks after therapeutic craniotomy. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 5 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
