	<brief_summary>This trial is conducted in Asia, Europe and South America. The aim of this research is to compare the efficacy (reduction in HbA1c and blood glucose) and pulmonary safety (pulmonary function tests, chest x-rays) of mealtime inhaled insulin with subcutaneous insulin aspart both in combination with insulin detemir in Type 2 Diabetes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy of Inhaled Insulin in Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The decision to discontinue the development of AERxÂ® is not due to any safety concerns. An analysis concluded that fast-acting inhaled insulin in the form it is known today, is unlikely to offer significant clinical or convenience benefits over injections of modern insulin with pen devices.</detailed_description>
