	<brief_summary>Ranibizumab is a humanised recombinant monoclonal antibody fragment targeted against human vascular endothelial growth factor A. This study will assess the safety and efficacy of ranibizumab administered on an as-needed dosing regimen in patients with subfoveal choroidal neovascularization (CNV) secondary to age-related macular degeneration (AMD).</brief_summary>
