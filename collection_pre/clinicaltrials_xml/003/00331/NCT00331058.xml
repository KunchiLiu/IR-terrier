	<brief_summary>The primary goal of this study is to compare the expression of key GSK drug targets across the 4 asthma phenotypes and healthy subjects and secondarily to evaluate changes in target expression in response to a 2-week course of corticosteroids across the 4 asthma phenotypes. Each asthmatic subject in this study will undergo two bronchoscopies. Each healthy subject will undergo one bronchoscopy.</brief_summary>
