	<brief_summary>Hypothesis: Treatment with Glatiramer acetate prevents deterioration of gait in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. During the study patients will undergo a 3 dimensional gait analysis before starting treatment with glatiramer acetate and after 1 year of treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gait Evaluation in Multiple Sclerosis Patients Treated With Glatiramer Acetate</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with a definite diagnosis of relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) will undergo a 3 dimensional gait analysis before initiation of treatment with glatiramer acetate. The gait analysis will include kinematic evaluation using a Charnwood Dynamics CODA CX-1 system, 4 AMTI force plates and a Noraxon telemetric EMG system. Patients will be videotaped and will also undergo a detailed physical examination by a physical therapist. Treatment with Glatiramer acetate will be initiated after the gait analysis. Therapy will be observed and controlled by a neurologist fromn the staff of the Multiple Sclerosis Center. Repeat gait analysis will be performed after one year of treatment.</detailed_description>
