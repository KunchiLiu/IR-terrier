	<brief_summary>We initiate a study with research grant from department of health and Taoyuan mental hospital and choose risperidone and olanzapine as study medications. We compare the incidence of using anticholinergic drugs in schizophrenic patients of Han ethnics with neuroleptic-induced acute dystonia or parkinsonism to test the hypothesis that these two medications have different EPS incidence in EPS intolerant population.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Risperidone and Olanzapine for the Schizophrenic Patients With Neuroleptic-Induced Acute Dystonia or Parkinsonism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective: First generation antipsychotics frequently induced extrapyramidal side effects (EPS). Second generation antipsychotics were the choices for EPS intolerant schizophrenic patients. But which one of second generation antipsychotic was the better choice did not have definitive results. We compared risperidone and olanzapine in schizophrenic patients with acute dystonia or parkinsonism side effects and observed the incidence of needing concomitant anticholinergic drugs. We also collected the data of average dose of risperidone and olanzapine to help the dosing strategy guidelines for EPS intolerant schizophrenic patients. Method: This randomized, rater-blind, parallel group, flexible dose study enrolled patients from Taoyuan Mental Hospital from July 2000 to July 2003. Schizophrenia (DSM-IV) patients who met the research criteria of neuroleptic-induced acute dystonia or parkinsonism research criteria of DSM-IV and greater than moderate severity (＞4) of global impression of extrapyramidal syndrome rating scale (ESRS). 70 patients were random assignment to risperidone or olanzapine for 8 weeks. The primary outcome was to compare the incidence of concomitant anticholinergic drugs.</detailed_description>
