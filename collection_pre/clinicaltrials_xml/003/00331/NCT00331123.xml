	<brief_title>Study of Transdermal Testosterone Patches in Surgically Menopausal Women With Low Libido</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Women with hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) who had undergone bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and hysterectomy were randomized into a 52-week, multicenter, multinational study that included a 24-week, double-blind (DB), parallel-group, placebo-controlled period followed by a 28-week open-label (OL) period. Patients were stratified based on their use of oral or transdermal ET and randomized to receive placebo or testosterone transdermal system. Patients had to maintain a stable dose of estrogen throughout the study. Upon completion of the DB period, patients receiving placebo were switched to TTS, while the active cohort remained on active treatment. All patients were then followed for an additional 28 weeks for safety. Patients who completed the first 52 weeks of the study were given the opportunity to participate in an open label extension (Years 2, 3 , and 4), which was added to the protocol by amendment. Safety was assessed by adverse events, lipids, serum chemistry with hepatic, renal and carbohydrate metabolism evaluation, coagulation testing, and hematology. Physical exam including clinical assessments of facial hair and acne were monitored.</detailed_description>
