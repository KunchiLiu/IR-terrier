	<brief_title>ELDA: Elderly Breast Cancer - Docetaxel in Adjuvant Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Adjuvant combination chemotherapy, given after breast cancer surgery, has been established as the standard approach to reduce the risk of breast cancer recurrence in those patients at intermediate or high risk for recurrence. However, since elderly patients have been underrepresented in past clinical trials, the optimal adjuvant therapy for elderly patients at risk for recurrence has not yet been defined. Docetaxel is one of the most active drugs for patients with metastatic breast cancer and several trials are evaluating its efficacy in the adjuvant setting. Administration of docetaxel on a weekly schedule is effective and well tolerated in women with metastatic breast cancer. In this study, patients from ages 65 to 80 will be randomized to one of two treatment strategies: - standard adjuvant chemotherapy with CMF (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil given intravenously on days 1 and 8 of each cycle) - experimental adjuvant chemotherapy with weekly docetaxel (given intravenously on days 1,8, and 15 of each cycle) In both treatment strategies: - 4 cycles of chemotherapy will administered for patients at least 10% positive for ER or PgR, and 6 cycles will administered for patients expressing &lt; 10% ER or PgR - patients with any positive expression of ER or PgR will receive adjuvant hormonal therapy with tamoxifen (20mg/day for 5 years) after concluding chemotherapy - adjuvant radiation therapy will be given to patients who are candidates at the conclusion of chemotherapy and within 6 months of surgery.</detailed_description>
