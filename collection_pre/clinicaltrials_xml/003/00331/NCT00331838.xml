	<brief_summary>The primary objective was to demonstrate the dose-response of Semuloparin sodium (AVE5026) for the prevention of Venous Thromboembolism [VTE] in patients undergoing total knee replacement [TKR] surgery. Secondary objectives were to evaluate the safety (incidence of major bleeding) of AVE5026, to document the efficacy and safety of AVE5026 post-operative regimens, and to assess the pharmacokinetic parameters of AVE5026.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The randomization had to take place before the first study drug injection. The total duration of observation per participant was 27-33 days from surgery broken down as follows: - 4 to 10-day double-blind treatment period; - Follow-up period up to Day 30 ± 3 after surgery. Mandatory bilateral venography of the lower limbs had to be performed between 5 to 11 days after surgery.</detailed_description>
