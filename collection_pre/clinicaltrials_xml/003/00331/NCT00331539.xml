	<brief_summary>Cochlear implants require programming on an individual basis to provide appropriate levels of electrical stimulation. This program, or "map", is placed in the speech processor of the cochlear implant. Success of implantation largely depends on the adequacy of this map. Cochlear implant fitting remains a difficult challenge in congenitally or pre-linguistically deafened children. It requires competence of experienced audiologists with expertise in behavioral techniques for hearing function assessment.Our goal is to establish the offset correlation between objective measurements (NRT and ESRT) and the behavioral measurements of T &amp; Cs in different stimulation rates in the Freedom SP System.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>An open trail. The implantees will go through their routine programming sessions after implantation, the specified data will be collected and analyzed in order to establish the offset correlation which we seek for.</detailed_description>
