	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Specialized radiation therapy (RT), such as intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), that delivers a high dose of radiation directly to the tumor may kill more tumor cells and cause less damage to normal tissue. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving intensity-modulated radiation therapy to the pelvis with or without chemotherapy after surgery may kill any tumor cells that remain after surgery. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well intensity-modulated radiation therapy to the pelvis with or without chemotherapy works in treating patients with endometrial cancer or cervical cancer that has been removed by surgery.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the transportability of intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) to a multi-institutional setting in patients with resected endometrial or cervical cancer. - Compare the efficacy, in terms of reducing short-term bowel injury, of IMRT versus standard treatments. - Assess adverse events related to this regimen. - Estimate the rates of local-regional control, distant metastasis, and disease-free and overall survival. - Evaluate chemotherapy compliance with this regimen for patients with cervical carcinoma. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to diagnosis (cervical vs endometrial cancer). All patients undergo intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) once a day, 5 days a week, for 5.5 weeks. Patients with cervical cancer also receive cisplatin IV over 30-60 minutes on day 1 or 2. Treatment with cisplatin repeats every 7 days for 5 courses (during radiotherapy) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 6 weeks post-IMRT and then every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for years 3-5, and then annually for at least 3 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 92 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
