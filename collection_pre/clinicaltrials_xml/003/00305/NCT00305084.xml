	<brief_summary>The main objective of the trial is to document the safety of the combination (escalation doses of NGR-hTNF, from 0.2 mcg/sqm to 1.6 mcg/sqm , with a fixed dose of doxorubicin, 75 mg/sqm). Safety will be established by clinical and laboratory assessment according to National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI-CTC ).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of NGR-hTNF in Combination With Doxorubicin in Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a phase IB, open-label, non-randomized, dose-escalation study that will be conducted in sequential cohorts of patients. Three patients per each cohort are planned. Patients, with advanced or metastatic solid tumor previously treated with a non cumulative dose of doxorubicin (&lt;300 mg/sqm in order to allow an adequate number of cycles) or chemotherapy naïve will be enrolled.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients ≥18 years old with proven advanced or metastatic solid tumor not amenable to any clinical improvement by current standard treatments and previously treated with a non cumulative dose of anthracyclines (&lt;300 mg/sqm) or chemotherapy naïve.

Absence of any conditions involving hypervolemia and its consequences.

Patients both males and females with reproductive potential (i.e. menopausal for less than 1year and not surgically sterilized) must practice effective contraceptive measures throughout the study. Women of childbearing potential must provide a negative pregnancy test (serum or urine) within 14 days prior to registration</criteria>
