	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to determine the usefulness of Microvolt T Wave Alternans (MTWA) testing of patients that have had a heart attack and have decreased pumping ability of the lower chamber of their heart. MTWA testing is a non-invasive test used to detect the likelihood of developing abnormally fast rhythms in the lower chambers of the heart. The objective of the study is to prove that if a patient has a positive MTWA test, they will be more likely to develop abnormally fast and dangerous rhythms in the lower chambers of the heart. The results of the study will help doctors to determine which patients would benefit the most from having an Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD) implanted.</brief_summary>
