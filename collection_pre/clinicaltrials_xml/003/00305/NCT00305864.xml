	<brief_summary>This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of motexafin gadolinium when given together with temozolomide and radiation therapy and to see how well they work in treating patients with newly diagnosed supratentorial glioblastoma multiforme or gliosarcoma. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as temozolomide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Motexafin gadolinium may help temozolomide work better by making tumor cells more sensitive to the drug. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Motexafin gadolinium may also make tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy. Giving motexafin gadolinium together with temozolomide and radition therapy may kill more tumor cells.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Motexafin Gadolinium, Temozolomide, and Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma Multiforme or Gliosarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of motexafin gadolinium (MGd) when given concurrently with temozolomide and radiotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed supratentorial glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) or gliosarcoma. II. Estimate the overall survival of patients treated with concurrent radiotherapy, temozolomide, and MGd followed by post-radiation temozolomide. III. Determine the short- and long-term adverse effects in patients treated with this treatment. IV. Estimate the progression-free survival of patients with newly diagnosed supratentorial GBM or gliosarcoma treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of motexafin gadolinium (MGd). PHASE I: Patients undergo radiotherapy once daily on days 1-5, 8-12, 15-19, 22-26, 29-33, and 36-40. Beginning the night before the first dose of radiotherapy and ending the night before the last dose of radiotherapy, patients receive concurrent oral temozolomide once daily on days 0-39. Patients also receive MGd IV over 30 minutes prior to radiotherapy once daily on days 1-5 and 8-12 and then on days 15, 17, 19, 22, 24, 26, 29, 31, 33, 36, 38, and 40. Beginning 28 days after the completion of radiotherapy, patients receive oral temozolomide once daily on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-7 patients receive escalating doses of MGd until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which no more than 6 eligible patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. PHASE II: Patients undergo radiotherapy and receive temozolomide as in phase I. Patients also receive MGd as in phase I at the MTD determined in phase I. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 2 months for 1 year, every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.</detailed_description>
