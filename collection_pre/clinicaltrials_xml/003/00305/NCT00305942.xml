	<brief_summary>This proposed phase II trial will investigate the combination of topotecan/carboplatin in the first-line treatment of patients with extensive-stage SCLC. Topotecan/platinum regimens are emerging as common treatments for patients with extensive-stage disease. This trial will be one of the first clinical trials to evaluate a combination of weekly topotecan and carboplatin in the first-line treatment of extensive-stage SCLC.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Topotecan and Carboplatin in the First-Line Treatment of Patients With Extensive Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Eligible patients will receive treatment with carboplatin and topotecan. Topotecan 4mg/m2 IV on days 1, 8. Carboplatin AUC=5 IV day 1 only . - Cycles are repeated every 21 days for &gt; 4 cycles of topotecan and carboplatin (maximum 6 courses). Restaging studies will be performed every 2 cycles (or 6 weeks.)</detailed_description>
