	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Determining whether erlotinib passes into the cerebrospinal fluid may help in planning treatment for some types of cancer. PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well erlotinib is able to pass into the cerebrospinal fluid of patients receiving erlotinib for stage III non-small cell lung cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cerebrospinal Fluid Levels of Erlotinib in Patients Receiving Erlotinib For Stage III Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the cerebrospinal fluid penetration of erlotinib in a subset of patients who are undergoing treatment with erlotinib for stage III non-small cell lung cancer and have no CNS metastatic disease. OUTLINE: This is a pilot, nonrandomized study. Patients will undergo single lumbar puncture (LP) to remove cerebrospinal fluid for analysis. After completion of study, patients will be monitored for 1 month after LP to assess for any LP-related complications. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Patients must be enrolled in the trial: "A Phase I/II Trial of Neoadjuvant Paclitaxel, Carboplatin and OSI774 (Tarceva) with Concurrent Accelerated Hyperfractionation Radiation Followed by Maintenance Therapy with OSI774 for Stage III NonSmall Cell Lung Cancer," Principal Investigator: T. Mekhail, M.D. Patient must be in maintenance therapy phase of the study and have received erlotinib for ≥ 1 week No known CNS primary or metastatic cancer at any time prior to time of enrollment No MRI evidence of pathological enhancement at the time of study entry PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Patients must use adequate birth control measures while in the study No significant side effects to erlotinib that require dose reduction or interruption None of the following medical issues which could make a lumbar puncture unsafe: Platelets &lt; 100,000/mm³ INR &gt; 1.1 Known bleeding dyscrasia Absolute neutrophil count &lt; 1,500/mm³ Ongoing systemic bacterial infection PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Patients on modest or antiepileptic therapy must be on nonenzymeinducing drug only, including any of the following: Neurontin Lamictal Depakote, Depakene Felbatol Keppra Gabitril Topimax Zonegran No concurrent enzymeinducing antiepileptic drugs such as phenytoin, carbamazepine, or phenobarbital No concurrent other drug known to affect the metabolism of erlotinib No concurrent anticoagulant therapy</criteria>
