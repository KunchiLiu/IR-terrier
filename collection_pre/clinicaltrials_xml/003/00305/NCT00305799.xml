	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Understanding how oxaliplatin affects hearing loss, dizziness, and peripheral neuropathy may improve the ability to plan effective treatment for patients receiving oxaliplatin for solid tumors. PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying hearing loss and dizziness in patients receiving oxaliplatin for solid tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hearing Loss and Dizziness in Patients Receiving Oxaliplatin for Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Define the prevalence of audiometrically detectable hearing loss in patients with solid tumors treated with oxaliplatin. - Describe the association of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) and audiometrically detectable hearing loss in these patients. - Describe the association of CIPN and patient self-reported scales including, Peripheral Neuropathy Scale, Hearing Handicap Inventory for Adults, and Dizziness Handicap Inventory. OUTLINE: This is an exploratory study. Patients will complete three self-reported questionnaires including the Peripheral Neuropathy Scale, Hearing Handicap Inventory for Adults, and Dizziness Handicap Inventory. Patients will also be asked a series of questions regarding symptoms or complaints about hearing changes, tinnitus, and dizziness that they may have experienced prior to, during, and after completion of chemotherapy. Patients will also undergo a hearing test. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
