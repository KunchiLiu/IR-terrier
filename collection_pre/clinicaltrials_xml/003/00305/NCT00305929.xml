	<brief_summary>This is a multi-centre, phase II, open-label, 12-month clinical trial for patients previously treated with WST09 (Tookad) who have positive prostate biopsies for cancer. The study aims at delivering a second WST09 treatment for the purpose of eradicating the localized prostate cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of WST09 in Prostate Cancer After Radiation: Repeat Procedure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multi-centre, phase II, open-label, 12-month clinical trial for patients that previously received a vascular-targeted photodynamic treatment (VTP) with WST09 (Tookad) and still have histological findings (prostate biopsies) indicating the presence of localized cancer. The WST09-mediated VTP procedure consists of an I.V. infusion of WST09 (Tookad) at 2 mg/kg, in combination with the per-cutaneous interstitial delivery of monochromatic laser light (of a wavelength of 763nm) via the trans-perineal implantation of illumination fibres, positioned in the prostatic lobes. In a previous Tookad trial, escalating doses of laser light were used with a fixed dose of WST09 (2 mg/kg) in patients with localized prostatic cancer. Patients who underwent the procedure but still have positive prostate biopsies (residual cancer) may benefit from an additional WTS09-mediated VTP procedure. Thus, the aim of this study is to treat patients still presenting with localized prostate cancer with a second WST09-mediated VTP procedure.</detailed_description>
