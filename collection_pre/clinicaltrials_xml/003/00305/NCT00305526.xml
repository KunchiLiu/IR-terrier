	<brief_summary>This protocol will evaluate the effect of cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) combined with beta-blocker therapy in patients with symptomatic heart failure in whom beta-blocker therapy was either not tolerated or could not be up titrated to optimal doses before CRT. Cardiac resynchronization therapy will be combined with automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator (AICD, CRT-D) as it has been shown to be associated with an improvement in prognosis in the patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction and heart failure.</brief_summary>
