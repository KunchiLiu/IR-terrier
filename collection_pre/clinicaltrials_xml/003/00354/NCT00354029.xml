	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether the use of perioperative intravenous S (+) ketamine reduces the amount and degree of postoperative pain. Furthermore the purpose of this study is to determine whether the use of perioperative intravenous S (+) ketamine effects cognitive function in the early postoperative period.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Perioperative i.v. Low-dose S(+) Ketamine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The mechanism of development of postoperative pain is complex. Central and peripheral sensitization are playing an important role and this can lead to postoperative hypersensitization. Several studies have shown, that S (+) ketamine can be effective to reduce sensitization and postoperative pain. Ketamine (2-O-chlorophenyl-2-methylamino cyclohexanone) is a N-Methyl-D-Aspartat (NMDA) receptor antagonist. S (+) ketamine has a four times stronger affinity to the NMDA receptor compared to R (-) ketamine. The duration of action for S (+) ketamine is shorter than R (-) ketamine and it has fewer side-effects. The purpose of this study is to compare the analgetic effect of pregabalin and placebo used in the perioperative period. The hypothesis is that perioperative intravenous S (+) ketamine gives significant better analgesia than placebo without effecting cognitive function. The study is including patients undergoing hemorrhoidectomy.</detailed_description>
