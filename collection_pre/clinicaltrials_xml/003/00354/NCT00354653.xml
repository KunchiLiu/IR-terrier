	<brief_summary>The efficacy of lamivudine in Hepatitis Be Antigen (HBeAg) positive Asian patients of chronic hepatitis has been well established.The evidence in HBeAg negative patients is limited. Limited sustained response was observed post-treatment following a one year treatment period. Whether these results can be applied to patients in Iran is uncertain. This study is therefore intended to further assess the efficacy profile after two years of open treatment in the adult Iranian population.</brief_summary>
