	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Imatinib mesylate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as hydroxyurea, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving imatinib mesylate together with hydroxyurea may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving imatinib mesylate together with hydroxyurea works in treating patients with recurrent or progressive meningioma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Imatinib Mesylate and Hydroxyurea in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Progressive Meningioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Evaluate the activity of imatinib mesylate and hydroxyurea, as measured by 6-month progression-free survival, in patients with recurrent or progressive meningioma. Secondary - Evaluate the progression-free survival (PFS) - Overall survival (OS), - Objective response rate among patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is an open-label study. Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate once or twice daily and oral hydroxyurea twice daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 21 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
