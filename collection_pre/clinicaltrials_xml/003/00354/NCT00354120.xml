	<brief_title>Thymoglobuline Versus Alemtuzumab in Patients Undergoing Allogeneic Transplant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The reduction of intensity of conditioning is currently indicated for patients who cannot undergo standard myelo-ablation due to their age, comorbidities or type of pathology. Furthermore, the rationale to use RIC regimens is based on the observation that the infusion of alloreactive donor lymphocytes may yield to a graft versus tumour effect. However, in this kind of regimens the morbidity and TRM due to GvHD are still a concern and in vivo T-depletion is a necessary treatment. Both monoclonal (Alemtuzumab) and polyclonal T-depletion protocols carry risks and benefits. Benefits being a better prophylaxis for GvHD, and risks being an higher incidence of post-transplantation infections and relapse. At the moment, it is not clear which type of regimen, monoclonal or polyclonal, is better for the treatment.</detailed_description>
