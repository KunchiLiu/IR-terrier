	<brief_title>The Study of the Impact of Disclosing Imaging Study Information to Trial Participants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Research participants who previously underwent ß-CIT imaging will be contacted by the staff at IND to enquire whether they would like to receive their ß-CIT scan data. After signing a Research Participant Information and Consent Form, all research participants will be asked to complete a questionnaire prior to receipt of their imaging data. Those research participants requesting imaging data will be sent their data by IND and may review their data with IND (by phone) and/ or with their study investigator. All research participants will be asked to respond to a second questionnaire after receiving their imaging data and to a third study questionnaire approximately six weeks following receipt of their imaging data.</detailed_description>
