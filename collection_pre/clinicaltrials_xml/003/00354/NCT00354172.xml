	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Giving chemotherapy, natural killer cells, aldesleukin, and total-body irradiation before a donor umbilical cord blood stem cell transplant helps stop the growth of abnormal cells and cancer cells. It also helps stop the patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. When the healthy stem cells from a donor are infused into the patient they may help the patient's bone marrow make stem cells, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Sometimes the transplanted cells from a donor can make an immune response against the body's normal cells. Giving cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil, and methylprednisolone before and after transplant may stop this from happening. PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well giving fludarabine and cyclophosphamide together with total-body irradiation followed by donor umbilical cord blood natural killer cells, aldesleukin, and umbilical cord blood transplant works in treating patients with refractory hematologic cancer or other diseases.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the incidence of 6-month disease free survival. The primary laboratory objective is the measure of in vivo expansion of umbilical cord blood (UCB) derived natural killer cells (NK) after a fully ablative preparative regimen. Secondary - Determine the incidence of transplant-related mortality at 6 months after NK UCB + double UCBT - Evaluate the pattern of chimerism after NK UCB + double UCBT - Determine the incidence of neutrophil engraftment at day 42 after NK UCB + double umbilical cord blood transplantation (UCBT) - Determine the incidence of platelet engraftment at 6 months after NK UCB + double UCBT - Determine the incidence of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) grade II-IV and grade III-IV at day 100 after NK UCB + double UCBT - Determine the incidence of chronic GVHD at 1 year after NK UCB + double UCBT - Determine the disease-free survival at 1 after NK UCB + double UCBT - Determine the incidence of relapse at 1 after NK UCB + double UCBT OUTLINE: This is a single arm, nonrandomized, open-label study. - Myeloablative conditioning regimen: Patients receive fludarabine intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days -18 to -16 and cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) on days -18 and -17. Patients undergo total-body irradiation twice daily on days -16 to -13. - Haploidentical umbilical cord blood (UCB) natural killer (NK) cell therapy and aldesleukin: Patients undergo haploidentical UCB-enriched NK cell (CD3- depleted) infusion on day -13. Patients then receive aldesleukin subcutaneously on days -13, -11, -9, -7, -5, and -3. Some patients may also receive methylprednisolone IV on days -1 and 0. - UCB transplantation (UCBT): Patients undergo a single or double UCBT on day 0. Beginning on day 1, patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) IV once daily until blood counts recover. - Graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis: Patients receive cyclosporine IV over 2 hours 2-3 times daily beginning on day -1 and continuing until day 100, followed by a taper until day 180. Patients also receive mycophenolate mofetil IV or orally 2-3 times daily beginning on day -1 and continuing until day 30 (or 7 days after engraftment) in the absence of acute GVHD.</detailed_description>
