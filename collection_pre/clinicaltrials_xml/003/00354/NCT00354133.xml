	<brief_summary>Parkinsons' disease is one of the most disabling chronic neurological diseases. It can be treated sufficiently until motor complications with fluctuations of mobility and dyskinesias develop. The quality of life and the social and occupational functioning is relentlessly deteriorating with longer disease duration once the complications of conservative therapy develop. High-frequency stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus especially improves the motor complications of Parkinson's disease and preliminary data suggest that also the quality of life and psychosocial handicap are improved. So far this therapy is only used for patients which have already undergone personal, professional and social degradation due to motor complications of the disease. The aim of this study is to assess the use of this therapy in earlier stages of the disease, when motor complications have just developed and before patients are significantly affected in their social and occupational functioning.</brief_summary>
