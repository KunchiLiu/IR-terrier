	<brief_summary>The proposed study will evaluate adult patients admitted to the medical or surgical intensive care units (ICUs) at San Francisco General Hospital (SFGH). On admission, patients will be randomized in a 1:1 manner to the mini-bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) quantitative culture arm in the setting of suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) versus the tracheal aspirate culture arm, which is the current test available at SFGH.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients will be randomized to either Mini-Bal or tracheal aspirate then samples will be taken to the lab for culture. Comparative analysis will then be performed based upon lab results.</detailed_description>
