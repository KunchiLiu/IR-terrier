	<criteria>Adequate performance status: Breast Karnofsky score &gt; 50; Ovarian, endometrial or cervical Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) performance score â‰¤2 If female and of childbearing potential, are willing to use adequate contraception (hormonal, barrier method, abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Normal organ function within 14 days of study entry Diagnosis of one of the following malignancies: Metastatic breast cancer (BR) Metastatic ovarian cancer (OV) Metastatic endometrial cancer (EM) Metastatic cervical cancer (CX) Breast Cancer Measurable metastatic disease (&gt;1cm) in at least one site other than boneonly Progression on or failure to respond to at least one previous chemotherapy regimen for metastatic disease Progression on prior therapy with a hormonal agent if estrogen receptor or progesterone receptor positive, and/or with trastuzumab if HER2neu positive. If patient has progressed through hormone or trastuzumab therapy only, must have received one chemotherapy regimen. Ovarian Cancer Measurable metastatic disease as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Primary tumor must have been diagnosed histologically as either epithelial ovarian cancer, fallopian tube cancer, or primary peritoneal cancer (not borderline or low malignant potential epithelial carcinoma). Subjects must have failed at least two previous chemotherapy regimens. Paclitaxel must have been a component of one or both regimens and cisplatin or carboplatin must have been a component of one or both regimens. Endometrial Cancer Measurable metastatic disease Histologically proven recurrent or persistent endometrial cancer that is not amenable to curative treatment with surgery and/or radiation therapy AND has failed 2 previous treatment regimens Cervical Cancer Measurable metastatic disease Histologically proven recurrent or persistent squamous cell carcinoma, adenosquamous carcinoma, or adenocarcinoma of the cervix that is not amenable to curative treatment with surgery and/or radiation therapy AND has failed 2 previous treatment regimens. Had/have the following prior/concurrent therapy: Systemic corticosteroids (oral or injectable) within 7 days of first dose of 852A (topical or inhaled steroids are allowed) Investigational drugs/agents within 14 days of first dose of 852A Immunosuppressive therapy, including cytotoxic agents within 14 days of first dose of 852A (nitrosoureas within 30 days of first dose) Drugs known to induce QT interval prolongation and/or induce Torsades de pointes unless best available drug required to treat lifethreatening conditions Radiotherapy within 3 weeks of the first dose of 852A Hematopoietic cell transplantation within 4 weeks of first dose of 852A Evidence of active infection within 3 days of first dose of 852A Active fungal infection or pulmonary infiltrates (prior treated disease stable for 2 weeks is allowable) Cardiac ischemia, cardiac arrhythmias or congestive heart failure uncontrolled by medication History of, or clinical evidence of, a condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, could confound the results of the study or put the subject at undue risk Uncontrolled intercurrent or chronic illness Active autoimmune disease requiring immunosuppressive therapy within 30 days Active coagulation disorder not controlled with medication Pregnant or lactating Concurrent malignancy (if in remission, at least 5 years disease free) except for localized (insitu) disease, basal carcinomas and cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas that have been adequately treated Any history of brain metastases or any other active central nervous system (CNS) disease</criteria>
