	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to demonstrate that the exposure to bosentan in children with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) or familial pulmonary arterial hypertension, using a pediatric formulation, is similar to that in adults with PAH and to evaluate the tolerability and safety of a pediatric formulation of bosentan in this patient population.</brief_summary>
