	<brief_summary>The present clinical study will assess the immunogenicity and reactogenicity of Sanofi Pasteur's DTaP-IPV combined vaccines as a three-dose primary vaccination at 2, 4 and 6 months of age compared to commercially available vaccines in order to meet the requirements for registration of the product in South Korea. Primary objective To demonstrate the non-inferiority in terms of seroprotection rates (Diphtheria, Tetanus, Polio types 1, 2 and 3) and seroconversion/vaccine response rates to Pertussis antigens (PT, FHA) of Sanofi Pasteur's DTaP-IPV combined vaccine versus commercially available Biken's DTaP (CJ purified PDT vaccine ™) and Aventis Pasteur's IPV (IMOVAX POLIO) monovalent vaccines, one month after the three-dose primary vaccination. Secondary objectives 1. Immunogenicity: To assess the non-inferiority in terms of seroprotection rates (Diphtheria, Tetanus, Polio types 1, 2 and 3) and seroconversion / vaccine response rates to Pertussis antigens (PT, FHA) of Sanofi Pasteur's DTaP-IPV combined vaccine versus historical reference (Study E2I03294 - France). To assess and describe the immunogenicity of the study vaccines in both groups. 2. Safety: To assess and describe the safety of the study vaccines after each dose.</brief_summary>
