	<brief_summary>The hypothesis of this study is that administration of azithromycin to ventilated premature infants will decrease the incidence and severity of BPD. The purpose of this study is to determine if Azithromycin treatment is beneficial for prevention of bronchopulmonary dysplasia in preterm infants.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial II of Lung Protection With Azithromycin in the Preterm Infant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The survival of preterm infants has increased dramatically and has been associated with an increase in BPD. The incidence of BPD among extremely low birthweight infants ranges from 45% to 90%. Development of BPD is associated with both antenatal (maternal chorioamnionitis often due to Ureaplasma is related to BPD) and postnatal complications (oxygen toxicity, barotrauma, late onset infections). These insults appear to lead to an inflammatory response with resultant arrest of normal alveolar and vascular development. Multiple human studies support the role of inflammation in the development of BPD. Evaluating a medication that could decrease the inflammation in BPD, with minimal side effects, could significantly improve the morbidities of prematurity and the financial burden incurred by parents. Macrolide antibiotics (erythromycin and azithromycin) have been shown to have anti-inflammatory properties that are independent of their antimicrobial properties. Azithromycin has the potential to decrease the severity of ventilator-induced pulmonary inflammation that is commonly seen in BPD.</detailed_description>
