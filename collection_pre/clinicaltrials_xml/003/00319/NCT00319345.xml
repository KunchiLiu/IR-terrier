	<brief_title>Sodium-Lactate and Traumatic Brain Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Osmotherapy with mannitol remains the first treatment currently recommended to treat intracranial hypertension in severe head injury.However, this treatment in not always efficient and is associated with side-effects and a transitory action. Hypertonic sodium-lactate, by its osmotic and energetic properties could be superior to mannitol to decrease ICP. Study objectives : to compare the effect of mannitol and sodium-lactate on ICP at the fourth hour after the start of infusion during IHE in severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) (main endpoint) ; to compare the percentage of successfully treated episodes between both treatments and to compare the neurological status after one year of evolution (glasgow outcome score)(secondary endpoints) Patients inclusion : adult severe TBI (glasgow coma score &lt; 9) &lt; 66 yrs Exclusion criteria : polytrauma, bilateral fixed dilated pupils, motor score &lt; 4, neurosurgery, prolonged episode of hypoxia or arterial hypotension, 34 patients included from november 2003 to november 2004 and randomized into two groups : MAN group receiving mannitol 20% 100 ml in 15 min (17 patients, 36 episodes of IHE treated) and LAC group receiving semimolar sodium-lactate 100 ml in 15 min (17 patients, 37 episodes of IHE treated). For ethical reasons a rescue treatment in a crossover fashion was performed for each episode of IHE when the randomized treatment failed. Follow-up : one year after the TBI. Study end : november 30, 2005</detailed_description>
