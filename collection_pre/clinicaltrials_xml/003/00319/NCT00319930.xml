	<criteria>Key 1. Diagnosis of Bcell CLL including Lymphocytosis of &gt;=5,000 monoclonal Bcells/microliter coexpressing &gt;= one Bcell marker (CD19, CD20, or CD23) and CD5 in peripheral blood AND &lt;= 55% prolymphocytes AND Bone marrow with &gt;=30% mononuclear cells being lymphocytes 2. ZAP70 positive CLL 3. Intermediate or High risk, poor prognosis CLL refractory to fludarabinebased therapy as defined by one of the following: Disease progression following 2 cycles of fludarabine OR Failure to achieve PR or CR after at least 2 cycles OR No response to treatment or stable disease after at least 2 cycles of fludarabine OR Disease progression after chemotherapy treatment after fludarabinebased therapy OR Â· CLL patients intolerant to fludarabinebased therapy. [Intolerance is defined as the development of any serious medical condition occurring after exposure to fludarabine that would restrict further use of the agent as treatment for the patient's CLL (i.e., autoimmune hemolytic anemia, myelosuppression, hypersensitivity)] 4. Indication for treatment as defined by the NCI Working Group Guidelines 5. Laboratory parameters as follows: Hemoglobin &gt;=10 g/dL (may be posttransfusion); platelet count &gt;=50 x103/mm3 T. Bili &lt;2 x ULN and ALT and AST &lt;2 x ULN Creatinine &lt;=2 x ULN 6. ECOG Performance Score &lt;=2 7. For patients of childproducing potential, use of effective contraceptive methods during the study and for 1 month following treatment Key 1. Pregnant or nursing women 2. Class III or IV cardiac disease defined by the New York Heart Association Functional Classification and/or left ventricular ejection fraction &lt;40% 3. History of prior radiation that potentially included the heart in the field. 4. History of myocardial infarction or active ischemic heart disease within 6 months of study entry 5. History of arrhythmia (including atrial fibrillation, multifocal premature ventricular contractions, ventricular bigeminy or trigeminy, ventricular tachycardia or a requirement for antiarrhythmics (including digoxin) 6. Baseline QTc &gt;=450 msec for men and &gt;= 470 msec for women in the absence of correctable electrolyte imbalance 7. Poorly controlled angina 8. Congenital long QT syndrome or firstdegree relative with unexplained sudden death &lt;40 years of age 9. Presence of left bundle branch block 10. Treatment with chemotherapy, monoclonal antibody or radiotherapy within 28 days of study entry 11. Severe or debilitating pulmonary disease 12. Participation in any investigational drug study within 28 days prior to CNF1010 administration. (Patient must have recovered from all acute effects of previously administered investigational agents) 13. Presence of active malignancy with the exception of basal cell carcinoma 14. Active symptomatic fungal, bacterial and/or viral infection including active HIV or viral (A, B or C) hepatitis 15. Known allergy to soy 16. Requirement for concomitant therapy with drugs that alter metabolism by cytochrome P450 3A4 except lowdose warfarin for implanted device patency 17. Requirement for concomitant therapy with drugs that prolong or may prolong QTc interval</criteria>
