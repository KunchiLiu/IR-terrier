	<brief_summary>A major goal of modern perinatal and neonatal medicine is to reduce the rate of developmental disabilities, especially mental retardation. Cerebral palsy is frequently associated with neurologic abnormalities and mental retardation. Improvements in neonatal intensive care have resulted in improved survival of very low birthweight infants but also in an increased frequency of cerebral palsy. Prematurity is a leading risk factor for cerebral palsy. Two thirds of preterm neonates are born to mothers with preterm labor with intact membranes or preterm premature rupture of membranes. A growing body of evidence suggests that these conditions are heterogeneous. This is an observational cohort study designed to identify the mechanisms of disease in patients with preterm labor/contractions and preterm premature rupture of membranes and to describe the relationship between clinical, biochemical, histological, biophysical parameters and the development of infant neurological disorders.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA: Consecutive patients admitted with the diagnosis of preterm labor/contractions or PROM. "Preterm labor/contractions" will be defined as: 1. gestational age: 2036 weeks; 2. intact membranes; and 3. regular uterine contractions greater than or equal to 8 in 60 minutes. Preterm PROM will be defined as: 1. gestational age 2036 weeks; and 2. spontaneous rupture of membranes as diagnosed by sterile speculum examination confirming pooling of amniotic fluid in the vagina, a positive Nitrazine test result, and a positive ferning test result. In cases of suspected but unconfirmed preterm PROM, indigo carmin instillation will be performed. The vaginal leakage of indigo carmin will confirm the diagnosis in these cases.</criteria>
