	<detailed_description>Prospective reports will be collected from pregnant subjects, health care provider (HCP), or Astellas Product Safety Management staff. Data from the pregnant subjects will be collected at 4 to 5 months of pregnancy by telephone interviews with the Registry. The Registry will also contact the subject at 2 months and 12 months after the estimated delivery date (EDD) for post-natal &amp; pediatric follow-up. The Registry will confirm the information collected from the subject with the HCP by telephone interviews with the Registry, forms mailed/faxed to the Registry, electronic forms/queries sent to the Registry, or a combination of these methods. If a live birth is reported, the infant's HCP will be contacted for the Pediatric Follow-Up at 2 months and 12 months of age. If a birth defect is reported, targeted follow-up will be conducted.</detailed_description>
