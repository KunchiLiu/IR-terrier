	<brief_summary>To determine quality of vision post cataract extraction and intraocular lens (IOL) implantation of 2 different acrylic intraocular lenses: Acrysof® Single-Piece IOL and Acrysof® WF, through evaluation of contrast sensitivity, glare testing, visual outcomes, wavefront, corneal topography, and patient satisfaction.</brief_summary>

	<mesh_term>Cataract</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Unilateral or bilateral cataract Eligible for phacoemulsification with primary implantation of a posterior chamber IOL. If bilateral, patient will receive the same IOL than the fellow eye. Expected maximum of 4 weeks and minimum of 1 week interval between primary and second eye surgeries when bilateral. Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) should be no better than 20/40 in the presence of a glare source using Snellen visual acuity. In the Snellen visual acuity chart, better than 20/40 will be at least 3 letters read correctly in the 20/30 line. Naturally dilated pupil (in dim light) ≥ 4.0 mm in both eyes. Preoperative ocular pathology potentially affecting visual acuity Previous intraocular or corneal surgery. Keratometric astigmatism exceeding 1.5 diopters. Planned postoperative refraction for monovision. Current contact lens usage. Other ocular surgery at the time of the cataract extraction. Uncontrolled diabetes. Any neurological condition that might interfere with performance of required test. Autoimmune deficiency disease. Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition that may increase the risk associated with study participation or study device implantation or may interfere with the interpretation of study results. Use of any systemic or topical drug known to interfere with visual performance. Surgical Exclusion Criteria Significant anterior chamber bleeding. Detached Descemet’s membrane Iris damage Posterior capsule rupture Radial tear in capsulorhexis Vitreous loss Zonular rupture. Use of corneal sutures for more than 1 week. Postimplantation Exclusion Criteria Haptic not in the capsular bag. Descentration of the IOL of more than 1.0 mm Ocular pathologies potentially affecting visual acuity that were not evident prior to surgery.</criteria>
