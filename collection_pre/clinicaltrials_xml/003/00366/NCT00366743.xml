	<brief_summary>The aim of the study was to evaluate visual outcomes, contrast sensitivity, glare testing and high order aberrations induced by different laser technologies and to evaluate differences in aberrometer technology. We hypothesized that there will not be differences among conventional or wavefront guided treatments.</brief_summary>
