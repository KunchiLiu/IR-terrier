	<brief_title>Comparison of the Torsional Handpiece to Conventional Handpiece During Routine Phacoemulsification</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>With the introduction of new phaco-emulsification systems, the cataract surgery has become a very safe procedure. The new machines combine fewer surges, lower amount of ultrasound and more controlled anterior chamber depth, as well as lower incidence of thermal burns of the incision site.1-4 Alcon's Infiniti Vision System phacoemulsification machine includes now a torsional handpiece (OZiL™). The goal of OZiL™ is to minimize the surgery impact by reducing temperature increase, turbulence and incision stress. This handpiece has a sideways movement that does not repel the cataract during its extraction making the removal more continuous, maintains occlusion which facilitates vacuum build-up and reduces flow through the anterior chamber decreasing turbulence, therefore reducing the likelihood of lens particles damaging the corneal endothelial cells. The purpose of this study is to compare visual outcomes, induction of inflammation, endothelial cell loss and efficiency of the torsional handpiece vs. the conventional phacoemulsification handpiece when using the Alcon Infiniti Vision System.</detailed_description>
