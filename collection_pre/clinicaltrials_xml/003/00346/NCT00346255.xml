	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as BB-10901, can block cancer growth in different ways. Some block the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Others find cancer cells and help kill them or carry cancer-killing substances to them. PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of BB-10901 in treating patients with relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>BB-10901 in Treating Patients With Relapsed and/or Refractory Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the dose-limiting toxicity and the maximum tolerated dose of BB-10901 in patients with relapsed and/or refractory CD56-positive multiple myeloma. Secondary - To determine the qualitative and quantitative toxicities of BB-10901 administered on this schedule. - To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of BB-10901. - To recommend a dose for Phase II clinical studies with BB-10901 given on this specific regimen. - To observe any evidence of anti-tumor activity with BB-10901. Objectives of MTD Expansion Cohort - To evaluate response rate including overall response rate (ORR) and complete response rate (CRR), and duration of response (DOR). - To further assess time to progression (TTP), progression free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). OUTLINE: This is an open-label, non-randomized, dose-escalation, multicenter study. Patients receive BB-10901 IV over 1-2 hours on days 1 and 8. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of BB-10901 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Up to 40 patients are treated at the MTD. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for short term follow-up and long term (up to 3 years) survival status. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 80 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
