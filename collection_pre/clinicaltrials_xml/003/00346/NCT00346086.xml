	<brief_summary>Various chemical modifications of allergens have been attempted to enhance efficacy, improve safety, and foster compliance with IT. These approaches have been unsuccessful - in that the allergenicity and immunogenicity have either decreased, or increased in tandem, with no resultant efficacy: safety benefit ratio. This study utilizes an adjuvant approach in which synthetic immunostimulatory DNA is conjugated to ragweed allergen in an attempt to modulate both the clinical and immunologic allergic response to ragweed exposure in ragweed-allergic patients with seasonal rhinitis.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Evaluation of efficacy and safety of allergen-CpG oligonucleotide immunostimulatory conjugate in treatment of ragweed-induced seasonal allergic rhinitis. Study incorporates clinical outcomes (symptom diaries, medication diaries, visual analog scores, quality of life questionnaires), safety measurements, immunologic assays (antibody measurements, T-cell assays, cytokine assays, nasal provocation).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Adult men and women 18 to 60 years of age; Who provide informed consent; Have a history of fall, seasonal, allergic rhinitis consistent with ragweed allergy; Exhibit a postiive skin test to licensed , standardized, ragweed extract and a positive acute response to ragweed nasal challenge; Are in general good health; and are available for the duration of the study. Individuals with medical conditions or taking medications that might interfere with interpretation of the study results will be excluded. Those with a history of severe symptoms of allergic rhinitis during the spring and summer grass pollen season will be excluded.</criteria>
