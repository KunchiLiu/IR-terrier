	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Studying the genes expressed in samples of blood from patients with cancer and their family members may help doctors identify biomarkers related to cancer. PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying genes to identify melanoma in patients in Iceland and their family members.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Studying Genes to Identify Melanoma in Patients in Iceland and Their Family Members</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Assess the feasibility of Iceland Genomics Corporation (UVS) to identify melanoma in multiple-case families, individuals with multiple tumors, and selected additional family members in Iceland. - Assess the feasibility of mutation detection using sequencing and HPLC. - Determine UVS' ability to create datasets with demographic, epidemiologic and molecular data. OUTLINE: Participants and patients undergo blood collection and complete lifestyle questionnaires. All patients and population-based controls have DNA samples sequenced for MC1R. Demographic and epidemiologic data on all study participants is collected. Sequencing of the major melanoma susceptibility genes CFDKN2A, CDK4, and MC1R is also performed.</detailed_description>
