	<brief_title>Clinical Trial of Lutein for Patients With Retinitis Pigmentosa Receiving Vitamin A</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a group of inherited retinal degenerations with a worldwide prevalence of approximately 1 in 4,000. Patients typically report night blindness and difficulty with mid-peripheral visual field in adolescence. As the condition progresses, they lose far peripheral visual field. Most patients have reductions in central vision by 60 years if left untreated. Vitamin A palmitate, 15,000 International Units (IU)/d and an omega-3 rich diet have been shown to slow the progression of this condition among adults with the typical forms.(see Archives of Ophthalmology,111:761-772,1993 ; Archives of Ophthalmology 122: 1306-1314, 2004; Archives of Ophthalmology 130(6):701-711,2013). The present study was a randomized, controlled, double-masked trial with a planned duration of 5 years.Two hundred and forty adults with the typical forms of RP were assigned to either lutein 12mg/d or a control group. Patients in both groups received 15,000 IU/day of vitamin A palmitate in addition to the supplement under study. Participants agreed not to know the contents of the supplement or their group assignment until the end of the trial. The main outcome measurement was the total point score for the 30-2 program of the Humphrey Field analyzer (HFA). In addition,the total point score for the 60-4 program ,the total point score of the 30-2 and 60-4 programs combined, computer-averaged 30-Hz cone Electroretinogram (ERG) amplitude and Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) visual acuity were measured annually as secondary endpoints.</detailed_description>

Not pregnant or planning to become pregnant Not smoking currently Agreed not to know tablet content or course of condition until the end of the trial. No other disease which might affect absorption or metabolism of lutein or vitamin A. Only one patient per family was accepted into the study. Women who are pregnant or planning to become pregnant (Vitamin A supplements can increase the risk of birth defects.) Current participation in another clinical trial for RP Patients with atypical forms such as paravenous RP, pericentral RP, sector RP,unilateral RP,Refsum disease, BardetBiedl syndrome, retinitis punctata albescens and conerod dystrophy were excluded as were patients with RP and profound congenital deafness.</criteria>
