	<brief_summary>The aim of the present study is to characterize novel mechanisms whereby HDL may exert potent vasculoprotective effects independent of reverse cholesterol transport, in particular the effect of HDL on the regulation of the vascular NAD(P)H oxidase enzyme system, a major vascular source of superoxide, known to be important for endothelial dysfunction. In addition, the present study will characterize the effect of HDL on endothelial progenitor cell (EPC) mobilization, nitric oxide production and in vivo regenerative capacity.</brief_summary>
