	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if cell therapy with your own cells (autologous cells) delivered with a catheter to regions of the heart with poor blood flow will be safe and if it will improve your ejection fraction and heart failure symptoms.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subjects greater than 21 years old. Subjects with functional class (NYHA) III ischemic heart failure. Subjects who have attempted "best" cardiac medical therapy including longacting nitrates, maximal use of betaadrenergic blocking agents, and angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitors without control of symptoms. Subjects must be identified as noncandidates for conventional revascularization by their referring cardiologist. The patient's angiogram will then be reviewed by an independent interventional cardiologist and independent cardiac surgeon to determine if the patient is eligible for revascularization. Subjects must have left ventricular ejection fraction &lt;40% by echocardiography. All subjects must have a recent coronary angiogram (within the last 1 year) to document the coronary anatomy and insure the presence of coronary disease that is not amenable to standard revascularization procedures. Have serum Btype Natriuretic Peptide (BNP) level &gt;100 pg/ml. Myocardial infarction (Q wave or nonQ wave defined as CKMB &gt;3 times normal) within 30 days of treatment. Successful coronary revascularization procedures within 3 months of study enrollment. Documented stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) within 60 days of study enrollment. NYHA Class I, II or IV heart failure and patients with idiopathic or nonischemic heart failure. History of severe aortic stenosis (aortic valve area &lt; 1.0 cm2) or insufficiency (&gt;2+); severe mitral stenosis (mitral valve area &lt;1.5 cm2); or severe mitral insufficiency(&gt;2+). Implantation of biventricular pacemaker within 90 days of study treatment. Severe comorbidity associated with a reduction in life expectancy of less than 1 year, such as chronic medical illness (i.e. severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, renal failure or cancer).</criteria>
