	<brief_summary>Purpose:Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) continues tobe a major cause of blindness in children. Although ablation of the retina with laser or cryotherapy reduces the incidence of blindness by suppressing the neovascular phase of ROP the visual outcomes after treatment are often poor. Vascular endothelial growth factor(VEGF) has an important role in the pathogenesis of ROP and inhibition of VEGF expression in the neovascular phase might prevent destructive neovascularization in ROP. The aim of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of intravitreal bevacizumab in the treatment of retinopathy of prematurity</brief_summary>
