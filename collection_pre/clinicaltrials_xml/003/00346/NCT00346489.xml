	<brief_summary>A clinical trial to establish the long term response of using intraoperative 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) versus mitomycin C (MMC) in trabeculectomy glaucoma surgery. Antiproliferative agents such as 5-fluorouracil and Mitomycin C have been used extensively in trabeculectomy surgery to improve the success of the surgery and prevent further visual loss and blindness in glaucoma patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Outcomes of Intraoperative 5-Fluorouracil Versus Mitomycin C</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Glaucoma is a life-long progressive disease, and patients are living longer. Therefore, a long term full evaluation of the efficacy of intraoperative 5-FU and MMC needs to be performed to assess the true efficacy of MMC compared to 5-FU. We, therefore propose, a long-term prospective study of patients previously enrolled in the prospective study involving the evaluation of single intraoperative application of mitomycin C versus 5-fluorouracil in low to moderate risk glaucoma patients.</detailed_description>
