	<brief_title>Omega-3 Fatty Acids for High Triglycerides in HIV-infected Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypertriglyceridemia is common among HIV-infected patients receiving Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART). Although fibrates, statins, and niacin have all been used in the management of hypertriglyceridemia in HIV-infected patients, optimal control is difficult to achieve and other agents are needed. Omega-3 fatty acids are effective for lowering triglycerides in patients without HIV infection, but experience in HIV-infected patients is limited. In addition, omega-3 fatty acids may also have secondary benefits in decreasing bone resorption and decreasing markers of systemic inflammation. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of omega-3-fatty acids in HIV-infected patients with hypertriglyceridemia. In addition, we will evaluate the effect of omega-3 fatty acid administration of markers of bone turnover and inflammation. It is 8- week randomized, double-blind trial of omega-3 fatty acids (LOVAZA, GSK, Inc) compared to placebo in 48 HAART-treated HIV-infected patients with triglycerides between 250 and 1000 mg/dl receiving dietary counseling. Subjects will be recruited from three centers (Johns Hopkins, Georgetown, and Los Angeles VAMC). The primary endpoint will be the change in triglyceride concentrations from baseline in the LOVAZA group compared to the placebo group. Secondary endpoints include the effect of LOVAZA on other lipid targets (total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol), markers of systemic inflammation, markers of bone turnover, markers of insulin resistance, HIV-disease control (CD4+ counts, HIV viral loads), measures of hepatotoxicity (ALT), platelet function, and patient reports of adverse events. Omega-3 fatty acids may be a useful adjunct in the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia in HIV-infected patients, but additional controlled studies are needed to assess its safety and efficacy using a purified, standardized preparation.</detailed_description>
