	<brief_summary>Purpose of the project is to develop a school-based intervention aimed at increasing hat use when children are outside at home and at school. The intervention is targeted to fourth grade children in Hillsborough County, Florida and is based on Theory of Reasoned Action and Planned Behavior. It is structured to accomplish the following goals: (a) increase sun protection knowledge of children in regards to hat use,(b) foster more positive attitudes in regard to wearing hats,(c) change the subjective norms of wearing hats (d) target persons that children perceive as controlling their behavior of wearing hats(parents,teachers) and increase the use of hats when children are outdoors at school(primary outcome) and when outdoors at times other than school(secondary outcome).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Intervention is aimed at encouraging students to use a wide brim hat when participating in outdoor activities. To accomplish this goal our approach will be multifaceted and will include: 1. individual sessions with school principals to facilitate a school policy that encourages hat use when children are outdoors. 2. sessions with fourth grade teachers that explains the importance of sun protection and hat use, and that addresses potential concerns by teachers. 3. classroom sessions with fourth grade children that improves sun protection knowledge, fosters more positive attitudes about hat use. and that changes the subjective norm of wearing hats when at school. 4. follow-up sessions in which children are provided free hats with a customized design that represents their school. 5. sun protection educational materials that are mailed to the parents of targeted children.</detailed_description>
