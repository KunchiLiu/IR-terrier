	<brief_title>An Ascending Dose Study of KW-2449 in Acute Leukemias, Myelodysplastic Syndromes, and Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase I open-label dose escalation study of KW-2449 in subjects with acute leukemias, high risk MDS, and CML who are not candidates for approved therapy. Over an 18-month period, the investigative sites collectively will enroll up to a total of 96 subjects. Subjects will be enrolled sequentially into 1 of 7 dose groups to evaluate 2 dosing schedules (Arm A = 14 consecutive days of dosing followed by a 7-28 day rest period as determined by recovery from any acute hematologic and non-hematologic toxicities, or Arm B = 28 consecutive days of dosing followed by a 7-28 day rest period, as determined by recovery from any acute hematologic and non-hematologic toxicities). The safety of a dose level in Arm A (14-day dosing regimen) will be established prior to enrollment of subjects in the same dose level in Arm B (28-day dosing regimen). In April 2007 the protocol was amended to discontinue Arm B (28 consecutive days of dosing). The protocol will continue as planned for Arm A (14 days of consecutive dosing). Enrollment will proceed until a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) has been established for each study Arm. Once the MTD has been reached, 12 additional subjects, with 1 or more of the hematologic conditions included in this study, may be enrolled at the MTD as an expanded safety cohort.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Histologically confirmed diagnosis of: AML (including APL refractory to alltrans retinoic acid and arsenic) that has relapsed or was not responsive to prior chemotherapy; Relapsed/refractory ALL; CML that has failed to respond or has lost a response to imatinib; and Advanced MDS (INT2 and High risk by IPSS) with failure or intolerance to approved therapy. 2.

Candidates for approved therapies; 2. Concomitant treatment with any investigational agent, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or immunotherapy; 3. Active CNS leukemia; 4. Previous or concurrent malignancy except noninvasive nonmelanomatous skin cancer, in situ carcinoma of the cervix, or other solid tumor treated curatively, and without evidence of recurrence for at least 2 years prior to study entry; 5. Uncontrolled systemic infection (viral, bacterial, or fungal); 6. Uncontrollable disseminated intravascular coagulation; 7. Major surgery within the 28 days preceding the first dose KW2449; 8. Radiotherapy, or lack of recovery of any radiotherapyrelated acute toxicity, within the 28 days preceding the first dose KW2449; 9. Treatment with systemic therapy for the underlying hematologic condition, or lack of recovery of toxicity from such treatment, within 28 days of the first dose of KW2449, with the following exceptions: hydroxyurea for treatment of hyperleukocytosis (discontinued for at least 48 hours prior to the first dose of KW2449); imatinib (discontinued for at least 48 hours prior to the first dose of KW2449); and interferon (discontinued for at least 7 days prior to the first dose of KW2449); 10. Treatment with any other investigational agent, or lack of recovery of toxicity from such treatment, within the 28 days preceding the first dose of KW2449; 11. Positive serology for HIV; 12. Clinically significant cardiac dysfunction (New York Heart Association Class 3 or 4) at the time of screening, or a history of myocardial infarction or heart failure within 3 months preceding the first dose of KW2449; 13. Any evidence of chronic Graft versus Host Disease; 14. Active autoimmune disease requiring immunosuppressive therapy; 15. Female subjects who are pregnant or breast feeding; 16. Subjects of childbearing potential, unwilling to use an approved, effective means of contraception in accordance with the institution's standards; 17. Known current drug or alcohol abuse; 18. Other severe, acute, or chronic medical or psychiatric condition, or laboratory abnormality that may compromise the safety of the subject during the study, affect the subject's ability to complete the study, or interfere with interpretation of study results; or 19. For any reason is judged by the Investigator to be inappropriate for study participation, including an inability to communicate or cooperate with the Investigator. 20. Hematopoietic growth factors (i.e., such as erythropoietin or darbepoetin alpha, filgrastim [granulocyte colonystimulating factor {GCSF }], sargramostim [granulocytemacrophage colonystimulating factor {GMCSF}], or other thrombopoietic agents) and corticosteroids within 14 days of study entry.</criteria>
