	<brief_summary>"The primary objective of this study was to demonstrate that co-administering HRV vaccine with OPV does not induce a significant decrease in poliovirus immune response one month after the third dose of combined vaccines. The primary objective was reached if one month after the third dose of polio vaccine, upper limit of the 95% CI for the difference in Seroprotection rate between the group B and C pooled and (minus) the group A was below 10% for each polio serotype."</brief_summary>

Two cohorts: Subjects enrolled before the 2002 RV season were to receive two doses of HRV or placebo at approximately 6 and 10 weeks of age (first cohort) and subjects enrolled after the 2002 RV season received vaccinations at approximately 10 and 14 weeks of age (second cohort).
