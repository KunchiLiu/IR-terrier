	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as liposomal doxorubicin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Hyperthermia therapy kills tumor cells by heating them to several degrees above normal body temperature. Giving temperature-sensitive liposomal doxorubicin together with hyperthermia may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of temperature-sensitive liposomal doxorubicin when given together with hyperthermia in treating women with locally recurrent breast cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Temperature-Sensitive Liposomal Doxorubicin and Hyperthermia in Treating Women With Locally Recurrent Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the maximum tolerated dose of temperature-sensitive liposomal doxorubicin (ThermoDox™) when used in combination with local-regional hyperthermia in women with locally recurrent breast cancer. - Determine the pharmacokinetic profile of ThermoDox™ when used in multiple-course dosing. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of temperature-sensitive liposomal doxorubicin (ThermoDox™). Patients receive ThermoDox™ IV over 30 minutes immediately followed by hyperthermia to the chest wall/axilla over 1-2 hours on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21-35 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of ThermoDox™ (with or without standard-dose granulocyte colony-stimulating factor [G-CSF] support) until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD without G-CSF support is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). At least 6 patients are treated at the MTD. If the only DLT is neutropenia in &gt; 1 of 6 patients treated at any dose level, then additional cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of ThermoDox™ with G-CSF support (standard-dose G-CSF or standard-dose pegfilgrastim) until the MTD is determined. The MTD with G-CSF support is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience DLT after the addition of G-CSF support. Quality of life and pain are assessed at baseline, prior to courses 3 and 5, and at 21-42 days after completion of therapy. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 5 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
