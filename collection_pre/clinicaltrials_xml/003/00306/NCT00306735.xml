	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy Study for the Prevention of Nausea and Vomiting in Multiple Myeloma Patients Receiving Stem Cell Transplantation.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A number of multiple-day chemotherapy regimens involving moderately or highly emetogenic agents are used for the treatment of cancers. Further, patients undergoing high-dose conditioning regimens in combination with bone marrow or stem cell transplants remain poorly controlled in terms of CINV. Patients treated with these regimens are at risk for developing CINV with each treatment as well as in the delayed setting. Palonosetron to date, has been studied against single-day moderately and highly emetogenic chemotherapy regimens. It is of interest, therefore, to explore the safety and efficacy of palonosetron when administered during a multiple-day chemotherapy regimen. For this purpose, a population receiving melphalan (100 mg/m^2) as a conditioning regimen before stem cell transplant for the treatment of multiple myeloma was selected.</detailed_description>
