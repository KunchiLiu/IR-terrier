	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to evaluate mid and long term postoperative pain and further disabling complications in open inguinal hernia repair by Lichtenstein technique after mesh fixation with fibrin sealant (FS), compared to mesh fixation with sutures.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Study of Tissucol/Tisseel Fibrin Sealant to Treat Inguinal Hernia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects in the FS group will be operated by Lichtenstein technique, with mesh fixation by fibrin sealant. Subjects in control group will be operated with conventional Lichtenstein technique (mesh fixation by sutures). Hernia repair will be performed according to standardized Lichtenstein technique, a technique for tension free hernioplasty. A Polypropylene, heavyweight, macroporous mesh will be used (8x15 cm) tailored to individual patients requirement. The different ways of mesh fixation will be randomly assigned within 24 hours before the operation. In the FS group, the two tails of the mesh will be fixed together in overlapping their edges and by surrounding the cord. The edges will be joined up to by 1 suture. No other sutures will be used. First the mesh will be put correctly in place. A small spot (0.5ml) of FS will be applied on the pubis under the mesh without spray then the remaining part (3,5ml) over the mesh on the entire surface in a thin uniform layer by spray. 2 ml Tissucol-Tisseel (4 ml of fibrin sealant) will be used per mesh. In the control group, the mesh will be fixed in a conventional manner. Nerve resection (if occurred) will be recorded; it should be avoided.</detailed_description>
