	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to compare the responsiveness of lower airways in adult patients with stable asthma after treatment with ciclesonide and fluticasone propionate. Treatment medication will be administered as follows: ciclesonide will be inhaled once daily at one dose level, fluticasone propionate will be inhaled twice daily at one dose level. The study duration consists of a baseline period (5 weeks) and a treatment period (5 weeks). The study will provide further data on safety and tolerability of ciclesonide.</brief_summary>
