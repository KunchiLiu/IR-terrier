	<brief_summary>In children treated for intracranial lesions, the 2 factors of the obesity are : the location of the lesion (hypothalamic-pituitary region) and craniopharyngiomas</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Diazoxide on the Obesity Secondary to Hypothalamic-pituitary Lesions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 80 % of the hypothalamic-pituitary lesions that occur in children are craniopharyngiomas with one or three cases per 1 million children each year. One major problem remains unsolved : the obesity This study is performed to optimize the management of the children with hypothalamic-pituitary lesions by reducing the hyperinsulinemia due to the lesion and the surgery</detailed_description>
