	<criteria>Men or women 18 years of age and older Subjects requiring protocol specified oncological surgery. Subjects must have histological confirmation of malignancy in lung or esophagus Documented, signed and dated informed consent obtained prior to any study specific procedures being performed Subjects with previous exposure to aprotinin in the last 6 months or with a known or suspected allergy to aprotinin Subjects undergoing laparoscopic surgery Subjects with sepsis or mesothelioma Subjects with impaired renal function (serum creatinine &gt;2.5 mg/dL or 221 micromoles/liter) Subjects with a history of bleeding diathesis, deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism or known coagulation factor deficiency. Based on the investigator's opinion of any active significant medical illness the subject may have. Subjects who refuse to receive allogenic blood products or whose preoperative red blood cell volume is so low that a blood transfusion would be likely to be given perioperatively (preoperative hematocrit of &lt;24% or hemoglobin of &lt;8 g/dl) Subjects who have participated in an investigational drug study within the past 30 days Subjects who are pregnant or breastfeeding or women of childbearing potential in whom the possibility of pregnancy cannot be excluded by a negative pregnancy test and who are not using a reliable method of contraception Planned use of other antifibrinolytic agents, e.g. aminocaproic acid or tranexamic acid Subjects on chronic anticoagulant treatment with warfarin that cannot be temporarily discontinued for the surgical procedure (as per local practices)</criteria>
