	<brief_summary>This phase 2 study will determine the antitumor activity, based on the objective rate, of oral MKC-1, administered twice daily for 14 consecutive days every 4 weeks, in patients with advanced or metastatic breast carcinoma. The study will also evaluate the safety and response duration in patients, time to tumor progression, and overall survival in patients following MKC-1 therapy.</brief_summary>
