	<brief_summary>The primary objectives of this study are to further evaluate the safety of natalizumab (Tysabri®) monotherapy by evaluating the risk of hypersensitivity and immunogenicity following re-exposure to natalizumab, and to confirm the safety of switching to natalizumab from interferon beta (IFN-β), glatiramer acetate (GA), or other multiple sclerosis (MS) therapies.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study 101-MS-322 (NCT00306592) is conducted to evaluate the safety of natalizumab monotherapy following re-exposure to natalizumab of former clinical trial participants in Studies C-1801 (NCT00027300), C-1802 (NCT00030966), and C-1803 (NCT00097760). This study includes participants in North America. In parallel with the conduct of this study, a similar study, 101-MS-321 (NCT00297232) is initiated for participants in Europe and the rest of the world. The primary purpose and primary outcome for both studies are identical, therefore, the combined Week 48 data from both studies are presented. In addition, after 48 weeks, participants from 101-MS-322 (NCT00306592) can enter study 101-MS-321 (NCT 00297232), which is considered the Long-Term Treatment Period of 101-MS-322 (NCT00306592).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>MS subjects who completed Study C1801 (NCT00027300), C1802 (NCT00030966), or C1803 (NCT00097760) and completed a Dosing Suspension Safety Evaluation (neurological examination and magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] scan) Considered by the investigator to be free of signs and symptoms suggestive of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) based on medical history, physical examination, or laboratory testing (results from the Dosing Suspension Safety Evaluation from Study C1808 [NCT000276172] may be used) Other protocoldefined inclusion criteria may apply Considered by the investigator to be immunocompromised, based on medical history, physical examination, or laboratory testing (results from the Dosing Suspension Safety Evaluation from Study C1808 may be used), or due to prior immunosuppressive treatment History of persistent antinatalizumab antibodies, based upon testing from prior natalizumab studies Other protocoldefined exclusion criteria may apply</criteria>
