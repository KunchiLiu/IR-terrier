	<brief_summary>Human papillomavirus infection has clearly been recognized as the cause of cervical cancer. Indeed, the infection of the cervix by certain oncogenic types of HPV, if not cleared , can lead over time to cervical cancer in women . This study will evaluate the immune response induced by the HPV-16/18 L1 VLP AS04 vaccine and the safety of the vaccine. The Protocol Posting has been updated in order to comply with the FDA Amendment Act, Sep 2007.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate the Immunogenicity and Safety of GSK Biologicals' HPV Vaccine in Healthy Women Aged 18-35 Years</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The protocol was primarily amended for the following reason: Merck's tetravalent HPV vaccine, GardasilÂ®, has been licensed and is now becoming commercially available in an increasing number of countries. Therefore, the study procedures were revised to include questions at every visit to determine if subjects have received an HPV vaccine outside of the study.</detailed_description>
