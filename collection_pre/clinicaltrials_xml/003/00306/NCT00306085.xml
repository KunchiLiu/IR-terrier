	<brief_summary>Implantation of bone marrow cells, including endothelial progenitor cells, into ischemic limbs has been shown to improve collateral vessel formation. In the present study the safety and feasibility of autologous blood mononuclear cells implantation will be investigated in patients with severe peripheral atherosclerosis.Twenty cases will be enrolled. Improvement in the ankle-brachial pressure index (ABI:&gt;0.1), ischemic ulcers and angiography as well as laser doppler flow will be evaluated until six months.</brief_summary>
