Acute disease at the time of enrolment. (Acute disease is defined as the presence of a moderate or severe illness with or without fever). All vaccines can be administered to persons with a minor illness such as diarrhoea, mild upper respiratory infection with or without lowgrade febrile illness, i.e., oral temperature / axillary temperature &lt;37.5°C (99.5°F).
