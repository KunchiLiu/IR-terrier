	<brief_summary>Primary Hypothesis: Acute tocolysis (48 hours) using oral nifedipine is more effective than intravenous magnesium sulfate in prolonging pregnancy in women with preterm labor with intact membranes between 24 and 32 6/7 weeks' gestation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial of Magnesium Sulfate Tocolysis Versus Nifedipine Tocolysis in Women With Preterm Labor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objective: To compare the efficacy of oral nifedipine versus IV magnesium sulfate on the rate of preterm delivery at &lt;37 weeks in women with preterm labor between 24 and 32 6/7 weeks gestation. Secondary Objective: 1. To compare maternal side effects between the two tocolytic agents 2. To compare neonatal morbidities between the two study groups.</detailed_description>
