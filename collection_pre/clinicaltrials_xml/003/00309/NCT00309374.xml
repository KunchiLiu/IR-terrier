	<brief_title>Anti-Inflammatory Effect of Statins in the Human Endotoxin Model</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The beneficial effect of lipid lowering in cardiovascular disease is well established. Statin potently reduce elevated cholesterol levels but also exert pleiotropic other effects such as improvement of inflammation-induced vascular dysfunction, upregulation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase, yield antiinflammatory and antioxidant properties and lower tissue factor (TF) expression on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PB-MNC) in vivo. The mechanism of action for these effects remains unclear, but is already seen after short term treatment and was independent of cholesterol reduction. Following endotoxin administration to healthy humans, the systemic response includes the activation of inflammation by cytokines, mainly IL-1, IL-6, THF-α and INF-γ, activation of the clotting system with enhanced thrombin generation, and vascular dysfunction, as demonstrable by an impaired response to vasoconstrictors. Low dose endotoxemia therefore serves as an adequate model for acute inflammation and the interaction of the three systems. The goal of this study is to determine the effect of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor pretreatment on inflammation and coagulation activation in human endotoxemia and to investigate if anti-inflammatory effects are similar between two different statins. Further, we plan to study genome-wide effects on the leukocyte transcriptome induced by (i) statin pretreatment, (ii) low-dose endotoxemia, and (iii) the anti-inflammatory effects if the statins. The study will be carried out as a randomized placebo controlled double-blind threeway crossover three period study. Subjects will receive three treatment periods (Day 1 - Day 5) in randomized order consisting of 5 days oral Simvastatin (80 mg/day), 5 days oral Rosuvastatin (40 mg/day) and 5 days adequate placebo. On Day 5 of each study period, subjects will receive LPS (2 ng/kg i.v.). Inflammatory protein expression and coagulation activation will be assessed on Day 1 and Day 5 of each period. Washout-time between treatment periods will be ≥6 weeks.</detailed_description>
