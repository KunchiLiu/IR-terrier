Subjects may also have received oral antidiabetic agents including metformin or thiazolidinediones. No dose adjustments for insulin and oral antidiabetic agents within the preceding 6 weeks. FEV1 ≥ 70% of NHANES III predicted; TLC) ≥ 80% of predicted (Intermountain Thoracic Society); DLCO uncorrected ≥ 70% of predicted Total daily dose of insulin ≥1.4 IU/kg body weight Treatment with any sulfonylureas and/or meglitinides and/or alphaglucosidase inhibitors within the preceding 8 weeks Treatment with pramlintide acetate (Symlin®), and/or any incretins (e.g., exenatide [Byetta®]) within the preceding 8 weeks Unstable diabetes mellitus control, defined as 2 or more episodes of severe hypoglycemia (requiring third party intervention) and/or any hospitalization or emergency room visit due to poor diabetic control or hyperglycemia requiring hospitalization within the preceding 6 months Exposure to an inhaled insulin at any time, treatment with an investigational drug within the preceding 3 months, and/or current participation in another clinical trial Allergy to insulin or to any drugs to be used as part of the clinical trial, or history of hypersensitivity to the investigational drug or to drugs of similar chemical structures History of active viral and/or cirrhotic hepatic disease and/or abnormal liver enzymes as evidenced by serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST)and/or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≥ 3 x Upper Limit of Normal (ULN)(Includes active hepatitis A, positive hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C serology) Serum creatinine &gt; 1.8 mg/dL in women and &gt; 2.0 mg/dL in men History of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma (any history of bronchospasm or asthma after the age of 14), and/or any other clinically important pulmonary disease confirmed by documented history, pulmonary function testing, or radiologic findings Congestive heart disease graded as class III or class IV according to New York Heart Association criteria and subjects currently being treated pharmacologically for ventricular dysrhythmias using amiodarone History of myocardial infarction, cardiac surgery, coronary angioplasty, and/or stroke within the preceding 3 months Symptomatic coronary artery disease, including crescendo angina, unstable angina, and/or unstable or symptomatic cardiac arrhythmias Poorly controlled arterial hypertension despite pharmacologic treatment, defined as systolic blood pressure (BP) &gt; 180 mm Hg and/or diastolic BP &gt; 110 mm Hg at screening History of malignancy within the preceding 5 years (other than excised basal cell carcinoma of the skin), any history of lung neoplasm, and/or subjects with current or previous chemotherapy or radiation therapy that may result in pulmonary toxicity History of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), AIDSrelated complex (ARC), or positive human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) serology Prior diagnosis of systemic autoimmune or collagen vascular disease requiring previous or current treatment with systemic corticosteroids, cytotoxic drugs, or penicillamine Visit 1/Screening (Week 3), but prior to Visit 1 PFTs and before Visit 3/Baseline (Week 0), subject will be scheduled for PFTs after 30 days from resolution of respiratory infection.
