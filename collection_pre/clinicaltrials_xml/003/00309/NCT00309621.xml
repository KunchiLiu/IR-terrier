	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy of a Retinoid for the Treatment of Severe Chronic Hand Dermatitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For severe, chronic hand dermatitis, refractory to topical treatment and the avoidance of aggravating factors such as allergens and irritants, no registered systemic treatment is available. Current systemic treatment options consist in the off-label use of systemic immune suppressants, such as cyclosporine, methotrexate. Severe chronic hand dermatitis is a debilitating disease, with massive impact on social life and working ability. A huge proportion of the population suffers for more than a decade, and job losses are a frequent consequence. This open-label trial investigates the safety and efficacy of oral alitretinoin 30mg as a single daily dose for up to 6 months. The trial is complementary to the pivotal efficacy study BAP00089.</detailed_description>
