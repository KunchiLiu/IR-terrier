	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to find ways to improve the appearance of tumours or markers that indicate the presence of tumours in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Although based on the same technology, there are many ways to obtain images using MRI. The type of image that will be produced by the scanner depends on the instructions sent to the machine. These instructions tell different components of the machine when to turn on and off and all together are called a pulse sequence. These pulse sequences can get quite lengthy and intricate and small changes in them can produce considerable changes in the resulting image. the aim of this protocol is to alter existing pulse sequences to improve image appearance. This protocol will involve only healthy volunteers.</brief_summary>
