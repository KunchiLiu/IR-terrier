	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Androgens can cause the growth of prostate cancer cells. Drugs, such as ketoconazole, may stop the adrenal glands from making androgens. GM-CSF may help ketoconazole work better by making tumor cells more sensitive to the drug. Giving ketoconazole together with hydrocortisone and GM-CSF may be an effective treatment for prostate cancer. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving ketoconazole together with hydrocortisone and GM-CSF works in treating patients with progressive prostate cancer after hormone therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ketoconazole, Hydrocortisone, and GM-CSF in Treating Patients With Progressive Prostate Cancer After Hormone Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Evaluate the effect of ketoconazole, hydrocortisone, and sargramostim (GM-CSF) on time to clinical progression in patients with prostate cancer that has progressed on primary hormonal therapy. Secondary - Evaluate the objective response frequency in patients treated with this regimen. - Investigate the safety of this regimen. OUTLINE: This is an open-label, nonrandomized study. Patients receive oral ketoconazole three times daily and oral hydrocortisone twice daily on days 1-28 and sargramostim (GM-CSF) subcutaneously on days 15-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 48 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
