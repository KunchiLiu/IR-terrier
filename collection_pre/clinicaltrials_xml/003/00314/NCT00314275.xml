	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) and safety associated with ABT-578 administered using the Medtronic Endeavor Drug Eluting Coronary Stent system in the treatment of single de novo lesions in native coronary arteries between 2.5 - 3.5 mm in diameter.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>The patient is at least 18 years of age. The patient has clinical evidence of ischemic heart disease, stable or unstable angina, silent ischemia, or a positive functional study. The patient is an acceptable candidate for percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), stenting, and emergent coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within 7 days before the procedure. The patient or patient's legal representative has been informed of the nature of the study and agrees to its provisions and has provided written informed consent as approved by the Institutional Review Board of the respective clinical site. A known hypersensitivity or contraindication to aspirin, heparin or bivalirudin, ticlopidine or clopidogrel, cobalt, nickel, chromium, molybdenum, polymer coatings, or a sensitivity to contrast media, which cannot be adequately premedicated. History of an allergic reaction or significant sensitivity to drugs similar to ABT578, rapamycin, tacrolimus, everolimus, or any other analog or derivative. A platelet count &lt; 100,000 cells/mm³ or &gt; 700,000 cells/mm³, or a white blood cell (WBC) count &lt; 3,000 cells/mm³. A creatinine level &gt; 2.0 mg/dL within seven days prior to index procedure. Evidence of an acute myocardial infarction within 72 hours of the intended treatment (defined as: Q wave or nonQ wave myocardial infarction having creatine kinase [CK] enzymes greater than or equal to 2 X the upper laboratory normal with the presence of a creatine kinase myocardialband isoenzyme [CKMB] elevated above the institution's upper limit of normal). Previous percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) of the target vessel within 9 months preprocedure. Planned PCI of any vessel within 30 days postprocedure. During the index procedure, the target lesion requires treatment with a device other than PTCA prior to stent placement (such as, but not limited to: cutting balloon, directional coronary atherectomy, excimer laser, rotational atherectomy, thrombectomy, etc.). History of a stroke or transient ischemic attack within the prior 6 months. Active peptic ulcer or upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding within the prior 6 months. History of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy or will refuse blood transfusions. Concurrent medical condition with a life expectancy of less than 12 months. Any previous or planned treatment of the target vessel with antirestenotic therapies including, but not limited to, brachytherapy. Currently participating in an investigational drug or another device study that has not completed the primary endpoint or that clinically interferes with the current study endpoints; or requires coronary angiography, intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) or other coronary artery imaging procedures.</criteria>
