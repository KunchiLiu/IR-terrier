	<brief_title>Treatment of Unstable Both-Bone Midshaft Forearm Fractures in Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Children who arrive at the emergency unit with an unstable both-bone midshaft forearm fracture will be asked to join the trial. If the fracture will be unstable during reposition in the operating room, a randomization between 1 or 2 ESIN will be done. The aftertreatment will be the same for both groups: above elbow plaster for 3 weeks. Outpatient clinic visits till a follow-up of 9 months. During these visits we will investigate: consolidation and dislocation on X-ray, function of both arms, complaints in daily living and complications.</detailed_description>
