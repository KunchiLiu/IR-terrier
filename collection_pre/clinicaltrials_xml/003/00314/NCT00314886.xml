	<brief_summary>Despite there being no clearcut advantages, one of the most common recommendations in IBS management is to increase the amount of dietary fibres. In some IBS patients fibres have a deleterious effect on pain and bloating. It has been shown that butyrate can increase colonic sensitivity in rats. Our purpose is to study whether butyrogenic fibres can modify rectal sensitivity and symptoms in IBS and healthy control through a modification of colonic flora.</brief_summary>
