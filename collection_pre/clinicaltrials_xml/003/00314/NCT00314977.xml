	<brief_summary>2 different treatment schedules may be used for neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer using adriamycin, cyclophosphamide and taxotere. The most optimal sequence- concurrent or sequential- is however unclear. The aim of the study is to compare the efficacy and tolerability of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with AC followed by T(adriamycin, cyclophosphamide, taxotere) versus TAC ( with upfront T) in patient with large resectable or locally advanced breast cancer.</brief_summary>
