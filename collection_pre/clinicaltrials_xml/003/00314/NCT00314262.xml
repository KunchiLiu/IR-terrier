	<brief_title>Phase I/II Study of Chemoprevention With EGFR and COX-2 Inhibitor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect on cells and patient response to study medications, assess the side effects of these medications, and to evaluate chemicals in the cells that may tell how the drug works, before, and after receiving the study medications. Approximately 61 patients will participate at Emory Winship Cancer Institute and Emory Crawford W. Long Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia.</detailed_description>

Participants who were taking COX2 inhibitors or EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors within 3 months of study entry. Documented history or interstitial lung disease. Known connective tissue disease. History of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID)induced ulcers or those who are at risk for a GI ulcer. Participated in a clinical trial of an investigational drug within 12 months prior to enrollment. Final eligibility will be determined by the health professionals conducting the trial.</criteria>
