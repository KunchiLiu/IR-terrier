	<detailed_description>IDPN is widely used in HD patients without clue of its effectiveness. Study objectives: to evaluate IDPN effects on mortality (main objective), hospitalization rates, nutritional status, dialysis efficacy, Karnofsky score. Patient eligibility: adult patients ≤ 82 y with HD vintage &gt; 6 mo. and 2 of the following malnutrition criteria: BMI ≤ 20 kg/m2, BW loss/6 mo. ≥ 10%, serum albumin ≤ 35 g/L, prealbumin ≤ 300 mg/L. Recruitment: patients in 38 HD units from January 2001 to December 2002 Study protocol. Patients are randomized into 2 groups: IDPN group, given IDPN during one year, and control group. For ethical reasons, the 2 groups are given oral supplementation during the same period. Follow-up: two years after start of nutritional therapy. Study end: December 31, 2004. Final results will be available in early 2005.</detailed_description>
