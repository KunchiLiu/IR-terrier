	<brief_title>Treatment of Non-Dislocated Midshaft Both-Bone Fractures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Children who arrive at the emergency unit with a non-dislocated both-bone midshaft forearm fracture will be asked to join the trial. After informed consent we will do a randomization between 6 weeks above elbow cast and 3 weeks above elbow cast in combination with 3 weeks under elbow cast. Outpatient clinic visits till a follow-up of 6 months. During these visits we will investigate: consolidation and dislocation on X-ray, function of both arms, complaints in daily living and complications.</detailed_description>
