	<brief_title>Functional Brain Imaging and Employment in First-Episode Psychotic Patients Treated With Risperdal</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>First episode patients have a greater potential for therapeutic response than multi-episode patients, and many of them also havea great desire to rejoin the workforce. Unfortunately, first episode patients become non-compliant or intermittently compliant with prescribed antipsychotic treatment at least as frequently as multi-episode patients. We believe that assured treatment with Risperal CONTSTA will provide first episode patients wiwth their best opporutnity for continued improvement in cognitive function beyond 3 months of treatment and that improvements in cognitive function will be associated with a greater likelihood of employment, real-world outcomes, such as independent living, as well as measures of brain function.</detailed_description>
