	<brief_summary>Children born after elective C-section have a greater risk of respiratory problems and hypoglycemia - most likely due to a lower concentration of stress hormones compared to children born vaginally. Hypothesis: can we eliminate or reduce the risk of respiratory distress and hypoglycaemia by administrating adrenaline to the newborn.</brief_summary>
