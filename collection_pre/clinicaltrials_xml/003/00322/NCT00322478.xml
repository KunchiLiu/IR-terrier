	<brief_summary>Many people with diabetes have a desire to share blood glucose data with other members of their team. Using a unique wireless glucose meter device, real-time wireless alerts may be automatically sent to a specific team of interested caregivers whom the patient selects. Additionally, trending reports can be automatically delivered to any number of authorized patient caregivers to facilitate more frequent review of glycemic control. This study is recruiting patients from throughout the USA including Hawaii and Alaska.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Diabetes Technology Study of Real-Time Glucose Alerts in the Team Management of Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Previous research suggests that using wireless messaging to handle the values from finger-stick blood glucose testing and making the numbers available to both patients and their diabetes health care team may improve the management of diabetes. We would like to test the GlucoMON glucose meter accessory device and the real-time wireless alerts feature which automatically sends to a specific team of interested caregivers whom the patient selects and the effects of real-time alerts in the management of diabetes. We also would like to know whether this procedure can improve the frequency of glucose pattern management as a patient and possibly reduce the costs of care required for frequent interactions between the patient and the diabetes care team. In this study, we will compare a new wireless device and Internet-based automated data management system to existing methods of sharing data amongst an interested care team. Specifically, the research will answer the question, "How does the real-time alert feature of the GlucoMON device compare to people who regularly initiate telephone calls (notification) to interested members of the care team to report a) that a blood glucose test was performed; b) the numerical value of the blood glucose level; and, c) the time that the blood glucose test was performed?" In addition, the data collected during this study will be used to answer the larger question of whether the automated sharing of patient directed blood sugar information affects diabetes control positively or negatively and to what degree. The GlucoMON device provided by Diabetech, LP is an automated, wireless blood glucose collection and reporting system that will be used to send encrypted glucose data through a secure Internet connection for review by the patient and the authorized diabetes care team. Preparing and delivering the glucose data in this manner will help the care team to know if the person with diabetes is testing or not and provide them with some level of information regarding current blood glucose control even though they cannot be with the patient. The most obvious use of this feature of the automated diabetes management system is the delivery of a blood sugar text message to the mother and/or father of a child with type 1 diabetes attempting to provide remote assistance to their son or daughter at school. However, this is only one scenario in which the researchers anticipate patient feedback.</detailed_description>
