	<brief_summary>Hemodialysis is a cause of carnitine deficiency. The deficiency of carnitine induces an anemia by an increase fragility of the red blood cells, a muscular fatigue and a cardiac dysfunction. We proposed to evaluate the benefit of an early administration of L-carnitine in hemodialysis patients. The patients should be included in the first month after the start of chronic hemodialysis, randomized to receive L-carnitine or placebo and should be followed-up during one year.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Early Administration of L-carnitine in Hemodialysis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The first aim of the study is to compare the resistance index to erythropoietin (hemoglobin level / rHuerythropoietin dose) with L-carnitine versus placebo Double blind randomized study evaluating the supplementation with L-carnitine versus placebo in patients beginning chronic hemodialysis for less than 1 month. Primary outcome to compare rHuerythropoietin resistance index defined as hemoglobin level / rHuEPO dose ratio with L-carnitine and with placebo. Secondary endpoints to compare acylcarnitine / carnitine ratio, number of red blood cells transfusion, physical status, quality of life, hypotensive episodes, lipid profile, diabetes profile, albuminemia, c reactive protein. Several variables that influenced primary and secondary endpoints will be included in a multivariate analysis; albuminemia, c reactive protein, iron status, dialysis efficiency, protein intake, lipid intake, treatment with additional vitamins (C, B9, B6), treatment with statins, treatment of predialysis hypotension by midodrine, antihypertensive treatments. Statistical analysis: - description of the cohort - comparisons of each evaluated variables between the 2 treatments - ANOVA study for repeated measurements from inclusion to month-12 for Hb / rHuEPO dose to compare the course of the ratio between each group in intention to treat analysis - analysis of the ratio Hb / rHuEPO month by month and taking into account tempera withdrawal Following analysis in both intention to treat and per protocol analysis: - acylcarnitine / carnitine ratio by ANOVA for repeated data - number of predialysis hypotension by Chi2 test - number of red blood cells transfusion by Chi2 test - SF-36 physical status by comparison of mean - SF-36 total score by comparison of mean - lipid profile by ANOVA for repeated data - HbA1c by ANOVA for repeated data - variables that influenced primary and secondary variables will be analyzed by multivariate analysis - statistical study of clinical events per month</detailed_description>
