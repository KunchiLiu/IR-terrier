	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Chemoprevention is the use of certain drugs or substances to keep cancer from forming, growing, or coming back. The use of lycopene, a substance found in tomatoes, may keep prostate cancer from forming. PURPOSE: This randomized clinical trial is studying how well lycopene works in preventing prostate cancer in healthy participants.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lycopene in Preventing Prostate Cancer in Healthy Participants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine whether lycopene supplementation affects percent free and bound prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in healthy participants. Secondary - Determine whether lycopene reduces oxidative stress in these participants, as indicated by lipid peroxidation assay. - Determine whether a 21-day washout period is sufficient to return lycopene, PSA, and lipid peroxidation products to baseline. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, placebo-controlled study. Participants are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms. - Arm I: Participants receive an oral tomato dietary supplement containing lycopene twice daily for 3 weeks. - Arm II: Participants receive an oral tomato dietary supplement containing lycopene at a higher dose twice daily for 3 weeks. - Arm III: Participants receive oral placebo twice daily for 3 weeks. Urine and blood samples are collected on days 0, 21, and 42. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 150 participants will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
