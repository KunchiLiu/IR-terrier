	<brief_summary>Dengue fever, which is caused by dengue viruses, is a major health problem in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and immune response to the dengue vaccine DEN4delta30-4995 in healthy adults.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety of and Immune Response to a Dengue Virus Vaccine (rDEN4delta30-4995) in Healthy Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dengue viruses account for more than 50 million cases of dengue fever and a half million cases of the more severe disease, dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome. Infection with dengue viruses is the leading cause of hospitalization and death in children in at least eight Asian countries. The goal of producing a vaccine against dengue fever is to induce a long-lived antibody response against all four dengue serotypes. The rDEN4delta30-4995 vaccine candidate is a live attenuated recombinant virus derived from rDEN4delta30 for protection against dengue virus serotype 4. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of rDEN4delta30-4995 in healthy adults. This study will last 180 days (6 months). Participants in Cohort 1 will be randomly assigned to receive the highest dose of rDEN4delta30 or placebo at study entry. Participants in Cohort 2 will be randomly assigned to receive a lower dose of rDEN4delta30 or placebo. Participants in Cohort 3 will be randomly assigned to receive the lowest dose of rDEN4delta30 or placebo. Cohorts 2 and 3 will begin after a safety review of all participants in the previous cohort. After initial vaccination, participants in Cohort 1 will be followed every other day for the first 16 days of the study, monitoring their temperature three times a day through Day 16 and recording these measurements in a diary. After Day 16, study visits will occur on Days 21, 28, 42, and 180 and will include a physical exam and blood collection. Some participants will also be asked to undergo a skin biopsy or additional blood collection at selected visits.</detailed_description>
