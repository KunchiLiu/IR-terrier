	<brief_summary>This clinical study is being conducted at multiple sites to determine the activity, safety and tolerability of XL999 when given weekly to patients with relapsed or newly-diagnosed AML. XL999 is a small molecule inhibitor against Flk1/kinase insert domain receptor (KDR), PDGFR, c-Kit, FLT3 and SRC. c-Kit and FLT3 are receptors commonly expressed on AML blasts.</brief_summary>
