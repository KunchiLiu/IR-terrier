	<brief_summary>This study will treat patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma whose disease is in complete remission due to previous treatment with CHOP-R. Half of the patients will receive Zevalin and the other half will receive no further anti-cancer treatment. The two patient groups will be compared to determine if Zevalin given after CHOP-R therapy provides greater benefits than receiving no additional anti-cancer therapy after CHOP R.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Histologically confirmed, Ann Arbor stage II, III, or IV DLBCL according to the REAL/WHO classification (from initial diagnosis made prior to starting CHOPR therapy) Central pathology review confirming the DLBCL diagnosis and CD20 positivity, and no evidence of DLBCL in bone marrow Firstline treatment of DLBCL must have been 6 or 8 cycles of standard CHOP chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m2, doxorubicin 50 mg/m2, vincristine 1.4 mg/m2 up to a maximum of 2 mg on day 1, and at least 40 mg/m2/day prednisone on Days 1 to 5 every three weeks, with generally accepted adjustments in dose or frequency due to toxicity, patient scheduling, etc.) in combination with rituximab (375 mg/m2) Complete remission (CR) or unconfirmed complete remission (CRu) according to the International Workshop Response Criteria for NHL described by Cheson et al and modified for this study after firstline treatment with CHOPR. CT scans of chest, abdomen, pelvis, and neck (if applicable) must have been performed within 6 weeks after the last dose of the last course of CHOPR. Applicability of the neck CT means that the patient had involvement of the neck region by palpation / physical examination at first diagnosis (preCHOPR). Central radiographic review of the CT scans (chest, abdomen, pelvis and if applicable, neck) from before and after firstline treatment with CHOPR fulfilling the radiological requirements for CR/CRu Patients 60 years of age or older at time of randomization WHO performance status (PS) of 0 to 2 within 1 week of randomization Absolute neutrophil count (ANC)greater than or equal to 1.5 x 10^9/L within 1 week of randomization Hemoglobin (Hgb) greater than or equal to 10 g/dL within 1 week of randomization Platelets greater than or equal to 150 x 10^9/L within 1 week of randomization Life expectancy of 3 months or longer Written informed consent obtained according to local guidelines Presence of any other malignancy or history of prior malignancy except nonmelanoma skin tumors or stage 0 (in situ) cervical carcinoma Prior radioimmunotherapy, radiation therapy, or any other NHL therapy except firstline CHOPR Presence of gastric, central nervous system (CNS), or testicular lymphoma at first diagnosis Histological transformation of lowgrade NHL Known seropositivity for hepatitis C virus (HCV) or hepatitis B surface antigen (HbsAg) Known history of HIV infection Abnormal liver function: total bilirubin &gt; 1.5 x ULN or ALT &gt; 2.5 x ULN within 1 week of randomization Abnormal renal function: serum creatinine &gt; 2.0 x ULN within 1 week of randomization Nonrecovery from the toxic effects of CHOPR therapy Known hypersensitivity to murine or chimeric antibodies or proteins GCSF or GMCSF therapy within two weeks (or four weeks if pegylated) prior to screening laboratory sampling Concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled medical disease (e.g., uncontrolled diabetes,congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction within 6 months of study, unstable and uncontrolled hypertension, chronic renal disease, or active uncontrolled infection) which could compromise participation in the study Male and female patients of childbearing potential unwilling to practice effective contraception during the study and unwilling or unable to continue contraception for 12 months after their last dose of study treatment Female patients who are pregnant or are currently breastfeeding Treatment with investigational drugs less than 4 weeks before the planned Day 1 or nonrecovery from the toxic effects of such therapy Surgery less than 4 weeks before the planned Day 1 or nonrecovery from the side effects of such surgery Concurrent systemic corticosteroid use for any reason except as premedication in case of known or suspected allergies to contrast media or as premedication for potential side effects of rituximab treatment Unwillingness or inability to comply with the protocol</criteria>
