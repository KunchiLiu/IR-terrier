	<brief_summary>Given the activity of single-agent Topotecan in NSCLC, there is both scientific rationale and a medical interest in studying this agent in combination with radiation. In addition, Topotecan administered on a weekly basis offers advantages over the daily x 5 regimen, i.e., the convenience of administration and fewer visits to the clinic.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Concurrent Radiotherapy With Weekly Topotecan for Primary Treatment of Inoperable Localized Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a study of chemoradiation for patient with inoperable non small cell lung cancer with poor pulmonary function. These patients have usually very limited treatment options because of the compromised lung function. Chemoradiation is usually superior to radiation alone, but has not been extensively tested in this patient population. Topotecan is a drug approved for lung cancer that has synergistic activity with radiation. The study will determine what is the safest dose of topotecan to use with radiation in this patient population</detailed_description>
