	<brief_summary>This study evaluates the safety of plerixafor and other outcomes that are purely exploratory in nature. One other pre-specified outcome is to evaluate an interval of 10-11 hours between dosing with plerixafor and the beginning of apheresis to determine if there will be at least a 2-fold increase in circulating CD34+ cells. Data from this protocol will assist in the determination of the dosing schedule for future studies.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment With AMD3100 (Plerixafor) in Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma and Multiple Myeloma Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and multiple myeloma who have undergone prior cyto-reductive chemotherapy and are to be autologously transplanted will be treated with a combination of plerixafor and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) mobilization regimen on the day prior to apheresis. The only change to standard of European care is the addition of plerixafor to a G-CSF mobilizing regimen. Participants will undergo mobilization with G-CSF (10 µg/kg each day) and on each day prior to apheresis will receive plerixafor (240 µg/kg). Participants will undergo apheresis for up to 5 consecutive days in order to collect the target number of (≥ 5*10^6) CD34+ stem cells/kg. Participants will be transplanted with cells obtained from the G-CSF and plerixafor mobilization regimen. The number of CD34+ cells mobilized in the peripheral blood from the time of the plerixafor dose to just prior to apheresis and those harvested in the apheresis product will be measured. The number of apheresis sessions required to obtain ≥ 5*10^6 CD34+ cells/kg will also be measured. Success of the transplantation(s) will be evaluated by the time to engraftment of poly-morphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) and platelets (PLT). Participants will be followed for durability of their transplant for 12 months following transplantation. This study was previously posted by AnorMED, Inc. In November 2006, AnorMED, Inc. was acquired by Genzyme Corporation. Genzyme Corporation is the sponsor of the trial.</detailed_description>

Patients who have failed previous collections Brain metastases or carcinomatous meningitis History of ventricular arrhythmias History of paresthesias A comorbid condition which, in the view of the investigator, renders the patient at high risk for treatment complications A residual acute medical condition resulting from prior chemotherapy Acute infection Fever (temp &gt;38°C/100.4°F) Patients whose actual body weight exceeds 150% of their ideal body weight Patients who previously received experimental therapy within 4 weeks of enrolling in this study or who are currently enrolled in another experimental study during the mobilization period Positive pregnancy test in female patients Lactating females Patients of childbearing potential unwilling to implement adequate birth control. Patients who have deterioration of their clinical status or laboratory parameters between the time of enrolment and transplant (such that they no longer meet entry criteria) may be removed from study at the discretion of the treating physician, principal investigator, or sponsor.</criteria>
