	<brief_summary>Hepatitis B Vaccine [Recombinant] is a well-established vaccine which has been used extensively, worldwide since its initial licensure in 1986. Hepatitis B vaccines: [1] induce protection against the morbidity and mortality of acute hepatitis B virus infection, [2] reduce the incidence of chronic infection in vaccinated populations, and [3] thereby, reduce the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma. The purpose of the trial is to assess if the new manufacturing process of the Hepatitis B Vaccine [Recombinant] vaccine shows the same level of hepatitis B antibody response or better as the currently licensed Hepatitis B Vaccine [Recombinant] vaccine. This study will also confirm that the new process vaccine is as well tolerated as the current vaccine.</brief_summary>
