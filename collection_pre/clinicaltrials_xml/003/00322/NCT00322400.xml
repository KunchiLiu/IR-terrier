	<brief_summary>This open-label, dose-finding, multi-center study is designed to determine the safety and the maximum tolerated dose of AMG 706 given once daily in combination with either weekly paclitaxel (Arm A) or once-every-3 week docetaxel (Arm B) in subjects with locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer. Secondarily, this study will evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of AMG 706 in both treatment arms, the PK profile of paclitaxel in Arm A and the PK profile of docetaxel in Arm B. Additionally, this study will assess objective tumor response and duration of response. Exploratory endpoints include the investigation of potential biomarker development and to assess the effects of genetic variation in drug metabolism genes, cancer genes and drug target genes on subject response to AMG 706 in combination with paclitaxel or docetaxel.</brief_summary>
