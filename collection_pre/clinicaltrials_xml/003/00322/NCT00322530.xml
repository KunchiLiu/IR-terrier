	<brief_summary>The goal of the present study is the comparison of different dialysis strategies in critically ill patients with acute renal failure on the intensive care unit. Patients are treated with either continuous dialysis or hemofiltration. Outcome measures are death, restitution of renal function, days on ICU, hemodynamic stability, dialysis efficiency.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The goal of the present study is the comparison of different renal replacement strategies in critically ill patients with acute renal failure on the intensive care unit. In a prospectively randomized clinical study patients are treated with either continuous dialysis (SLED) or continuous hemofiltration (CVVHD). 200 patients should be included in the study (n=100 each). The primary outcome is death at ICU, secondary outcome measures are restitution of renal function, days on ICU, hemodynamic stability, dialysis efficiency.</detailed_description>
