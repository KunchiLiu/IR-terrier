	<brief_summary>To study all ICU patients with an independent baseline functional status, who experience a critical illness requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation, evaluating the role of protocol-directed, early physical and occupational therapy on the incidence of critical illness associated functional debilitation. Our goal is to hasten the recovery of independent physical functioning as well as to reduce ICU delirium in the group of patients who begin this intervention from the earliest hours of ventilator dependence.</brief_summary>
