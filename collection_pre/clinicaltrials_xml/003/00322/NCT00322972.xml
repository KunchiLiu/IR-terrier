	<brief_summary>The WHO has initiated a program to eliminate trachoma, blinding eye infection caused by Chlamydia trachomatis, in large part by mass distributions of oral azithromycin. The proposed study will determine the frequency and treatment target of community-wide mass antibiotic treatment. We will also study the impact of mass antibiotic distribution on antibiotic-resistance in pneumococcus.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The proposed study is a group-randomized trial to determine the frequency and treatment target of community-wide mass antibiotic treatment to eliminate trachoma. We will also study the impact of community-wide antibiotic distribution on antibiotic-resistance in pneumococcus. Communities in Goncha Siso Enese district of East Gojam Zone, Ethiopia will be randomly assigned to different treatment schemes and monitored to study the following research questions: Specific Aim 1. To determine whether biannual mass treatments is more likely to eliminate ocular chlamydia from hyper-endemic communities than annual mass treatments. Specific Aim 2. To determine whether children form a core group for the transmission of trachoma. Specific Aim 3. To determine whether latrine construction prevents the return of infection into a community after mass treatment. Specific Aim 4. To determine the effect of mass azithromycin treatments on antibiotic resistance in pneumococcus and the reduction in mortality. Specific Aim 5. To determine whether annual mass treatments are more likely to eliminate ocular chlamydia from hyper-endemic communities than biennial mass treatments.</detailed_description>

Pregnant women Children under 6 months of age All those who are allergic to macrolides or azalides Refusal of village chief (for village inclusion), or refusal of parent or guardian (for individual inclusion) Individuals in these three exclusion criteria will not be given the study antibiotic azithromycin, but offered the current WHOrecommended alternative treatment to azithromycin for active trachoma, which is 1% tetracycline eye ointment, to be used twice a day, topically to both eyes, for six weeks. Note that the exclusion criteria refer to the exclusion to the treatment drug, but not to the monitoring, treatment of trachoma, and examinations.</criteria>
