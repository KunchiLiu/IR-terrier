	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy of Inhaled Insulin in Type 1 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The decision to discontinue the development of AERxÂ® is not due to any safety concerns. An analysis concluded that fast-acting inhaled insulin in the form it is known today, is unlikely to offer significant clinical or convenience benefits over injections of modern insulin with pen devices.</detailed_description>
