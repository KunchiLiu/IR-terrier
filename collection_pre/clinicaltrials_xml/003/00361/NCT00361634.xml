	<brief_title>Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DCE-MRI) to Measure Response to Etanercept in Rheumatoid Arthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The current literature shows the promise of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for assessing response to therapy in RA but the heterogeneity of the methodology and the semi-quantitative nature of the image analysis limits its applicability. To evaluate the ability of DCE-MRI to serve as a biomarker for treatment-induced changes in RA associated synovial inflammation, the reproducibility of the measurement and an effect size are required. Additional endpoints such as synovial volume, bone erosion progression and bone marrow edema-like changes may also prove useful for short-term assessment of a therapeutic intervention, but have not been explored in the context of a pharmacodynamic biomarker. It is therefore critical to conduct a carefully designed longitudinal study, focused on identifying the key parameters related to the instrumentation and data analysis, to fully evaluate the potential utility of MRI in an early clinical development setting. Importantly, this study will also demonstrate the feasibility of using DCE-MRI at multiple centers to acquire useful information that will drive program decisions.

	<criteria>Fulfillment of the 1987 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria for RA with a disease duration &gt; 6 months Presence of active disease (defined as both tender and swollen joints) in at least one wrist Suboptimal response to methotrexate (MTX) defined by the presence of the following criteria (based on 68/66 joint count): 8 or more swollen joints AND 8 or more tender joints (with involvement of the wrist, fingers and at least one region outside the hands) at screening Must be receiving MTX at a stable dose &gt; 15 mg/week at least 12 weeks prior to baseline a lower dose is acceptable if otherwise not tolerated (toxicity documentation required). Patients who are currently receiving disease modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) therapy (other than MTX, hydroxychloroquine or sulfasalazine) including tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists (etanercept, infliximab, and adalimumab), abatacept, rituximab, leflunomide, cyclosporine, and gold (oral and intramuscular injection) within 8 weeks or 5.5 halflives, whichever is longer, of screening Coexisting condition requiring medications that alter vascular flow (e.g., nitrates, calcium channel blockers, ergot containing drugs) [Potential effects of antihypertensive and migraine medications will be discussed with the Sponsor] Comorbid autoimmune disorders including systemic lupus erythematosus Unable to undergo an MRI examination (e.g., presence of a pacemaker, defibrillator, or other implanted device such as anterior interbody cages, aneurysm clip or pedicle screws allergic to contrast agent tattoos [in area of examination if contains metallic pigment]) or will likely require sedation for the procedure</criteria>
