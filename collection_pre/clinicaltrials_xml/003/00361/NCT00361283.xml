	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to test whether atorvastatin (also known as Lipitor) has anti-inflammatory effects in people with no known heart disease or high cholesterol. We also are investigating whether or not genetic differences between people plays a role in the drug response.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Systemic Immunomodulatory Effects and Pharmacogenetics of Atorvastatin in Early Atherosclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All subjects received 16 weeks of Atorvastatin after a two week run in. Key dependent variables were the 16 week value minus the baseline value (post run-in). Last observation carried forward was used for missing values. The key comparisons are for two groups OATP1B1 reduced carriers and on-carriers and their association with Cytokines and Lipids. Secondarily, we were interested in changes over the 16 weeks for the pooled sample, irrespective of genetics.</detailed_description>
