	<brief_title>Study of Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPI) to Prevent Strictures After Gastric Bypass Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LYRGB) has been shown to be a safe and effective procedure for the treatment of morbid obesity. However, a common early complication of LYRGB is stricture at the gastrojejunal (GJ) anastomosis, occurring in 4% - 27% of patients, usually within the third post-operative month. This complication usually presents with progressive dysphagia leading to daily vomiting. Endoscopic balloon dilation is the treatment of choice for this complication, and multiple dilations are often required to provide complete resolution. The etiology of GJ anastomotic strictures is unknown and is probably multi-factorial. Some investigators hypothesize that ischemia or non-ischemia-related excessive scar formation is the cause of stricture. The method of construction of the anastomosis as well seems to have an impact, as circular stapled anastomoses may have higher rates of stricture than linear staplers or completely hand-sewn anastomoses. The route of the Roux limb (antecolic vs retrocolic) does not appear to affect this complication. Several investigators have demonstrated little acid production in the gastric bypass pouch. Despite this data, acid secretion has been hypothesized as a predominant factor in the development of GJ stricture. This hypothesis is supported in part by the frequent finding of ulcers at the site of stricture in up to 55% of patients. The purpose of this study is to determine whether suppressing acid production by administration of daily proton pump inhibitors in the early post-operative period will reduce GJ anastomosis stricture rate.
