	<brief_summary>Our guidelines in the community recommend the use of NM for the treatment of women with community acquired UTI. While the length of treatment for uncomplicated cystitis with quinolones or TMP-SMX is three days, NM is recommended for seven days. However, there are not sufficient papers that establish the optimal length of treatment with NM in this population. The aim of this proposal is to evaluate and compare NM 3 day vs. 7 day treatment for the treatment of women with uncomplicated UTI.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The aim of this proposal is to evaluate and compare NM 3 day vs. 7 day treatment for the treatment of women with uncomplicated UTI. Our design is to enroll 400 women with uncomplicated cystitis and divided according to a double-blind randomization in two groups (3 days vs. 7 days). The women will be followed 7 days and 28 days clinically and bacteriologically.</detailed_description>
