	<brief_summary>Bronchiolitis is a common disease of infancy and a main reason for infants' hospital admissions in the first 2 years of life. The main cause of bronchiolitis is RSV (respiratory syncytial virus). Though, Treatment is mainly supportive, the treatment benefit of nebulized epinephrine or albuterol has been largely debated for the past years. Most of the clinical studies used clinical parameters to detect and compare the effectiveness of such medical interventions. In this study we will use non invasive computerized method of wheeze and crackles quantification to compare the effectiveness of nebulized epinephrine vs albuterol in RSV Bronchiolitis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Acoustic Assessment of Nebulized Epinephrine Versus Albuterol for RSV Bronchiolitis- a Double Blind Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Inpatient Infants younger than 2 years of age with first episode of RSV bronchiolitis will be randomly assigned to treatment with nebulized epinephrine (1 mg diluted with 3 ml of 0.9% saline) or nebulized albuterol (2.5 mg diluted with 3.5 ml of 0.9% saline). Both solutions will be provided in identical containers. Clinical assessment and clinical score will be done before treatment, 10 and 30 minutes after treatment. The following parameters were recorded at each time point, wheezing, respiratory distress, O2 saturation, respiratory rate and heart rate. Computerized lung sounds as well, will be recorded before treatment, 10 and 30 minutes after treatment via 4 contact sensors attached to the chest.</detailed_description>
