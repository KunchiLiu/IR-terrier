	<brief_summary>Inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A(HMG-CoA) reductase can play a role in preventing recurrent vascular events from ischemic heart disease patients, whose mechanism consists in not only the reduction of serum lipid level but also anti-inflammatory effects. Serum high sensitive CRP is known to be a predictor of cardiovascular events independent of other conventional risk factors. The present substudy examine whether such pleiotrophic effect of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (statin) which decreases high sensitive CRP would be observed in the post-ischemic stroke patients who have already been registered in the J-STARS, and the relationship the values of high sensitive CRP and recurrence of stroke.</brief_summary>
