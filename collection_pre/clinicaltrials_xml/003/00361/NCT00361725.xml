	<brief_summary>This is a comparative study performed in 3 groups of patients/subjects: 30 severe sepsis patients, 30 non-septic patients with organ failure, 30 healthy subjects. The only intervention is a venous blood sampling at the onset of the disease. The purpose of the study is to compare the PC pathway and expression and inflammatory genes between the 3 groups. The main hypothesis is that systemic inflammatory response and exacerbated coagulation activation are non specific of an infection as a triggering event.</brief_summary>
