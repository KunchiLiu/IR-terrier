	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of statin therapy for prevention of atrial fibrillation (AF) in pacemaker and non-pacemaker patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in the absence of significant coronary artery disease.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation: Role of Inflammation, Oxidative Stress Injury and Effect of Statins</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, with or without a dual chamber pacemaker and who meet all study criteria, will be randomized to receive either a placebo, or simvastatin 40 mg, daily for 6 months. Liver enzymes are drawn at randomization and 3 months. CRP and oxidative stress products are drawn at randomization, weekly for the first month and then monthly for 5 months. Patients transmit their rhythm, twice daily for 5 consecutive days at randomization, then 5 consecutive days monthly for 6 months. Clinic visits are required at randomization, 3 months and 6 months.</detailed_description>
