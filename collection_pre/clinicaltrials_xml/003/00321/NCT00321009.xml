	<brief_summary>To prospectively evaluate the utility of enoxaparin vs. oral warfarin in reduction of echocardiographic indices of LV mural thrombus. The primary outcome is the presence of LV mural thrombus at 3.5 months. The secondary outcome is cost analysis comparing the two arms.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>LV Thrombus Pilot Study for Comparing Enoxaparin Vs. Warfarin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with anterior Q-wave MIs and ejection fractions&lt;=40% will be enrolled within the first 4 days of infarction. Patients will be randomized to receive either enoxaparin 1mg/kg (maximum 100mg) subcutaneously every 12 hours for one month or heparin followed by oral warfarin for 3 months. Clinical and safety evaluations, 2-D echocardiograms at baseline and at 3.5 months and cost analysis will be performed.</detailed_description>
