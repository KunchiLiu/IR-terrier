	<brief_title>Graft-Augmented Rectocele Repair-A Randomized Surgical Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rectoceles may have a significant effect on the quality of life of women. Symptoms associated with rectoceles include a protruding vaginal mass, persistent pelvic pressure, and sexual dysfunction. Surgical repair is the most common treatment with success rates ranging from 65%-85% at 1-2 years. In an attempt to improve surgical outcomes, clinicians are using graft materials to augment weakened tissues in rectocele repairs: however, there is little data to support or refute these practices. The purpose of this study is to estimate the effect of graft augmentation on objective and subjective outcomes. Comparison: Rectocele repair without graft, compared to rectocele repair with the SurgiSIS (TM) graft.</detailed_description>
