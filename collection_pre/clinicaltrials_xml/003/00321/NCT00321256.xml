	<brief_summary>This research project is supported by a multicentric network of collaborators whose goal is to assess the efficacy of transplanting allogenic pancreas islets to restore insulin secretion in patients with brittle type 1, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and to improve their metabolic control.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Human Islet Transplantation in Brittle Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. The GRAGIL 2 Study.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The general objective is to demonstrate the beneficial effect of islet allotransplantation in patients with brittle type 1 diabetes with no endogenous insulin secretion, for whom the risk of the spontaneous course of the disease is judged to be worse than the transplantation-related risk. The specific objective is to establish reference data for islet transplantation in non-uremic patients with brittle diabetes, in a multicentric network setting, using the Edmonton protocol.</detailed_description>
