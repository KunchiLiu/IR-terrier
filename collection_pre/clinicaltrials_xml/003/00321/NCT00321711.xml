	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of Romiplostim (AMG 531) on the incidence of clinically significant thrombocytopenic events (grade 3 or 4 and/or receipt of platelet transfusions) in subjects with low or intermediate risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) receiving hypomethylating agents. It is hypothesized that Romiplostim administration, at the appropriate dose and schedule, will result in reduction in the incidence of clinically significant thrombocytopenic events in low or intermediate risk MDS subjects receiving hypomethylating agents.</brief_summary>
