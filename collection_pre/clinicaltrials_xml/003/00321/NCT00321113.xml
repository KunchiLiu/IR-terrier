	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to explore the safety and efficacy of two different immunosuppressive regimens (sequential tacrolimus/mycophenolate mofetil [MMF] plus steroids versus tacrolimus plus MMF, following induction with daclizumab) in recipients of marginal donor kidneys.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Two Tacrolimus Based Immunosuppressive Regimens in Recipients Receiving Marginal Donor Kidneys</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An open, multicentre, randomized, parallel group study to compare in marginal old-for-old renal transplant patients the safety and efficacy of two treatments: sequential mycophenolate mofetil/delayed tacrolimus plus steroids vs tacrolimus plus mycophenolate mofetil, in patients requiring induction with anti-IL2 monoclonal antibody. Elderly (≥50 years) low risk patients (PRA grade ≤50%, in the previous 6 months) receiving an allograft transplantation of marginal kidney(s) from elderly (&gt;65 years) donors (old-for-old allocation) will be randomized to one of the following treatment arms: Arm1: Sequential mycophenolate mofetil/tacrolimus/steroids Arm2: Tacrolimus/mycophenolate mofetil/steroid one single dose (perioperatively)</detailed_description>
