	<brief_title>Comparison of the ProAdjuster Analysis to the Penning Method of Determining Intersegmental Motion of the Cervical Spine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will utilize the ProAdjuster Device as a method of assessing the motion of the cervical spine in participants with instability as determined by a Penning Radiographic analysis. Only participants with existing radiographic studies will be included in the study. No additional Radiographic will be required.</detailed_description>
