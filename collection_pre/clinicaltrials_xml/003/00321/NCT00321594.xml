	<brief_summary>This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of belinostat and to see how well it works in treating patients with liver cancer that cannot be removed by surgery. Belinostat may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Belinostat in Treating Patients With Liver Cancer That Cannot Be Removed By Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of PXD101 (belinostat) in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). (Phase I) II. Assess the pharmacokinetic profiles of PXD101 in these patients. (Phase I) III. Assess tumor response in patients treated with this drug. (Phase II) OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation phase I study followed by a phase II study. PHASE I: Patients receive belinostat intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1-5. Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of belinostat until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. PHASE II: Patients receive belinostat (as in phase I) at the MTD determined in phase I. After completion of study therapy, patients are followed for up to 8 weeks.</detailed_description>
