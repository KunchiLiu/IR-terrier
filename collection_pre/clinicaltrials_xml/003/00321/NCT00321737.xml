	<criteria>Subjects must have successfully completed the Phase 3 Study TEE04084 (NCT00251693) or TEE04085 (NCT00251719); and have healed esophageal erosions proven by endoscopy. Complete healing was assessed for change in LA Esophagitis Classification grades A, B, C, or D to healed (defined as anything less than the criterion for Grade A). The subject was counted as healed if endoscopy findings did not meet the Grade A criterion. Use of prescription or nonprescription proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), histamine (H2) receptor antagonists, sucralfate, misoprostol, or prokinetics throughout the study. Use of antacids (except for study supplied) throughout the study. Use of drugs with significant anticholinergic effects such as tricyclics who cannot stay on a stable dose throughout the study. Chronic (&gt;12 doses per month) use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or cyclooxygenase2 (COX2) inhibitors. Need for continuous anticoagulant therapy. Evidence of uncontrolled systemic disease. Subjects who have participated in either maintenance study (TEE04086 [NCT00255164] or TEE04087 [NCT00255151]). Subjects who, in the opinion of the investigator, is unable to comply with the requirements of the study or is unsuitable for any reason.</criteria>
