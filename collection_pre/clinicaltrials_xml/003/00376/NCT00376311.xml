	<brief_title>Effects of Oral Salmon Calcitonin in Human Osteoarthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Osteoarthritis (OA) is a difficult condition to manage and, thus far, we have no simple, effective interventions for this common cause of pain and disability. Because parenteral salmon calcitonin (sCT) has positive effects in canine experimental OA, this phase IIa, randomized,placebo-controlled, double-blind trial evaluates the safety, tolerance and clinical efficacy of an oral formulation of sCT in patients with OA. Patients receive a tablet containing either a placebo, 0.5 mg sCT or 1 mg sCT that they have to take every day in the morning 15 minutes before breakfast for 3 months.</detailed_description>
