	<brief_summary>Decreased insulin sensitivity is and independent risk factor for stroke despite glycemic control. It is known that physical exercise increases insulin sensitivity in healthy subjects. Wether stroke patients can increase insulin sensitivity via physical exercise is not known. Chronic low-grade inflammation is associated with an increased risk of stroke. Physical exercise has shown to increase IL-6 directly after exercise in untrained subjects. When fitness is increased in each subject then the peak IL-6 concentration after exercise decreases and so does the basal level of IL-6. It is not known whether stroke patients can increase physical activity level to a degree where chronic inflammation are decreased. This study is designed to evaluate if physical exercise after stroke will increases insulin sensitivity and reduce low-grade chronic inflammation. Stroke patients have been randomized to intervention with physical exercise or control in the ExStroke pilot trial and followed for 2 years. Using the study population from the ExStroke pilot trail blood samples will be obtained at the last control. Insulin sensitivity can be measured from fasting glucose and insulin using the Homeostasis Model Assessment (HOMA). Interleukin-6, TNF-alfa and CRP is measured to estimate chronic inflammation.</brief_summary>
