	<brief_summary>Gaucher disease, the most prevalent lysosomal storage disorder, is caused by mutations in the human glucocerebrosidase gene (GCD) leading to reduced activity of the lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase and thereby to the accumulation of substrate glucocerebroside (GlcCer) in the cells of the monocyte-macrophage system. This is the second trial to utilize a recombinant active form of lysosomal enzyme, glucocerebrosidase, (human prGCD) which is expressed and purified in a bioreactor system from transformed carrot plant root cell line.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase III Trial to Assess the Safety and Efficacy of Plant Cell Expressed GCD in Patients With Gaucher Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This will be a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, parallel group, dose-ranging trial to assess the safety and efficacy of prGCD in 30 untreated patients with Gaucher disease. Patients will receive IV infusion of prGCD every two weeks at the selected medical center. The duration of the study will be nine months. At the end of the 9-month treatment period (20 visits, 38 weeks) eligible patients will be offered enrollment in an open-label extension study. There will be two treatment groups, 15 patients in each treatment group. Treatment Group I: 30 units/kg every 2 weeks. Treatment Group II: 60 units/kg every 2 weeks. All patients will have pharmacokinetic data collected over approximately 3 hours with frequent blood samples following the first and final doses of prGCD.</detailed_description>
