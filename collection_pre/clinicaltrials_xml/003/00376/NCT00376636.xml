	<brief_title>Phase IIa Safety and Efficacy Study of SPP635 in Mild to Moderate Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Renin-Angiotensin system blockade is a well established target for treatment of high blood pressure. Blocking the system at the initial step, however, is a rather new concept that could only be implemented very recently through the availability of novel, oral, renin inhibitors. This study investigates the safety and efficacy of a novel oral renin inhibitor, SPP635.</detailed_description>
