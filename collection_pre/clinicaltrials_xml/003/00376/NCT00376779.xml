	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to show that the immunogenicity of newly formulated DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib vaccine is as good as the immunogenicity of the currently licensed formulation of the vaccine. The vaccine will be administered as a primary vaccination course to healthy infants at 2, 3 and 4 months of age and its safety and reactogenicity will also be assessed.</brief_summary>
