	<brief_summary>It was the aim of the present study to prospectively compare the functional and morphological outcome of idiopathic epiretinal membrane surgery with and without the assistance of Indocyanine green (ICG). The main outcome measure was improvement of best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA). This was treated as an open question and we had no hypothesis which of the two therapies was superior.</brief_summary>
