	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Studying the barriers that prevent minority and low-income women from undergoing cancer screening, and offering encouragement to them over the telephone, may help improve cancer screening rates. PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying how well a telephone-based Prevention Care Manager increases screening rates for breast cancer, cervical cancer, and colorectal cancer in minority and low-income women.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Telephone-Based Prevention Care Manager in Increasing Screening Rates for Breast Cancer, Cervical Cancer, and Colorectal Cancer in Minority and Low-Income Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine whether telephone support for patients, provided through a Prevention Care Manager (PCM), can increase breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer screening rates among minority and low-income women. - Measure the amount of PCM time required to improve early cancer detection provided to age-eligible ethnically diverse women seen in community health centers in the New York City area. - Learn barriers faced by this population in obtaining indicated services (mammograms, Pap tests, fecal occult blood testing, and sigmoidoscopy). - Assess at baseline and follow-up the office environment and work processes in each participating center (in PCM randomized controlled study only). - Develop and implement the PCM intervention to help patients overcome barriers. - Evaluate the impact and costs of the PCM in a randomized controlled efficacy trial. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, controlled, single-blind, multicenter study. Patients are randomized according to participating center. - Part 1: Some patients undergo a series of structured interviews about the obstacles to early cancer detection. Participating sites are assessed for study eligibility. - Part 2: Pilot testing, training, and competency testing of the Prevention Care Managers (PCM) are conducted. - Part 3: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 intervention arms. - Arm I: Patients are offered health education and follow-up services by telephone with a PCM. - Arm II: Patients receive usual care. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 2,729 (1,413 for PCM randomized controlled study and 1,316 for pilot study) patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
