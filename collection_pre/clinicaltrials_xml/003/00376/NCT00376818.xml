	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Yoga, meditation, and breathing exercises may help lower stress and improve quality of life in patients with malignant brain tumors and their family caregivers. PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well a stress reduction program works to improve the quality of life of patients with malignant brain tumors and their family caregivers.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Stress Reduction Program in Patients With Malignant Brain Tumors and Their Family Caregivers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine whether regular practice of a stress reduction program for 8 weeks improves the quality of life of patients with malignant brain tumors. Secondary - Determine whether regular practice of a stress reduction routine decreases perception of stress and anxiety and stress- and inflammation-related hormones in both patients with malignant brain tumors and their primary family caregivers. OUTLINE: This is a pilot study. Patients and caregivers receive a 90-minute stress-reduction session once a week for 8 weeks. Each session comprises an educational session on stress reduction and yoga therapy comprising specific yoga postures, breathing exercises, and relaxation and meditation. Quality of life, stress, anxiety, and levels of stress-related hormones (cortisol, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate [DHEAS], and melatonin) are assessed at baseline and at week 8. After completion of study treatment, patients and caregivers are followed at 6 and 12 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14 caregiver/patient pairs will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
