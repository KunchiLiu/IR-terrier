	<brief_summary>Study purpose The purpose of the study is to show that the addition of valsartan on top of established therapies can reduce the recurrence of atrial fibrillation in patients with a history of recent atrial fibrillation associated with cardiovascular diseases/comorbidities. Primary objective To demonstrate that, in patients with history of recent atrial fibrillation treated with the best recommended therapies, the addition of valsartan 320 mg is superior to placebo in reducing atrial fibrillation recurrence. Study design The GISSI-AF is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled study. Patients with a history of atrial fibrillation will be centrally randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either valsartan or placebo. GISSI-AF will be a pragmatic trial, with broad selection criteria to mimic real clinical practice as much as possible. Since no special examinations or procedures are required for the trial, the economic impact on the National Health Service will be minimized and use of resources likely to be optimized. The enrollment period will last 12 months. The patients will be followed up for 12 months from study entry All prescribed treatments for AF or for the underlying cardiovascular diseases, including ACE-inhibitors, amiodarone and betablockers, will be allowed: - patients should be on a stable treatment for at least one month - the current guideline for hypertension treatment should be applied - patients should not be started on ARBs during the study</brief_summary>
