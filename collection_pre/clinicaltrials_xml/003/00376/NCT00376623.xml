	<brief_summary>The trial will be performed to evaluate whether BI 2536 may be effective in the treatment of advanced or metastatic NSCLC of stage IIIB or IV in patients who relapsed after or failed first-line therapy. A secondary aim is to identify the most suitable dosage schedule for the further Phase II and III clinical programme of BI 2536. To achieve this objective two dosage schedules are compared.</brief_summary>
