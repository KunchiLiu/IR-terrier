	<brief_title>Antioxidant Supplementation in Patients With Kashin-Beck Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Current research regarding Kashin-Beck disease, (KBD) have identified dramatic deficiencies of both selenium and iodine in patients with this disease. Initial supplementation of these trace minerals provided no measurable benefit to the affected population. Research conducted by Innovative Humanitarian Solutions, suggests that such deficiencies may not be causal, but markers of an underlying condition of extreme oxidative stress brought on by the improper functioning of the Glutathione Peroxidase enzyme in synthesizing H202 during periods of critical cellular development, primarily in mesenchymal cell development. The purpose of this trial is to determine the efficacy of antioxidant supplementation in aiding the Glutathione Peroxidase enzyme in its proper function and thereby reducing oxidative stress and enabling the uptake of selenium and iodine which are necessary for proper bone growth and development.</detailed_description>
