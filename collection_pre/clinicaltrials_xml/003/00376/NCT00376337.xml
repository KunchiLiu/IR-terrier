	<brief_title>Micafungin Salvage Mono-therapy in Invasive Aspergillosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a phase II, multicentre, prospective, active-controlled, open-label, 2:1 randomised and parallel group clinical study. Patients will be stratified according to the baseline infection status and the baseline neutropenic status: - Intolerant to previous antifungal therapy - Refractory to previous antifungal therapy; progression of infection - Refractory to previous antifungal therapy; failure to improve In case, criteria for both intolerant and refractory are fulfilled at the same time the patient will be considered as refractory. - Neutropenic (absolute neutrophil count (ANC &lt; 500 cells/mm3) - Non neutropenic (ANC &gt;= 500 cells/mm3)</detailed_description>
