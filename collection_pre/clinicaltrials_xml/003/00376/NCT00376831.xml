	<brief_summary>Providing adequate sedation and analgesia is an integral part of the practice of colonoscopy procedure. There are various protocols and methods used to prevent discomfort and alleviate pain. Conscious sedation is one of the options recommended by the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy, although the choice of the exact protocol is left to the physician's discretion. This study will attempt to recommend a preferred protocol based on a double blind randomized prospective method. The efficacy of midazolam and ketamine will be compared to the efficacy of midazolam and fentanyl for sedation in ambulatory colonoscopies. The results will be compiled from objective data and patient and physician interviews.</brief_summary>
