	<brief_title>Prolonged Treatment for Infected Abortion After Hospital Discharge.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The use of 7-10 days of treatment for infected/septic abortion is not based on clinical trials. A recent evidence showed that endometritis post cesarean section needs no treatment after hospital discharge. The objective of this study is to verify if this finding also applies to infected abortions. After in hospital treatment, the patients will be randomized to the traditional treatment (metronidazole and doxycycline) or to placebo until 10 days of treatment is completed. Active follow-up will be done every 2 days, and the patient will be reevaluated at the end of treatment. Cure will be defined as the absence of fever, pain and bleeding. Failure of treatment will be considered as the need for hospitalization or additional antibiotics.</detailed_description>
