	<brief_title>Melatonin and Cardiac Outcome After Major Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Abdominal aortic surgery is associated with a significant increase of oxidative and inflammatory stress response. Aortic surgery is also associated with elevated troponin which is a sensitive and specific marker for myocardial injury. The severity of oxidative stress is correlated with elevated troponin. Melatonin, which is a hormone produced in brain, seems to modify cell damage and inflammation. On the other hand we know, that melatonin production first night after surgery is disturbed. The purpose of this study is therefore to determine whether treatment with melatonin can reduce cell damage and inflammation, and thereby occurrence of myocardial injury associated with abdominal aortic surgery.</detailed_description>
