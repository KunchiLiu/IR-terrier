	<brief_summary>Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener's) (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) are two rare immune system disorders that cause the inflammation of blood vessels, or vasculitis. In order to properly treat these diseases, it is critical that the level of disease activity can be determined over the course of the disease. The purpose of this study is to determine new biological markers, or biomarkers, that may be used to assess the severity of disease in people with GPA or MPA.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Longitudinal Protocol for Granulomatosis With Polyangiitis (Wegener's) and Microscopic Polyangiitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>GPA and MPA are two autoimmune disorders that cause systemic vasculitis. GPA commonly affects the upper respiratory tract, the lungs, and the kidneys. MPA is marked by kidney inflammation, weight loss, skin lesions, nerve damage, and fever. Many patients with WG or MPA show no visible symptoms of active disease; it is known that underlying subclinical disease activity leads to long-term damage in these patients. Also, because it is difficult to monitor WG and MPA disease activity, it is difficult for clinicians to know when and how to treat these patients. This study will use new scientific methods to identify new biomarkers that can be used to monitor disease activity in GPA and MPA patients. These biomarkers may be used to help direct clinical care for GPA and MPA patients and assist in future drug development. Study visits will occur monthly for the first year, then every 3 months thereafter for the remainder of the study. Blood and urine collection will occur at every visit. A physical exam and medical and medication history will occur every 3 months; also, participants will be asked to complete several questionnaires to assess disease activity, health status, and tobacco, alcohol, and drug use. Participants may have additional study visits if a disease flare or disease-related complications occur during the study.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Diagnosis of GPA or MPA. Widely accepted diagnostic criteria, as opposed to classification criteria or definitions, have not been developed for GPA and MPA. For diagnosis of GPA, meets at least 2 of the following 5 modified American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria: 1. Nasal or oral inflammation with oral ulcers or nasal discharge with pus or blood 2. Abnormal chest radiograph with nodules, fixed infiltrates, or cavities 3. Urinary sediment with microhematuria or red cell casts 4. Granulomatous inflammation within the wall of an artery or in the perivascular area on biopsy 5. Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) positive by enzyme immunoassay for either PR3 or MPOANCA For diagnosis of MPA, meets the Chapel Hill Consensus Conference Definition for MPA: 1. Necrotizing vasculitis, with few or no immune deposits, that affects small vessels (i.e., capillaries, venules, arterioles) 2. Necrotizing arteritis involving small and mediumsized arteries may be present 3. Necrotizing glomerulonephritis is very common 4. Pulmonary capillaritis often occurs Parent or guardian willing to provide informed consent, if applicable Simultaneous diagnoses of both GPA and MPA Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (ChurgStrauss) Takayasu's arteritis Giant cell arteritis Polyarteritis nodosa Cogan's syndrome Behcet's disease Sarcoidosis Kawasaki disease Tuberculosis or any atypical mycobacterial infections Deep fungal infections Lymphoma, lymphomatoid granulomatosis, or any other type of cancer that mimics antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodyassociated vasculitis (AAVs) Cryoglobulinemic vasculitis Systemic lupus erythematosus Rheumatoid arthritis Mixed connective tissue disease or any overlapping autoimmune syndrome</criteria>
