	<brief_summary>Using a rapidly responding nitric oxide analyzer in a new developed modular lung-function-setup we are going to measure steady-state NO diffusing capacity in 107 healthy subjects (age 6-45 years). The results will be compared to those measured by using carbon monoxide single-breath estimates. We like to show that the new method is sufficient to measure exactly lung diffusion capacity in this collective.</brief_summary>
