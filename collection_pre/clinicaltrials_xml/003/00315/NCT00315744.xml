	<brief_summary>Asthmatic children who remain symptomatic on inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) require an adjustment of their asthma therapy. Current guidelines suggest that the treatment options are either an increased dose of inhaled corticosteroid or the addition of other therapy such as a long-acting beta-agonist (LABA). In the paediatric age range, major concerns with respect to high dose ICS therapy are growth retardation and the suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis. Previous studies in adults have shown that a combination product that included a LABA as well as the ICS allowed to reduce the steroid dose and was still at least as effective in achieving asthma control as treatment with a higher dose of ICS. These treatment options shall be compared in the present study. Children who remain symptomatic while inhaling 100 µg fluticasone (FP) twice daily shall be randomised to receive the salmeterol/ fluticasone combination product, Viani (SERETIDE) 50/100 µg, or fluticasone 200 µg as a comparator drug, inhaled twice daily via the DISKUS for a period of eight weeks.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Children aged 4 to 16 years with an established history of perennial asthma. Subjects who are treated with an inhaled corticosteroid according to BDP (budesonide) 200400 µg/day or equivalent during the last 4 weeks before runin. 15 minutes after inhaling 200µg of salbutamol, reversible increase in FEV1 of at least 12% of the predose value. Willingness to substitute previous controller medication on the twice daily inhalation of fluticasone 100µg bid via DISKUS®. Subjects/guardians who have given written informed consent to participate in the study. Subjects /guardians who are able to understand and complete a diary record card (DRC). Subjects who are able to use a MiniWright Peak Flow meter. Sexually active female adolescents must use adequate contraception. Willingness to refrain from any other controller medication (including antileukotrienes) or from regular use of shortacting beta agonists or anticholinergics during the treatment period.</criteria>
