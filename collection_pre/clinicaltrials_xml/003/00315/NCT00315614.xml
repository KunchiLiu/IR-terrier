	<brief_summary>SPECIFIC AIMS: - To reverse hyperglycemia and insulin dependency in patients with Type 1 diabetes mellitus by islet cell transplantation. - To induce a state of donor specific tolerance and eliminate the need for continuous immunosuppressive therapy by simultaneous transplantation of donor bone marrow cells with islets and utilization of the monoclonal antibody Campath-1H for induction of Immunosuppression. - To assess long-term function of successful islet cell transplants in patients with Type 1 diabetes mellitus. - To determine whether the natural history of the microvascular, macrovascular and neuropathic complications are altered following successful transplantation of islet</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Islet Cell Transplantation Alone and CD34+ Donor Bone Marrow Cell Infusion in Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In our current protocol (IRB #2000/0024) the immunosuppressive regimen, comprised of induction with daclizumab and maintenance therapy with sirolimus and tacrolimus, has been combined with the infusion of CD34+ enriched donor bone marrow stem cells in an attempt to create a chimeric state and hence induce donor tolerance. This strategy was tested by evaluating graft survival following the removal of all immunosuppressive medication after one year.</detailed_description>
