	<brief_summary>This research seeks to establish a neonatal DNA Tissue Bank to find out if differences in small segments of DNA predispose babies to Chronic Lung Disease (CLD), Periventricular Brain Injury (PVI), Necrotizing Enterocolitis (NEC), or Hypoxic Respiratory Failure (HRF).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Genomics, Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs), and Clinical Neonatology</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This genetic predisposition study does not involve investigational drugs, devices, or treatments. Our broad goal is to identify genomic factors, which contribute to the development or exacerbation of common and critical illnesses that affect preterm and near-term infants. We seek to accomplish this goal in the following ways: - First: to test candidate gene DNA variations and link already identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) producing functional alterations to the risk of clinically important disorders. - Second: to utilize a whole-genomic approach to identify SNPs not previously linked to the risk of development or progression of neonatal disorders.</detailed_description>
