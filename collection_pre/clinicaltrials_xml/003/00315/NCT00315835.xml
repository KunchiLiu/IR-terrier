	<detailed_description>Buprenorphine is a synthetic opioid analgesic with over twenty-five years of international clinical experience indicating it to be safe and effective in a variety of therapeutic situations for the relief of moderate to severe pain. Transdermal systems may offer advantages over currently indicated oral products including ease and convenience of use, improved compliance, possible reduction in patient care, and prolonged and consistent delivery of drug.</detailed_description>
