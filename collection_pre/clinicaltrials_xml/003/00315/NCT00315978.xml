	<brief_title>The Impact of Patient Involvement in Decision-Making About Heart Disease Prevention</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: Low utilization of effective CHD prevention strategies may be due to many factors, but chief among them is the lack of patient involvement in prevention decisions. We undertook this study to test the effectiveness of an individually-tailored, computerized decision aid about CHD on patientsâ€™ discussions with their doctor and their plans for CHD prevention. Methods: We conducted a pilot randomized trial in a convenience sample of adults with no previous history of cardiovascular disease to test the effectiveness of an individually-tailored, computerized decision aid about CHD prevention against a risk factor list that patients could present to their doctor.</detailed_description>
