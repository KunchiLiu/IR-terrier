	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the safety profile, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and maximum tolerated dose of RAF265 in patients with locally advanced and metastatic melanoma. Phase II portion of study (dose expansion) has been cancelled with Amendment 7 as of Dec 2011.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate RAF265, an Oral Drug Administered to Subjects With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway plays a prominent role in controlling several key cellular functions including growth, proliferation and survival. B-Raf is a member of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway and is frequently mutated in melanoma resulting in activation of the MAPK pathway. RAF265 is a novel, orally active, small molecule with potent inhibitory activity against B-Raf kinase and additional antiangiogenic activity through inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor type 2 (VEGFR-2) in non-clinical studies. The primary objectives of this study are to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), dose limiting toxicities (DLTs), and the safety profile of RAF265 when administered orally to subjects with locally advanced or metastatic melanoma; to determine the plasma pharmacokinetics (PKs) of orally administered RAF265; and to evaluate potential pharmacodynamic effects of RAF265 using tumor biopsies, peripheral blood samples, and tumor imaging.</detailed_description>
