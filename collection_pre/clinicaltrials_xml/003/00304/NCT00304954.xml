	<brief_summary>This study examined whether the anti-inflammatory medicines infliximab, sirolimus or daclizumab, when given with a participant's current therapies, would prevent the growth of new blood vessels in the eye in participants with age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Participants 55 years of age and older with AMD and drusen larger than 63um may be eligible for this study. Vision in the study eye was between 20/20 and 20/400. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three treatments - infliximab, sirolimus, or daclizumab - or to observation only. In addition, participants may have been treated by their ophthalmologist as needed for their AMD. Infliximab and daclizumab were given intravenously (through a vein); infusions were given at enrollment in the study, then at 2 weeks, and then monthly. Sirolimus was a pill that was taken every other day for the duration of the study. At 6 months, participants were evaluated to see whether continuing treatment would be beneficial. In addition to treatment or observation, participants underwent the following procedures: Physical examination at enrollment and 6 months. Photographs of the back of the eye, fluorescein angiography, indocyanine green angiography and measurement of retinal thickness at enrollment and months 1, 3 and 6. - Fluorescein angiography evaluated the eye's blood vessels. A yellow dye was injected into an arm vein and traveled to the blood vessels in the eyes. Pictures of the retina were taken using a camera that flashed a blue light into the eye. The pictures show if any dye has leaked from the vessels into the retina, indicating possible blood vessel abnormality. - Indocyanine green angiography identified feeder vessels that may have supplied abnormal blood vessels. This procedure is similar to fluorescein angiography, but uses a green dye and flashes an invisible light. - Optical coherence tomography measures retinal thickness. This test shines a light into the eye and produces cross-sectional pictures of the retina. These measurements are repeated during the study to determine whether retinal thickening is getting better or worse, or staying the same. Tuberculin skin test and chest x-ray at enrollment and 6 months. Blood tests at enrollment and months 1, 3 and 6.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Infliximab, Sirolimus and Daclizumab to Treat Age-Related Macular Degeneration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There has been much interest in the possible role of the immune system in AMD. Experimental models and patient material have, to date, suggested a role for macrophages and complement. This study hypothesized that the underlying mechanism that leads to choroidal neovascularization (CNV) is similar to those at play in atherosclerosis. If this is the case, the investigators believed that CNV treatment should be amenable to new immunomodulatory agents directed against specific parts of the immune system. After therapy with anti-angiogenic agents not leading to a persistent remission of CNV due to AMD, participants were treated with one of three immunomodulatory agents or were observed in conjunction with their continued anti-angiogenic therapy. Thus the participant continued with the anti-angiogenic therapy they received after randomization. The investigators hypothesized that this combination therapy would inhibit progression of CNV associated with AMD. This was an open-label, phase II, randomized, single center clinical trial of 18 study participants randomized to receive one of three immunomodulatory agents or was observed in conjunction with their anti-angiogenic therapy.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA: 1. Understand and sign the institutional review board (IRB)approved informed consent document for the study. 2. Age greater than 55 years. 3. In the study eye, diagnosis of AMD defined by the presence of drusen larger than 63 microns. 4. Any antiangiogenic therapy in the study eye within 7 days of beginning immunosuppressive therapy. 5. In the study eye, the participant's study eye vision is between 20/20 and 20/400. 6. In the study eye, the presence of CNV under the fovea determined by the investigators and defined as any one of the following fluorescein angiographic (FA) features: 1. Early stippled hyperfluorescence of flat retinal pigment epithelium (RPE)and little or mild leakage in the late frames of the fluorescein (occult). 2. Irregular elevation of the RPE that does not exhibit discrete or bright hyperfluorescence in the early transit phase of the angiogram. Stippled hyperfluorescence may be present. Late frames may show persistent fluorescein staining or leakage within a sensory retinal detachment overlying this area (occult). 3. Latephase leakage of undetermined source with leakage at the level of the RPE in the latephase frames of the angiogram in which the source of the late leakage cannot be determined from earlierphase frames of the angiogram (occult). 4. A welldemarcated area of bright hyperfluorescence in the early phase of the angiogram with leakage through the mid and latephase frames which obscures the boundaries of the area (classic). 7. For all CNV lesions considered to have occult CNV with no classic CNV, one of the following criteria must be met: 1. A documented loss of visual acuity (5 or more letters of bestcorrected visual acuity if both measurements are made using an Early Treatment for Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) chart or, a doubling of the visual angle if Snellen acuities are available from either an outside referral center or within the participating center (e.g., 20/80 to 20/160) a doubling of the visual angle is required because of the measurement variability of Snellen acuities). OR 2. Documented FA evidence of a 10% increase in the lesion greatest linear dimension over the 3 months prior to enrollment. OR 3. Documented blood associated with CNV. 8. The greatest linear dimension of the entire lesion (classic CNV, occult CNV and any features that could obscure the identification of classic or occult CNV) has to be less than or equal to 5400 microns in greatest linear dimension on the retina as measured by the treating ophthalmologist. 9. Retinal photographs and angiography of sufficient quality, allowing assessment of the macular area according to standard clinical practice, can be obtained. 10. Women of childbearing potential must not be pregnant or lactating, must have a negative pregnancy test at screening and must be practicing an adequate method of birth control.
