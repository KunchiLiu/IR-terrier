	<brief_title>Study of RADPLAT and Tarceva in Locally Advanced Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCCA)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Head and neck malignancies represent a group of epidermoid tumors that arise from the epithelial lining of the mouth, pharynx, and larynx. Three modalities of therapy have established roles in the treatment of carcinoma of the head and neck: chemotherapy, radiation therapy (XRT), and surgery. The choice of modality depends upon many factors such as the site and extent of the primary lesion, the likelihood of complete surgical resection, the presence of lymph node metastases, etc. Traditionally, smaller lesions (stage T1-T2) are effectively treated either, by surgical excision or irradiation whereas more advanced disease (stage III-IV) is treated with combined surgery and XRT. The subsequent morbidity related to extensive surgery is a major problem among survivors. Clearly, there is a need to develop therapeutic strategies for patients with advanced head and neck cancer with more effective approaches employing non-surgical modalities. Our hypothesis is that head and neck cancers are resistant to apoptosis from DNA damage induced by radiation and chemotherapy. This resistance is mediated by EGFR overexpression which results in downstream activation of cell survival signals, such as AKT, and may be overcome when Erlotinib (Tarceva) is co-administered with RADiation and cisPLATin (intraarterial chemotherapy).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed Stage IIIIV disease comprised of T3 or T4 N02 lesions of the oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, and larynx. No previous radiation therapy or chemotherapy. No evidence of distant metastatic disease. Age &gt; 18. Karnofsky performance status of &gt; 60 (ECOG 2). ANC &gt; 1000, platelets &gt; 100,000, calculated or 24hour creatinine clearance &gt; 60. Studyspecific informed consent form. Protocol treatment must begin &lt; 8 weeks of diagnostic biopsy. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document. Patients with surgically cured secondary malignancy who have been disease free &gt; 5 years are eligible. Radiologic evidence of bone destruction. Previous or concurrent head and neck primaries. Prior surgery to study site other than biopsy. Patients receiving any other investigational agents. History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to agents used in the study. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because treatments and agents have the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. For this reason, women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. History of a prior or concomitant malignancy (other than carcinoma in situ of the cervix, basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin).</criteria>
