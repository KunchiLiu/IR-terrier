	<brief_summary>This phase III clinical trial is studying how well cisplatin-based chemotherapy and/or surgery works in treating young patients with stage I, stage II, stage III or stage IV adrenocortical cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more tumor cells. Giving chemotherapy before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed. Giving it after surgery may kill any tumor cells that remain after surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cisplatin-Based Chemotherapy and/or Surgery in Treating Young Patients With Adrenocortical Tumor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Describe the outcome of patients with stage I adrenocortical tumor (ACT) treated with surgery alone. II. Describe the outcome of patients with stage II ACT treated with radical adrenalectomy plus regional retroperitoneal lymph node dissection. III. Describe the outcome of patients with unresectable or metastatic ACT treated with mitotane and a cisplatin-based chemotherapy regimen. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the feasibility and complications associated with the use of radical adrenalectomy and regional node dissection (RLND) in these patients. II. Determine the toxicity of mitotane when administered with cisplatin, etoposide, and doxorubicin hydrochloride in patients with residual disease after surgery, inoperable tumors, or metastatic disease at diagnosis. III. Determine, prospectively, the frequency of tumor spillage during surgery in these patients. IV. Determine the frequency of lymph node involvement in these patients. V. Compare the incidence and type of germline p53 mutation in non-Brazilian children and children from Southern Brazil. VI. Characterize the cooperating molecular alterations associated with ACT. VII. Determine the presence of embryonal markers in children with ACT. OUTLINE: STRATUM I (stage I disease): Patients undergo primary tumor resection and retroperitoneal lymph node sampling followed by observation. Patients who have undergone prior surgery without nodal sampling undergo observation only. STRATUM II (stage II disease): Patients undergo primary tumor resection and extended regional lymph node dissection followed by observation. Patients who have undergone prior surgery with simple resection of the primary tumor undergo exploratory surgery with extended regional lymph node dissection followed by observation. STRATUM III (stage III or IV disease): INDUCTION CHEMOTHERAPY: Patients receive cisplatin-based chemotherapy comprising oral mitotane four times daily on days 1-21; cisplatin IV over 6 hours on days 1-2; etoposide IV over 1 hour on days 1-3; and doxorubicin hydrochloride IV over 1 hour on days 4-5. Patients also receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) once daily beginning on day 6 and continuing until blood counts recover OR pegfilgrastim SC once on day 6. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 2-4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with stable disease or partial response proceed to surgery. Patients with a complete response proceed directly to continuation chemotherapy. SURGERY: Patients with stage III disease undergo extended surgery and regional lymph node dissection. Patients with stage IV disease undergo primary tumor resection (if feasible) with regional lymph node dissection and resection of the metastases. Patients then proceed to continuation chemotherapy. CONTINUATION CHEMOTHERAPY: Patients receive additional cisplatin-based chemotherapy (as in induction chemotherapy) for 4-6 courses followed by mitotane alone for an additional 2 months. Patients with stage IV disease then proceed to additional surgery when feasible. ADDITIONAL SURGEY: Patients with stage IV disease may undergo additional primary tumor resection with regional lymph node dissection and resection (or re-resection) of the metastases. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for at least 5 years.</detailed_description>
