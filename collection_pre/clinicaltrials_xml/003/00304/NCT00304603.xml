	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to explore the mode of action of topiramate in the treatment of obese and diabetic patients by testing association between genetic variations within candidate genes or chromosomes (thread like structure found in cell which carries genes) and the clinical outcomes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mode of Action of Topiramate in the Treatment of Obese Patients With and Without Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This pharmacogenomics (effect of genetic variation on drug response) study will analyze genetic variations in the DNA extracted from blood samples collected from patients who were randomized (assigned to treatments by chance) in 1 of 3 previous topiramate studies on obesity and diabetes. The study consist of a screening telephone contact, a single visit to the study site for a blood sample collection (10 ml of whole blood) for genetic analyses, and a 24-hour post-sample adverse event reporting period. The total duration of the study is 24 hours from the time of the blood sample collection. Safety will be monitored up to 24 hours after blood sample collection. No study medication was administered.</detailed_description>
