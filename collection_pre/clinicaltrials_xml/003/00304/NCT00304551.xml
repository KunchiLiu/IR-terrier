	<brief_summary>This study evaluated the clinical response of the efficacy and safety of the combination therapy of peginterferon alfa-2a and ribavirin, compared with an antiviral treatment-free group in CHC patients with compensated LC. Additionally, this study evaluated the dosage reactivity and the pharmacokinetic characteristics of the combination therapy of peginterferon alfa-2a and ribavirin in CHC patients with compensated LC.</brief_summary>
