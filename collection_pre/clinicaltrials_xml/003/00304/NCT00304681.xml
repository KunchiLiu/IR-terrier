	<brief_title>An Effectiveness and Safety Study of CONCERTA* vs. Immediate Release Methylphenidate (IR MPH) in Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Methylphenidate, namely immediate release methylphenidate is the primary stimulant used in the treatment of children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Immediate release methylphenidate has limitations related to its time course of action.As the morning dose wears off, inattention may increase during late-morning classes. Similarly, when the midday dose is wearing off, the child may experience difficulty concentrating on homework. The second problem relates to compliance with midday and late afternoon dosing. Children feel stigmatized or embarrassed by trips to the nurse's office for medication and may skip doses as a result. In other cases, a school nurse may not be available or policies prohibit staff from administering drugs so children may be required to self-administer drug. CONCERTAÂ® was developed to overcome these limitations. The purpose of this study is to see how effective and safe Concerta* is vs. immediate release methylphenidate in children with ADHD. Patients will take either Concerta* (18, 27, 36, or 54 mg) or Immediate Release Methylphenidate tablets (maximum 60mg/day) orally every morning for 8 weeks.</detailed_description>
