	<brief_summary>Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) is a severe demyelinating disease that selectively involves the optic nerves and the spinal cord but usually spares the brain. NMO is considered to have a B cell induced pathogenesis. Mitoxantrone (MITO, Novantrone®), a synthetic anthracenedione approved for worsening relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) and secondary progressive MS, has been shown to primarily suppress the humoral response. We conducted a prospective 2-year study to evaluate the benefit of MITO in five relapsing NMO patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Study of Mitoxantrone for the Treatment of Recurrent Neuromyelitis Optica (Devic’s Disease)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The treatment protocol consisted of monthly 12 mg/m2 MITO intravenous infusions for 6 months followed by 3 additional treatments every 3 months. Neurological assessment including the determination of the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score was performed every 3 months and during relapses. Orbital, brain and spinal cord MRI was performed at baseline, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. Visual evoked potentials and ophthalmologic evaluations were performed at baseline and annually.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Recurrent longitudinal myelitis (&gt;3 segments of spinal cord involvement by MRI) with or without recurrent ON (unilateral or bilateral) but with normal brain MRI. Patients with recurrent longitudinally extensive myelitis without optic neuritis have an underlying pathology and serology similar to NMO and it is appropriate to consider this a form of NMO10. Cerebrospinal fluid required no intrathecal IgG synthesis or oligoclonal bands. Age was required to be 1855 years Extended Disability Status Score ≤ 7.
