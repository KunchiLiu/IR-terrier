	<brief_title>Warm Contrast Media for Pain Reduction During Hystersalpingography</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Infertility occurs in about 15% of all couples. One of the common methods for evaluation of mechanical infertility is hysterosalpingography (HSG). Several reports have shown that this common procedure is associated with moderate pain, i.e. around 5 on a visual analog scale (VAS)of 1-10. It is therefore important to find modes for pain reduction for HSG. According to a report on sonohydrosonograpy, a similar technique using sonography, insertion of media warmed to body temperature into the uterus significantly reduced the pain during the procedure compared with media at room-temprature. The use of room-temperature media is the routine in our institution, as well as in many others. A comparison between the media at different temperatures has not been reported so far. We plan to perform a prospective trial in which patients referred for HSG will be randomized to the procedure using either warmed or room-temperature media. we will asses pain levels using VAS during the procedure.</detailed_description>
