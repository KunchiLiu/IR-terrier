	<brief_summary>The natural history of subfoveal CNV secondary to Pattern Dystrophy is little understood, but it seems that visual function may be preserved only in the short-term follow-up, with progressive deterioration thereafter. Photodynamic therapy with verteporfin is the most studied therapeuthic option for this kindf of lesion, but unfortunately, this approach does not appear to guarantee long-term vision stabilization, and alternative therapies should be investigated.</brief_summary>
