	<brief_summary>This randomized, multicenter, open-label, active-comparator, 2-arm, parallel-group, 6 month study with approximately 360 patients will compare the efficacy of two treatment regimens (Algorithm A versus Algorithm B) in insulin-naive patients with type 2 diabetes not optimally controlled by one or more oral antihyperglycemic medications. Patients will be assigned randomly to receive one of the following treatment groups: Algorithm A is defined as a simplified diabetes management regimen starting with a fixed dose of HIIP (also known as AIR® Inhaled Insulin)(AIR® is a registered trademark of Alkermes,Inc.), titrating 2 times per week based on 2 times per week 4 point blood glucose values for the first month and titrating 1 time per week based on once weekly 4-point blood glucose values for the remainder of the study, increasing total daily dose by a maximum of 6 U per day. Algorithm B is defined as an intensive diabetes management regimen, starting with an adjusted dose of AIR® Inhaled Insulin, titrating 2 times per week based on daily 4 point blood glucose values, with sustained monitoring of dose and blood glucose throughout the study, increasing total daily dose by a maximum of 8 U per day.</brief_summary>
