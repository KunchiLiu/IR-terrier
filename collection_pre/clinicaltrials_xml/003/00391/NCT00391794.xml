	<brief_title>Efficacy of Early Stage Alzheimer's Support Groups</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>With recent advances in diagnostic procedures and treatment options, many individuals with AD are now diagnosed early in the disease. Early diagnosis has many benefits: treatment can be started sooner, legal and financial planning can be addressed while the individual is able to participate in decision-making, and support services can be mobilized earlier. However, early diagnosis may also have negative consequences for the diagnosed individual's quality of life. Thus, diagnosis creates an obligation to help individuals and their families learn more about AD and cope with the impact of the diagnosis. Many Alzheimer's Association chapters have begun providing early stage support groups that focus on enhancing quality of life for participants and their caregivers. Anecdotal reports suggest that these groups improve quality of life of participants, but some individuals may also experience decreases in quality of life associated with stress, depression, or family conflict as a result of discussing current and future losses in the group. Thus, there is a need to systematically evaluate the benefits of these groups. This study will evaluate and compare the efficacy of a structured, 8-session Early Stage Support Group intervention (ESSG) and a half-day Education Seminar (ES). Participants with early stage memory loss and their caregivers will be randomly assigned to either ESSG or ES. Both are presented by the Alzheimer's Association Western &amp; Central Washington State Chapter.</detailed_description>
