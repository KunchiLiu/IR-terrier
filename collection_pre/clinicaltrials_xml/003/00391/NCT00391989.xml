	<brief_title>Treatment of Adult Ph+ LAL With BMS-354825</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open label phase II study of Dasatinib will enroll adult de novo Ph+ ALL patients. A minimum of 48 cases will be required to complete the study. Accrual is expected to be completed in 18 months. The study will be considered completed for patients in HCR after completion of a total of 12 weeks of treatment. After completion patients will go off study and will be treated according to the best treatment option for Ph+ ALL patients in 1st HCR. The enrollment in the post-remissional phase of the current GIMEMA LAL protocol will be suggested.</detailed_description>

Impaired cardiac function, including any one of the following: Impairment of gastrointestinal (GI) function or GI disease that may significantly alter the absorption of BMS354825 (e.g., ulcerative diseases, uncontrolled nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, malabsorption syndrome, or small bowel resection) Use of therapeutic warfarin Acute or chronic liver or renal disease considered unrelated to leukemia Other concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled medical conditions (e.g., uncontrolled diabetes, active or uncontrolled infection) that could cause unacceptable safety risks or compromise compliance with the protocol Treatment with any hematopoietic colonystimulating growth factors (e.g., GCSF, GM¬CSF) ≤1 week prior to starting study drug Patients who are currently receiving treatment with any of the medications listed in "Appendix F" and the treatment cannot be either discontinued or switched to a different medication prior to starting study drug. The medications listed in "Appendix F" have the potential to prolong the QT interval.

(Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 48 hrs prior to administration of BMS354825). Postmenopausal women must be amenorrheic for at least 12 months to be considered of nonchildbearing potential. Male and female patients must agree to employ an effective barrier method of birth control throughout the study and for up to 3 months following discontinuation of study drug Known diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (HIV testing is not mandatory) Patients with a history of another primary malignancy that is currently clinically significant or currently requires active intervention Non compliant to oral medication patients.</criteria>
