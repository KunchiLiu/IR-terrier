	<brief_title>Questionnaire Study for Gynecological Cancer Survivors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Since the early 1970s, death rates for the major gynecological tumors have significantly declined, with a reduction of 42% for endometrial, 49% for cervix, 27% for vagina and vulva, and 11% for ovarian cancer. Thus, of the approximately 82,000 new gynecologic cases each year, more women will be living and, necessarily be forced to cope with psychological or behavioral morbidity. Psychosocial data on cancer patients portray significant fear and anxiety with diagnosis and treatments and the potential for high levels of psychological and sexual morbidity. While many studies have been done investigating sexual outcomes, little data is available on basic domains of quality of life, i.e. emotional or social adjustment, occupational outcomes, or aspects of physical health that might influence quality of life for gynecologic cancer survivors. There is a need for basic descriptive research in these areas, particularly in investigations that include representative samples from differing socioeconomic and racial/ethnic groups. The goal of the proposed study is to evaluate quality of life in long-term gynecologic cancer survivors. The specific aims are to: 1. Describe quality of life (both mental health and physical functioning components), stress, and sexual functioning among survivors of gynecologic malignancies and 2. Describe differences between disease site groups (i.e. cervical, endometrial, ovarian, and vulva). It has been shown with other cancer groups that improvements in mood and coping can be achieved with brief, cost effective interventions (e.g. ten therapy hours with delivery in a group format). These are multi-modal interventions with stress reduction, disease/treatment information, cognitive behavioral coping strategies, and social support. There is suggestive evidence that disease specific interventions, such as including sexual therapies for gynecologic patients, can result in improvements as well. Research focus on these issues is aided by the availability of reliable and valid strategies to assess both quality of life (SF-36; FACT) and sexuality. Before clinical trials are undertaken, research must provide a comprehensive assessment of quality of life for gynecologic cancer survivors.</detailed_description>
