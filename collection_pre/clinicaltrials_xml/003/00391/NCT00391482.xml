	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether a six-session, small group behavioral intervention based on "peer-volunteer activism" is effective in (1) decreasing distributive sharing of syringes and other injection paraphernalia and (2) increasing utilization of HCV-related healthcare services among HCV-infected injection drug users</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of a peer-volunteer intervention to reduce high-risk transmission behaviors among hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected young adult injection drug users (IDUs), and to identify the proportion of these individuals who would be eligible and willing to undergo treatment to eradicate HCV infection. HCV is one of the most frequently occurring human viral infections, having an estimated worldwide prevalence of 3%. In many regions of the United States, between 65% and 95% of IDUs are HCV-seropositive and capable of transmitting the infection. To date, research studies targeting infected individuals to prevent secondary transmission of chronic blood-borne viral infection have generally been limited to post-test counseling and case management. In addition, recent data suggest that medical treatment of HCV infection may be most effective when offered soon after HCV seroconversion. However, the proportion of HCV-infected IDUs who meet strict national guidelines for HCV treatment is likely to be small because treatment is usually postponed while drug use continues. Determining the proportion of infected individuals who may be both eligible and willing to undergo HCV therapy is highly important for guiding national standards and objectives to achieve greater numbers of IDUs in HCV therapy. We have previously reported that fewer than 1% of HCV-infected IDUs in Baltimore are currently receiving such therapy. Early initiation of HCV treatment among young IDUs in conjunction with a reduction in HCV transmission risk behaviors may ultimately lead to a reduction in incident HCV infection at the individual and the community levels. This study is a randomized controlled trial to determine the efficacy of a "peer-volunteer activism" intervention to reduce distributive syringe and injection paraphernalia sharing behaviors among HCV positive IDUs and promote the uptake of HCV care and treatment. If proven effective, this intervention would substantially decrease the risk of HCV infection in the community. To address these aims, we plan to recruit, screen, and randomly assign 750 IDUs age 18-35 years who are HCV-seropositive but HIV-seronegative in Baltimore, New York and Seattle to a behavioral intervention (250 per site), and prospectively monitor participants behavior at 3- and 6-month follow-up visits.</detailed_description>
