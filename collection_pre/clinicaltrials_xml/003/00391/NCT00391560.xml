	<brief_title>Phase II Study of Perifosine in Patients With Refractory and Relapsed Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase II study of perifosine in patients with refractory and relapsed leukemia. After a one time loading dose of 600 mg (150 mg x 4 at least 4 hours apart) during the first cycle, perifosine will be given orally at 100 mg once a day continuously. Cycles are 28 days in length. Intra-patient dose escalation for the maintenance dose to 150 mg daily will be done in the second cycle if no non-hematological toxicities beyond grade 0-1 occurred during the first cycle are observed. Patients will be assessed for efficacy at the end of each 28 day cycle of therapy, +/- 7 days. Complete remissions, partial remissions and hematological improvements of any kind will be counted towards an objective response for all diseases. A maximum total of 37 evaluable patients will be entered in each of two diagnostic groups, which are being distinguished due to different anticipated rates of accrual. Group 1: AML, MDS, CML-BP non-lymphoid, CMML, Agnogenic Myeloid Metaplasia (AMM); Group 2: CLL, ALL, CML-BP lymphoid. A maximum total of 74 patients will be enrolled on the study.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must have relapsed/refractory leukemias for which no standard therapies are anticipated to result in a durable remission. Patients with poorrisk myelodysplasia (MDS) [i.e. refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB1 or RAEB2) by WHO classification] and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) are also candidates for this protocol. Relapsed/refractory leukemias include acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (AML) by WHO classification, acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), or chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in blast crisis. Patients with agnogenic myeloid metaplasia (AMM) are also eligible. ECOG performance status of 02 Sexually active men and women who are not surgically sterile or post menopausal must use acceptable contraceptive methods (physician will discuss acceptable methods) during the time on study and for 4 weeks following the completion of treatment. Women of childbearing potential (i.e., women who are premenopausal or not surgically sterile) must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 2 weeks prior to beginning treatment on this trial. In the absence of rapidly progressing disease, the interval from prior treatment to time of study drug administration should be at least 2 weeks for cytotoxic agents, or at least five halflives for noncytotoxic agents. Persistent chronic toxicities from prior chemotherapy must not be greater than grade 1. Patients must have the following clinical laboratory values: Serum creatinine: &lt;= 2.0 mg/dl Total bilirubin: &lt;=1.5x the upper limit of normal unless considered due to Gilbert's syndrome Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), or aspartate aminotransferase (AST): &lt;= 3x the upper limit of normal unless considered due to organ leukemic involvement Must be able and willing to give written informed consent Age equal to or greater than 18 years Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to uncontrolled infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements Active heart disease including myocardial infarction within previous 3 months, symptomatic coronary artery disease, arrhythmias not controlled by medication, or uncontrolled congestive heart failure Patients with a history of severe hyperreactive airway system (e.g. active asthma, COPD) Patients receiving any other standard or investigational treatment for their hematologic malignancy Pregnant and nursing patients are excluded because the effects of perifosine on a fetus or nursing child are unknown.</criteria>
