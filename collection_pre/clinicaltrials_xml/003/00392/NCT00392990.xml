	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab, can block cancer growth in different ways. Some block the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Others find cancer cells and help kill them or carry cancer-killing substances to them. Giving rituximab together with combination chemotherapy may kill more cancer cells. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome and rituximab together with combination chemotherapy works in treating patients with newly diagnosed Burkitt's lymphoma or Burkitt-like lymphoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Doxorubicin Hydrochloride Liposome and Rituximab With Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Burkitt's Lymphoma or Burkitt-Like Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the overall response rate (complete remission, complete remission undetermined, and partial remission) in HIV-negative or HIV-positive patients with newly diagnosed Burkitt's or Burkitt-like lymphoma treated with doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome and rituximab as part of the Magrath regimen. Secondary - Determine the complete remission rate in patients treated with this regimen. - Determine progression-free and overall survival at 2 years in patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the safety of adding rituximab to the standard Magrath regimen in these patients. - Determine the safety of using doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome in place of doxorubicin hydrochloride in these patients. - Determine correlative levels of rituximab and doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome in cerebrospinal fluid and peripheral blood. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to risk category (low risk vs high risk). Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment regimens according to stratum. - Regimen A (low-risk disease with no CNS involvement): Patients receive R-CODOX-M chemotherapy comprising rituximab IV over 2-4 hours on days 0 and 8; doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome IV over 30 minutes on day 1; vincristine IV on days 1 and 8; cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on days 1-5; and high-dose methotrexate (MTX) IV over 24 hours on day 10. Patients also receive leucovorin calcium IV beginning 36 hours after the start of MTX infusion and continuing every 6 hours until blood levels of MTX are safe. Patients also receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) once daily on days 4-8 in courses 1 and 3 and on days 6 and 7 in course 2. Beginning on day 12, daily G-CSF dosing resumes until blood counts recover. Patients receive CNS prophylaxis comprising cytarabine intrathecally (IT) on day 1 and MTX IT on day 3. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. - Regimen B (high-risk disease with or without CNS involvement): Patients receive R-CODOX-M chemotherapy with leucovorin calcium and G-CSF support as in regimen A for courses 1 and 3 and R-IVAC chemotherapy with leucovorin calcium and G-CSF support (as below) for courses 2 and 4. R-IVAC chemotherapy comprises high-dose ifosfamide IV over 3 hours and etoposide IV over 1 hour on days 1-5; cytarabine IV over 3 hours twice daily on days 2 and 3; and rituximab IV over 2-4 hours on day 0 and on day 6 or 7. Patients also receive leucovorin calcium orally every 6 hours on day 6 and G-CSF SC once daily beginning on day 6 or 7 and continuing until blood counts recover. Patients without CNS involvement receive CNS prophylaxis comprising cytarabine IT on days 1 and 3 and MTX IT on day 15 in courses 1 and 3 and MTX IT alone on day 5 in courses 2 and 4. Patients with proven CNS involvement at diagnosis receive cytarabine IT on days 1, 3, and 5 in course 1, on days 7 and 9 in course 2, and on days 1 and 3 in course 3. These patients also receive MTX IT on days 15 and 17 in course 1, on day 5 in courses 2 and 4, and on day 15 in course 3. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The first 10 patients enrolled on the study undergo cerebrospinal fluid and blood collection during courses 1 and 3 for correlative biological marker and pharmacological studies. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 30 days and then periodically for up to 3 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 25 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
