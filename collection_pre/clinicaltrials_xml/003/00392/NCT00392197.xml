Fasting blood glucose level (FBS) &lt;110mg/dL (If FBS is not available, nonfasting blood glucose level*1 &lt;140mg/dL) *1 : For cases in which blood sugar measurements include values that cannot be judged as having been obtained in the fasted state. HbA1c &lt;5.8% Fasting blood glucose is defined as glucose concentrations in plasma samples taken between 5 a.m. and 12 noon after at least eight hours of fasting (including abstinence from snacks and caloriecontaining juice, coffee, etc. ). All other blood glucose measurements of are counted random glucose. 5.

Patients who have been given aripiprazole after market launching 2. Patients who clearly experienced symptoms of polydipsia, including socalled PETbottle syndrome (hyperglycemia caused when the supply of insulin, which promotes glucose metabolism, becomes insufficient due to continuous soft drink consumption) and water intoxication, within one year prior to giving informed consent 3. Patients taking drugs that affect glucose metabolism 4. Patients who take quetiapine fumarate (Seroquel) or olanzapine (Zyprexia) within a period from 12 weeks prior to commencement of study drug administration to immediately before commencement of study drug administration 5. Patients with the following complications Abnormal adrenal function, abnormal pituitary function, abnormal thyroid function, chronic pancreatitis, chronic hepatitis, alcoholic hepatopathy, nonalcoholic fatty liver, and liver cirrhosis 6. Female patients who are known to have given birth to a macrosomatic infant exceeding 4000 g in weight 7. Patients given antipsychotics at doses equivalent to 20 mg/day or more of haloperidol (or, in the case of multidrug therapy, a combined equivalence of 20 mg/day or more of haloperidol) within a period from 12 weeks prior to commencement of study drug administration to immediately before commencement of study drug administration 8. Patients in a major state of excitation or stupor immediately before commencement of study drug administration 9. Patients who are forcibly hospitalized 10. Patients given any investigational new drugs within 12 weeks prior to commencement of study drug administration 11.
