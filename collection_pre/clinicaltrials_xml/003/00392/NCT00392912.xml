	<brief_summary>Treatment with testosterone can improve performance on tests of spatial ability in men with low testosterone levels and Alzheimer's disease. Improved performance on these tests may mean an improved ability to get around in one's environment without getting lost or injured. This could have a positive impact on both patients and those who care for them. We will investigate what areas of the brain are involved in these improvements in spatial ability. This will be done using a PET scan, which creates a 3-dimensional image of the brain that can allow us to see how the brain functions.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Testosterone Therapy in Men With Alzheimer's Disease and Low Testosterone</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Volunteers will be treated with a prescription testosterone gel applied to the shoulder or other body area each day. This treatment will continue for 6 months. Subjects will undergo a PET scan at the beginning of the study and after approximately 2 months of treatment. Subjects will undergo some cognitive testing throughout the study.</detailed_description>
