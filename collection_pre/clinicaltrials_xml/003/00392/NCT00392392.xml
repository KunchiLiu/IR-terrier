	<brief_summary>This trial combines trastuzumab and bevacizumab monoclonal antibodies, with ABI-007 and carboplatin, as neoadjuvant therapy in previously untreated locally advanced breast cancers demonstrating HER2 gene amplification. It is hoped that this novel combination will result in increased pathologic response rates that will translate into long term outcome improvements in HER2 positive patients with locally advanced breast cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Preoperative Bevacizumab and Trastuzumab With ABI-007 and Carboplatin in HER2+ Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All eligible patients will receive induction chemotherapy prior to consideration of primary surgical intervention. If surgical intervention is deemed not to be in the best interest of the patient, patient will go off study at the time of evaluation for surgery. Upon completion of chemotherapy and surgery, all ER + and/or PR + patients will be placed on Tamoxifen 20 mg/qd or an aromatase inhibitor. Induction preoperative therapy: - Bevacizumab - Trastuzumab - ABI-007 - Carboplatin Postoperative Adjuvant Therapy: - Bevacizumab - Trastuzumab</detailed_description>

Previous diagnosis of noninvasive breast cancer is OK. Must have adequate bone marrow, renal and liver function. Pregnant or lactating females not allowed. Preexisting peripheral neuropathy must be equal to or less than grade 1 Must have archived tumor tissue for tissue testing. You cannot be in this study if you any of the following: History of cardiac disease, with New York Heart Association Class II or greater with congestive heart failure Any heart attack, stroke or TIAs within the last 6 months or serious arrhythmias needing medication; no bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy. No prior investigational drug within the last 30 days No prior trastuzumab or bevacizumab therapy There are additional inclusion/exclusion criteria. The study center will determine if you meet all of the criteria. If you do not qualify for the trial, study personnel will explain the reasons.</criteria>
