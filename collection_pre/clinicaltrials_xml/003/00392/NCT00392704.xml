After 6 weeks of treatment, patients will be reevaluated and will then receive concurrent radiation therapy, chemotherapy (weekly paclitaxel),bevacizumab, and erlotinib. Induction Treatment: Paclitaxel 200mg/m2 by vein over 1-3 hours on Day 1 &amp; Day 22 Carboplatin AUC 6.0 by vein over 1 hour on Days 1 and 22 Bevacizumab 15mg/kg by vein over 60-90 minutes on Days 1 and 22 5-FU 200mg/m2 as a 24 hour continuous infusion via pump on Days 1 through 43.

Erlotinib 150mg by mouth daily during the entire course of radiation (approximately 7 weeks) Paclitaxel 50mg/m2 by vein over 1-hour weekly for 6 weeks beginning Day 1 of radiation therapy Bevacizumab 15mg/kg by vein over 30-90 minutes on Days 50 and 71 at the same time of radiation therapy</detailed_description>
