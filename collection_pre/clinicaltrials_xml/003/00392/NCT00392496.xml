	<brief_summary>This phase II trial is studying how well sunitinib works in treating patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse or mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma. Sunitinib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sunitinib in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Diffuse or Mediastinal Large B-Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the response rate in patients with relapsed or refractory, diffuse or mediastinal, large B-cell lymphoma treated with sunitinib malate. II. Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients. III. Determine the effects of this drug on peripheral blood biomarkers, circulating endothelial cells, and their precursors in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a non-randomized, open-label, multicenter study. Patients receive sunitinib malate orally once daily on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for a maximum of 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 4 weeks and then every 3 months thereafter.</detailed_description>
