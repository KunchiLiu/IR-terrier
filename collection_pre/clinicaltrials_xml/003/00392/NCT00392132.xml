	<brief_summary>The Infectious Disease Society of America has recently recommended that patients with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) be screened for kidney disease on a regular basis. Screening involves non-invasive urine and blood test and a screening program has already been initiated here in the University of Mississippi HIV clinic. This study looks at the effect of this new screening program. Our Hypothesis is that screening for kidney disease is a cost effective and important addition to the care of patients with HIV.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The Infectious Disease Society of America has recently recommended that patients with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) be screened for kidney disease on a regular basis. Screening involves non-invasive urine and blood test and a screening program has already been initiated here in the University of Mississippi HIV clinic. However nobody knows for sure whether this will help doctors take better care of patient with HIV. This study looks at the effect of this new screening program. We want to see how frequently abnormalities are seen on screening, how frequently certain kidney diseases are diagnosed, how often patients are referred to a nephrologist and how often a patient's management is changed by the screening. We will also estimate the cost-benefit ratio of the screening. We will review patient charts to determine what has happened in each case where screening was conducted. This study will not involve any additional testing. The benefit of this study will be improving our understanding of kidney disease in HIV. It will help us determine the value of screening for kidney disease and the frequency of certain kidney diseases in HIV in our clinic population.</detailed_description>
