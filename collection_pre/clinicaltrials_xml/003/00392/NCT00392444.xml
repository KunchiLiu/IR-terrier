	<brief_summary>This phase II trial is studying how well sunitinib works in treating patients with advanced malignant mesothelioma of the pleura. Sunitinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for their growth.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sunitinib in Treating Patients With Advanced Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the efficacy of sunitinib malate, in terms of response rate (complete and partial), in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma. II. Assess the toxicity, safety, and tolerability of this drug in these patients. III. Assess the duration of response or stable disease, stable disease rate, progression-free survival, and median and overall survival rates. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, nonrandomized, open-label study. Patients are stratified according to prior cytotoxic chemotherapy (yes vs no). Patients receive oral sunitinib malate once daily on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 4 weeks and then every 3 months thereafter.</detailed_description>
