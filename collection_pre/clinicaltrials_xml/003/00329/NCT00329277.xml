	<brief_summary>Standard perimetry provides information on topographical retinal sensitivity to light stimuli, however the said locus is not necessarily the preferred locus for fixation. Standard perimetry could also be used as a way for macular scotoma mapping, indirectly showing the fixation locus. Topographic acuity at the preferred retinal locus can be determined if correlation between loci with high sensitivity, eccentric fixation loci and potential visual acuity measurements are correlated. PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: Determination of visual acuity at preferred retinal locus in Low Vision patients with ARMD using eye standard automated and computerized perimetry methods.</brief_summary>
