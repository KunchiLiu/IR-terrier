	<brief_title>Study of the Influence of Vaccination in HIV Viral Load and Immunologic Responses Against HIV</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>As HIV-infected patients are considered immunocompromised, it is generally recommended that they have to receipt appropriate vaccines. However data are conflicting concerning potential harmful effects following the administration of commercial vaccines in HIV-infected patients. Transient increases (“blips”) in the viral load have been described associated with a single dose of vaccine, with the potential risk of developing resistance to HAART. On the other hand, there has been described that patients with blips can have an increase in HIV-specific immune responses, which may help to improve the viral control. Comparison: We have performed a clinical trial to evaluate the effect of a vaccination program in successfully treated HIV-infected adults on HAART compared to placebo.</detailed_description>
