	<brief_summary>This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of temsirolimus when given together with sorafenib and to see how well they work in treating patients with recurrent glioblastoma. Sorafenib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as temsirolimus, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Sorafenib and temsirolimus may also stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving sorafenib together with temsirolimus may kill more tumor cells.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sorafenib and Temsirolimus in Treating Patients With Recurrent Glioblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objective - Phase I (closed to accrual as of 01/11/2008): To establish a maximum tolerable dose of temsirolimus in combination with sorafenib in patients with recurrent glioblastoma not receiving enzyme-inducing anticonvulsants (EIACs). Phase II (closed to accrual as of 12/07/2012): To assess the efficacy of temsirolimus and sorafenib in the treatment of recurrent glioblastoma in non-EIAC patients as measured by progression-free survival status at six months (PFS6). Secondary Objectives - Phase I (closed to accrual as of 01/11/2008): I. To define the safety profile of temsirolimus and sorafenib in non-EIAC patients. II. To assess the evidence of antitumor activity. Phase II (closed to accrual as of 12/07/2012): I. To assess the safety and toxicities of temsirolimus and sorafenib in the above-noted patient populations. Outline: This is a multicenter, phase I, dose-escalation study followed by a phase II study. Phase I (Arm A): Patients receive sorafenib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28 and temsirolimus intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of temsirolimus until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Phase II: Patients are assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups. Group 1 (Arm B): Patients receive sorafenib and temsirolimus as in phase I at the MTD. (patients not undergoing surgery) Group 2 (Arm C): Patients receive sorafenib PO BID on days 1-8 (15 doses) and temsirolimus IV at the MTD on day 1. Patients undergo surgery on day 8. (patients undergoing surgery) After recovering from surgery, patients receive sorafenib and temsirolimus as in phase I at the MTD. Group 3 (Arm D): Patient receive sorafenib and temsirolimus as in phase I at the MTD. (patients who have received prior anti-vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF] therapy and are not undergoing surgery) Biopsy or resected tissue and blood are collected prior to treatment (usually at diagnosis) and analyzed for biomarkers. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 6 months for 5 years and then annually thereafter.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Central pathology review submission prior to registration to confirm eligibility. It should be initiated as soon after surgery as possible. ≤2 prior systemic chemotherapy regimens. ≥18 years of age. Histological confirmation of a grade 4 astrocytoma (glioblastoma) or gliosarcoma, at primary diagnosis or recurrence by World Health Organization (WHO) criteria. Central pathology review is mandatory prior to study entry to confirm eligibility. Evidence of tumor progression by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) or Computerized Tomography (CT) scan following Radiation Therapy (RT) or following the most recent antitumor therapy. Bidimensionally measurable or evaluable disease by MRI or CT scan. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status (PS) 0, 1, or 2. ≥12 weeks since the completion of RT. Fixed or decreasing dose of corticosteroids (or no corticosteroids) ≥1 week prior to registration. ≥1 week from minor surgery other than venous line placement and &gt;3 weeks from major surgery. ≥4 weeks from prior cytotoxic chemotherapy (≥6 weeks for nitrosoureas). ≥2 weeks from cytostatic chemotherapy such as tamoxifen, cisretinoic acid, or thalidomide. The following laboratory values obtained ≤7 days prior to registration: WBC ≥3000/mm3 ANC ≥1500/mm3 PLT ≥100,000/mm3 Hgb ≥10 gm/dL Total bilirubin ≤1.5 x ULN SGOT (AST) ≤2.5 x ULN Creatinine ≤2.0 x ULN Serum cholesterol ≤350 mg/dL Serum triglycerides ≤400 mg/dL Willingness to provide the biologic specimens as required by the protocol. (Please note that the willingness to participate pertains only to the patient and does not factor in the institution's ability to participate in any part of the translational component.) Prior intratumoral chemotherapy (e.g. Gliadel or IL13PE38QQR), stereotactic radiosurgery or interstitial brachytherapy unless there is a separate lesion on MRI which is not part of the previous treatment field or there is proof of recurrent disease based on biopsy, MRI spectroscopy, or Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scan. Prior CCI779, sorafenib, or other agents specifically targeting mTOR or raf. Patients receiving prior agents inhibiting VEGF or VEGFR (prior antiVEGF group) are eligible but: 1) must be at least four weeks from last treatment with the agent(s); and 2) must have recovered from any clinically relevant toxicities attributable to this agent(s). Evidence of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy. Note: Patients on prophylactic anticoagulation therapy (e.g., lowdose warfarin) are eligible provided their coagulation parameter levels are as follows: prothrombin time (INR; International Normalized Ratio of prothrombin time) &lt;1.1 x institutional upper limit of normal. Note: Patients on fulldose anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin) are eligible provided that both of the following criteria are met: a) the patient has an inrange INR (usually between 2 and 3) on a stable dose of oral anticoagulant or on a stable dose of low molecular weight heparin, and b) the patient has no active bleeding or pathological condition that carries a high risk of bleeding (e.g., tumor involving major vessels or known varices). INR &gt;1.5 (unless the patient is on full dose warfarin).

Hypertension with systolic blood pressure of &gt;140 mmHg or diastolic pressure &gt;90 mmHg. However, patients with wellcontrolled hypertension are eligible. Uncontrolled infection.

Other active malignancy. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements. Immunocompromised patients (other than that related to the use of corticosteroids) including patients known to be HIV positive. HIVpositive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with temsirolimus and sorafenib.
