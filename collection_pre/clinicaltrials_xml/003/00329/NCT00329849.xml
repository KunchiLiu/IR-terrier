(Exception: subjects with mild asthma were eligible for enrollment; subjects with moderate or severe asthma requiring routine use of inhaled or systemic corticosteroids were not eligible for enrollment); who had epilepsy or any progressive neurological disease; who had a history of any anaphylaxis, serious vaccine reactions, or allergy to any vaccine component; who had a known or suspected impairment/alteration of immune function, either congenital or acquired or resulting from (for example): receipt of immunosuppressive therapy within 30 days prior to enrollment (any systemic corticosteroid administered for more than 5 days, or in a daily dose &gt;1 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent during any of 30 days prior to enrollment, or cancer chemotherapy); receipt of immunostimulants; receipt of parenteral immunoglobulin preparation, blood products, and/or plasma derivatives within 90 days prior to enrollment and for the full length of the study; common childhood exanthematous diseases (varicella, mumps, measles, rubella) occurring 6 weeks prior to vaccination; who were known to have a bleeding diathesis or any condition that could be associated with a prolonged bleeding time; who had Down syndrome or other known cytogenic disorders; whose families were planning to leave the area of the study site before the end of the study period; who had any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, could interfere with the evaluation of the study objectives.</criteria>
