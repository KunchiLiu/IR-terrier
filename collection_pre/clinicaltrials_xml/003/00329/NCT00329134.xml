	<brief_summary>No pediatric formulations of quinine exist. Therefore, quinine tablets are broken into 2 or 4 parts, according to the body weight. Based on the body weight, 1/2 or 1/4 a tablet is administered to the child. At this moment, quinine sulphate pellets are developed. These pellets enable an adequate dosing according to the body weight. 56 children with malaria will be dosed every 8 hours during 7 days with 10-15mg/kg body weight.</brief_summary>
