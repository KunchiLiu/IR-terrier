	<brief_summary>Cutaneous allodynia (pronounced q-tane-ee-us all-o-din-ee-a) is common in migraine. It is a heightened skin sensitivity during an active migraine attack. Migraine attacks in patients who experience allodynia are more difficult to treat. This study intends to collect and evaluate data on the phenomenon of allodynia in patients with episodic migraine during an actual attack. The results of this study may help clinicians better understand allodynia, thereby helping them diagnose and more effectively manage patients with migraine and allodynia.</brief_summary>
