	<brief_summary>This is a research study examining cutaneous allodynia and cluster headaches. Cutaneous allodynia means the feeling of pain or unpleasant sensation when normally non-painful stimuli (e.g. light touch) are applied to the skin. Many studies have been performed looking at the presence of cutaneous allodynia in patients with migraines; however, few studies have examined it in cluster headache patients. There is still much to be learned about the brain and how it functions if the investigators are to understand the underlying causes of cluster headache. It is important to explore cutaneous allodynia in cluster headache as it may help guide physicians with the care of these individuals. Sixty patients will be screened for this study. Thomas Jefferson University is the only center enrolling patients in this research study.</brief_summary>
