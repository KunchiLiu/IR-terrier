	<brief_title>The Effect of Ribose on B-Type Natriuretic Peptide (BNP) Levels in Congestive Heart Failure Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), is a blood test commonly used to track the progress of congestive heart failure. CORvalen, a medical food, contains D-Ribose (ribose), a natural substance that has been shown to improve the amount of energy compounds at the cellular level. Congestive heart failure has been associated with a reduced level of high-energy compounds. One researcher has called them an "energy starvation" in congestive heart failure. This study will try to assess if increasing the amount of these energy compounds is sufficient to improve BNP levels. Approximately 120 symptomatic congestive heart failure patients will participate in this 3 month study.</detailed_description>
