	<brief_summary>The principal objective is to evaluate the analgesic effectiveness of the systemic ketamine on the control of the pain (average consumption of morphine at 48 hours) at the alcool-dependent patient, in carcinological surgery ORL. The effect coanalgesic is found for low dose of ketamine and action anti NMDA seems to have a stabilizing effect on this particular type of patient. This imbalance of the receivers, with a greater number of r-NMDA among these patients would involve it a better analgesic effectiveness and less effects dysphoric, to see an improvement on the syndrome of weaning. The secondary objectives evaluate the pain, the ground (dependence with alcohol), the first request analgesic, the tolerance and the signs psychic (syndrome of weaning...) and the satisfaction of the patient.</brief_summary>
