	<brief_summary>Compare endoscopic papillary balloon dilatation vs. endoscopic sphincterotomy for bile duct stones in: - when sphincterotomy is difficult (periampullary diverticulum, prior sphincterotomy or Billroth II anastomosis) - when there is distal CBD tapering.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Papillary Balloon Dilatation Vs.Sphincterotomy for Lithotripsy in Difficult Sphincterotomy or Distal CBD Tapering</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Endoscopic papillary balloon dilatation is an alternative to endoscopic sphincterotomy for treating bile duct stones: - easier and as effective. But... - a higher risk of pancreatitis. Conditions including periampullary diverticulum, prior EST, Billroth-II anastomosis, or distal CBD tapering pose difficulty in EST and lithotripsy with increased risk of complications. Whether EPBD or EST is superior in efficacy or safety under such circumstances is not clear.</detailed_description>
