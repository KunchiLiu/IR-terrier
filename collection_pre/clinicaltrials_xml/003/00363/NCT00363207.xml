	<brief_summary>In children, behavior management is critical to the success of pediatric dental procedures. Most of the studies on local anesthesia performed in children deal with the question how to avoid or minimize pain during injection. Due to the sensation of numbness children scratch the soft tissues and bite lips and tongue. In many cases, this may be kept in children's memory as a "painful experience" and may affect their behavior in the following visit. The purpose of this study is to evaluate children's reactions to the administration of local anesthetic injection in the mandible (mandibular block) and in the maxilla (supraperiosteal infiltration), and to assess their behavior in the following visit related to each type of injection.</brief_summary>
