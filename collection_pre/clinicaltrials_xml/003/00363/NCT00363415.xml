	<brief_summary>This study is a Phase 3, global, multi-center, open-label study of patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer. Eligible patients will be randomly assigned to receive either pemetrexed plus carboplatin or etoposide plus carboplatin. It is anticipated that pemetrexed plus carboplatin will offer similar survival benefits as compared to etoposide plus carboplatin.</brief_summary>
