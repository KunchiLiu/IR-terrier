	<brief_summary>In this ALFA-9803 trial in AML patients aged 65 years or more, we randomly compared idarubicin or daunorubicin throughout the study (first randomization) and two different post-remission strategies (second randomization): one single intensive consolidation course similar to induction versus six ambulatory cycles with one dose of idarubicin/daunorubicin (day 1) and 2x60 mg/m2/d cytarabine SC (day 1 to 5) delivered in out-patients on a monthly basis. Primary endpoint was 2-year overall survival (OS). Study hypotheses were equivalence for the idarubicin/daunorubicin comparison and a 15% difference in 2-year OS for the post-remission therapy comparison.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Randomized Study of Post-Remission Therapy in Elderly Patients With Acute Myelogenous Leukemia.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients were randomized at baseline (first R1 randomization) to receive either daunorubicin (DNR) or idarubicin (IDA) as an anthracycline for induction and post-remission therapy. This first randomization was stratified on centers and AML type (de novo versus post-MDS AML). Induction chemotherapy consisted of a 4+7 course with either DNR at a daily dosage of 45 mg/m2 or IDA at a daily dosage of 9 mg/m2 for four days (day 1 to day 4) in combination with 200 mg/m2 cytarabine per day as a continuous IV infusion for seven days (day 1 to 7). Lenograstim granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) was administered in all patients from day 9 until myeloid recovery (3 consecutive days with PMN more than 1.0 G/L) by IV infusion and at a daily dosage of 263 microg/day for a maximum of 28 days. A blood and marrow aspiration smear examination was performed at day 21. A salvage course of chemotherapy may be offered to patients with persistent leukemia (defined below), but only if they did not present acquired contra-indication to further intensive chemotherapy (baseline criteria). Salvage consisted of six 1-hour IV bolus of intermediate-dose cytarabine (500 mg/m2/12h day 1 to 3) combined to mitoxantrone (MTZ) at a daily dosage of 12 mg/m2 for two days (day 3 and 4). G-CSF administration was stopped before salvage onset and restarted from day 5 of the salvage course until myeloid recovery for a maximum of 28 days. Patients reaching complete remission (CR) after induction or induction followed by salvage were eligible for a second R2 randomization between mild versus intensive post-remission therapy, but only if they did not present acquired contra-indication to further intensive chemotherapy (baseline criteria). This second randomization was stratified on centers, AML groups (de novo versus post-MDS AML), and first randomization groups. Mild post-remission therapy was administered in out-patients and consisted of six 1+5 monthly courses with either 45 mg/m2 DNR or 9 mg/m2 IDA for one day (day 1) in combination with 60 mg/m2/12h cytarabine as a SC infusion for five days (day 1 to 5). No G-CSF support was given after these six courses. Intensive post-remission therapy required another hospitalization and was a repetition of the first 4+7 induction administered at the same doses and followed by G-CSF administration as well.</detailed_description>
