	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study will be to assess the safety and tolerability and dose-limiting toxicity of a single intravitreal injection of Sirna-027 (AGN211745) and to assess the anatomical changes in the retina, changes in CNV, and changes in visual acuity. Escalation to the next dose cohort will be completed following minimum of 2 weeks follow-up. Patients will be monitored intensively for three months, and then followed-up for safety up to 24 months post-injection.</brief_summary>
