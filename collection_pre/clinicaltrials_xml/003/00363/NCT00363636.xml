	<brief_summary>This is a Phase III, multicenter, global, clinical study of an investigational drug called galiximab in combination with an approved drug called rituximab in subjects with follicular NHL. The purpose of the study is to compare the clinical benefit of galiximab when given in combination with rituximab as compared with rituximab alone (given with placebo) in subjects with follicular NHL. Safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) of galiximab and rituximab will also be evaluated.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Key Key Aged &gt;= 18 years old at the time of informed consent. Histologically confirmed follicular Grade 13a NHL. Relapsed or progressive disease after at least 1 prior chemotherapy requiring treatment. Bidimensionally measurable disease with at least 1 lesion &gt;= 2.0 cm in a single dimension. Acceptable hematologic, hepatic, and renal function parameters. Recovered fully from any significant toxicity associated with prior surgery, radiation treatments, chemotherapy, biological therapy, autologous bone marrow or stem cell transplant, or investigational drugs. Key Follicular lymphoma Grade 3b. Rituximab refractory or refractory to antiCD20 radioimmunotherapy (no response to prior rituximab or prior rituximabcontaining regimen, or a response with a TTP of less than 6 months). Cancer radiotherapy, biological therapy, or chemotherapy within 3 weeks prior to Study Day 1 (6 weeks if nitrosourea or mitomycin C). Prior lymphoma vaccine therapy within 12 months prior to Study Day 1. Prior antibody therapy for lymphoma (including radioimmunotherapy) within 6 months prior to Study Day 1. Autologous bone marrow or stem cell transplant within 6 months prior to Study Day 1. Prior allogeneic transplant. Transfusiondependent subjects. Another primary malignancy requiring active treatment (except hormonal therapy). Serious nonmalignant disease (e.g., congestive heart failure, hydronephrosis); active uncontrolled bacterial, viral, or fungal infections; or other conditions, which would compromise protocol objectives in the opinion of the Investigator and/or the Sponsor. New York Heart Association Class III or IV cardiac disease or myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to Study Day 1.</criteria>
