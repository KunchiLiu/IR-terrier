	<brief_title>The Effect of Glyceryl Trinitate and Diamox on Cerebral Haemodynamics.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Experimental headache model open a unike opportunity to study the pathophysiological mechanisms behind headache in general and migrane in particular. Previous studies have used various techniques to study the cerebral haemodynamics as a basis for the headache pathophysiology. We wish to use a 3-Tesa MRI so study the cerebral haemodynamics after application of various pharmacological substances. The most used experimental headache model is the glyceryl trinitrate model (GTN). Where infusion of the NO donor GTN induces headache and changes in the cerebral arteries. On the other hand injection of Diamox (Acetazolamide) apparently causes increase of the cerebral blod flow with out dilation of the arteries. We wish to study the precise effect of GTN and diamox on the cerebral haemodynamics such as Cerebral blod flow (CBF) and Cerebral blod volume (CBV) via a 3-Tesla MRI.</detailed_description>
