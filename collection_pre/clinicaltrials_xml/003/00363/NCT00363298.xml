	<brief_summary>The study hypothesis is that dextro-amphetamine (d-amphetamine) will be safe and effective when used to augment treatment for Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), and that tolerance (loss of therapeutic effect) to the medication will not develop over a period of several weeks.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dextro-Amphetamine Versus Caffeine in Treatment-resistant OCD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will investigate whether dextro-amphetamine (d-amphetamine) is safe and effective compared to caffeine as an active placebo when used to augment treatment for Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), and whether tolerance (loss of therapeutic effect) to the medication will develop over a period of several weeks D-amphetamine is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in children and adolescents. Because of the effects that d-amphetamine has on the brain, Dr. Koran believes it may be helpful in treating OCD. A positive finding in this study may stimulate research aimed at improving OCD treatment and understanding of the neurochemistry involved. This research study will enroll 24 people who are taking medication for their OCD but are not receiving sufficient benefit. The research will be performed only at Stanford University.</detailed_description>
