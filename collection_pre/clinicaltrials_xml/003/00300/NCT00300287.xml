	<brief_summary>This study is not being conducted in the United States. Key long-term clinical studies have shown that people with type 2 diabetes should try to achieve overall blood glucose levels as close to normal as possible. The purpose of this study is to gather data on the long-term safety and effectiveness of vildagliptin, an unapproved drug, compared to placebo in lowering overall blood glucose levels in people with type 2 diabetes who have not been previously treated with drug therapy to lower their blood sugar and whose blood glucose levels are close to normal.</brief_summary>
