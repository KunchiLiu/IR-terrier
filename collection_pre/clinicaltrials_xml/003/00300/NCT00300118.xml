	<brief_title>Oral Budesonide vs. Oral Mesalazine in Active Crohn's Disease (CD)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Crohn's disease is often treated with glucocorticoids or mesalazine. Both drugs are indicated for active Crohn's disease. Treatment with mesalazine is indicated for the treatment of mildly to moderately active Crohn's disease. Budesonide 9 mg/day or mesalazine 4.5 g/day are better than lower doses. So far only one trial compares the efficacy and safety of budesonide and 5-ASA. The result of this trial is that budesonide is more effective in inducing remission than mesalazine. The primary objective of this trial is to confirm this result for other presentations of budesonide and mesalazine; i.e. Budenofalk® capsules (9 mg/day) and Salofalk® tablets (Eudragit-L-coated oral mesalazine; 4.5 g/day) in moderately active Crohn's disease. Mesalazine is used in this trial as a comparator.</detailed_description>
