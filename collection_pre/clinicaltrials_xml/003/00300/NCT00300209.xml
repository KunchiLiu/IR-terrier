	<brief_summary>Description: The Manhattan HIV/Hepatology Brain Bank (MHBB) was established in 1998 as a resource for the AIDS research community. The MHBB was created to act as a center for the provision of pre- and post-mortem tissues and body fluids from HIV infected persons. It has recently expanded its goals to assist in the elucidation of liver disease-induced nervous system disorders. The MHBB is dedicated to improving the understanding of HIV and Hepatitis C and thereby, improving the lives of patients living with HIV and/or Hepatitis C. Participation is voluntary and can be stopped at any time. Benefits: This is an observational study; no experimental procedures, devices or drugs are used. All enrolled patients undergo regular examinations by physicians, nurses, and neuropsychologists who specialize in the problems that HIV and HCV can cause. Taking part in this study may result in the detection of brain, muscle, or spinal cord disease for which treatments may be available. Participants may receive no direct benefit from this study. However, knowledge gained from this research may, in the future, help others who suffer from HIV/AIDS and/or liver disease. Participants agree to autopsy and organ donation upon demise by signing an Anatomical Gift Consent document.</brief_summary>
