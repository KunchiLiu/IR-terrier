	<brief_title>Priapism in Boys and Men With Sickle Cell Disease - Demographics, Characteristics and Prevalence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Priapism is a prolonged, painful erection of the penis that lasts for more than four hours and occurs without sexual stimulation. It occurs when blood in the penis becomes trapped and is unable to drain properly. If it is not treated immediately, it can lead to scarring and permanent erectile dysfunction. Many cases of priapism are the result of sickle cell disease; approximately 42% of all adults with sickle cell disease will eventually develop priapism. Current treatments include medication, ice packs, or surgery. More research is needed to better understand the demographic and clinical characteristics of priapism. The purpose of this study is to collect information and further characterize priapism by conducting interviews with men with sickle cell disease. In turn, these findings may guide future priapism clinical trials. This study will consist of two standardized questionnaires that will be administered to 1,650 men with sickle cell disease. Participants will complete an initial five-item questionnaire about priapism. If a participant indicates past experience with priapism on this initial questionnaire, he will be asked to complete a second questionnaire. This questionnaire will ask in-depth questions to further characterize the participant's episodes of priapism. If health issues such as drug use, harmful sexual behaviors, or impotence are identified upon reviewing the questionnaire, clinic staff will suggest care options and provide appropriate referrals to the participants. All participants will receive an educational brochure about priapism and compensation for completing the questionnaires.</detailed_description>
