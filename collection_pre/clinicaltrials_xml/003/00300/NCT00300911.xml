	<brief_title>Effects of Rosiglitazone on Plasma BNP Levels and Left Ventricular Dysfunction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Large scale clinical trials have reported fluid retention and increase in plasma volume (6% to 7%) with glitazone therapy, with an increased incidence of peripheral edema occuring in 2% to 5% patients. Some evidence suggests that this effect may be related to increased endothelial cell permeability induced by glitazones therapy. Others report that glitazones may interfere with renal hemodynamics. In controlled clinical trials, the frequency of new onset congestive heart failure was very low in glitazones treated patients. The incidence of congestive heart failure is higher in patients receiving combination therapy with insulin and glitazones. Only few studies compared rosiglitazone and metformin on cardiac safety. Recently a study reported a reversible increase in endothelial cell permeability to albumin in cultured pulmonary arterial cells treated with rosiglitazone. To our knowledge, there is not any clinical study published for showing the reversibility of the cardiac adverse effects if the rosiglitazone treatment is continued.</detailed_description>
