	<brief_summary>We are testing the use of telehealth technology that includes self monitoring of blood pressure, weight, blood sugar, and oxygen levels for patients with heart failure who are receiving home care. We are interested to learn if using the equipment results in improved self care and decreased incidence of rehospitalization.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Testing the Effects of Telehealth Monitoring on Rehospitalization and Self Care for Heart Failure Patients in Home Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite telehomecare's potential to enhance patients' self-care in a cost-effective manner, few studies have evaluated its efficacy. Reported studies were conducted prior to the introduction of Medicare's prospective payment system for home care and evaluated the use of telehomecare in addition to traditional home visits. None examined patients' involvement in decision-making regarding the use of such technology in meeting their health care needs. Available data suggest that telehomecare may improve self-care and enhance outcomes for elders with heart failure but major gaps in knowledge exist regarding the clinical and cost effectiveness of this technology when decisions regarding its use are negotiated with patients and when it substitutes for traditional nurse visits under the recently introduced changes in the financing of home health care. Patient and cost outcomes will include: self-care, health care resource utilization, health status, quality of life, satisfaction, access to care and cost effectiveness. Data analysis will consist of a variety of statistical tests, and estimates of treatment costs. Findings will help guide optimal use of telehomecare in promoting self-care in the growing population of chronically ill elders whose conditions are characterized by high morbidity, complex therapies and poor quality and cost outcomes. Subjects will be enrolled from the acute care setting and will be randomized to receive home care with or without telehealth monitoring. Baseline and follow-up interviews will be conducted at admission, 60, 120 and 180 days.</detailed_description>
