	<brief_title>Effect of Folic Acid Treatment in Coronary Artery Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Common vascular disease states including diabetes and atherosclerosis are associated with endothelial dysfunction, characterised by reduced bioactivity of nitric oxide (NO). Folates are thought to improve endothelial function,but the mechanism by which this effect occurs is poorly understood. We propose to study the effects of folate supplementation on endothelial function in patients with coronary artery disease.</detailed_description>
