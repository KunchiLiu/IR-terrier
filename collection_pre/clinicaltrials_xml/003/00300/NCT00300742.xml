	<brief_title>Topiramate for the Treatment of Alcohol Dependent Binge-Eating Disordered Individuals</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Research has shown an alarming coincidence of binge eaters also reporting serious alcohol abuse. Evidence has shown this population to have higher rates of psychiatric comorbidity, higher caloric intakes during meals, higher rates of tobacco use, more frequent binge episodes, and an earlier age of onset for binge eating and alcohol abuse. It is believed that topiramate may reduce binge eating and has been found helpful in reducing the cravings associated with alcohol consumption. This study is to test the feasibility of administering topiramate to individuals with alcohol dependence and binge eating disorder. This will involve determining the adequacy of the amount of assessment and scheduled visits.</detailed_description>
