	<detailed_description>The study is a prospective cohort study in which 150 newly enrolled HIV-infected participants of CitiWide Harm Reduction are followed for 18 months to assess HIV-related health outcomes. Data elements include (1)face-to-face interviews focusing on housing, HIV disease severity, utilization of health care services, utilization of non-medical services, substance use, mental health, and quality of life; (2) medical chart information focusing on CD4 count, viral load, and HIV primary care visits; and (3) outreach services. We hypothesize that involvement with CitiWide Harm Reduction will improve HIV-related health care utilization and outcomes.</detailed_description>
