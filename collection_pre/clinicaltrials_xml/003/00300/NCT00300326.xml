	<brief_summary>To determine clinical outcomes and biomechanical gait performance of patients who receive the Zimmer Legacy® LPS Flex Knee system using a computer-assisted surgical technique. This study will provide evidence as to whether there are differences between the two surgical procedures with respect to complications such as infection and dislocations, rate and level of functional recovery, blood loss, operating time, degree of radiographic correction and quality and duration of post-operative pain and stiffness.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Computer-assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) With Zimmer LPS Flex Knee System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective of this study is to determine the clinical outcomes and biomechanical gait performance of patients who receive the Zimmer Legacy® LPS Flex Knee system using a computer-assisted surgical technique. Pre and post-operative clinical and gait variables will be compared within the computer-assisted group. These same comparisons will also be made between the computer-assisted surgical group and a conventional surgical group who receive the same knee implant. This study will further provide evidence as to whether there are differences between the two surgical procedures with respect to complications such as infection and dislocations, rate and level of functional recovery, blood loss, operating time, degree of radiographic correction and quality and duration of post-operative pain and stiffness.</detailed_description>
