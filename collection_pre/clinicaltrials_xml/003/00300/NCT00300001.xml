	<brief_title>Home-Based Symptom Monitoring: Its Impact on Cancer Care Team Behaviors and Patient Outcomes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients will be randomly assigned to one of two groups. One group will be offered an Internet assisted home-based symptom reporting system Cancer Symptom Monitor (CSM) for a twelve-month study period. Patient and care team evaluations will be measured using quantitative and qualitative methods (via focus groups). The second group will receive "standard care" without home-based symptom monitoring. Both groups will be evaluated at baseline, 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, &amp; 12 months, for symptom levels and overall quality of life during the twelve-month study period.</detailed_description>
