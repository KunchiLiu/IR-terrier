	<brief_title>Left Main Coronary Artery Stenosis and Angioplasty With Taxus Stent</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Coronary artery bypass graft is the reference treatment of left main coronary artery disease. With the advancements of technology and particularly drug-eluting stents, in-stent restenosis has dramatically decreased and now it is possible to extend indications of complexes lesions such as left main coronary artery stenoses. In these particular situations,some centers performed percutaneous coronary angioplasty (PCI) with drug-eluting stents with acceptable results in terms of safety and efficacy. However, these procedures are performed at isolated sites and are not evaluated in multicenter trial.The aim of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of this PCI with Taxus-stent in a french multicenter trial and to evaluate clinical and angiographic outcome of these patients at long-term follow-up.</detailed_description>
