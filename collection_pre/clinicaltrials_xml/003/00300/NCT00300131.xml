	<detailed_description>- Prospective, open-labeled Clinical Investigation enrolling patients with visually estimated nominal vessel diameter of 3.0 mm and lesion length ≥ 8 mm receiving a single 3.0 x 12 mm BVS Everolimus Eluting CSS containing 98 microgramme per cm² of surface area. Lesion length will be expanded to≥ 14 mm in length by visual estimation when 3.0 x 18 mm stent is available. - Angiographic, Intravascular Ultrasound (IVUS), Intravascular Ultrasound- virtual histology (IVUS-VH) and Palpography follow-up will be carried out in all patients at 180 days and 2 years following the index procedure - Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) follow-up at 180 days and 2 years will be carried out in a subset of up to 10 patients in Cohorts A and B respectively who are enrolled in pre-determined clinical site(s) - Multi-slice Spiral Computed Tomography (MSCT) is an optional procedure which may be carried out at 18 months post procedure and again between 4 and 5 year follow up. - Additionally, coronary vasomotion test may be done at 2 years post procedure Single patient Cohort of 30.

	<criteria>Target lesion must be located in a native epicardial vessel with visually estimated nominal vessel diameter of 3.0 mm Target lesion must measure less/equal 8 mm in length by visual estimation for 3.0 x 12 mm, expanded to less/equal 14 mm in length by visual estimation when 3.0 x 18 mm stent is available The target lesion(s) must be in a major artery or branch with a visually estimated stenosis of &gt; 50% and &lt; 100% with a TIMI flow of greater/equal 1 NonClinical Investigation, percutaneous intervention for lesions in a nontarget vessel is allowed if done more/equal 90 days prior to or if planned to be done 6 months after the index procedure NonClinical Investigation, percutaneous intervention for lesions in the target vessel is allowed if done &gt; 6 months prior to or if planned to be done 6 months after the index procedure Located within an arterial or saphenous vein graft or distal to a diseased (defined as vessel irregularity per angiogram and &gt; 20% stenosed lesion by visual estimation) arterial or saphenous vein graft Lesion involving a bifurcation greater/equal 2 mm in diameter and ostial lesion &gt; 40% stenosed by visual estimation or side branch requiring predilatation Total occlusion (TIMI flow 0), prior to wire passing The target vessel contains visible thrombus Another clinically significant lesion is located in the same epicardial vessel (including side branch) as the target lesion Patient has received brachytherapy in any epicardial vessel (including side branches)</criteria>
