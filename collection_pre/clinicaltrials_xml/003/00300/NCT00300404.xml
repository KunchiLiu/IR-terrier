	<brief_summary>We investigate whether the add-on specific antitoxoplasmatic medication has positive effects in individuals with schizophrenia or major depression seropositive for Toxoplasma gondii (TG) infection. As TG modulates neurotransmitter metabolism affecting serotonin and dopamine we hypothesize that this chronic persistent infection might play a role for depressive and psychotic symptomatology. Therefore, on the basis of an ex juvantibus approach, specific anti TG medication might further improve psychiatric symptomatology in affected patients. This is investigated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized treatment trial.</brief_summary>
