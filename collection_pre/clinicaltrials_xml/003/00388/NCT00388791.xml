	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of Systane Free to Saline in decreasing the symptoms of dry eye after aggressive therapy. As a principal outcome measure, we are using the modified Schein dry eye symptomatology questionaire to determine whether any improvement in signs is mirrored by improvement in the Schein Score. Up to 30 dry eye subjects will be dosed six times per day for one month. The typical clinical signs will be onmitored (e.g., corneal staining) along with dyrness symptoms. The hypothesis is that an optimized drop, Systane Free, will be more effective than saline solution in improving dry eye signs and symptoms.</brief_summary>

Subjects must have best corrected visual acuity of twenty twenty five or better in each eye. History or evidence of ocular or intraocular surgery in either eye within the past six months. LASIK and other keratorefractive procedure patients may participate if the surgery was earlier than 12 months at the time of the beginning of the study. History or evidence of serious ocular trauma in either eye within the past six months. History of hypersensitivity to any component of the study medications. These include the artificial tear and the diagnostic dye sodium fluorescein.

Use of topical ocular medications during the study period. Subjects using systemic steroids, immunosuppressive agents and/or anticholinergics (e.g. cold and allergy medications, tricyclic antidepressants) for treatment of autoimmune connective tissue disease may not be enrolled in the study if they have not been on a stable dosing regimen for a minimum of 30 days prior to the Eligibility Visit. In addition, the dosing regimen must remain stable throughout the 4week treatment period. Ocular conditions such as active acute conjunctival infections or iritis. Individuals unwilling to discontinue contact lens wear for seven days prior to the study and throughout the study.
