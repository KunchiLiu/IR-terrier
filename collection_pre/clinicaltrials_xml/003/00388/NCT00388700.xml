	<brief_summary>The purpose of this clinical trial is to determine whether the combination of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) plus a DAVANAT (carbohydrate polymer) along with Avastin and Leucovorin (LV) is beneficial in treating colorectal cancer in patients unable to tolerate intensive chemotherapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A New Agent GM-CT-01 in Combination With 5-FU, Avastin and Leucovorin in Subjects With Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase II, multi-center study of DAVANAT which has been shown to increase the anti-tumor activity of 5-FU in mice. 5-FU is a chemotherapy drug commonly used to treat tumors. A Phase I study of 40 patients showed that DAVANAT in different doses plus 5-FU was well tolerated in patients with different types of solid tumors who failed standard, approved treatments.</detailed_description>
