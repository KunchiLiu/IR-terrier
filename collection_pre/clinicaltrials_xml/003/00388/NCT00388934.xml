	<brief_title>Comparison of Cypher Select and Taxus Express Coronary Stents</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Design: - Randomized open multicentre trial. Patients: - 1800 patients with coronary artery disease scheduled for percutaneous coronary intervention with stent implantation. Inclusion criteria: - Patients with coronary artery disease scheduled for percutaneous coronary intervention with stent implantation. - Signed informed consent. Exclusion criteria: - Participation in other stent studies. Randomization: - Implantation of Taxus Express og Cypher Select stents. Primary end-point: - Combined end-point of cardiac death, new revascularization (PCI or CABG) or myocardial infarction after nine months. Secondary end-points: - Total death after nine months - Cardiac death after nine months - Myocardial infarction after nine months - Index vessel myocardial infarction after nine months - Target lesion revascularization - Target vessel revascularization - Stent thrombosis after nine months End-point evaluation: - End-points will be adjudicated by an independent end-point committee</detailed_description>
