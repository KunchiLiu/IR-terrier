	<brief_summary>Duloxetine has recently been shown to be effective in reducing the pain in chronic pain patients. Duloxetine is known to exert a central mechanism, however the precise human brain structures responsible for mediating its pain-relieving properties are not known. We will use functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) to investigate the neural and functional correlates of pain.</brief_summary>
