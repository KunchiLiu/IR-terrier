	<brief_title>Emergency Ultrasound of the Gallbladder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ultrasonography of the gallbladder is currently the diagnostic modality of choice in determining cholelithiasis and cholecystitis. Historically this test has been performed in the Radiology suites where the patient was expected to fast for times of six to ten hours. Patients presenting to emergency departments (ED) have also been required to wait to have their study performed in order to have better visualization of the gallbladder. However, few studies have examined whether a fasting time matters in determining gallbladder pathology. Furthermore, with the emphasis on through-times in the ED, most EDs cannot afford holding their patients in the ED to wait for a test. Finally, with the advent of emergency bedside ultrasonography and the greater level of comfort emergency physicians (EP) have in diagnosing gallbladder pathology, it is possible to now determine an answer within minutes. We will test to see if EPs trained in the use of emergency bedside ultrasound can effectively and efficiently determine gallbladder pathology and if fasting has an impact on their ability to perform a quality ultrasound.</detailed_description>
