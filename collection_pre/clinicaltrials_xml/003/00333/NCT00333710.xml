	<brief_title>Evaluating a Telehealth Treatment for Veterans With Hepatitis C and PTSD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with comorbid diagnoses of HCV and PTSD may experience increased risk of diminished quality of life, given that PTSD is associated with poor self-care and medical non-compliance. To date, no systematic efforts to improve quality of life in this high-risk population have been documented. The main objective of this proposal is to develop and test the feasibility and efficacy of two cognitive-behavioral interventions (a telehealth intervention and a face-to-face intervention) designed to improve quality of life, self-care, motivation to engage in healthcare, and psychological distress in patients diagnosed with HCV and PTSD. A secondary objective is to evaluate the cost effectiveness of the interventions. I plan to develop the interventions, pilot test them, and deliver the refined treatments to veterans with HCV and PTSD. Participants will be 70 patients from VA Boston who meet study criteria. Assessment will occur at pre-treatment, post-treatment, and 3- and 6-month follow-up. Assessments will measure quality of life, self-care, motivation to engage in healthcare, and psychological distress. Analyses will examine study feasibility, the effects of the treatment conditions, and the cost effectiveness of the interventions. It is hypothesized that the telephone and face-to-face intervention will improve outcomes, as compared to treatment as usual, but that the participants will be more satisfied with the telephone intervention. In addition, it is predicted that the telephone condition will be cost effective as compared to the face-to-face intervention</detailed_description>
