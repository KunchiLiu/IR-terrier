	<brief_summary>The purpose of this trial is to determine if selectively removing only a small subset of T cells, called CD8+ T cells, is safe and if it can reduce the risk of graft versus host disease (GVHD) without losing the anti-cancer effects.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CD8+ T Cell Depletion for GVHD Prophylaxis After Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- The patient will be admitted to the hospital once a good donor is found for chemotherapy and stem cell transplant. The patient will remain in the hospital for 8 days and will receive two chemotherapy drugs (fludarabine and Busulfex) intravenously once each day for 4 days. - On the third day after the patient has finished chemotherapy, the donor cells should arrive at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and the lab will remove CD8 cells. Then the product will be given to the patient through a central line. If there are not enough stem cells in the donor product, then the CD8 cells will not be taken out, and the patient will get the whole product. - Just before and after the transplant, the patient will also take tacrolimus and methotrexate to help prevent GVHD. Tacrolimus is a pill that will be taken orally two times a day. Methotrexate is a chemotherapy drug that is given intravenously on days 1, 3 and 6 after the transplant. In addition to the these drugs, participants will also take antibiotics to prevent infection and Filgrastim (G-CSF, neupogen) until their white blood cell counts are better. - After the stem cell infusion, check-ups and blood tests will be performed at least once a week for 1 month. At about one month, a bone marrow biopsy to look for the donor's cells in the participants bone marrow will be performed. After the 1-month evaluation, the patient will be seen at least every 2 weeks with another bone marrow biopsy at 3-4 months after the transplant. - After the patient is past 100 days since transplant, they will be followed in the clinic and have blood work done at least once a month until 6 months post transplant. - The trial will end at 6 months after the transplant, but patients will be tracked for the rest of their life to look at long-term effects of this transplant.</detailed_description>
