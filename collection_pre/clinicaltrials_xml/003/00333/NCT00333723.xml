	<brief_summary>This study was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of AVANDIA (rosiglitazone) (8mg once daily) in African American and Hispanic patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. As microvascular and macrovascular disease are significant contributors to diabetes morbidity and mortality and previous studies suggest that the thiazolidinedione compounds could have potentially beneficial vascular effects, the effects of rosiglitazone therapy on serum parameters associated with endothelial dysfunction, vascular inflammation and impaired fibrinolysis were examined in this study. Improvement in these parameters suggests that rosiglitazone may provide an additional beneficial vascular effect, apart from its ability to improve glycemic control.</brief_summary>
