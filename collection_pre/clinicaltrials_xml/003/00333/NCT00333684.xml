	<brief_summary>Evaluate and record any changes in the Quality of Life and psychological state of the affected study group following treatment with Bio-Alcamid. Evaluate the safety and efficacy of Bio-Alcamid for restoring the natural fullness and contours of the face affected by HIV drug-induced lipoatrophy. Pre-treatment classification and post treatment recording of changes will be performed by, both, the Principal Investigator and the Treatment Specialist and independently by a 'Blinded' Co-Investigator at post treatment Week 12. Safety data for Bio-Alcamid will be collected throughout the duration of the study. Safety will be determined by the rates of procedure-related events and adverse experiences associated with the use of Bio-Alcamid.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety, Efficacy and Psychological Effects of Treating Antiretroviral Drug-Induced Facial Lipoatrophy With Bio-Alcamid</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Thirty (30) participants in the randomized portion of the study will be selected who have been classified as having moderate to severe facial lipoatrophy based on the three investigators evaluations. These patients will be divided into two groups - The Treatment Group - 15: At Day -1, the Treatment group will be established by the inclusion/exclusion criteria and consent forms will be signed. At Day 0 they will complete QOL Surveys and will receive treatment with Bio-Alcamid in the affected facial area(s). At Day 7, they will return to complete the QOL Surveys and allow the CITS to determine if a touch-up is necessary. If so, one touch-up session is permitted at week 6. The participants will again complete QOL Surveys and have efficacy assessments at week 12. The Treatment Group will continue with follow-up sessions at week 24, 48, 60 and at 96 weeks. Professional clinical photographs will be taken at each visit. The Control Group - 15: At Day -1, the Control group will be established by the inclusion/exclusion criteria and consent forms will be signed. At Day 0, they will complete QOL Surveys. They will return for visits at baseline and week 6 as well to complete QOL Surveys. At Week 12, they will complete the QOL Surveys and will receive a BA treatment. At Week 13, they will return to complete the QOL Surveys and allow the CITS to determine if a touch-up is necessary. If so, one touch-up session is permitted at week 18. If not, these participants will again complete QOL Surveys and have efficacy assessments at week 24. The Control Group will continue with follow-up sessions at week 48, 60, 96 and at 104 weeks. Professional clinical photographs will be taken at each visit.</detailed_description>
