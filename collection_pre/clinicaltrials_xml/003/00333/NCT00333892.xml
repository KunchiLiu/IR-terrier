	<brief_summary>To further investigate differences in the immunologic function of various lymphocyte subsets in HIV-infected patients who are treated early in their infection and during the chronic phase of the infection. Studies will also be done to further delineate the various antigen-specific and innate immune responses including characterization of soluble factors associated with primary HIV infection.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Leukapheresis to Obtain Lymphocytes for Studies on Antiretroviral Naive HIV-infected Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary HIV-1 infected and chronically infected individuals will be recruited and leukapheresis will be performed. This one year study requires that patients be apheresed once before initiating therapy and on two other occasions (at month 6 and month 12) after suppression of plasma viremia. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells will be isolated by sodium diatrizoate density centrifugation and subjected to immunologic and virologic studies.</detailed_description>
