	<brief_title>Predictors of Response to Cognitive Remediation in Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It has been suggested that level of cognitive function is a "rate-limiter" for the efficacy of other psychosocial treatments in schizophrenia. Cognitive remediation, which entails training and practice of successively more difficult cognitive exercises, has shown efficacy in improving cognitive function. However, the rate of improvement has not been uniform among patients receiving this intervention. Given the time- and cost-intensiveness of cognitive remediation, it is important to examine variables that will predict response to this treatment, as well as to examine the clinical significance of any improvement. The current proposal has two aims: 1) to determine which neuropsychological, demographic, and illness variables predict response to cognitive remediation training; and 2) to determine the proportion of patients whose performance returns to normal following cognitive remediation training. For the first part of the proposed study, 50 outpatients diagnosed with schizophrenia spectrum disorders will be invited to participate in an 8-week trial of cognitive remediation training. Detailed neuropsychological, demographic, symptom and illness course variables will be collected prior to training, at the conclusion of training, and 4 months from study intake. In order to answer the second question, additional data on the computerized task performance for healthy controls will be collected, and compared to patient data, in order to determine what constitutes normal-range performance</detailed_description>
