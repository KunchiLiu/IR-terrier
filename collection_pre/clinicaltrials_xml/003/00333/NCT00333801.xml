	<brief_title>The Impact of Vocational Rehabilitation on Mentally III Veterans</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objectives: to study the impact of Individual Placement and Support (IPS) supported employment (SE) compared to treatment-as-usual vocational rehabilitation program (VRP) for veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Research Design: This prospective randomized study evaluates the impact of IPS-SE compared to VRP on occupational, sobriety, psychiatric, and quality of life outcomes and health care costs for veterans with chronic PTSD who enter the Tuscaloosa VA Medical Center's (TVAMC) vocational rehabilitation program. Methodology: Occupational functioning is determined primarily by whether the veteran can obtain and maintain competitive employment, and, secondarily, by time worked and wages earned for those employed. Veterans who meet inclusion criteria will be randomized to either IPS-SE or VRP. Outcomes will be assessed over a fixed 12-month observation period (beginning at randomization and computed for the entire 12-month observation period) as percent subjects employed at least one week (employed rate), and monthly employment rates (maintained employed rate). In addition, PTSD symptoms and other health-related quality of life measures will be evaluated. This strategy uses all available data during the 1-year period.</detailed_description>
