	<brief_title>Non-Pharmacological Interventions on Sleep in Post-Acute Rehabilitation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to perform a randomized controlled trial to test whether a multicomponent, nonpharmacological intervention improves sleep/wake patterns and functional recovery among older people (N = 214) undergoing post-acute rehabilitation. The intervention will combine: 1) structured sleep assessment, 2) patient education in key elements of cognitive behavioral strategies to improve sleep, and 3) environmental interventions on factors which likely contribute to abnormal sleep/wake patterns in the post-acute rehabilitation setting. This project will be conducted in a VA post-acute rehabilitation site. Older veterans (&gt;= 60 years) who were previously community-dwelling (N = 214) will be randomized to receive the intervention, or a social contact and memory skills training program as the control condition. Data collected at baseline will include medical data and demographics, as well as subjective and objective measures of sleep, structured assessments of functional status, and medical comorbidity. Follow-up assessments will be performed in the facility while the intervention/control condition is in place, and at three months and six months after discharge from rehabilitation. The main outcome measures will include objective sleep measures (nighttime percent sleep and daytime percent sleep) and functional status collected at three and six months follow-up. Data will be analyzed for all randomized participants in an intention to treat analysis.</detailed_description>
