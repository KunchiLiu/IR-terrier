	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to investigate if enteral immunonutrition of head and neck or esophageal cancer patients, using an arginine, omega 3 fatty acid, nucleotides-enhanced diet [Impact (R), Novartis] versus a standard enteral nutrition (control, Novartis), could improve clinical outcomes (mucositis frequency, treatment tolerance), nutritional and immune status, and life quality parameters.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>INEC Study: Immuno-modulating Enteral Nutrition in Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Malnutrition is frequent in head and neck (H&amp;N) and esophageal cancers and alters immune status, anti-infectious and anti-tumoral defenses and the response to the treatment (surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy). Treatment of these 2 types of cancer is often chemoradiotherapy which frequently induces mucositis. Mucositis enhances nutritional risk and could impose a modification or an interruption of the treatment. The aim of this study is to investigate if enteral immunonutrition of head and neck or esophageal cancer patients, using an arginine, omega 3 fatty acid, nucleotides-enhanced diet [Impact(R), Novartis] versus a standard enteral nutrition (control, Novartis), could improve clinical outcomes (mucositis frequency, treatment tolerance), nutritional and immune status, and life quality parameters.</detailed_description>
