	<brief_summary>The purpose of this trial is to compare the ability of two doses of OT-551 ophthalmic solution and drug-free solution to safely and effectively prevent or delay the progression of nuclear cataracts that frequently develop as a result of vitrectomy (surgery for retina repair), thereby avoiding the need for a second surgery (cataract removal). Victrectomies involve removal of the jelly-like substance (vitreous) that is located in a cavity behind the lens.</brief_summary>
