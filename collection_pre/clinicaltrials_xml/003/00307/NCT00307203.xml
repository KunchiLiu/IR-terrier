	<brief_title>Safety and Effectiveness of Sustained Release Bupropion in Treating Individuals With Schizophrenia Who Smoke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Schizophrenia affects 1 % of the population. Among individuals with schizophrenia, between 74 and 92 % smoke cigarettes regularly. Heavy smoking represents a significant and neglected public health problem for people with schizophrenia; smoking cessation treatment is often overlooked as part of the psychiatric care for such individuals. The most effective treatment for smoking cessation described to date is sustained release (SR) bupropion. Past research suggests that SR bupropion may be especially effective in individuals with depressive symptoms, including individuals with schizophrenia. The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of SR bupropion, when combined with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), in individuals with schizophrenia. This trial will last 12 weeks. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive SR bupropion or placebo. All participants will receive weekly CBT. Participants will be followed for 3 months following completion of the 12-week treatment session.</detailed_description>
