	<brief_summary>This study explores the efficacy, safety and tolerability of tenofovir DF (TDF) 300 mg once daily monotherapy versus the combination of emtricitabine 200 mg plus tenofovir DF 300 mg (FTC/TDF) once daily in subjects currently being treated with adefovir dipivoxil (Hepsera) for chronic hepatitis B who have persistent viral replication (detectable hepatitis B virus deoxyribonucleic acid [HBV DNA]). Subjects with confirmed (within 4 weeks) plasma HBV DNA ≥ 400 copies/mL during double blind treatment at Week 24 or any time thereafter have the option of receiving 12 weeks of open-label FTC/TDF which may be continued through the end of the 168-week treatment period if there is a virologic response (HBV DNA &lt; 400 copies/mL). Alternatively, subjects with confirmed HBV DNA &lt; 400 copies/mL at or any time after Week 24 of double-blind treatment may continue blinded therapy up to Week 168 at the discretion of the investigator. If, in the investigator's opinion, it is felt that continued blinded treatment beyond 24 weeks in subjects with confirmed HBV DNA ≥ 400 copies/mL is not beneficial, the subject may discontinue the study and begin commercially available HBV therapy rather than initiate open-label FTC/TDF.</brief_summary>
