	<brief_summary>To compare lung delivery of fluticasone propionate delivered by HFA-pMDI, using a conventional polycarbonate of anti-static chamber/mask in a randomized crossover design in 1-6 year old children. Hypothesis: Anti-static chamber/mask would increase the amount of inhaled corticosteroid delivered to young children who passively inhale and cannot breath hold.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective -- to determine whether an anti-static chamber increases the one-hour steady-state fluticasone plasma concentration, which is an indirect measure of airway delivery and direct measure of systemic exposure. Twelve children 1-6 yrs with well-controlled persistent asthma were treated with HFA-FP pMDI, 2 actuations of 110 Âµg twice daily. The drug was administered by conventional polycarbonate or anti-static valved-holding chambers with masks in an unblinded, randomized, crossover manner each for at least three days. A blood sample was collected one hour after the last dose when adherence documented by electronic monitor was 100%. FP plasma concentrations were measured by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry assay. Results evaluated using regression analysis.</detailed_description>
