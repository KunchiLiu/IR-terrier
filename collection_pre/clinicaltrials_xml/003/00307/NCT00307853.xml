	<brief_summary>We hypothesize that Traumeel S is more effective than placebo in reducing 48-hour mean cumulative morphine consumption following Total Knee or Hip Arthroplasty. 224 patients, meeting all inclusion and none of exclusion criteria, will be enrolled in the trial. Patients will be randomized to receive either intraoperative injection and post operative oral Traumeel S Tablets or placebo injection (normal saline) and indistinguishable oral placebo tablets. Baseline measurements of relevant outcome measures will taken preoperatively. In the recovery room, the patient will begin to receive IV Dipyrone (Optalgin) 1000mg, for a total of 4 doses during the first 24 hours postoperatively (1000 mg every 6 hours). Once back in the ward, the patient will be connected to an IV Patient-Controlled Analgesia (PCA) device, enabling the self-administration of morphine at a set dose of 1mg every 8 minutes, should the patient require it. The PCA memory registers the time and dose, and the data will be used later to evaluate post-operative pain.</brief_summary>
