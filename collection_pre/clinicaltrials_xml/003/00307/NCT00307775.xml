	<brief_title>Vaginal Estrogen for the Treatment of Faecal Incontinence in Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Faecal incontinence affects about 5% of women, the most common cause is often cited by women as obstetric trauma. However in clinical practice many women report that their symptoms of faecal incontinence begin around the same time as menopause. A community survey examining the prevalence of faecal incontinence in menopausal women is in progress. If a correlation is found between the onset of menopause and the development of faecal incontinence, further investigation of effective treatment will be indicated. The investigators want to investigate whether vaginally administered oestradiol can alleviate or improve symptoms in women who have faecal incontinence after the menopause. This is a pilot study.</detailed_description>
