	<detailed_description>Oxidative stress has been recognized as a potential risk factor for such complications as atherosclerosis in hemodialysis patients. This study investigates whether CoQ10 administration is effective for protecting oxidative stress in hemodialysis patients. The subjects were recruited from day-time hemodialysis patients in Iwata City Hospital. 100 mg CoQ10 was administered every HD for 6 months. Several oxidative and antioxidative markers were measured in plasma at pre, 1, 3, 6 months and after washout.</detailed_description>
