	<brief_title>An Open-label Study to Evaluate Contraceptive Efficacy and Safety of the Transdermal Contraceptive System of Norelgestromine and Ethinyl Estradiol</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A multicenter, open label, descriptive study. Five hundred requiring contraception will receive the weekly transdermal contraceptive patch for 6 cycles. At the baseline and after the 1st, 3rd and 6th cycles, satisfaction with the method will be assessed. The contraceptive efficacy will be assessed by the Pearl Index and by life table analysis. To assess satisfaction with the weekly transdermal contraceptive patch, this method will be compared to the previous contraceptive method. Adhesion, cycle control, safety and efficacy are secondary outcomes. Treatment duration: 6 cycles (4 weeks each). The subject will wear a 20 cm2 contraceptive transdermal patch for one full week, apply a fresh patch for week 2, and a third patch for week 3. The fourth week will be patch-free. Each patch deliveries 150 mcg of NLGM and 20 mcg of EE per day.</detailed_description>
