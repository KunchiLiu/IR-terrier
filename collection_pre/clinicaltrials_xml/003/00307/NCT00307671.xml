	<brief_title>Treatment of Necrotizing Vasculitides for Patients Older Than 65 Years</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Systemic necrotizing vasculitides are severe diseases associated with a high mortality rate in elderly. Although corticosteroids and immunosuppressants are effective, they can induce some side-effects, especially in this latter patients. Preliminary data indicate that systemic necrotizing vasculitides (SNV) occurring in patients over 65 years have a poorer outcome than in younger patients (mortality rate of 76 % vs. 69 % at 5 years, respectively) and that 68,4 % of the elderly experience treatment side-effects. In this trial, patients will be randomly assigned to receive either low doses of corticosteroids systematically in combination with immunosuppressants (CYC then azathioprine) or usual regimen with corticosteroids combined with immunosuppressants only if factor(s) of poor prognosis is present (this latter regimen relying on previously published therapeutic guidelines).</detailed_description>
