	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate PROCRIT (Epoetin Alfa) for Maintenance Phase Treatment of Patients With Anemia Due to Chronic Kidney Disease (PROMPT)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Epoetin alfa has been widely utilized as treatment for anemia associated with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD). Epoetin alfa has been shown to increase hemoglobin (Hb) levels by an average of 1.5 g/dL to 2 g/dL in these patients over 12 weeks (Data on file Ortho Biotech Products, L.P.). This improvement in Hb levels is maintained while the patient is receiving Epoetin alfa and is associated with significant improvements in survival, exercise tolerance, and quality of life. Literature has suggested that epoetin alfa can be given less frequently and still maintain an optimal hemoglobin while also allowing patient's greater convenience. This study will further confirm that less frequent dosing of epoetin alfa is safe and effective. This is an open-label, randomized multicenter study in patients with CKD. CKD patients who are currently receiving PROCRIT therapy for at least 2 months or more and with a stable Hb (&gt;= 11g/dL) will be randomized to one of four treatment groups. A stable Hemoglobin will be defined as a value that is ± 10% for 3 consecutive laboratory values. This study is designed to demonstrate that there is no meaningful difference in hemoglobin level with more extended dosing regimens as compared to once weekly. A clinically meaningful difference is defined as a difference that is less than 10%. Patients will be randomized to one of 4 treatment groups: All will receive subcutaneous (under the skin) Epoetin alfa for a period of 16 weeks. Group 1: 10,000 units every week Group 2: 20,000 units every two weeks Group 3: 30,000 units every three weeks Group 4: 40,000 units every four weeks</detailed_description>
