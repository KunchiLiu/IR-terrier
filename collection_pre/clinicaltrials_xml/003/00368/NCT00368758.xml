	<brief_title>The Effect of Probioticson Bloating in IBS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective of this study is to establish a model for screening probiotic bacteria in the treatment of meteorism symptoms (feeling of air in the stomach) with otherwise healthy adult women. As excessive bacterial gas production in the intestine is the most likely mechanism behind meteorism, we will examine eventual changes of the production of gases (hydrogen and methane) before and after administration of Trevis®. For screening of Trevis® we will apply a combination of clinical examination and a laboratory model for the determination of gastrointestinal gas production (a new method in connection with studies on probiotics). The results will be compared with the test person’s specification of their health, both with respect to gastrointestinal function and in general through questionnaires. The background for the project will be described in the following.</detailed_description>
