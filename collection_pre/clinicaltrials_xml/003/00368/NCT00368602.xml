	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to learn more about how to heal venous leg ulcers faster and to test the safety of a drug and see what effects it has on a venous leg ulcer. You will: - be interviewed and examined - have a physical exam - have blood and urine tested - have photographs taken of the wound - apply medication to the leg ulcer as directed</detailed_description>
