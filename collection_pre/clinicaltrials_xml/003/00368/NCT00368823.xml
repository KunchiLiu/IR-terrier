	<brief_summary>Does presentation of clinical evidence for decision making at point-of-care improve prescribing patterns in ambulatory pediatrics?</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Trial of Point of Care Information in Ambulatory Pediatrics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We showed previously that an electronic prescription writer and decision support system improved pediatric prescribing behavior for otitis media in an academic clinic setting. This study assessed whether point-of-care evidence delivery could demonstrate similar effects for a wide range of other common pediatric conditions. We performed a randomized controlled trial in a teaching clinic/clinical practice site and a primary care pediatric clinic serving a rural and semi-urban patient mix. There were 36 providers at the teaching clinic/practice site, and 8 providers at the private primary pediatric clinic, and an evidence-based message system presented real time evidence to providers based on prescribing practices for acute otitis media, allergic rhinitis, sinusitis, constipation, pharyngitis, croup, urticaria, and bronchiolitis. We measured the proportion of prescriptions dispensed in accordance with evidence.</detailed_description>
