	<brief_title>Hydrocortisone Versus Hydrocortisone Plus Fludrocortisone for the Treatment of Adrenal Insufficiency in Severe Sepsis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sepsis is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients in the United States. As evidenced by its increasing prevalence and high mortality rates, sepsis is a complex and difficult syndrome to treat. Current therapeutic management of sepsis includes fluid resuscitation, vasopressor and inotropic support, maintenance of oxygen delivery, drotrecogin alpha, and steroid replacement therapy in patients who are found to have adrenal insufficiency. Studies in septic patients suggest that the administration of stress doses of hydrocortisone alone, or the combination of hydrocortisone plus fludrocortisone promotes an improvement in cardiovascular performance and a quicker resolution of shock symptoms. Current therapeutic guidelines for the treatment of severe sepsis recommend either hydrocortisone alone or combination therapy with hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone as therapeutic options for the treatment of adrenal dysfunction in severe sepsis. This study will help determine which regimen is more efficacious in this patient population.</detailed_description>
