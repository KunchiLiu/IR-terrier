	<brief_summary>Revascularisation procedures such as percutaneous coronary intervention are associated with overall worse outcomes in patients with diabetes mellitus. Implantation of coronary stents is associated with higher restenosis rates compared to non-diabetic individuals. There is only limited data available on the efficacy and safety of the novel Yukon Choice drug-eluting stent system specifically in patients with diabetes mellitus. The trial will determine the efficacy and safety of the novel Yukon Choice stent system compared to the well established Taxus Liberté stent system. The primary endpoint will be "in-stent late lumen loss" at 9 months as determined by invasive angiography.</brief_summary>
