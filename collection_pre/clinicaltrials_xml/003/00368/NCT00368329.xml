	<brief_title>Phase I Dose Escalation of Stereotactic Radiosurgical Boost for Locally Advanced Esophageal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will evaluate the safety and feasibility of delivering radiation dose escalation using hypofractionated radiosurgery in locally advanced esophageal cancer. The dose escalation will be delivered using an image-guided radiosurgical boost to the tumor volume, following a neoadjuvant regimen consisting of oxaliplatin, capecitabine, and conventionally fractionated radiotherapy. In addition, we will evaluate the utility of PET-FDG before and after neoadjuvant chemoradiation in predicting the pathologic response to pre-operative treatment. We will study the effect of this regimen on pathologic complete response rates and complete resection rates at surgery among patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer and determine patterns of failure and rates of progression-free survival. Finally, we plan to characterize in an exploratory manner the correlation between molecular markers and pathologic findings following pre-operative chemoradiation.</detailed_description>
