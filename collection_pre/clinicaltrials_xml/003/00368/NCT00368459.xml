	<brief_title>Raloxifene for Women With Alzheimer's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Raloxifene , a selective estrogen receptor modulator, has attracted attention as a potential treatment for Alzheimer's disease in women, but it has not been studied in this disorder. To assess feasibility of large-scale efficacy trials and to obtain an initial estimate of treatment effect, study investigators plan to conduct a pilot, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trial of high-dose (120 mg daily) raloxifene. Eligible participants are postmenopausal women with late-onset Alzheimer's disease of mild-to-moderate severity taking a stable dose of an approved cholinesterase inhibitor. This pilot study is not designed to have power to detect significant, modest between-group differences of the magnitude provided by current FDA-approved therapies. Study participants will be randomly allocated to oral raloxifene or identical placebo over a 12 month period. Outcomes of interest will be obtained at 6 and 12 months. The prespecified primary outcome is the change in the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale, cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog), compared between groups at 12 months. Prespecified secondary outcomes include measures of global severity (Clinical Dementia Rating sum of boxes), function (Activities of Daily Living), behavior (Neuropsychiatric inventory), and other neuropsychological measures. Caregiver outcomes will be burden (Zarit burden inventory) and distress (from the Neuropsychiatric inventory).</detailed_description>
