	<brief_title>Validation of a Score of Predictive Factors for Complete Resection in Platinum-sensitive Recurrent Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The multicentre retrospective study AGO-DESKTOP OVAR 1 investigated in a multicentre-setting the question of prognostic factors for a successful (i.e. complete) debulking for recurrence. That way, a hypothesis for a score with 3 factors could be developed: - PS ECOG = 0 - tumor-free after primary surgery (if unknown: FIGO I/II) - Ascites &lt; 500 ml. The goal of this study is to evaluate in a prospective multicentre setting, to what extent this retrospectively defined AGO-score has predictive validity. The criterion aimed at is therefore the rate of complete tumor resections if the three score characteristics are present in invasive epithelial platinum-sensitive ovarian-, fallopian tube- or primary peritoneal cancer. This study will be the second in a series of three: (1) hypothesis building for a potential predictive score for resectability, (2) prospective confirmation of the AGO-score, and (3) application of the AGO-score as inclusion criteria for eligible patients in whom a formal comparison of the role of secondary debulking of relapsed ovarian cancer could be performed.</detailed_description>
	<mesh_term>Ovarian Neoplasms</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Patients with recurrence of invasive epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer of any initial stage who have relapsed after a tumorfree interval of at least 6 months after completion of firstline therapy. The same interval applies to patients with second relapse who are enrolled after completed platinumcontaining reinduction therapy. Women aged &gt; 18 years Patients who have given their signed and written informed consent to data transmission and processing Patients with nonepithelial tumors as well as borderline tumors Patients who undergo secondlook surgery or completion surgery after end of chemotherapy or during the interval Only for the study collective: patients with second malignancies who have been treated by laparotomy, as well as other neoplasias, if the treatment could interfere with the treatment of relapsed ovarian cancer Patients with a third recurrence Patients with socalled platinumrefractory tumor, i.e. progression during chemotherapy or recurrence within 6 months after end of former platinumcontaining therapy</criteria>
