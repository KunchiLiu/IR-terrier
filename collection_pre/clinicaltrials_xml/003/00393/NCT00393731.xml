	<brief_summary>The goal of this study is to compare the vaginal delivery rates in women undergoing induction of labor with an unripe cervix between oxytocin induction alone and preinduction cervical ripening with prostaglandin El (misoprostol). Secondary goals are to measure and compare the time intervals to delivery between the two methods.</brief_summary>
