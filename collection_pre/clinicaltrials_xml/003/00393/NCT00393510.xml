	<brief_summary>Chronic foot ulcers occurring among diabetic patients are difficult to heal. The frequent elderly age with co-morbidities, vascular insufficiencies, peripheral neuropathies and super imposed infections, all contribute towards the chronicity and failure of treatment. Preserving the ulcerated limb is the patients' wish. On the other hand, an infected ulcer that never heals just unnecessarily prolongs suffering. Nevertheless, patients earnestly like to try all methods of healing before accepting amputation. Objective:To determine whether a course of herbal preparation used as an adjuvant therapy for diabetic patients suffering from chronic foot ulcers may promote healing so that major leg amputation can be avoided.</brief_summary>
