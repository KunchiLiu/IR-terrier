	<brief_summary>The main objective is to compare the safety and efficacy of 4 artemisinin-based combinations (ACT) [amodiaquine-artesunate (AQ+AS), dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHAPQ), artemether-lumefantrine (AL) and chlorproguanil/dapsone plus artesunate] for single and repeat treatments of uncomplicated malaria in children. Safety will be determined by registering adverse events and grading, laboratory, and vital signs evaluations. Their incidence will be compared between the different study arms. TO BE NOTED: following GlaxoSmithKline decision to discontinue the clinical development of the fixed-doses combination of Lapdap (Chlorproguanil-Dapsone) and artesunate, the Lapdap plus Artesunate arm was immediately discontinued in this study, on 17th February 2008. A formal amendment has been submitted to all the concerned ECs and competent authorities. The leading EC approved the amendment on 2nd June 2008. TO BE NOTED: since the batches of the study drug DHAPQ expire at the end of October 2008, and because of the unavailability of a new batch of DHAPQ from the manufacturer, the recruitment in the DHAPQ arm had to be discontinued on 30th October 2008. A formal amendment has been submitted to all the concerned ECs and competent authorities.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Males and Females aged between 6 months and 59 months inclusive. In the sites where CDA is tested all recruited children will be aged between 12 months and 59 months inclusive (this arm was discontinued on 17th February 2008). This criterion applies only for the recruitment in the first follow up. For the second follow up, children having been included in the first follow up are eligible, regardless of their age. Body weight of 5 Kg and above. Microscopically confirmed, monoinfection of Plasmodium falciparum (parasitaemia ≥ 2,000/μL to 200,000/μL). Fever (axillary temperature at ≥ 37.5°C) or history of fever in the previous 24 hours. Haemoglobin value ≥ 7.0 g/dl; Signed (or thumbprinted whenever parents/guardians are illiterate) informed consent by the parents or guardians. Note the informed consent will be asked only at recruitment and will cover the whole period of the study, including second active follow up and passive case detection. Parents' or guardians' willingness and ability to comply with the study protocol for the duration of the trial. Participation in any other investigational drug study (antimalarial or others) during the previous 30 days. Known hypersensitivity to the study drugs. Severe malaria. Danger signs: not able to drink or breastfeed, vomiting (&gt; twice in 24hours), recent history of convulsions (&gt;1 in 24h), unconscious state, unable to sit or stand. Presence of intercurrent illness or any condition (cardiac, renal, hepatic diseases) which in the judgement of the investigator would place the subject at undue risk or interfere with the results of the study, including known G6PD deficiency. Severe malnutrition (defined as weight for height &lt;70% of the median NCHS/WHO reference). Ongoing prophylaxis with drugs having antimalarial activity such as cotrimoxazole for the prevention of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia in children born to HIV+ women.</criteria>
