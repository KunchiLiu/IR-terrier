	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to see if adding two targeted drugs (bevacizumab and erlotinib) further improves the response to chemotherapy (5-FU, paclitaxel, carboplatin) and radiation therapy in patients with operable esophageal cancer. Side effects (toxicity) information will also be collected.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Chemotherapy, Radiation Therapy and Immunotherapy Prior to Surgery in Operable Esophageal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Surgical removal has been the standard treatment for operable esophageal cancer. However, recent studies have shown improved results when patients receive a short course of chemotherapy and radiation therapy prior to surgery. Prior to surgery study treatment will be given over a 6 weeks (Days 1-42) period. Beginning Day 1 and continuing through Day 35 patients will receive a continuous infusion of 5-FU by vein. A small portable pump will be used to administer this drug into a tube that has been surgically inserted into the patient's vein. On Day 1 and 22 patients will also receive the drugs paclitaxel, carboplatin and bevacizumab by vein. Erlotinib is given by mouth beginning on Day 1 and continuing through Day 45. Patients will receive radiation therapy daily, Monday through Friday, beginning Day 1-35 (approximately 5 weeks). Surgery will be performed approximately 12-14 weeks after beginning this combined treatment.</detailed_description>
