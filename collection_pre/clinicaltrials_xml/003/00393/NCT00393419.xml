	<brief_title>Federal Study of Adherence to Medications in the Elderly (FAME)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Poor medication adherence is prevalent, difficult to manage, and diminishes the health benefits of pharmacotherapies. Elderly patients with coronary risk factors frequently require treatment with multiple medications which places them at increased risk for medication nonadherence. Effective strategies to improve adherence in the elderly are lacking, and improved health outcomes in this population have not been demonstrated. Objective: We tested the efficacy of a comprehensive pharmacy care program including patient education and an adherence aid (medications custom-packaged in blister packs) to improve medication adherence and its associated effects on blood pressure and low density lipoprotein cholesterol. This is a Multi-phase, prospective observational and randomized controlled trial. We enrolled community-based patients aged ≥ 65 years old taking ≥ 4 chronic medications per day. Intervention: After a 2-month run-in phase during which baseline medication adherence (via pill counts), blood pressure, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were measured, participants entered a 6-month intervention phase during which standardized medication education and regular follow-up by a clinical pharmacist was provided and medications were dispensed in daily, time-specific blister packs. Following the intervention phase, participants were randomized to continued pharmacy care/blister packs versus usual care (return to their original method of medication administration) for an additional 6 months. Main Outcome Measures: The primary endpoint of the observation phase was the change in the proportion of pills taken compared to baseline; secondary endpoints were the associated changes in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and blood pressure. The primary endpoint of the randomized trial was the between-group comparison of medication persistence analyzed according to intention to treat.</detailed_description>
