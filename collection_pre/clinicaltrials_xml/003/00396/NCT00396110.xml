	<brief_summary>In this study the effect of the switch to rosuvastatin from another statin (fluvastatin, pravastatin, simvastatin, atorvastatin) was evaluated in high-risk patients with and without evident CHD and LDL-C â‰¥ 3.2 mmol/l. This was done in a large observational study (TARGET) representing daily practice. Primary end points analysis was the percentage of patients reaching the target of LDL-C &lt; 3.2 mmol/l. Secondary outcomes were the changes of LDL-C, HDL-C, TC, Triglycerides (TG) and TC/HDL-C-ratio from baseline.</brief_summary>
