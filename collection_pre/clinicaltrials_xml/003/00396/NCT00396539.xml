	<brief_summary>Oral malodor is a common condition. In most cases this condition results from the proteolytic activity of anaerobic oral bacteria. These bacteria produce volatile sulfide compounds which are fowl smelling and are felt during exhalation and speech. the aim of the present study is to examine a simple method of detecting these bacteria in samples taken from the oral cavity of oral malodor patients.</brief_summary>
