	<brief_title>Wearable Robotic Functional Assistance for Stroke Rehabilitation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a case controlled study for evaluation of the effectiveness of using the myomo e100 wearable robotic rehabilitation for upper arm therapy following stroke. The intervention for the study will be for the control group- 6-8 weeks of therapeutic exercise and functional training for a total of 18 hours of intervention, or the case group- 6-8 weeks of therapeutic exercise and functional training with the use of the AJB for a total of 18 hours of intervention. Each session will be one hour in length. The length of the study and length of each session is per standard rehabilitation protocol that has been well documented in previous studies as well as the pilot study regarding the AJB. A pre and post test with a 3 month follow up of all measures will be included in the study. Study procedures will focus on performing functional tasks using the e100.</detailed_description>
