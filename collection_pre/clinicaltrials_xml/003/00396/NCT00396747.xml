	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to compare the effects of methotrexate (MTX) alone or in combination with intravenous (IV) methylprednisolone (MP) or infliximab (IFX) on MRI-detected synovitis, bone edema and erosive changes in early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Comparison of Methotrexate Alone or Combined to Infliximab or to Pulse Methylprednisolone in Early Rheumatoid Arthritis: A Magnetic Resonance Imaging Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The effects of Glucocorticoïds and Infliximab have never been compared in early RA using MRI as primary outcome measure. In the current study, we compare the effects of MTX alone or in combination with intravenous (IV) methylprednisolone (MP) pulse therapy or IFX on MRI-detected synovitis, bone edema and erosive changes in early RA patients.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients were eligible for this study if they met the American Rheumatism Association classification criteria for RA (9), had a disease duration inferior to one year, suffered from active disease (defined as the presence of a swollen joint count [SJC] ≥ 6 [by the 66 joints count] and a tender joint count [TJC] ≥ 8 [by the 68 joints count]) and had not been treated with MTX before.
