	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to examine the efficacy of Paclitaxel injection after a stent implantation in patients with stenosis in native coronary arteries to prevent restenosis in comparision with two admitted therapies.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficiency of a New Therapy to Treat Stenosis of Coronary Vessels in Comparison With Two Already Admitted Therapies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of the study is to examine whether in patients with stable or instable Angina pectoris and/or documented myocardial ischemia in the presence of de-novo stenosis in native coronary arteries with a degree of stenosis between 50 % and 99 % an additional local administration of paclitaxel after implantation of a conventional stent is superior to the implantation of a conventional stent alone with respect to late lumen loss (LLL). In case of superiority it will be examined whether an additional local administration of paclitaxel after implantation of a conventional stent is not inferior to the implantation of a paclitaxel-eluting stent with respect to late lumen-luss. Is this the case, superiority will be tested.</detailed_description>
