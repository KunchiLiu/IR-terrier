	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the association of Melphalan/Prednisone/Revlimid (MPR) as induction treatment for newly diagnosed myeloma patients over age 65 or those under 65 years who refuse or are not eligible for high dose therapy. This association might further increase the response rate achieved by the standard oral MP regimen.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Melphalan, Prednisone, and CC-5013 (Revlimid) as Induction Therapy in Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In Multiple Myeloma patients, the standard treatment is the oral combination of Melphalan and Prednisone (MP). This approach induces a partial response (PR) rate of approximately 50% and a complete remission (CR) rate of 1-5%, with a median remission duration of 18-20 months and a median overall survival of 3 years. Recently, the combination of oral MP plus thalidomide increased response rate to 80% and complete remission rate to 20%, marked cytoreduction is the first step toward a sustained remission period. CC-5013 (Revlimid) is a thalidomide analogue, 50000 times more potent than thalidomide in inhibiting TNF-alfa secretion, a potent growth factor for myeloma cells. Revlimid represents a novel class of anti-cancer drugs, it is active in patients with multiple myeloma who are refractory to conventional and high-dose chemotherapy with a response rate of approximately 30%. The association Revlimid plus dexamethasone further increases the response rate induced by Revlimid by an additional 30%. This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of the association of Melphalan/Prednisone/Revlimid (MPR) as induction treatment for newly diagnosed myeloma patients over age 65 or those under 65 years who refuse or are not eligible for high dose therapy. This association might further increase the response rate achieved by the standard oral MP regimen. In the first part of the study (phase I component), different doses of oral Melphalan (0.18-0.25 mg/Kg) associated with Prednisone (MP) will be combined with escalating doses of Revlimid (from 5 mg/day) and administered together. This phase will define the MTD of the association. In the second part of the study (phase II component), 30 patients will be treated with MPR at dose/s defined from phase I component to verify data of response and toxicity.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patient is of a legally consenting age as defined by local regulations. Age &gt; 65 years or age &lt; 65 years in patients who refuse or are not eligible for highdose therapy. Patient is, in the investigator(s) opinion willing and able to comply with the protocol requirements. Patient has given voluntary written informed consent before performance of any studyrelated procedure not part of normal medical care, with the understanding that consent may be withdrawn by the patient at any time without prejudice to their future medical care. Female patient is either postmenopausal for 24 consecutive months or surgically sterilised or agree to continuous abstinence from heterosexual sexual contact or willing to use two acceptable method of birth control at the same time (one highly effective method and one additional effective method)(Highly Effective Methods: Intrauterine device IUD; Hormonal birth control pills, injections, implants; tubal ligation; partner’s vasectomy; Additional Effective Methods: Latex condom; Diaphragm; Cervical Cap) for 4 weeks prior to beginning study drug therapy, during study drug therapy (including dose interruption) and for 4 weeks after discontinuation of Lenalomide therapy Male patient agrees to use an acceptable method for contraception (i.e., condom or abstinence) during study drug therapy (including dose interruption) and for 4 weeks after discontinuation of Lenalomide therapy. Patient was previously diagnosed with symptomatic multiple myeloma based on standard criteria, and has measurable disease, defined as follows: any quantifiable serum monoclonal protein value (generally, but not necessarily, greater than 1 g/dL of IgG MProtein and greater than 0.5 g/dL of IgA MProtein) and, where applicable, urine lightchain excretion of &gt;200 mg/24 hours; measurable plasmacytoma as determined by clinical examination or applicable radiographs (i.e. MRI, CTScan); bone marrow plasma cells &gt;10%. Patient has a Karnofsky performance status ≥ 60% Patient has a lifeexpectancy &gt; 6 months. Patient has the following laboratory values within 14 days before Baseline (day 1 of the Cycle 1): Absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1.5 x 109/L without the use of growth factors Platelet count &gt; 75 x 109/L without transfusion support within 7 days before the test. Calculated or measured creatinine clearance: ≥ 20 mL/minute Total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x the ULN AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) &lt; 2.5 x ULN Corrected serum calcium ≤ 14 mg/dL (3.5 mmol/L Any serious medical condition, laboratory abnormality, or psychiatric illness that would prevent the subject from signing the informed consent form. Pregnant or beast feeding females. Any condition, including the presence of laboratory abnormalities, which places the subject at unacceptable risk if he/she were to participate in the study or confounds the ability to interpret data from the study. Use of any other concomitant standard/experimental antimyeloma drug or therapy. Any prior use of CC5013 or other antimyeloma therapy. Any of the following laboratory abnormalities: Platelet count &lt; 75 x 109/L. Absolute neutrophil count &lt;1.5 x 109/L. Calculated or measured creatinine clearance &lt;20 mL/minute. Corrected serum calcium &gt;14 mg/dL (3.5 mmol/L). Aspartate transaminase (AST): &gt;2.5 x the upper limit of normal (ULN). Alanine transaminase (AST): &gt; 2.5 x the ULN. Total bilirubin: &gt; 1.5 x the ULN. Known positive for HIV or active infectious hepatitis, type B or C.</criteria>
