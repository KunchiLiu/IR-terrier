	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study was to compare the time between paracenteses before and after administration of Aflibercept (ziv-aflibercept, AVE0005, VEGF trap, ZALTRAPÂ®) in ovarian cancer participants with symptomatic malignant ascites. The secondary objectives were to further assess efficacy and safety of Aflibercept treatment, and the exploratory objectives were to assess pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity and health-related quality of life.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study consisted of: - A 30-day screening phase prior to Day 1 - Day 1 registration and pre-treatment paracentesis - Aflibercept administration within 1-day of registration - Two-week study treatment cycles (for efficacy data, the cut-off date was 6 months post-registration - A 60-day post-treatment follow-up phase During the study, participants were treated with Aflibercept study treatment through the duration of the study unless they met one the following criteria for discontinuation: - Participant (or legal representative) chose to withdraw from treatment - The investigator or sponsor thought that continuation of the study would be detrimental to the participants well-being - Participant had intercurrent illness that prevented further administration of investigational product (IP) - Participant had more than 2 IP dose reductions - Participant had unacceptable adverse events (AEs) - Participant had arterial thromboembolic events, including cerebrovascular accidents, myocardial infarctions, transient ischemic attacks, new onset angina, or worsening of preexisting angina - Participant required surgical intervention for intestinal obstruction or gastrointestinal perforation</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants that met the following criteria were eligible. Symptomatic malignant ascites resulting from advanced ovarian epithelial cancer (including fallopian tube and primary peritoneal adenocarcinoma) that required at least 3 previous therapeutic paracenteses at a frequency of 1 to 4 paracenteses per month for management. Platinum resistant disease defined by relapse or progression of disease during or after treatment, or drug intolerance. Topotecan and/or liposomal doxorubicinresistant disease defined by relapse or progression of disease during or after treatment, or drug intolerance. Peritoneovenous or other type of shunt that was placed for the management of ascites Prior treatment with a VEGF or VEGF receptor inhibitor Uncontrolled hypertension The above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to participation in a clinical trial.</criteria>
