	<brief_summary>This study evaluates the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of plerixafor given in addition to granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) for collection of peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs) for autologous transplantation in patients who would benefit from an autologous stem cell transplant but have failed previous collections or collection attempts with a mobilization regimen of G-CSF alone, chemotherapy and G-CSF, or any other conventional therapy including cytokines, chemotherapy and cytokines and bone marrow harvests. The only change to standard of care of a mobilization regimen that includes G-CSF is the addition of a dose of AMD3100 (plerixafor) on the evening prior to each day of apheresis. Efficacy outcomes include quantification of CD34+ cells in the apheresis product and assessment of successful polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) and platelet (PLT) engraftment after transplantation. PK outcomes include analysis of repeated doses of plerixafor.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>AMD3100 (Plerixafor) With G-CSF in Poor Mobilizing Adult Patients Who Previously Failed Hematopoietic Stem Cell (HSC) Collection/Attempts</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase 2, multicenter, prospective, open-label study. Once 70 patients have enrolled, subsequent patients enrolled should have a diagnosis of lymphoma. Patients who would benefit from an autologous stem cell transplant, who have failed previous collections or collection attempts with a mobilization regimen of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) alone, chemotherapy and G-CSF, or any other conventional therapy including cytokines, chemotherapy and cytokines and bone marrow harvests, and who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria are eligible to receive plerixafor as outlined in this protocol. The only change to standard of care of a mobilization regimen that includes G-CSF is the addition of a dose of plerixafor on the evening prior to each day of apheresis. Patients will undergo mobilization with G-CSF (10 µg/kg) for 4 days. On Day 4, plerixafor (240 µg/kg) will be administered in the evening prior to the first apheresis and each subsequent evening prior to apheresis thereafter, such that there is a 10 to 11 hour interval between dosing and the initiation of apheresis. Patients will continue to receive G-CSF on each day of apheresis. Patients will undergo a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 7 aphereses or until ≥2*10^6 CD34+ cells/kg are collected, whichever occurs first. In addition, the mobilization of NHL tumor cells and the pharmacokinetics of repeat doses of plerixafor will be examined. After the last apheresis has been completed, or after the patient has collected ≥2*10^6 CD34+ cells/kg, he/she will be treated with high-dose chemotherapy in preparation for transplantation. Patients will be transplanted with cells obtained from the G-CSF with plerixafor mobilization regimen. In the event that the minimum number of ≥2*10^6 cells for transplantation are not obtained from the first mobilization with plerixafor, cells may be retained and pooled for transplantation with those from a second mobilization with plerixafor (or from prior mobilization with other agents), at the investigator's discretion. If a second mobilization with plerixafor is attempted, a minimum rest interval of one week should be allowed between the last apheresis of the first regimen and the first dose of G-CSF of the second. The number of CD34+ cells mobilized in the peripheral blood (PB), collected in the apheresis product, and the number of apheresis sessions performed will be measured. Success of the transplantation will be evaluated by the time to engraftment of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) and platelets (PLT). Participants will be assessed for durability of their transplant for 12 months after transplantation. This study was previously posted by AnorMED, Inc.
