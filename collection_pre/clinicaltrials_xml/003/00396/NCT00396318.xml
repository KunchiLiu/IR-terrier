	<criteria>Clinically stable, in the opinion of the investigator CVC occlusion Able to have fluids infused at the volume necessary to instill study drug into the CVC Able to have 3 mL of blood (patients weighing ≥ 10 kg) or 1 mL of blood (patients weighing &lt; 10 kg) withdrawn from the selected CVC following patient repositioning Selected study CVC inserted &lt; 2 days prior to treatment Selected study CVC implanted specifically for hemodialysis (HD) or internally coated with any therapeutic agent Use of a power injector on the selected study CVC during study drug treatment Evidence of mechanical, nonthrombotic occlusion of the selected study CVC (e.g., kink in the catheter or suture constricting the catheter) Previously treated in this study or any tenecteplase catheter clearance trial Use of any investigational drug or therapy within 28 days prior to treatment Use of a fibrinolytic agent (e.g., alteplase, tenecteplase, reteplase, or urokinase) within 24 hours prior to treatment Known to be pregnant or breastfeeding at screening Known bacteremia or known or suspected infection in the CVC catheter Known history of intracranial hemorrhage (within the previous 3 years), intracranial aneurysm, or arteriovenous malformation Use of heparin (unfractionated or low molecular weight) or any other anticoagulants within 24 hours prior to treatment, except heparin used for prophylaxis or intermittent or lowdose, continuous infusion of heparin to maintain catheter or vessel patency Subjects treated with warfarin only: international normalized ratio (INR) ≥ 3.0 within 7 days prior to Visit 1, or a target INR range that allows for an INR ≥ 3.0 Initiation of or increase in dose of Plavix® (clopidogrel bisulfate) within 7 days prior to treatment At high risk for bleeding events or embolic complications (i.e., recent pulmonary embolus, deep vein thrombosis, endarterectomy, or clinically significant righttoleft shunt) in the opinion of the investigator, or with known condition for which bleeding constitutes a significant hazard Known hypersensitivity to tenecteplase or any component of the formulation</criteria>
