	<brief_summary>Contemporary management of cyanotic congenital heart disease includes three stages of surgery. Incidence of shunt thrombosis and death between the two first stages of palliation remains important. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of Clopidogrel 0.2 mg/kg/day for the reduction of all cause mortality and shunt related morbidity in neonates or infants with cyanotic congenital heart disease palliated with a systemic-to-pulmonary artery shunt (e.g. modified Blalock Taussig Shunt [BTS]). The secondary objective was to assess the safety of Clopidogrel in the study population.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In this event-driven study, participants were to be randomized and treated as soon as possible after shunt placement. They were then to be treated and followed until the primary endpoint criteria was reached i.e. (shunt thrombosis, the next surgical procedure for correction of the congenital heart disease or death) or one year of age or the common study-end-date, which ever came first. The common study-en-date was defined as the date when it was projected that 172 participants would have reached the primary endpoint criteria.</detailed_description>
