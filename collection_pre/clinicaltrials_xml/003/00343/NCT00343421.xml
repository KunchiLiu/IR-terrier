	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate safety and immunogenicity of Pediacel® in infants and toddlers when given at 2,3,4 and 12-18 months of age. Primary Objectives: - To compare the post-dose 3 immunogenicity of Pediacel® to Infanrix®-IPV+Hib when both are co-administered with Prevenar®. - To describe the post-dose 3 pertussis antibody responses. Secondary Objectives: - To compare the post-dose 4 immunogenicity of Pediacel® to Infanrix®-IPV+Hib when both are co-administered with Prevenar®. - To describe the safety after each vaccination following co-administration with Prevenar®.</brief_summary>

Presence of fever (defined as rectal body temperature ≥ 38.0°C) reported within the last 72 hours Moderate or severe acute illness with or without fever Participation in another clinical trial in the 30 days preceding first study vaccination Planned participation in another clinical trial during the present study period Received diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, poliomyelitis, Haemophilus influenzae type b or a pneumococcal vaccine separately or in combination prior to study vaccination Received any vaccination in the 30 days preceding the first study vaccination and/or is planning any vaccination within 6 weeks following any of the study vaccinations Congenital or acquired humoral/cellular immunodeficiency or immunosuppressive therapy such as longterm systemic corticosteroids therapy (≥ 2 mg/kg/day prednisone equivalent for ≥ 14 days) in the previous 30 days Systemic or local hypersensitivity to any of the study vaccine components (including neomycin, streptomycin, polymyxin B and formaldehyde) History of lifethreatening reaction(s) (such as encephalopathy, HypotonicHyporesponsive Episode, rectal body temperature ≥ 40.0°C, convulsions with or without fever) to any vaccine containing the same components as the study vaccines Blood or bloodderived products (immunoglobulins) received since birth Known Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) seropositivity Known thrombocytopenia or other bleeding disorder contraindicating intramuscular vaccination History of encephalopathy, seizures or progressive, evolving or unstable neurological condition Clinically significant findings on review of systems that might interfere with study vaccination or which, in the opinion of the Investigator, would interfere with the evaluation of the study vaccine/objectives or pose a health risk to the subject.</criteria>
