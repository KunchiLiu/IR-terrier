	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to support the registration of the pentavalent DTaP-HB-PRP~T vaccine in countries that follow the World Health Organization-Expanded Program of Immunization (WHO-EPI) schedule. The primary objective is: - To demonstrate that the pentavalent DTaP-HB-PRP~T combined vaccine does not induce a lower immune response than Tritanrix-HepB/Hib™ in terms of the seroprotection rate to hepatitis B (HB) one month after a 3-dose primary series at 6, 10, and 14 weeks of age. The secondary objectives are: - To describe in each group the immunogenicity parameters one month after the 3-dose primary series at 6, 10, and 14 weeks of age; and - To evaluate the overall safety in terms of any adverse events in the first 28 days after each injection and any serious adverse events during the entire trial.</brief_summary>
