	<brief_title>APF530 or Aloxi (Palonosetron Hydrochloride) Combined With Dexamethasone in Preventing Nausea and Vomiting in Patients Receiving Chemotherapy for Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Compare the overall activity and effects of APF530 versus palonosetron hydrochloride in combination with dexamethasone for prophylaxis of acute- or delayed-onset, chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in patients undergoing moderately or highly emetogenic chemotherapy for cancer. Secondary - Evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of APF530, in terms of prevention of acute- and delayed-onset nausea and vomiting, in these patients. - Gather the pharmacokinetics of APF530 in a subset of patients during chemotherapy course 1. - Gather ECG data (using 24-hour Holter monitoring) in a subset of patients during chemotherapy course 1. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to emetogenicity of scheduled chemotherapy (moderate-risk [level 3 or 4] vs high-risk [level 5]). Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms (I, II, and III). Patients who are randomized to receive palonosetron hydrochloride during chemotherapy course 1 (arm I) are then re-randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms (II and III) after chemotherapy course 1 to receive treatment during chemotherapy courses 2-4. Patients receive palonosetron hydrochloride or APF530 and/or placebo 30-60 minutes before the start of chemotherapy. Patients receive dexamethasone 30-90 minutes before the start of chemotherapy. - Arm I: Patients receive palonosetron hydrochloride IV, placebo subcutaneously (SC), and dexamethasone IV on day 1 of chemotherapy course 1. Patients in the high-risk (level 5) stratum also receive oral dexamethasone on days 2-4 of all treatment courses. - Arm II: Patients receive APF530 SC, placebo IV, and dexamethasone IV on day 1 of chemotherapy course 1. Patients then receive APF530 SC and dexamethasone IV on day 1 of chemotherapy courses 2-4. Patients in the high-risk (level 5) stratum also receive oral dexamethasone as in arm I. - Arm III: Patients receive APF530 SC at a higher dose, placebo IV, and dexamethasone IV on day 1 of chemotherapy course 1. Patients then receive APF530 SC (at the same higher dose) and dexamethasone IV on day 1 of chemotherapy courses 2-4. Patients in the high-risk (level 5) stratum also receive oral dexamethasone as in arm I. A subset of patients undergo blood collection periodically during study for analysis of plasma APF530 concentration. Quality of life is assessed on day 5 after completion of chemotherapy course 1. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at approximately 30 days.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically or cytologically confirmed malignant disease No head and neck cancer or upper gastrointestinal cancer Scheduled to receive a single day of moderately or highly emetogenic chemotherapy regimen (for ≤ 4 courses) Chemotherapy administration ≤ 4 hours Duration of each course ≤ 28 days Causing nausea and vomiting in 30100% of patients if untreated according to Hesketh algorithm Must be able to receive standardized doses of dexamethasone for the prevention of emesis during study treatment No greater than mild nausea or any vomiting within 24 hours before beginning study treatment PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: ECOG performance status 02 Not pregnant or nursing Negative pregnancy test Fertile patients must use effective contraception No known allergy or hypersensitivity to other selective 5HT3 receptor antagonists or local anesthetics QTc interval ≤ 500 ms No cardiac abnormality predisposing the patient to arrhythmia No psychological problem that, in the opinion of the investigator, is severe enough to preclude study participation No recent history (i.e., ≤ 1 year) of alcohol or drug abuse No concurrent condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, could affect assessment of study medication or interfere with the nausea/vomiting response (e.g., severe renal or hepatic impairment) PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: See Disease Characteristics No radiotherapy 7 days prior to, during, and 5 days after completion of study treatment More than 7 days since prior chemotherapy More than 7 days since prior and no concurrent prohibited medications (e.g., CYP3A4 inhibitors or other antiemetic medications) More than 7 days since prior antinausea medications More than 30 days since prior treatment on an investigational trial No other concurrent corticosteroids or dexamethasone at a different dose than study treatment No concurrent use of APF530, palonosetron hydrochloride, or aprepitant as rescue medications</criteria>
