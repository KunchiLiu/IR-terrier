	<brief_title>Randomized Trial Comparing 3 Routes of Delivering Lorazepam to Children.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Convulsions are common in children. Prompt treatment with an effective anticonvulsant reduces longterm morbidity and mortality. The use of intravenous lorazepam as first line therapy in acute childhood convulsions where venous access has been obtained is widely accepted in developed countries. However, intravenous access can be a problem out of hospital or in small children. Benzodiazepines such as Lorazepam have long been the mainstay of first line therapy for acute convulsions but there is insufficient clinical evidence as to the optimal mode of administration when venous access has failed. Lorazepam can be given via the intranasal and buccal route offering the potential to be as effective as intravenous lorazepam whilst being easier to administer and avoiding the need for intravenous cannulation. To date there are no large published studies that have evaluated the efficacy and safety of intranasal or buccal lorazepam compared to intravenous lorazepam in the treatment of acute convulsions. In this study we wish to address the urgent need to obtain randomized controlled data in treating acute convulsions in children using a drug and delivery system that is safe, effective and easy to use in our setting.</detailed_description>
