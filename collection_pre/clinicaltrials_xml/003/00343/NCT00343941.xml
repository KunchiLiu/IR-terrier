	<criteria>Currently on licensed triple combination therapy, which is defined as two nucleoside analogues (2 NRTI) (excluding Abacavir) and a protease inhibitor (PI) (including boosted PI regimens) or non nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI). Must be on the same treatment for at least 3 months prior to study without plans to alter therapy for the next 3 months. Plasma HIV1 RNA (ribonucleic acid)&lt; 50 copies/mL at screening with a documented history of continuous suppression defined as: the last two readings &lt; 50 copies/mL for a period of at least 3 months prior to screening. Documented CD4+ lymphocyte cell count =350 cells/ml at screening with at least one reading =350 cells/mL in the preceding 3 months and CD4 nadir &gt;200 cells/ml. HBsAg (human hepatitis B Virus surface antigen) and HCVAb (human hepatitis C Virus antibody) negative. History of hyperimmune or allergic reactions to drug treatment within 3 months prior to study.</criteria>
