	<brief_title>Pilocarpine in Treating Vaginal Dryness in Patients With Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to age (18 to 45 vs 46 to 55 vs 56 to 65 vs &gt; 65), concurrent tamoxifen therapy (yes vs no vs unknown [e.g., on a blinded clinical study]), concurrent aromatase inhibitor therapy (yes vs no vs unknown [e.g., on a blinded clinical study]), and perception of severity of vaginal symptoms at baseline (mild vs moderate vs severe). Patients are randomized to 1 of 4 treatment arms. The primary and secondary objectives of the study are described below. OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the effectiveness of pilocarpine hydrochloride for alleviation of vaginal dryness in patients with breast cancer. Secondary - Evaluate any toxicities arising from pilocarpine hydrochloride in these patients. - Evaluate quality of life of these patients treated with pilocarpine hydrochloride. Quality of life was assessed at baseline and then weekly for 6 weeks.</detailed_description>

Note: Lubricants used during sexual intercourse are permitted. 8. Current (≤ 4weeks prior to randomization), or planned during the study period, use of any estrogen product. 9. A diagnosis of asthma, COPD, CAD or narrow angle glaucoma, or known cholelithiasis. 10.
