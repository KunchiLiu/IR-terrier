	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: A diet using a soy-based meal replacement may help survivors of breast cancer lose weight and improve their quality of life. PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well a soy-based meal replacement works in helping women with stage I, stage II, or stage III breast cancer in complete remission lose weight.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Soy-Based Meal Replacement in Helping Women With Stage I, Stage II, or Stage III Breast Cancer in Complete Remission Lose Weight</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the ability to recruit survivors of estrogen receptor/progesterone receptor (ER/PR)-negative stage I-III breast cancer to participate in a 3-month, soy-based, meal-replacement (Almased®) weight loss intervention. - Assess the patient's ability to adhere to this intervention protocol. - Measure changes in anthropometrics (body weight, bioelectrical impedance, waist circumference) and biomarkers (serum levels of glucose, insulin, highly specific C-reactive protein, insulin-like growth factor, insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3, lipids). - Measure changes in health-related quality of life. OUTLINE: This is a prospective, longitudinal, pilot study. Patients undergo goal-oriented, cognitive-behavioral therapy comprising group counseling weekly for 3 weeks and individual counseling once a month. Weight loss interventions include behavioral techniques, dietary modification (using a portion-controlled diet and soy-based meal-replacement [Almased®] once or twice daily), physical activity (≥ 15 minutes per day, 6 days a week), and social support. Weight loss is monitored weekly and patients complete daily logs of dietary intake and physical activity. Therapy continues for 12 weeks. Health-related quality of life is assessed at baseline and then weekly for 12 weeks. Patients undergo blood draws at baseline and at 12 weeks for analysis of C-reactive protein, glucose, insulin, insulin-like growth factor (ILGF), and ILGF-binding protein-3. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 25 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
