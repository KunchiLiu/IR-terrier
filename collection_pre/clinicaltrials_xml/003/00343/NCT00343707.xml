	<brief_summary>This six-arm study is being conducted to measure the effect of a combination of paroxetine and vestipitant on the arousal induced by public speaking in Seasonal Effective Disorder (SAD) patients, using functional brain imaging readouts (i.e., WAT(Wave Analysis Technology) PET(Positron Emission Tomography)), after one or eight weeks of treatment. The effect of paroxetine alone after one or eight weeks of treatment will also be measured.</brief_summary>
