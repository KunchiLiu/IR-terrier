	<brief_summary>Nearly half of all Americans will die from cardiovascular disease caused by the build up of atherosclerotic plaque within coronary arteries. Most deaths in these patients arise from the development of acute coronary syndromes (ACS) such as myocardial infarction, unstable angina, or sudden death. ACS is characterized by coronary plaque erosion or rupture, which is triggered by endothelial changes, including inflammation, and thrombosis. Diabetes, with insulin resistance as a major component, has been shown to engender adverse metabolic events within the endothelial cell [1], including impaired endothelial function, augmented vasoconstriction, increased inflammation and thrombosis. Activation of the transcription factors nuclear factor KB (NF-KB) and activator protein 1 (AP-1) induces inflammatory gene expression, with liberation of leukocyte-attracting chemokines, increased production of inflammatory cytokines, and augmented expression of cellular adhesion molecules. These metabolic processes may therefore play a significant role in the development of ACS.The hypothesis is that rosiglitazone and metformin, or the combination of both may provide positive anti-atherogenic effect, even among patients without diabetes. This pilot study proposes to evaluate the effect of placebo vs. combined rosiglitazone/metformin (Avandamet®) on surrogate blood markers of atherosclerosis activity among non-diabetic and pre-diabetic patients with known stable coronary syndromes. This will provide further evidence justifying a large definitive outcomes-based clinical trial.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Rosiglitazone and Metformin: Outcomes Trial in Nondiabetic Patients With Stable Coronary Syndromes (Romance) Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a single-center, randomized, double-blind trial comparing combined rosiglitazone/metformin (Avandametä) to placebo in subjects with normal or intermediate fasting glucose (IFG) and stable coronary artery disease.Subjects meeting entry criteria will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either placebo or combined rosiglitazone/metformin (Avandametä) 4/1000 mg. Laboratory specimens including high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), glucose, HgbA1C, complete lipid profile, will be obtained after a 10 hour fast as specified by study visits. Subjects will return for repeat study visits at 2, 4, 6 and 8 months for repeat laboratory evaluations, including safety labs consisting of serum creatinine, liver enzymes, and a CBC. Additionally, subjects will have IL-6 and TNF-a measured for research purposes at baseline and subsequent follow-up visits. All subjects will be followed for a minimum of 8 months. This pilot study proposes to evaluate the effect of placebo, or combined rosiglitazone/metformin onsurrogate blood markers of atherosclerosis activity among non-diabetic and pre-diabetic patients with known stable coronary syndromes.</detailed_description>
