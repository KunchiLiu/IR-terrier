The Phase I portion was a dose-escalation study designed to assess the safety, tolerability and to identify the maximum tolerated dose of SB-743921 in patients with Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma and Hodgkin Lymphoma. Phase II was intended to assess the activity, safety and tolerability of SB-743921 in patients with Indolent and Aggressive Non-Hodgkin's Lymphomas exclusively.
