	<brief_summary>Because AVI-4020 Injection was found to cross the blood-brain barrier, and because AVI-4126 (RESTEN-NG) has potential medical benefit to people with a variety of diseases, including cancers, this study is being performed to find out if AVI-4126 also crosses the blood-brain barrier. If it does, then additional investigations could be performed, such as in people with certain types of cancer.</brief_summary>
