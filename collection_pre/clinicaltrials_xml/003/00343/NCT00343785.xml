	<brief_summary>This clinical trial is studying how well giving cyclophosphamide together with anti-thymocyte globulin followed by methotrexate and cyclosporine works in preventing chronic graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) in patients with severe aplastic anemia undergoing donor bone marrow transplant. Giving low doses of chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide, before a donor bone marrow transplant helps stop the growth of abnormal cells. It also stops the patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. The donated stem cells may replace the patient's immune system and help destroy any remaining abnormal cells. Sometimes the transplanted cells from a donor can also make an immune response against the body's normal cells. Giving anti-thymocyte globulin before and methotrexate and cyclosporine after transplant may stop this from happening</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cyclophosphamide and Anti-thymocyte Globulin Followed By Methotrexate and Cyclosporine in Preventing Chronic Graft-Versus-Host Disease in Patients With Severe Aplastic Anemia Undergoing Donor Bone Marrow Transplant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Minimize the incidence of chronic GVHD by restricting the transplanted marrow dose to 2.0-2.5 x 10^8 nucleated cells/kg. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Engraftment and overall survival. OUTLINE: CONDITIONING REGIMEN: Patients receive cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) on days -5 to -2 and anti-thymocyte globulin IV over 4-10 hours on days -4 to -2. TRANSPLANTATION: Patients undergo allogeneic bone marrow transplantation on day 0. GVHD PROPHYLAXIS: Patients receive methotrexate IV on days 1, 3, 6, and 11 and cyclosporine IV over 1 hour or orally (PO) twice daily on days -1 to 50, followed by a taper until 6 months after grafting. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at on day 180, 1 year, 1.5 years, 2 years, 3 years, and yearly thereafter.</detailed_description>
