	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research is to evaluate optical coherence tomography (OCT) and FDA approved device used to image diseases of the eye. The ultra-high resolution OCT is a non-significant risk device used in this study. Optical Coherence Tomography may be useful for early diagnosis and monitoring of different types of eye diseases.</brief_summary>
