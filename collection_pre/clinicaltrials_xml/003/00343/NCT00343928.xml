	<detailed_description>Anorexia nervosa is a serious psychiatric disorder resulting in psychosocial distress for patients and their families, potentially severe medical consequences, and substantial long-term mortality. A major emphasis in current therapeutic research in anorexia nervosa is exploration of new interventions to stabilize recovery and prevent relapse. Although the etiology of anorexia nervosa is unknown, altered regulation of the neurotransmitter serotonin in the central nervous system is thought to contribute to preoccupation with body shape and weight, dysregulated eating patterns, persistent anxiety, and frequent mood fluctuations. The goal of this exploratory project is to assess the behavioral effects of an amino acid mixture thought to influence serotonin function in individuals who have recovered from anorexia nervosa. It is hypothesized that this brief intervention will help diminish residual eating disorder symptoms. All participants in this crossover study will attend eight sessions over a 9-week period. Participants will spend approximately 2 weeks in each phase, during which they will receive an amino acid mixture and the control condition.</detailed_description>
