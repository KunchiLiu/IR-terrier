	<brief_summary>This study is being conducted in order to determine if intratumoral chemotherapy will be helpful in the palliation of endobronchial tumors when used in conjunction with endobronchial brachytherapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intratumoral Cancer Chemotherapy Through a Flexible Bronchoscope as an Adjunct to Brachytherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Injections of cisplatin are given in conjunction with the brachytherapy procedure. If the direct intratumoral injections result in a decrease in the endobronchial obstructed airways and if the therapy is well tolerated, there will be immediate clinical benefit to this minimally invasive method, the most obvious being an improved quality of life. Approximately 2 mg cisplatin per cubic centimeter of tumor are injected into each tumor through a flexible bronchoscope. A total of four to six injections are administered one week apart. Response to therapy is assessed based on improvement in intraluminal obstruction by tumor, as assessed by endobronchial observation.</detailed_description>
