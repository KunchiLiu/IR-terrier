	<brief_summary>This study involves treatment for atrial fibrillation (AF)—the most common heart condition in the US—where the upper chambers of the heart beat very fast and in a disorganized manner. This can be felt as palpitations, tiredness, shortness of breath and passing out, plus can lead to stroke, damage to the heart muscle and a shorter life span. Study participants will receive a common treatment for atrial fibrillation called radiofrequency ablation (RFA), where small lesions or "burns" are made inside the heart to cut off the abnormal impulses that cause AF. The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of three different common ablation strategies in patients with persistent or permanent AF. Subjects will be randomized (like drawing straws) to be treated with one of the three strategies to see if there is a difference in how well atrial fibrillation is controlled after treatment.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In most cases, AF originates where the pulmonary veins (PV) enter the left upper chamber of the heart, known as the left atrium (LA). Common to the procedure in each arm of the study is pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) or ablation of tissue around the pulmonary vein entrances. After PVI, the procedure continues with ablation in other areas of the LA where similar abnormal impulses are found. The three strategies for continuing with ablation after PVI are described in the "Arms" section below.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>All patients of age ≥ 30 years, undergoing their first ablation procedure that meet ACC / AHA defined criteria for persistent or permanent AF will be eligible to participate in the study. This includes patients with a history of AF episodes lasting at least 7 days or requiring at least 2 cardioversions. 1. Patients with paroxysmal AF (selfterminating episodes lasting &lt; 7 day) 2. Patients who have had a previous AF ablation procedure 3. Pregnancy 4. Failure to obtain informed consent 5. Less than 30 years old</criteria>
