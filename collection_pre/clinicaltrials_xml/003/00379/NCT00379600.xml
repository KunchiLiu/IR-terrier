	<criteria>Rheumatoid Arthritis insufficiently controlled by existing diseasemodifying antirheumatic drugs Subjects will have at least 6 swollen joints plus 2 of the following: 6 tender joints (of 28 joints); early morning stiffness lasting more than 30 minutes; ESR greater or equal to 28mm/h must be receiving a stable dose of diseasemodifying antirheumatic therapy for at least 2 months prior to participating in the study. Exclusion criteria: Women who are lactating, pregnant, or planning to become pregnant during the course of the study including 30 days following conclusion of study medication Systolic blood pressure (SBP) &gt;165 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) &gt;95 mmHg while receiving optimal antihypertensive therapy Any clinically significant abnormality identified on the screening physical exam, laboratory tests, or ECG, which in the judgement of the Investigator makes the subject unsuitable for inclusion in the study a history of alcohol abuse within the past 3 years or consumes &gt;3 units per day for males and &gt;2 units per day for females or has a history of cirrhosis or stigmata of chronic liver disease a history of liver disease or has alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels &gt;2.5 times upper limit of normal and total bilirubin levels greater than 1.5 times the upper limit of normal (unless associated with predominantly indirect bilirubin or Gilbert's syndrome) at screening using glucocorticoid at doses &gt;10 mg/day currently or within the last 3 months or may be expected to do so during the course of the study The subject's dose of NSAIDs, COX2 inhibitors or glucocorticoids has changed at any time during the past 2 weeks prior to screening or may be expected to change during the course of the study The subject's dose or treatment with a statin has changed at any time during the past 3 months prior to screening or may be expected to change during the course of the study a history of renal disease or has serum creatinine = 132mol/L for males and =130mol for females has diabetes mellitus that requires medication or hyperglycaemia with a HbA1c of &gt;7% History of new cardiovascular event within the last 6 months (i.e., intervention, percutaneous coronary intervention, vascular surgery, acute coronary syndrome [non Qwave myocardial infarction, Qwave myocardial infarction, unstable angina) or significant arrhythmia; or major intervention (e.g., cardiac surgery or angiography plus stenting) scheduled Concurrent or past medical history of congestive heart failure or pulmonary oedema A presence of severe peripheral oedema or a medically serious fluidrelated event has significant cardiac, pulmonary, metabolic, renal, hepatic, gastrointestinal or immunological conditions that, in the opinion of the Investigator and/or GSK medical monitor, places the subject at an unacceptable risk as a participant in this trial a history of malignancy in the last 5 years, except for surgically cured basal cell carcinoma (&gt;2 years prior to first dosing) a history of HIV, or chronic hepatitis B or positive C serology a history of drug abuse has participated in a clinical trial within the 3 months before the start of the study for nonbiological therapy; or within 6 months of a biological therapy on a biological therapy or has received biological therapy within 6 months prior to screening has donated blood in excess of 500 mL within 56 days prior to dosing The subject is at risk of noncompliance in following directions or adhering to study restrictions a history of drug or other allergy, which, in the opinion of the physician responsible, contraindicates their participation has anaemia defined by haemoglobin concentration &lt;11 g/dL for males or &lt;10 g/dL for females</criteria>
