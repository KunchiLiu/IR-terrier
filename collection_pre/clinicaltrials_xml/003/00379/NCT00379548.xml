	<brief_summary>We hypothesize that Asian Americans compared to Caucasians, will be at higher risk of developing a pro-inflammatory state that may contribute to the development of heart disease and diabetes when they change from a traditional Asian diet to a typical Western diet. These inflammatory responses will be reflected by the activation of monocytes as measured by protein kinase C (PKC), a known activator of monocytes. We also hypothesize that the changes of these inflammatory responses in the gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) will reflect similar changes of these markers in the plasma and monocytes. Specific aims: 1. To compare the inflammatory responses (primarily PKC activation in monocytes), between Far-East Asian Americans and Caucasian Americans, when they change from a traditional Asian diet to a typical American diet. 2. To correlate the biochemical changes of inflammatory responses in the plasma and monocytes with those in the gingival crevicular fluid (GCF).</brief_summary>
