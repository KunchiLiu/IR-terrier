	<brief_title>Study of Improving Insulin Sensitivity by Electroacupuncture Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Some previous animal model studies reveal that electroacupuncture (EA) applying on specific acupoints, such as Zhongwan and Zusanli acupoint, can reduce plasma glucose levels and encourage insulin secretion, even improve insulin resistance. In this study, we want to observe these results on type II diabetic patients who have been diagnosed in five years under a study design of randomized control trial (RCT) to obtain evidence on clinical. We undertook a randomized, single blind and sham group controlled study to evaluate the effect of EA with a frequency in 15 Hz and fixed intensity (10 mA) on human Zusanli acupoint. A total of 26 newly diagnostic type II diabetic patients are enrolled in this study. They are randomly divided into 2 groups. There are 13 patients in the experimental group (EG) with EA treatment, and the other 13 patients are divided into control group (CG) with sham treatment. The main outcome is the changes of laboratory parameters between before and 30 minutes after the test.</detailed_description>
