	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether cinacalcet + low dose vitamin D attenuates the progression of vascular calcification over one year, compared with a treatment regimen that includes flexible vitamin D dosing in the absence of cinacalcet, in subjects with chronic kidney disease receiving hemodialysis</brief_summary>
