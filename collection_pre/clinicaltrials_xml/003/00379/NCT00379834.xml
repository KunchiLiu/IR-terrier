	<brief_title>12-Month Stability of Diurnal IOP Control on Cosopt</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Glaucoma is a potentially-blinding but treatable eye disease. A major risk factor for glaucoma is elevated intraocular pressure (IOP). IOP is a dynamic variable (like blood pressure)â€”it changes over time. The more it changes, the more likely patients are to get worse. Glaucoma is treated by lowering IOP. Cosopt is a medication that lowers IOP. Little is known about how well Cosopt reduces IOP fluctuations. In this study, we plan to measure the IOP in both eyes of 10 glaucoma patients treated with Cosopt, every 2 hours from 8am to 8pm, on five separate days over a one-year period. Untreated baseline IOP will be measured on a similar long day before beginning treatment with Cosopt. This methodology will allow us to compare IOP fluctuations with and without Cosopt, and also to learn about long-term control of IOP fluctuations in eyes treated with Cosopt.</detailed_description>
