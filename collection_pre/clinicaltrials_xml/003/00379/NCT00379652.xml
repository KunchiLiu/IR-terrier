	<brief_summary>Hypertension and diabetes are among the most common chronic diseases in the United States. Racial and ethnic minority groups are more at risk for these diseases than the Caucasian population. This study will attempt to identify factors that contribute to racial and ethnic differences in hypertension and diabetes care among minority patients of community health centers (CHCs). This information will be used to design and implement programs to improve quality of care in these communities.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Community Partnership to Examine Racial and Ethnic Differences in Health Care for Hypertension and Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypertension and diabetes are the primary contributors to today's high rates of heart disease and stroke, which are the first and third leading causes of death in the United States, respectively. African Americans and Hispanics have a higher risk of developing hypertension and diabetes than do Caucasians. They are also less likely to know that they have high blood pressure, are more prone to organ damage, and are more likely to die as a result of these chronic conditions. A significant number of African Americans and Hispanics are uninsured and receive care through publicly supported CHCs. It is important to identify factors that contribute to healthcare differences among the lower income, uninsured, and minority populations that are typically served by CHCs. In this study, a collaborative partnership will be developed between CHCs, health service research organizations, and academic researchers. The goal of the study is to examine the barriers that minority CHC patients face in receiving appropriate hypertension and diabetes care. This study will develop a collaborative partnership between various health organizations and seven CHCs located in Boston neighborhoods that have a large percentage of African American and Hispanic residents. Researchers will conduct focus groups with CHC patients who are receiving care for hypertension or diabetes. CHC staff members will be interviewed to collect information regarding the relationship between CHC organizational structure and disparities in heart disease risk factors among minority patients with hypertension or diabetes. Researchers will then develop, implement, and evaluate a patient- and CHC-focused intervention aimed at reducing the cardiovascular risks of minority patients at four CHCs in Boston.</detailed_description>
