	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as trabectedin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well trabectedin works in treating patients with advanced, persistent, or recurrent leiomyosarcoma of the uterus.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trabectedin in Treating Patients With Advanced, Persistent, or Recurrent Leiomyosarcoma of the Uterus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the antitumor activity of trabectedin, as measured by frequency and duration of objective response, in patients with advanced, persistent, or recurrent uterine leiomyosarcoma. - Determine the nature and degree of toxicity of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a nonrandomized, multicenter study. Patients receive trabectedin IV continuously over 24 hours on day 1. Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve a confirmed complete response may receive at least 2 additional courses. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 43 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically confirmed uterine leiomyosarcoma Histological confirmation of original primary tumor required Advanced, persistent, or recurrent disease Documented disease progression Measurable disease, defined as ≥ 1 unidimensionally measurable lesion ≥ 20 mm by conventional techniques, including palpation, plain xray, CT scan, and MRI OR ≥ 10 mm by spiral CT scan At least 1 target lesion Tumors within a previously irradiated field are considered nontarget lesions unless progression is documented or a biopsy is obtained to confirm persistence at least 90 days following completion of radiotherapy Ineligible for a higher priority GOG protocol (i.e., any active phase III GOG protocol for the same patient population) PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: GOG performance status 02 Not pregnant or nursing Negative pregnancy test Fertile patients must use effective contraception Platelet count ≥ 100,000/mm³ Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mm³ Hemoglobin &gt; 9.0 g/dL Creatinine ≤ 1.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN) Bilirubin normal AST ≤ 2.5 times ULN Alkaline phosphatase ≤ 1.5 times ULN CPK ≤ ULN No active infection requiring antibiotics (except for patients with uncomplicated UTI) No neuropathy (sensory or motor) &gt; grade 1 No other invasive malignancy within the past 5 years except for nonmelanoma skin cancer No known active liver disease or hepatitis Must be willing/able to have a central venous catheter PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: See Disease Characteristics Recovered from prior surgery, radiotherapy, or other therapy No prior cancer treatment that would preclude study therapy No prior cytotoxic chemotherapy or biologic therapy for uterine sarcoma No prior chemotherapy for any abdominal or pelvic tumor within the past 5 years Prior adjuvant chemotherapy for localized breast cancer is allowed provided it was completed more than 3 years ago and there is no evidence of recurrent or metastatic disease No prior trabectedin No prior radiotherapy within the past 5 years to any portion of the abdominal cavity or pelvis other than for treatment of uterine sarcoma Prior radiotherapy for localized cancer of the breast, head and neck or skin is allowed, provided that it was completed more than 3 years ago and there is no evidence of recurrent or metastatic disease At least 1 week since prior hormonal therapy for the malignancy (continuation of hormone replacement therapy is permitted) No concurrent amifostine or other protective agents</criteria>
