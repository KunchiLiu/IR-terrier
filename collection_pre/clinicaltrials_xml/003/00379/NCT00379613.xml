	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the optimal dose of sugammadex when this compound is administered during deep neuromuscular block. Sugammadex is administered shortly (5 minutes) after administration of a high dose (1.2 mg/kg) of the neuromuscular blocking agent rocuronium . Under these circumstance the neuromuscular block is deep. The safety and pharmacokinetics of sugammadex are also studied.</brief_summary>
