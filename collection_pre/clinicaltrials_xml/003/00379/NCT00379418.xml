	<brief_summary>AIR STUDY TITLE: Anti-Ischemic effects of Abciximab(Reopro) PATIENT POPULATION: Patients undergoing PCI(an interventional procedure placing a small stent/metallic tube to keep a narrowed artery in your heart open) and either on a stable statin dose or not on a statin. Statin= cholesterol lowering drug(ie, lipitor, zocor). INTERVENTION: Heparin vs. heparin + abciximab during PCI PURPOSE: Measure the effects of abciximab on special healing blood stem cells (EPC's-Endothelial Progenitor Cells), on inflammation, on oxidative stress and on microvascular blood flow. PATIENT ASSESSMENT: 1. 50ccs blood draw on day 1(from sheath), day 2 ,day 7 and day 28. 2. Measurement of blood flow in selected suitable patients 3. 10 minute questionnaire before discharge and on visit on day 28.</brief_summary>
