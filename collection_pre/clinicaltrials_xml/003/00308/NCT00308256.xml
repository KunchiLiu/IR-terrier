	<brief_summary>The incidence of type 1 diabetes is increasing in France. A recent cross sectional study has shown that in France, only 15% of children and 26% of adults had HbA1c&lt;7%. Adolescents seem to need particularly a better metabolic control. Working Hypothesis: We hypothesized that a stricter control of glycaemia by nurse-counselling could probably improve metabolic control in adolescents with type 1 diabetes. Objectives: To show that nurse-counselling may improve levels of patient satisfaction. Methodology: The main criterion is the patient acceptance of diabetes measured by an analogical visual scale rated from 0 (I cope very well with my diabetes, I cope very badly with my diabetes) to 10 cm. The scale will be measured every quarter within 12 months follow-up. We wish to improve patient's appreciation by 10 mm, near to "I cope very well with my diabetes". This is a randomised parallel group study with 36 subjects in each group. During the follow-up, the "routine follow-up" group will continue its routine care. The "complementary follow-up" group will be called by nurses every 15 days and consult monthly. HbA1c is the secondary criterion and will be measured every 3 months. The total study duration is 18 months including 6 months for the recruitment and 12 months for the patients follow-up</brief_summary>
