	<brief_summary>The purpose of the proposed work is to assess the effects of a dietary supplement, containing chromium (600 mcg per day) provided by chromium picolinate and biotin (2 mg per day) on glycemic control in type 2 diabetes. Specifically, this study will assess whether use of the supplement will lower the post-prandial rise in blood glucose experienced after ingestion of a 75g carbohydrate load, relative to placebo, in type 2 diabetic patients. The study will also assess the chronic effects of supplementation over a 4-week period (relative to placebo) on fasting plasma levels of glucose, insulin, lipids and lipoproteins.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A 30 Day Acute Efficacy and Safety Study of Chromium Picolinate + Biotin on Glycemic Control in Overweight or Obese Subjects With T2DM</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this work is to assess the effects of a dietary supplement, containing chromium (600 mcg per day) provided by chromium picolinate and biotin (2 mg per day) on glycemic control in type 2 diabetes who are currently taking an oral antidiabetic agent (OAD) and failing therapy with OADs. Subjects entering the trial must have a HbA1c &gt;/= 7.0% and have an OGTT &gt;/= 200 mg/dL at 2 hours post consumption of a 75 g glucose beverage. The study is an acute 30 day intervention in conjunction with the subject's current OADs and standard of care in comparison to placebo. Specifically, this study will assess whether use of the supplement will lower the post-prandial rise in blood glucose experienced after ingestion of a 75g carbohydrate load, relative to placebo, in type 2 diabetic patients as measured by the area under the curve for glucose (AUCg). The study will also assess the acute effects of supplementation over a 4-week period (relative to placebo) on fasting plasma levels of glucose, fructosamine, insulin, lipids and lipoproteins.</detailed_description>

Diagnosed or selfreported alcoholism or substanceabuse problems 14. Any psychiatric or mental health issue that would prevent the subject from completing the study 15. Any illness or complication factor that, in the opinion of the investigator, would jeopardize the subjectâ€™s health or well being by participating in the study or would interfere with the subject successfully completing the study. 16. Current participation in any other clinical research trial for any product or device, or participation in said clinical trials within 30 days prior to enrollment.</criteria>
