	<brief_summary>The object of this study is to measure the levels of B-type Natriuretic Peptide (BNP) in patients with congenital heart disease, normal individuals, and patients with acquired heart failure, and compare the results from each group.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study of B-Type Natrieutic Peptide (BNP) Levels in Patients With Congenital Heart Disease(BNP)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Enrollment: Patients with congenital heart disease seen at Emory Clinics, Adult Congenital Heart Disease program, Crawford Long Hospital will be asked to participate in this pilot study. Sample size: 20 patients (5 in each group) Screening Phase: Demographic data, medical history, physical examination including vital signs and room air oxygen saturation, and medications will be recorded. New York Heart association functional class will be recorded. BNP Levels: Approximately 7 cc of blood will be collected. The blood will be analyzed for B-type natriuretic peptide on a rapid assay in the clinic. Exercise Tolerance: will be measured by a 6 minute walk test on day of visit Echocardiogram: A complete echocardiogram including assessment of anatomy, ventricular function and valvular function will be performed following the phlebotomy. Quality of life: The minnesota living with heart failure questionnaire will be administered on the day of collection of neurohormonal levels. A research nurse will be available to assist the patient if needed.</detailed_description>
