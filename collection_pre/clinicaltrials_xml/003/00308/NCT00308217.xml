	<brief_title>Single Ventricle Outcome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Congenital disease is the most common cause for infant death from a birth defect. Approximately 30,000 infants are born each year with congenital heart defects.Over one-third of those babies will require cardiac surgery. A particularly lethal cardiac defect is one with single ventricle physiology. The objective of this research proposal is to perform an ongoing single institution prospective clinical trial examining the overall clinical outcome of children with single ventricle physiology.</detailed_description>
