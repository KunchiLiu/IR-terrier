	<brief_title>Treating Late-Life Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) in Primary Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) is one of the most common anxiety disorders among older adults. Anxiety in older adults is associated with decreased physical activity, poorer self-perceptions of health, decreased life satisfaction, and increased loneliness. Because many older adults with anxiety seek assistance in a medical setting, treatment has been primarily pharmacological. There is, however, limited evidence of the effectiveness of psychotropic medications. Given the potential difficulties in prescribing psychotropic medications in later life (e.g., increased adverse effects, potential drug interactions), psychosocial treatments may be important alternative or adjuncts. The treatment phase of this study lasts 10 weeks, during which patients will be randomly assigned to either cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) or usual care. Follow-up will last 12 months after treatment completion, during which time patients will complete telephone assessments.</detailed_description>
