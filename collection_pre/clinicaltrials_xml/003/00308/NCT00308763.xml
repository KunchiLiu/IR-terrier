	<brief_summary>Nicotine addiction is a serious health problem in the United States; 46 million people smoke cigarettes, and 70% of those are trying to quit. The nicotine patch and bupropion, a medication used to reduce nicotine cravings, are two commonly used smoking cessation aids. Both have been shown to reduce smoking rates, however, the effectiveness of combining the two treatments has not been widely examined. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of the nicotine patch combined with bupropion at reducing smoking rates among younger, low-income, and minority individuals.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nicotine Patch and Bupropion to Reduce Smoking Rates in Younger, Low-Income, and Minority Individuals</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cigarette smoking poses a serious but preventable health risk. The negative health effects of smoking are well-known, but the prevalence of cigarette smoking remains high in the United States, particularly among younger people, people of lower socioeconomic status, and minority groups. Nicotine replacement therapy, commonly known as the nicotine patch, has been proven to be an effective treatment for reducing nicotine use. The nicotine patch provides a measured dose of nicotine through the skin. By gradually lowering nicotine doses over a period of time, individuals experience fewer nicotine cravings; the ultimate goal is to stop using nicotine. Bupropion, a medication commonly used to treat depression, is also used as a smoking cessation tool. It helps to control nicotine cravings. The majority of studies on the nicotine patch and bupropion have been performed on older, white, middle-class individuals; more research is needed to confirm the benefit of these treatments in younger, low-income, and minority populations. While both the nicotine patch and bupropion appear to be individually effective as smoking cessation aids, little is known on the possible effectiveness of combining the two treatments. Because of the high relapse rates in low-income and minority individuals, the combination of the nicotine patch with bupropion may be particularly effective at reducing relapse rates in these individuals. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the nicotine patch and bupropion at reducing smoking rates in younger, low-income, and minority individuals. This 1-year study will enroll younger, low-income, and minority individuals who smoke. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the following three groups: 1) nicotine patch plus placebo sustained-release bupropion; 2) placebo nicotine patch plus sustained-release bupropion; or 3) nicotine patch plus sustained-release bupropion. At study entry, participants will complete standardized psychological questionnaires to assess depression levels and will undergo a physical exam and blood testing. Study visits will take place at Weeks 5 and 11, Month 6, and Year 1. At each visit, questionnaires will be completed, and smoking cessation rates will be assessed by self-report and verified by saliva and exhaled carbon monoxide testing. In addition, all participants will take part in a standardized behavioral smoking cessation program.</detailed_description>
