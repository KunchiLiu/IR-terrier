	<brief_summary>It is unknown whether it is best to do the TVT( procedure for urinary stress incontinence in women) at the time of prolapse surgery or at a later date. Women with both conditions were randomized to both procedures together or the TVT 3 months after the prolapse surgery. Any or no leakage when couching was the main end-point, evaluated 1 year after the last surgery</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of the Result of TVT Performed at the Time of Prolapse Surgery or 3 Months After</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All women were evaluated by the POP-Q (pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification) prior to surgery and 1 year after. Examination for urinary leakage was done prior to surgery and 1 year after. Group 2 was also examined after prolapse surgery to see if TVT was still needed.</detailed_description>
