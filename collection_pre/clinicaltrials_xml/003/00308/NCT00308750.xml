	<brief_summary>The purposes of this study are to determine: The safety of enzastaurin plus pemetrexed with carboplatin, pemetrexed with carboplatin, or docetaxel with carboplatin and any side effects that might be associated with the combination of these drugs. Whether the combination of enzastaurin plus pemetrexed and carboplatin or pemetrexed and carboplatin can help patients with non-small cell lung cancer live longer, compared with the combination of docetaxel and carboplatin. Whether the combination of enzastaurin plus pemetrexed and carboplatin or pemetrexed and carboplatin can make your tumor smaller or disappear, and for how long, compared with the combination of docetaxel and carboplatin. The effects of enzastaurin plus pemetrexed with carboplatin, pemetrexed with carboplatin or docetaxel with carboplatin have on your disease related symptoms. The relation of smoking history and hormone replacement therapy (for women only) may have to your lung cancer treatment results. The effects of certain genes and proteins in samples of your blood and tumor tissue in order to learn more about non-small cell lung cancer and how enzastaurin works in the body.</brief_summary>
