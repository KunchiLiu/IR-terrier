	<brief_summary>To determine the effect of age and device on delivery of HFA-Fluticasone Propionate (FP) in children of different ages. Hypothesis -- passive inhalation in younger children through a valved holding chamber/mask (VHC) will reduce the relative amount of FP delivered to airways.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Age and Device on Delivery of Fluticasone</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective was to determine the effect of age and device on delivery of fluticasone propionate delivered by HFA-pMDI in children of different ages. The one-hour steady-state fluticasone plasma concentration which is an indirect measure of airway delivery and direct measure of systemic exposure, was determined. Sixty children with well-controlled persistent asthma received two actuations of 110 mcg twice daily for at least 3 days. A blood sample was collected one hour after the last dose when 100% adherence was documented by electronic monitor. Five groups of 12 each were studied: 1) 12-18 yr by actuator alone; 2) 5-9 yr by actuator alone; 3) 5-9 yr by antistatic VHC/mouthpiece; 4) 5-9 yr by antistatic VHC/mask and 5) 1-4 yr by antistatic VHC/mask. Fluticasone concentrations were measured by LC-MS/MS assay. Fluticasone plasma concentration between groups was compared using one way ANOVA.</detailed_description>
