	<brief_summary>This study tested the safety of a new malaria vaccine in adults in Mali, West Africa, and measured the ability of the vaccine to stimulate antibodies directed against the malaria protein that the vaccine is based on. Forty adults were randomly assigned to get either the experimental malaria vaccine or a rabies vaccine, for comparison.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Study of Candidate Malaria Vaccine FMP1/AS02A in Healthy Adults in Bandiagara, Mali</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study was a randomized, controlled trial in which participants and clinical investigators were blinded to vaccine group assignment. Forty adults were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either FMP1/AS02A or the control rabies vaccine. The aims of the control group were to account for baseline morbidity and the impact of seasonal malaria transmission on the dynamics of anti-MSP-1 antibodies, and to minimize bias in assessment of adverse events. Vaccines were given on a 0-, 1- and 2-month schedule. The first immunization was given in early July just as malaria transmission began; the second dose at the end of July as transmission was increasing; and the third dose in late August near the peak of malaria transmission intensity. Study day 90 was in October, shortly after transmission crests and when severe and uncomplicated malaria disease episodes peak, study day 180 was at the end of the malaria season, and study day 272 was at the height of the dry season. The final study follow-up on day 364 coincided with the beginning of the 2004 malaria season. Interim safety analyses were reviewed by an independent Safety Monitoring Committee before the second and third immunizations.</detailed_description>
