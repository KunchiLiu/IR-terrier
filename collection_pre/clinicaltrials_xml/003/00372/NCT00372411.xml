	<brief_title>Robotic Assisted Upper-Limb Neurorehabilitation in Stroke Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Hypothesis: The primary hypothesis is that robotic training compared with usual care and intensive comparison therapy will lead to improved upper extremity function. Eligible patients will be randomized to one of three treatment arms: 1) usual care, 2) intensive comparison therapy, or 3) robotic training. Participants assigned to intensive comparison therapy or robot-assisted training will receive treatment for 12 weeks consisting of three one-hour sessions a week and then usual care for the remainder of follow-up. Those assigned to usual care will receive the usual stroke care as delivered at each participating medical center for 36 weeks and then will be offered, as compassionate care, their choice of either robot-assisted or intensive comparison therapy. Secondary Hypothesis: The secondary hypotheses are that compared with usual care and intensive comparison therapy, robotic treatment will lead to improved quality of life and task performance involving proximal and distal control of the paretic arm. If the robotic arm is effective, two other secondary objects are to evaluate its early (less than 12 week) and late (36 week) effects on the primary and secondary outcomes. Primary Outcome: The primary study outcome is the change in the Fugl-Meyer score of neurological impairment at 12 weeks relative to baseline. Secondary Outcome: Secondary outcomes include the Stroke Impact Scale and Wolf Motor Function Test. A cost-effectiveness analysis is planned but only will be conducted if robotic training is more effective than usual care. Study Abstract: CSP #558 will be a randomized, multi-center, outpatient phase II trial to assess the safety and efficacy of robot-assisted therapy for neurorehabilitation in stroke patients with moderate to severe upper extremity impairment. The target sample is 158 patients: 26 usual care, 66 intensive comparison therapy and 66 robot training. This sample size will provide 90% power to detect a 5-point mean difference in the Fugl-Meyer scale between robot training and usual care and 3-point mean difference between robot training and intensive comparison therapy. There will be one interim analysis of the primary endpoint at 12 months for the purpose of sample size re-estimation using an adaptive design. The planned study duration is 33 months with 24 months of intake and nine months of follow-up. IMPACT STATEMENT If robotic training proves to be beneficial it will not only provide a functionally-oriented and neurophysiologically appropriate therapy, but also will make more widely available high-quality, evidence-based rehabilitative care at a time when there is a shortage of experienced therapists and a progressively growing rehabilitative need for veterans and all Americans.</detailed_description>
	<mesh_term>Stroke</mesh_term>
	<criteria>A single new focal unilateral stroke with diagnosis verified by brain imaging (MRI) or CT scan that has occurred at least 6 months prior to enrollment. Age 18 years of age and older. Upper extremity FuglMeyer score &gt;=7 or &lt;=38 (max 66). (These thresholds include neither hemiplegic nor fully recovered motor function in 14 muscles of the shoulder, elbow, and wrist.) Cognitive function sufficient to understand the experiments and follow instructions (MiniMental Status Score of 22 and higher or interview for aphasic subjects). Willingness to avoid any new alternative arm rehabilitative approaches for the duration of the study. Written informed consent to participate in the study. A fixed contracture in the affected limb that prevents movement along the entire dynamic range required by either robotassisted or intensive comparison therapy. Joint pain that occurs within the range of motion required by the intervention protocols (intensive comparison therapy and robotassisted therapy). Enrolled in or planning to enroll in another interventional research trial that involves the upper limbs using procedures proposed to enhance or limit the function of the upper extremity (such as adjuvant rehabilitation or Botox injections) during the 36 weeks of participation. Prior experience with robotassisted therapy or intensive comparison therapy for the upper limb as described in this specific study. A complicating medical condition that would prevent completion of the trial. Unable to complete the ninemonth study, e.g., extended planned vacation. Any other known preexisting bone diseases that might increase the risk of bone fracture or other injury from intensive comparison therapy or robotassisted therapy.</criteria>
