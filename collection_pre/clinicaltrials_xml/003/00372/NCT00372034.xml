	<brief_title>The Effect of Punctal Plugs on Tear Volume and Osmolality</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>50% of contact lens wearers have dryness/discomfort during contact lens wear. Significant decreases in lipid layer and tear film break up time during contact lens wear have been reported, leading to excessive evaporation, reduced tear volume and an increase in osmolality. Similar tear film changes occur with Dry Eye Disease. A commonly used therapy in treating dry eye is the insertion of punctal plugs to increase tear volume and ease dry eye symptoms. Punctal plugs block the tear drainage system, and often increase tear stability, and improve ocular surface health. This study will evaluate the role of tear volume in discomfort and dryness sensations during contact lens wear, and the possible influence on osmolality and ocular surface sensitivity. Collagen punctal plugs will be used for this study, as these allow a temporary (3-14 days) occlusion of the ocular drainage system, are easily removed if necessary and are inserted with minimal risk.</detailed_description>
