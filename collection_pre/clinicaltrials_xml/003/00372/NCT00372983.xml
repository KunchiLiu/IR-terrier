	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research trial is to find out whether NOV-205 is well tolerated compared to placebo (salt water) in people with hepatitis C. In addition, this trial will test how NOV-205 is absorbed by your body after single and multiple doses of the trial drug, and it will look for early signs of therapeutic activity (decreases in indicators in the blood for the hepatitis C virus and for liver damage). This is known as pharmacokinetics (PK). NOV-205 is an experimental drug. "Experimental" means that the trial drug is currently being tested and is not approved for sale in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). However, NOV-205 has been approved by the Russian Federation for treatment of liver diseases including hepatitis C. Clinical studies in that country showed that subjects treated with NOV-205 alone had decreased indicators in the blood for the hepatitis C virus and for liver damage.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and PK Study of NOV-205 to Treat Chronic HCV Who Fail Standard Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 1b trial aims to evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile of NOV-205, and in comparison to placebo, identify early signs of antiviral activity (with a quantitative reduction of &gt;0.5 log10 in serum HCV RNA level (Elbeik, 2004)) and establish a safety profile of NOV-205 as monotherapy in subjects with chronic HCV who are non-responders to treatment with pegylated interferon plus ribavirin. This trial will also explore the effect of NOV-205 on serum biochemical markers of liver damage (e.g. alanine aminotransferase, ALT) as indications of biologic activity. Results of this trial will guide the design of future Phase 2 studies of NOV-205 in chronic hepatitis C subjects.</detailed_description>
