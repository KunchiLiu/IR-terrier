	<brief_summary>This is a randomized Phase II study of an experimental anti-cancer drug called seliciclib. The main objective of this study is to learn if, and how long, seliciclib can keep the non-small cell lung cancer in check. An experimental drug is a drug which has not been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or other regulatory agencies for marketing and is still under study to determine how safe it is, what its side-effects are, and whether or not it is effective in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer.</brief_summary>
