	<criteria>Written voluntary informed consent. Patients with biochemically documented active acromegaly who are currently receiving somatostatinanalogues in a conventional treatment regimen (octreotide up to 30 mg/28 days; lanreotide up to 120 mg/28 days) for at least 6 months. Patients with uncontrolled disease defined as patients with a decrease of baseline levels of growth hormone (GH) ≥ 50% during treatment with somatostatinanalogues in a conventional regimen (sandostatin up to 30 mg/28 days; lanreotide up to 120 mg/28 days) for at least 6 months. Baseline (mean of 3 samples) GH level &gt; 2 µg/L. Insulinlike Growth Factor I (IGFI) levels above the upper limits of normal for age and gender. Other protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criteria applied to the study.</criteria>
