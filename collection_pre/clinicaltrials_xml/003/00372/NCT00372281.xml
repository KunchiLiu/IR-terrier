	<brief_summary>USPIO contrast enhancement results from intracellular trapping of the iron particles in reactive cells, especially macrophages. 17FDG-PET studies have demonstrated that macrophages are present in spine infectious diseases but are absent in spine degenerative diseases. The aim of this work is to compare the enhancement induced by CLIAVIST in both diseases. The absence of macrophages in degenerative lesions should help to differentiate them from infectious lesions, who should present contrast enhancement in relation to the presence of macrophages.</brief_summary>
