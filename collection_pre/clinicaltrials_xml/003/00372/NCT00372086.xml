	<brief_summary>Type 1 Diabetes is the most common life-long disorder with onset in childhood. Patients need insulin injections, blood sugar monitoring several times each day, and adhere to a strict diet. Adequate control of blood glucose is essential to prevent long term kidney and eye complications that result in kidney failure and blindness. Adolescence is a time when diabetes is difficult to control, due in part to high growth hormone levels causing insulin resistance ( a state where the body does not respond as strongly to insulin). This study will test whether treatment with rosiglitazone (an oral medication used frequently in type 2 diabetes) will reduce the insulin resistance of adolescence and improve the control of type 1 diabetes during puberty.</brief_summary>
