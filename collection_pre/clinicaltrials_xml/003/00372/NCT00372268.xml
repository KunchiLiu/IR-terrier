	<brief_summary>During laparoscopy, administration of cold and dry carbon dioxide (CO2) leads to hypothermia. Different types of gas conditioning have been studied in order to prevent this specific hypothermia. Intra-abdominal administration of local anesthetics has also been studied in order to prevent post-operative pain. In both cases, some results have been described. The investigators propose to evaluate in a prospective, randomized, double blind trial, the impact of 4 different types of conditioning of insufflated gas during laparoscopy for womb surgery on hypothermia prevention and post-operative pain. These 4 types of gas conditioning are: - CO2 wet and cold with nebulized Nacl and direct intra-abdominal administration of Nacl - CO2 wet and cold with nebulized ropivaca誰ne 0.75% and direct intra-abdominal administration of Nacl - CO2 dry and cold with direct intra-abdominal administration of ropivaca誰ne 0.2% - CO2 dry and cold with direct intra-abdominal administration of Nacl The investigators use a new device (Aeroneb速 Pro [Aerogen速 Company]) which can wet (by nebulization) the insufflated gas and therefore permits intraperitoneal medicament administration (local anesthetics).</brief_summary>
