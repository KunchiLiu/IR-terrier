	<brief_summary>Calcitonin has been used for many years for treating osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. Recent data from the 2 years placebo-controlled QUEST study have shown a preservation of microarchitecture as measured by high resolution MRI in postmenopausal women with prevalent vertebral fractures at baseline.This pilot study should provide additional new insights in the mode of action of nasal calcitonin, on structural changes as measured by high resolution peripheral CT, and on the comparison between weight bearing and non weight bearing bones in postmenopausal women.</brief_summary>
