	<brief_title>To Evaluate if the Medication Gabapentin Lessens Vulvar Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There is not a "best" treatment plan for vulvar pain including vulvodynia (chronic vulvar pain) and vulvar vestibulitis syndrome (VVS, chronic vulvar pain localized to the vaginal opening). We propose that vulvodynia is a neuropathic pain (pain that effects the nervous system) as characterized by pain from stimuli that is not usually painful, stimuli that would not usually be painful causing significant pain, and burning pain. Gabapentin has been shown to be effective in treating chronic pain.</detailed_description>
