	<brief_summary>This phase II trial is studying how well ziv-aflibercept works in treating patients with locally advanced, unresectable or metastatic gynecologic soft tissue sarcoma. Ziv-aflibercept may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ziv-aflibercept in Treating Patients With Locally Advanced, Unresectable, or Metastatic Gynecologic Soft Tissue Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the objective response of recurrent or metastatic gynecologic soft-tissue sarcomas to VEGF-Trap (ziv-aflibercept). II. To assess the incidence of disease stabilization, as measured by 6-month progression-free survival, in patients with recurrent or metastatic gynecologic soft-tissue sarcomas treated with VEGF-Trap. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess time-to-progression and overall survival in patients with recurrent or metastatic gynecologic soft-tissue sarcoma treated with VEGF-Trap. * As of 24 October 2012, overall survival follow-up is to be discontinued for the one remaining patient on long term follow-up, who has been off protocol therapy for at least 3 years. Time to progression and median survival times have been based on the currently available data. II. To assess the toxicity associated with VEGF-Trap in patients with recurrent or metastatic gynecologic soft-tissue sarcoma. III. To characterize the population pharmacokinetics of VEGF-Trap and to explore for demographic and clinical covariates OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to histology (uterine leiomyosarcoma vs malignant mixed mullerian tumor/carcinosarcoma). Patients receive ziv-aflibercept over 1 hour on day 1. Treatment repeats every 14 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo blood collection at baseline, every 8 weeks during treatment, and 60 days after completion of study treatment for population pharmacokinetic analysis using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 4 weeks and then every 3 months thereafter.</detailed_description>
