	<brief_summary>This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of carcinoembryonic antigen-expressing measles virus (MV-CEA) in treating patients with glioblastoma multiforme that has come back. A virus, called MV-CEA, which has been changed in a certain way, may be able to kill tumor cells without damaging normal cells.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the safety and toxicity of intratumoral and resection cavity administration of an Edmonston's strain measles virus genetically engineered to produce CEA (MV-CEA) in patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme. II. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of MV-CEA. III. To characterize viral gene expression at each dose level as manifested by CEA titers. IV. To assess viremia, viral replication, and measles virus shedding/persistence following intratumoral administration. V. To assess humoral and cellular immune response to the injected virus. VI. To assess in a preliminary fashion antitumor efficacy of this approach. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 sequential treatment arms. ARM A (RESECTION CAVITY ADMINISTRATION): Patients undergo en block resection of their tumor (after confirming diagnosis) on day 1, followed by MV-CEA administered into the resection cavity. ARM B (INTRATUMORAL AND RESECTION CAVITY ADMINISTRATION): Patients undergo stereotactic biopsy (to confirm the diagnosis) and placement of a catheter within the tumor, followed by carcinoembryonic antigen-expressing measles virus intratumorally (IT) through the catheter over 10 minutes on day 1. Patients then undergo en block resection of their tumor with computer-assisted stereotactic techniques on day 5, followed by MV-CEA administered around the tumor bed. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 28 days (non-cohort I patients), 7 weeks (patients in cohort I only), every 2 months until progression, every 3 and 12 months after progression, and then yearly thereafter for up to 15 years.</detailed_description>
