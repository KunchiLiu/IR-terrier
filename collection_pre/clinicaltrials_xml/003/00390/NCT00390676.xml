	<brief_summary>N-cadherin, a protein involved in blood vessel cell binding, is increased as cancer progresses, and is on the surface of many tumor cells. ADH-1 blocks N-cadherin. This study will test the safety and effects of the combination ADH-1 and carboplatin or ADH-1 and docetaxel or ADH-1 and capecitabine in subjects with specific incurable, solid tumors with a protein biomarker called N-cadherin.</brief_summary>
