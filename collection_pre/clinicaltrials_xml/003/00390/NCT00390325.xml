	<brief_summary>This phase II trial studies how well sorafenib tosylate works in treating patients with medullary thyroid cancer that has spread to other parts of the body (metastatic), spread to the tissue surrounding the thyroid (locally advanced), or has returned after a period of improvement (recurrent). Sorafenib tosylate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sorafenib Tosylate in Treating Patients With Metastatic, Locally Advanced, or Recurrent Medullary Thyroid Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess objective response rate of sorafenib (BAY 43-9006) (sorafenib tosylate) in metastatic medullary thyroid carcinoma in setting of inherited tumor syndromes, such as multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) 2A, MEN 2B, or familial medullary thyroid carcinoma (FMTC). II. To assess objective response rate of sorafenib (BAY 43-9006) in sporadic metastatic medullary thyroid carcinoma. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess toxicity of sorafenib (BAY 43-9006) in patients with metastatic medullary thyroid carcinoma. II. Measure serum tumor markers calcitonin and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) pre-, during, and post-treatment to correlate with disease response. II. Correlate nuclear medicine functional imaging (fludeoxyglucose F 18 positron emission tomography [PET] scan) data obtained at pre-, during, and post-treatment with tumor response in these patients. III. Correlate dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) data obtained at pre-, during, and post-treatment with changes in tumor permeability and vascularity with tumor response. IV. Perform pharmacogenomic studies on procured peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) if clinical responses are observed in these patients. V. To correlate between the degree of retrovirus-associated deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequences (Ras)-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling inhibition with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in the tumor and clinical response. VI. To correlate between the presence and type of ret proto-oncogene (RET) gene defects in tumor and clinical response. OUTLINE: Patients receive sorafenib tosylate orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-56. Treatment repeats every 8 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 4 weeks.</detailed_description>
