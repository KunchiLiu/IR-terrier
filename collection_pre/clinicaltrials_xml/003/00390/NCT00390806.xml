	<brief_summary>The current prognosis for patients with metastatic brain cancer from NSCLC is very poor. The current standard treatment for this disease is radiation therapy to the brain. The goal of the current study is to test whether the combination of orally administered HYCAMTIN capsules and whole brain radiation therapy will prolong the survival time of patients with this potentially serious condition.</brief_summary>
