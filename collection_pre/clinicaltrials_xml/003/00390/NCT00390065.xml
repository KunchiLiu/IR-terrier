	<brief_summary>Utilization of nitric oxide (NO) therapy has been related to a trend towards short term improvement in very premature infants. A two year follow-up of children treated soon after birth with NO in the neonatal period, suggests that a significant improvement in neurodevelopmental outcome might occur. This study aims to evaluate follow-up at 6 years, in respiratory and neurodevelopmental outcome, of children born very prematurely, some of them having been treated with nitric oxide in the neonatal period.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Utilization of nitric oxide therapy in the neonatal period has been related to a trend towards short term improvements in respiratory and neurological outcome at 28 days postnatal age or 36 weeks postconceptional age. A two year follow-up in children treated soon after birth with NO in the neonatal period, suggests that a significant improvement in neurodevelopmental outcome might occur. No long term evaluation on respiratory outcome has yet been done. This study aims to evaluate respiratory and neurodevelopmental outcome at 6 years of age in children born very prematurely, some of them having had Nitric Oxide as a rescue treatment for respiratory distress syndrome.</detailed_description>
