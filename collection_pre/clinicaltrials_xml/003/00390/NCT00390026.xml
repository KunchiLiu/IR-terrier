	<brief_summary>The object of the study is to compare the treatment effect of bevacizumab (Avastin), an antibody targeting vascular endothelial growth factor, with verteporfin photodynamic therapy (PDT) for patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration, the leading cause of vision severe loss in the Western world.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Avastin vs Visudyne for Neovascular AMD Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is caused by an ingrowth of pathological vessels under the macula. Experimental studies have demonstrated that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is centrally involved in this process. Current treatment options have up until now been limited to photodynamic therapy (PDT) where a photosensitizing agent in combination with laser is used to occlude the pathologic vessels. Anti-VEGF agents have recently become available making them a potentially attractive treatment alternative for neovascular AMD. We will compare the effect intravitreally administered bevacizumab with conventional PDT in a prospective, randomized and controlled trial including 100 patients (50 patients receiving either treatment regimen). Non-treated patients will receive either sham-injection or sham-PDT. The primary endpoint of the study is the amount of patients losing less than 15 letters on the ETDRS visual acuity chart. The study will go on for 2 years with an interim report after 1 year.</detailed_description>
