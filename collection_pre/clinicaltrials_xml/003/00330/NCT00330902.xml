	<brief_summary>In areas of seasonal malaria transmission, treatment of carriers of malaria parasites, whose parasitaemia persists at very low levels throughout the dry season, could be a useful strategy for malaria control in areas with a short transmission season. We did a randomized trial to compare two regimens for clearance of low level parasitaemia in the dry season.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomized Trial of Two Antimalarial Treatments for Clearing Low Density P.Falciparum Parasitaemia in Sudan</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>104 individuals with low density Plasmodium falciparum infection detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were randomized to receive sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and three daily doses of artesunate (SP+AS) or SP+AS and a dose of primaquine (SP+AS+PQ), and were followed up for 14 days during the transmission-free season in Eastern Sudan. Subjects were visited on days 3, 7 and 14 after the start of treatment to record any adverse events and to detect P.falciparum using PCR. PCR positive samples were tested for gametocytes using RT-PCR. Packed cell volume was measured on days 7 and 14.</detailed_description>
