	<brief_summary>STUDY OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of this study is to compare the safety and efficacy of acamprosate versus placebo in the treatment of alcohol dependence in adults with co-occurring mood or anxiety disorders (specifically, depression (MDE), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) or social anxiety disorder). Secondary objectives are to evaluate the effect of acamprosate treatment on mood and anxiety disorders. STUDY DESIGN: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial evaluating acamprosate in the treatment of alcohol dependence in adult outpatients with concurrent mood and/or anxiety disorders. The active study phase will be 12 weeks in duration. There will be a two-week screening period, followed by 12 weeks of study medication and a follow-up assessment at 14 weeks from randomization. STUDY POPULATION: A total of 90 (30 per site) men and women aged 18-60 years who have a current diagnosis of alcohol dependence as well as a current DSM-IV diagnosis of either MDE, GAD and/or social anxiety will be recruited to participate in this study. Only those individuals whose psychiatric disorders are stable will be randomized to acamprosate or placebo. Three sites will participate in this trial. TREATMENTS: Eligible participants will be randomly assigned to receive either acamprosate or matching placebo for 12 weeks. EFFICACY ASSESSEMENTS: The primary efficacy outcome measure will be cumulative days abstinent as measured by self-report.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Participants who meet all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be randomized to receive either acamprosate or placebo in a 1:1 ratio. Participants will be instructed to take (2) 333 mg tablets three times a day. Participants will be seen weekly for 12 weeks an again 14 weeks from randomization. At each weekly visit, participants will be asked about substance use and possible adverse events. They will also have their vital signs and weight measured at each visit. Psychiatric assessments, including the MADRS,HAM-A, Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale, and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale will be performed at weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12. Alcohol craving will be assessed using the Obsessive Compulsive Drinking Scale at baseline and monthly. A urine drug screen will also be performed monthly. A clinical global impressions scale will be completed for both psychiatric and alcohol abuse symptoms at every visit. A breath alcohol test will be performed at every visit, and a urine drug screen will be performed at baseline and monthly during the trial.</detailed_description>
