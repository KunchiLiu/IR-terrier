	<brief_summary>Hypothesis: Pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, treated with chronic glucocorticoids as a part of the leukemia treatment protocol, will have an increased incidence and severity of osteoporosis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Osteoporosis in Children With ALL</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Osteoporosis is a disease characterized by low bone mass and microarchitectural deterioration of bone tissue. Osteoporosis is a devastating disorder with significant physical, psychosocial and financial consequences. Intensive chemotherapy and radiotherapy have led to significant improvements in long term, disease-free survival of children with malignancies. Unfortunately, there are many deleterious side effects associated with this therapy. Little is known about the longitudinal changes in bone mass accumulation and bone metabolism in these patients. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the timing and severity of changes in bone mineral metabolism for children treated for childhood leukemia. Data will be used to establish treatment protocols with the goal of preventing severe fractures and pain in the acute treatment stage and severe osteoporosis and related pathology in the chronic stage.</detailed_description>
