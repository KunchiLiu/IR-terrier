	<brief_summary>This is an extension study to Tercica study MS301 (NCT00125164) and is intended to collect long term safety and efficacy data on the continued use of recombinant human insulin-like growth factor-1 (rh IGF-1) in children and adolescents treated for primary IGF-1 deficiency (IGFD). The secondary objective is to use the data collected to learn more about the relationship of IGF-1 exposure to the promotion of normal growth and pubertal development.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Primary IGFD is a term that has been used to describe patients with intrinsic cellular defects in GH action. In this protocol, subjects that have completed one year of mecasermin treatment on Tercica protocol MS301 (NCT00125164) will be allowed to enroll in this extension study. All subjects were planned to receive treatment. This is a Phase IIIb open-label, multi-center, parallel dose, extension study conducted in approximately 40 centers across the United States.</detailed_description>
