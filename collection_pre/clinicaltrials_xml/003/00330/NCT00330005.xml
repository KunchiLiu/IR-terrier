	<brief_title>A Pilot Study of Psychodynamic Psychotherapy for Bipolar Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The psychotherapy literature suggests that psychological treatments can have a significant impact on the clinical course and outcome for bipolar disorder (Swartz &amp; Frank, 2001). Very few outcome studies have been conducted in group psychotherapy for bipolar disorder, and there are no preliminary studies conducted using the Integrative Outpatient Model, developed specifically for bipolar disorder. Given the lack of preliminary data, a pilot study with a matched-control design is indicated to obtain preliminary data regarding this treatment modality and approach. The IOM is a weekly, long term psychotherapy. Comparison: Individuals who participate in group psychotherapy will be compared to a control group on mood and symptom ratings, up to 1 year post intervention.</detailed_description>
