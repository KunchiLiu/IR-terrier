	<brief_summary>The two purposes of this study are 1. to determine what effect the chronic and moderate/heavy drinking of alcoholic beverages has 1. on the blood level of bupropion and chlorzoxazone and their major breakdown products in the blood and 2. on the stimulant effect of bupropion and 2. to determine what effect a normal and common (25% frequency) genetic variation of a specific liver enzyme (that breaks down bupropion) has 1. on the blood levels of bupropion and its major breakdown products in the blood and 2. on the stimulant effect of bupropion. Two groups of volunteers will be recruited for this study: 1. volunteers who drink moderate to heavy amounts of alcohol frequently and 2. volunteers who usually do not drink alcohol. Volunteers will NOT be asked to change their drinking (or nondrinking) habits during the study.</brief_summary>
