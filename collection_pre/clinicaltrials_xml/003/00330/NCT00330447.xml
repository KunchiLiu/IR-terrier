	<detailed_description>Prospectively the outcome of mothers diagnosed and/or treated for cancer during pregnancy will be registered and investigated. In a prospective trial we invite children that were exposed to cytotoxic drugs or radiotherapy in utero for a standardized neurological and cardiological examination. The examinations will be done by qualified psychologists, neurological and cardiological pediatricians.</detailed_description>
