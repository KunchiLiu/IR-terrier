	<brief_summary>Fruits and vegetables are rich in a variety of flavonoids with antioxidant properties. These compounds may be partially responsible for some of the positive links found between fruits and vegetables intake and higher bone mineral density in adults and children. Several animal studies have shown that consumption of onions (which are rich in quercetin), rutin (a quercetin glycoside) and resvatrol (found in red wine) inhibits ovariectomy induced bone loss in rats. One of the most studied flavonoids with respect to bone health is the soy isoflavones. However, consumption of soy products is relatively low in Western countries. One the other hand, a flavonoid such as hesperidin, found mostly in oranges is much more abundant in the Western diet. Citrus juice consumption has been demonstrated to prevent bone loss in male orchidectomized rats while specifically feeding hesperidin has been shown to prevent bone loss in ovariectomized mice and rats. However, to date no clinical prove has been obtained for these benefits.Therefore the aim of this study is to investigate the effect of hesperidin in preventing bone loss in postmenopausal women. This study is designed as a 2-year, double blind, placebo-controlled, two arm, and parallel group study. The primary outcome measure is change in bone mineral density (BMD) while the secondary outcome measures are changes in bone resorption and formation markers as well as body composition. The women are randomised to consume 2 servings of hesperidin-rich food or food without hesperidin but with the same taste &amp; appearance (placebo). Subjects will undergo medical screening, anthropometry, physical activity, dietary assessments and BMD before randomisation into placebo or active group. Follow-up measurements are made at 3-month intervals (for blood and urine collection) and 6-month intervals for bone mineral density. Side effects are also being monitored during each visit.</brief_summary>
