	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: Phase I Patients are on EIAC for a minimum of 15 days. Patients may be on more than one anticonvulsant (AC). At least one of the ACs must be an EIAC. Patients with anaplastic astrocytoma, anaplastic oligodendroglioma, mixed anaplastic oligoastrocytoma, glioblastoma multiforme, or gliosarcoma at recurrence Patients whose diagnostic pathology confirmed these pathologies will not need rebiopsy Patients with prior lowgrade glioma are eligible if histologic assessment demonstrates transformation to Grade III or IV malignant glioma Phase II Patients must have histologically confirmed glioblastoma multiforme or gliosarcoma in first or second recurrence. Patients may not have received more than two prior cytotoxic chemotherapy containing regimen. Patients must not have received prior treatment with VEGFR, ErbB1, ErbB2 inhibitors including but not limited to PTK787, Sorafenib, Sutent, Tarceva, Iressa, Erbitux, and Herceptin. Prior Avastin therapy is permitted provided three months has elapsed before Day 1, Treatment Period 1. Tumor tissue must be analyzed for PTEN and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) vIII prior to dosing. Patients with prior lowgrade glioma are eligible if histologic assessment demonstrates transformation to Grade IV malignant glioma. Patients must not be on an EIAC. NOTE: Once the (optimally tolerated regimen) OTR in Phase I is determined and all patients in the expanded cohort have completed 1 treatment period then patients on EIAC may be enrolled in the Phase II component of the study. Phase I and II Male or female, age at least 18 years of age. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) status 0 to 1 as per protocol. Clinical lab results as per protocol Has a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) at least 50% based on echocardiogram (ECHO) or Multi Gated Aquisition (MUGA) or within the institutional normal range. Adequate renal function Creatinine clearance more than 50 mL/min as calculated by the CockcroftGault formula as per protocol. Urine Protein Creatinine (UPC) ratio of less than or equal to 1 as per protocol. Able to swallow and retain oral medications. A woman is eligible to enter and participate in the study if she is of: Nonchildbearing potential (i.e., physiologically incapable of becoming pregnant), including any female who: Has had a hysterectomy, Has had a bilateral oophorectomy (ovariectomy), Has had a bilateral tubal ligation, Is postmenopausal (total cessation of menses for at least 1 year) Childbearing potential, has a negative serum pregnancy test at screening, and agrees to use adequate contraception. Acceptable contraceptive methods, when used consistently and in accordance with both the product label and the instructions of the physician, are as follows: An intrauterine device (IUD) with a documented failure rate of less than 1% per year. Vasectomized partner who is sterile prior to the female patient's entry and is the sole sexual partner for that female. Doublebarrier contraception (condom with spermicidal jelly, foam suppository, or film; diaphragm with spermicide; or male condom and diaphragm with spermicide). A man with a female partner of childbearing potential is eligible to enter and participate in the study if he uses a barrier method of contraception or abstinence during the study. If sexually active, patients will continue the recommended contraceptive measures for the duration of the treatments and for 28 days following discontinuation of therapy. Signed informed consent approved by the Institutional Review Board prior to patient entry. Exclusion criteria: Poorly controlled hypertension as per protocol. NOTE: Initiation or adjustment of BP medication is permitted prior to study entry provided that patient has two consecutive BP readings less than 140/90 mmHg each separated by a minimum of 24 hrs. These readings need to be collected prior to enrolment. Concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled medical disease (e.g. uncontrolled diabetes, congestive cardiac failure, poorly controlled hypertension, history of labile hypertension, history of poor compliance with antihypertensive regimen, chronic renal disease, or active uncontrolled infection) that could compromise participation in the study. History of myocardial infarction, admission for unstable angina, cardiac angioplasty or stenting within three months of Day 1, Treatment Period 1. Has Class III or IV heart failure as defined by the New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification system as per protocol. QTc prolongation defined as a corrected QT (QTc) interval greater than or equal to 470 milliseconds. History of venous or arterial thrombosis within 3 months of Day 1, Treatment Period 1. Current use of therapeutic warfarin. NOTE: both low molecular weight heparin and prophylactic lowdose warfarin are permitted; however, prothrombin time/partial thromboplastin time (PT/PTT) must meet above inclusion criteria. Excessive risk of bleeding as defined by stroke within the prior 6 months, history of central nervous system (CNS) or intraocular bleed, or septic endocarditis. Evidence of intratumor hemorrhage on pretreatment diagnostic imaging, except for stable postoperative Grade 1 hemorrhage. Active systemic bleeding, such as gastrointestinal bleeding or gross hematuria. Female patients who are pregnant or breast feeding. Acute or chronic liver disease (i.e., hepatitis, cirrhosis). Patients who received investigational drugs less than 21days prior to Day 1, Treatment Period 1, or who have not recovered from the toxic effects of such therapy. Patients who received chemotherapy less than or equal to 21days prior (6 weeks for prior nitrosourea or mitomycin C) to Day 1, Treatment Period 1, or who have not recovered from the toxic effects of such therapy. Patients who received radiation therapy less than or equal to 12 weeks prior to Day 1, Treatment Period 1, or who have not recovered from the toxic effects of such therapy as per protocol. Patients who received biologic, immunotherapeutic or cytostatic agents less than or equal to 14 days prior to Day 1, Treatment Period 1, or who have not recovered from the toxic effects of such therapy. Patient is less than 3 years free of another primary malignancy except: if the other primary malignancy is not currently clinically significant or requiring active intervention. Patients with a history of completely resected nonmelanoma skin cancer or successfully treated in situ carcinoma are eligible.
