	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to determine whether the investigational drug cetuximab, (Erbitux) alone or with paclitaxel (Taxol) can stabilize the growth of urothelial cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Cetuximab With and Without Weekly Paclitaxel for Patients With Previously Treated Advanced Urothelial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study is being done to find out if cetuximab, alone or with paclitaxel will slow the growth of urothelial cancers. Cetuximab is an antibody that blocks a protein called epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). EGFR sits on the outside of tumor cells and controls tumor cell growth. This agent has been looked at alone and with other chemotherapy drugs including paclitaxel. It has been found to be safe and can shrink other types of cancer. This research study is also being done to find out if cetuximab, alone or with paclitaxel shrinks urothelial tumors. If it extends the time the tumors shrink. If it helps people live longer. The purpose of this research study is to find out what effects (good and bad) these treatments have on you and your cancer. We do not know if you will benefit from this research study. It is possible that your condition will get better, but it is also possible that there will be no effect on your condition or that your condition will get worse. We can use what we learn from this research study to help other people with the same disease.</detailed_description>
