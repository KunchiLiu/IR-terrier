	<brief_summary>Patients with Clostridium difficile associated disease who fulfill the eligibility criteria will be approached to participate. All study patients must receive standard of care treatment for Clostridium difficile associated disease. Enrolled patients will be randomized to receive a single intravenous solution of a human monoclonal antibody (huMab) to C. difficile toxin A (GS-CDA1) combined with a human monoclonal antibody to C. difficile toxin B (MDX-1388) or 0.9% sodium chloride as placebo in a 1:1 treatment allocation.Patients will be evaluated for safety and clinical outcomes through day 84 +/- 10 days. Occurrence of adverse events, use of concomitant medications, and stool output will be assessed at scheduled phone contacts and study visits. Some patients enrolled will have a subsequent visit on day 168 ± 14 days.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of the Clinical Effectiveness of a Human Monoclonal Antibody to C. Difficile Toxin A and Toxin B in Patients With Clostridium Difficile Associated Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a phase II, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in patients diagnosed with Clostridium difficile associated disease. Patients with Clostridium difficile associated disease will be identified either from stool test results or by physician referral, and those who fulfill the eligibility criteria will be approached to participate. All study patients must receive standard of care treatment for Clostridium difficile associated disease. Enrolled patients will be randomized to receive a single intravenous solution of a human monoclonal antibody to C. difficile toxin A (GS-CDA1) combined with a human monoclonal antibody to C. difficile toxin B (MDX-1388) or 0.9% sodium chloride as placebo in a 1:1 treatment allocation. One hundred patients will be enrolled in the combination monoclonal antibody treated arm and 100 patients will be enrolled in the placebo arm. Patients will be evaluated through day 84 ± 10 days after receipt of study infusion for safety and clinical outcomes. Blood samples for safety analyses, anti-toxin A and anti-toxin B antibody measurements and human anti-human antibody (HAHA) titers will be collected at scheduled times. Study visits will occur on days 3 ± 1, 10 ± 2, 28 ± 3, 56 ± 7 and on day 84 ± 10 days. Occurrence of adverse events, use of concomitant medications, and record of stool output will be assessed at scheduled phone contacts and study visits. The first 20 patients enrolled will have a subsequent visit on day 168 ± 14 days for an additional blood collection for HAHA analysis.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Patient &gt; 18 years of age with diarrhea associated with a positive stool test for C. difficile toxin(s). Patients may be diagnosed with C. difficile by hospital/clinic/reference microbiology laboratory test or by a rapid diagnostic test performed by the study staff and positive test result must be within 14 days of enrollment. 2. Patient must receive standard of care treatment for C. difficile associated disease. Standard of care treatment should include either metronidazole by mouth or intravenously or vancomycin by mouth. 3. Patient or legal representative must have read, understood, and provided written informed consent and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) authorization after the nature of the study has been fully explained. 1. History of chronic diarrheal illness such as ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease. 2. Score of 4 on modified Horn's index 3. Severe C. difficile colitis with planned surgery in less than 24 hours. 4. Positive pregnancy test within 24 hours of study infusion or an unwillingness to undergo pregnancy testing in females of childbearing potential. Females capable of childbearing must agree not to become pregnant from the time of study enrollment until at least 3 months after completion of study infusion. If a woman is sexually active and has no history of hysterectomy or tubal ligation, she must agree to use hormonal or barrier birth control with spermicidal gel. 5. Breastfeeding. 6. Receipt of other investigational study agent within previous 30 days. 7. Any other condition that in the opinion of the investigator would jeopardize the safety or rights of the patient participating in the study or make it unlikely the patient could complete the study.</criteria>
