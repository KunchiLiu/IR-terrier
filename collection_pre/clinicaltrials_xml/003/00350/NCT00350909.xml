	<detailed_description>The purpose of this clinical trail is to evaluate the efficacy of a brief, cognitive-behavioral therapeutic intervention for adolescents reporting mild or moderate drug abuse (MMDA). This school-based initiative employs a collaborative effort between the University of Minnesota researchers and the St. Paul Public Schools. This intervention aims to reduce post-treatment drug use behaviors and enhance drug-use resistant cognitions and problem-solving skills. Specifically, we propose a randomized clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of a cognitive-behavioral therapy on key process and outcome dimensions among school-based youth with mild-to-moderate drug abuse (MMDA). The experimental treatment is designated Brief Cognitive Behavioral Intervention (BCBI) given its theoretical foundation in stage of change theory used to coordinate modules on Rational-Emotive Therapy and Problem Solving Therapy. BCBI will be compared against a second experimental treatment that consists of BCBI and a single parent session (BCBI+P) and an assessment only condition (control). The importance of clarifying mechanisms in drug treatment research will be explored with respect to a limited number of treatment and individual factors that have emerged as promising mediating and moderating factors, such as cognitive and problem solving factors, parenting practices, and peer group influences.</detailed_description>
