	<brief_title>A Phase II Trial of a WRAIR Live Attenuated Virus Tetravalent Dengue Vaccine in Healthy US Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects will be randomized into one of 4 groups. One group will receive a placebo vaccine and the others will receive one of 3 different dengue vaccine formations. Each subject will receive two doses six months apart. Study subjects who elect to participate in a mosquito transmissibility component of the study will undergo mosquito feedings during each of the two assigned follow-up visits after vaccine dose 1. All subjects will have 11 venipunctures during 11 visits (i.e., screening plus 10 study visits) over a period of nine months. A third (booster) dose of post transfection F17 or F19 will be administered approximately 5 to 12 months after dose 2 to all subjects who received one of these formulation for their first two doses. Volunteers will return for a single visit 6 months after receiving their booster dose (long term follow-up)</detailed_description>

Pregnant or lactating female; Female planning to become pregnant or planning to discontinue abstinence or contraceptive precautions; History of any neurological or behavioral disorder or seizures, with the exception of a single febrile seizure in childhood; History of drug abuse or alcohol consumption (more than 2 drinks per day); History of allergic disease/reaction likely to be exacerbated by any component of the vaccine; History of urticaria related to mosquito bites requiring medical attention; Acute or chronic, clinically significant pulmonary, cardiovascular, hepatic, renal, hematologic or endocrine functional defect, as determined by physical examination or laboratory tests; Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition; Subject seropositive for HBsAg, antiHCV or antiHIV; Acute disease at the time of enrollment (acute disease is defined as the presence of a moderate or severe illness with or without fever); (Vaccine can be administered to persons with a minor illness such as diarrhea, mild upper respiratory infection with or without lowgrade febrile illness, i.e., oral temperature &lt;37.5°C/&lt;99.5°F.) Chronic hepatomegaly, right upper quadrant abdominal pain or tenderness; Chronic splenomegaly, left upper quadrant abdominal pain or tenderness; Use of any investigational or nonregistered drug or vaccine other than the study vaccine within 30 days preceding the study vaccine (includes placebo) or planned use during the study period; Planned administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol during the period starting from 30 days before each dose of the study vaccine and ending 30 days after; A planned move to a location that will prohibit participating in the trial for 9 months after the initial vaccination; Chronic administration (defined as more than 14 days) of immunosuppressants or other immunemodifying drugs within 90 days preceding the first dose or planned administration during the study period. For corticosteroids, this will mean prednisone, or equivalent, 0.5 mg/kg/day. Inhaled and topical steroids are allowed; Administration of immunoglobulins and/or blood products within 90 days preceding the first dose or planned administration during the study period; Any chronic systemic drug therapy to be continued during the study period (except for vitamin/mineral supplements, a single antihypertension medication or routine treatment for gastroesophageal reflux).</criteria>
