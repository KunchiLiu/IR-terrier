We hypothesize that in weeks following serious terror attacks there will be an increase in prescriptions for psychiatric medications and an increased number of unexplained somatic complaints. We will also examine associations with overall medical utlization. We will consider age, gender and effects of geographic poximity to location of attacks.</brief_summary>
