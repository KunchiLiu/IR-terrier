	<brief_title>Effect of Androgel on Type 2 Diabetic Males With Hypogonadism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Type 2 diabetes is an atherosclerotic, pro-inflammatory and pro-oxidative stress. Hypogonadism( low testosterone) is also associated with increased levels of inflammatory mediators and atherosclerosis. This project is about studying the effect of testosterone replacement on different inflammatory cells in blood and urine. It will also compare the dose dependent effect on inflammatory cells. This also involves comparing level of inflammation in hypogonadic diabetic males treated with testosterone with those not treated with any replacement therapy. This study involves applying AndroGel for 8 wks and studying effects during this time and thereafter.</detailed_description>
