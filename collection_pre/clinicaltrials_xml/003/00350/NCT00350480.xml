	<brief_title>Treatment of Non-Gestational Acute Uterine Bleeding: A Randomized Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute uterine bleeding, unrelated to pregnancy, is a relatively common problem that causes many reproductive-aged women to requite emergent medical and/or surgical intervention. Although the traditional approaches have generally been surgical in nature, many practitioners utilize medical methods to arrest the bleeding. However, despite widespread use, there exists a paucity of information regarding the effectiveness, side-effects, and patient satisfaction associated with the commonly-used medical regimens. (b) The purpose of the study is to compare the efficacy of multidose medroxyprogesterone acetate and a multidose, monophasic combined oral contraceptive in the treatment of hemodvnamically-stable women with non-gestational, acute uterine bleeding. (c) Non-pregnant, hemodynamically-stable, reproductive-aged, women, over the age of IS, who present either to the emergency area or to KP practitioner's offices with acute uterine bleeding, will be considered for eligibility. If, following a full exam and medically appropriate investigations medical management is deemed appropriate, they will be approached by a member of the investigating team for possible inclusion into the study. Following informed consent, patients will be randomized to receive either medroxyprogesterone acetate (20 mg three times daily for 7 days) or monophasic oral contraceptive containing I mg of norethindrone and 35 ug of ethinyl estradiol (three dines daily for seven days). Following the seven days of therapy, those randomized to MPA will continue with 20 mg per day for three weeks while those randomized to oral contraceptives will take one pill per day for three weeks, each completing a total of four weeks of therapy. The primary outcome will be the number of days until cessation of bleeding. Other outcomes measured will include pad and tampon counts, and hemoglobin levels. Chi square tests and student t will be used to evaluate differences between the two treatment groups. The hope is that this study will elucidate on the efficacy of the two regimens.</detailed_description>
