	<brief_summary>Background: Nonsurgical proximal humerus fracture is common, causing prolonged disability, for which the time to begin rehabilitation is not well determined. We assessed the feasibility and efficacy of early (within 3 daysâ€™after fracture) mobilisation of the shoulder compared with conventional 3-week immobilization followed by physiotherapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy of Shoulder Mobilisation Versus Conventional Immobilisation for Nonsurgically Proximal Humerus Fracture</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Methods: We randomly assigned 74 patients with impacted nonsurgically treated proximal humerus fracture to receive early passive mobilisation or conventional-treatment. The primary outcome was functional assessment of the shoulder (Constant score) at 3 months. Secondary outcomes were functional assessment at 6 weeks and at 6 months, change in pain (on a visual analogue scale) and passive range of motion.</detailed_description>
