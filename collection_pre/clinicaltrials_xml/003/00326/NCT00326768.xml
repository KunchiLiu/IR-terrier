	<brief_summary>The objective of this trial is to assess the safety and efficacy of 52 weeks of open-label treatment with the fixed dose combination of telmisartan 80 mg plus HCTZ 12.5 mg and telmisartan 40 mg plus HCTZ 12.5 mg in patients with essential hypertension.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial of Telmisartan 80 mg/HCTZ 12.5 mg and Telmisartan 40 mg/HCTZ 12.5 mg in Patients With Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multi-centre study with three centres participating with a target of 30 to 90 patients entering the maintenance period and 20-60 patients completing long-term treatment per centre. The recruitment period will be about three months from the start of the study. Study Hypothesis: The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate the long-term safety of a fixed dose combination of telmisartan/HCTZ fixed-dose combination treatment. This study has no control group; therefore, no hypothesis testing will be performed. Comparison(s): This study has no control group.</detailed_description>
