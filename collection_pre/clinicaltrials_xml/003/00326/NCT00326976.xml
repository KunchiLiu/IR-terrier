	<criteria>Patients who have given informed consent Patients after primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for acute STelevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) Men or women with no child bearing potential Onset of symptoms to balloon time &lt; 6 hours STelevation of at least 2 mm in at least 3 leads on 12lead electrocardiogram (ECG) Primary PCI indicated per standard of care First myocardial infarction (MI) Single index lesion with complete occlusion [thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) flow 0/I] of one target vessel.
