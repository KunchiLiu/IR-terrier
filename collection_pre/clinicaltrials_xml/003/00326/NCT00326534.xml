	<brief_summary>One study has suggested a connection between an infection with Rickettsia species and sarcoidosis finding molecular evidence of rickettsial deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in two patients. Another study found no antibodies in twenty Swedish patients with sarcoidosis. This study will further enhance the subject by three different approaches in Danish patients. The purpose of this study is to find serological and molecular evidence of an infection with Rickettsia species in Danish patients with sarcoidosis.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study has three approaches to the subject: 1. A serological survey of rickettsial immunoglobin G (IgG)-antibodies in 50 patients with sarcoidosis compared to 50 blood donors without sarcoidosis. 2. An archival study using pre-existing lymph node biopsies, where immunohistochemical analysis, fluorescent in situ hybridization, and polymerase chain reaction will be applied to samples from 50 patients with sarcoidosis and compared to 50 patients without sarcoidosis and 10 patients with tuberculosis. 3. A prospective study using bronchoscopically obtained samples from 20 patients with sarcoidosis, compared to 20 patients without sarcoidosis. The study applies the same techniques as the second study, but enhancing the information from the patients.</detailed_description>
