	<brief_summary>For reduction of dislocated shoulder, sedation with propofol and remifentanil should give satisfactory operating conditions and pain relief, and significantly reduce the time to full recovery, compared with morphine and midazolam</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Sedation/Analgesia: Midazolam/Morphine Vs Propofol/Remifentanil</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Propofol is a recognised agent for sedation and remifentanil is a short acting opioid analgesic. We intend to provide sedation with propofol, 0.5 mg/Kg, and analgesia with remifentanil 0.5 microgram/Kg for reduction of dislocated shoulders. This will be a randomised sex-stratified comparison with current therapy which is midazolam incrementally up to a maximum of 0.15 mg/Kg, and morphine incrementally up to 0.15 mg/Kg. The primary outcome measure is time to full recovery. Secondary aspects are pain or discomfort during the procedure and operating conditions.</detailed_description>
