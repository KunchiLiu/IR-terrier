	<brief_title>Isthmus Ablation With Gold Electrode for Treatment of Atrial Flutter (AURUM 8)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Transvenous catheter ablation has become the therapy of choice for patients with recurring, isthmus-dependent right atrial flutter. Achieving bidirectional conduction block in the cavotricuspid isthmus is decisive for both acute and long-term therapy success and essentially depends on the selected ablation method and the lesion size. By using an 8 mm tip electrode instead of a conventional 4 mm electrode, deeper lesions can be made, thus significantly reducing the required number of energy applications for achieving a bidirectional conduction block. Experimental studies have proven that using an ablation electrode made of gold alloy allows the creation of deeper lesions than with conventional platinum-iridium electrodes. Due to the greater heat conductivity of the gold alloy as opposed to platinum-iridium, the cooling of the ablation electrode is improved and more electric energy can be transmitted to the tissue at identical temperatures. The combination of both technologies in the form of an 8 mm-long gold electrode anticipates that the lesion depth required for an isthmus block can be achieved more quickly in comparison to the platinum-iridium electrode.</detailed_description>
