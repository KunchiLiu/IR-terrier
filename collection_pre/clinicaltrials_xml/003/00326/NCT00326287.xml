	<brief_title>Ceftobiprole in the Treatment of Patients With Community-Acquired Pneumonia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ceftobiprole medocaril is a cephalosporin antibiotic with anti-MRSA (Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus) activity. Ceftobiprole medocaril is not yet approved for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia. This is a randomized, double-blind, multicenter study of ceftobiprole medocaril plus placebo versus a comparator to assess the effectiveness and safety of ceftobiprole medocaril in patients with community-acquired pneumonia. The patients will be randomized to ceftobiprole medocaril plus placebo or a comparator. Patients who meet specified criteria may be switched to an alternative oral treatment. The primary endpoint is that the clinical cure rate among patients treated with ceftobiprole at the test of cure visit. The patients will receive either ceftobiprole medocaril plus placebo or a comparator.</detailed_description>
