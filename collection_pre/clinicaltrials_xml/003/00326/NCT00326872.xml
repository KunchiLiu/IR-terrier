	<brief_summary>This phase II trial is studying how well AZD2171 works in treating patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 and plexiform neurofibroma and/or neurofibroma near the spine. AZD2171 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>AZD2171 in Treating Patients With Neurofibromatosis Type 1 and Plexiform Neurofibroma and/or Neurofibroma Near the Spine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the efficacy of AZD2171, in terms of volume change in target tumors by 3-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging (3D MRI). II. Describe and define the toxicities of AZD2171 in these patients. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the value of 3D MRI data analysis in evaluating plexiform or paraspinal neurofibromas compared to conventional 2-dimensional MRI data analysis. II. Assess the value of delayed contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) in determining changes in vascularity of neurofibromas before and during treatment. III. Assess the quality of life of patients treated with AZD2171. IV. Evaluate the effect of AZD2171 on biological changes of human neurofibroma by comparing pre- and post-treatment specimens from patients involved in this trial or, alternatively, by evaluating the effect of AZD2171 on human tumor grafts in experimental animals. V. Evaluate relevant pharmacodynamic markers (circulating endothelial cells [CECs] and vascular endothelial growth factor-2 [VEGF2] levels) and pharmacogenetics analyses (variation in kdr/flk-1 and other genes) in response to AZD2171. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to tumor location (peripheral vs paraspinal plexiform neurofibroma). Patients receive oral AZD2171 once daily on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 26 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with responding or stable disease may continue treatment beyond 26 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Quality of life is assessed at baseline, prior to course 2, prior to course 4, and every 6 courses thereafter.</detailed_description>
