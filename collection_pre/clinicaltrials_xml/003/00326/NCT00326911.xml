	<criteria>The patient has provided signed written informed consent. The patient is ≥18 years of age. The patient has histologically or cytologicallyconfirmed pancreatic adenocarcinoma not amenable to curative treatment with surgery or has documented or suspected extrapancreatic metastases. The patient has either (a) measurable disease as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.0 (RECIST) or (b) nonmeasurable disease with an elevated baseline CA199 level (≥2 x the upper limit of normal [ULN]). The patient's Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status is ≤2. The patient has adequate hematologic function as defined by an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1500/mm3 and a platelet count ≥100,000/mm3 obtained within 2 weeks prior to the first dose of study medication. The patient has adequate hepatic function as defined by a total bilirubin ≤2.0 mg/dL and transaminases ≤5.0 x ULN obtained within 2 weeks prior to the first dose of study medication. The patient has adequate renal function as defined by serum creatinine ≤2.0 x ULN and urine dipstick for proteinuria ≤1+ obtained within 2 weeks prior to the first dose of study medication. If urine dipstick is ≥2+, then a 24hour urine for protein must demonstrate &lt; 1000 mg of protein in 24 hours to allow participation in the study. Urinalysis is also acceptable. If the patient is on fulldose anticoagulation therapy (eg, warfarin or low molecular weight [LMW] heparin), the following criteria must be met: The patient has an inrange International Normalized Ratio ([INR]usually between 2 and 3) on a stable dose of oral anticoagulant or be on a stable dose of LMW heparin The patient has no active bleeding or pathological condition that carries a high risk of bleeding (e.g., tumor involving major vessels or known varices) If the patient is not on fulldose anticoagulation therapy, the following criteria must be met: The patient has adequate coagulation function as defined by INR ≤1.5 The patient has a partial thromboplastin (PTT) ≤ULN obtained within 2 weeks prior to the first dose of study medication If a woman, the patient agrees to use an accepted and effective method of contraception (hormonal or barrier methods, abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of the study. If a male and sexually active, the patient agrees to use effective contraception. The patient is accessible for treatment and followup. Patients enrolled in this trial must be treated at the participating center. Endocrine tumors or lymphoma of the pancreas Known brain metastases Prior therapy with an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor or vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor Prior chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, or radiation therapy for advanced pancreatic cancer, patients who received chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy in the adjuvant setting will be eligible as long as the adjuvant therapy was completed &gt;6 months prior Concurrent malignancy other than nonmelanomatous skin cancer or carcinoma in situ of the cervix Concurrent treatment with other anticancer therapy, including other chemotherapy, immunotherapy, hormonal therapy, radiotherapy, chemoembolization, or targeted therapy Ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations History of arterial thrombotic events within 9 months History of uncontrolled hypertension (&gt;150/100 mmHg) not on a stable regimen of antihypertensive therapy History of significant bleeding events or upper or lower gastrointestinal bleeding within 9 months History of gastrointestinal perforation within 12 months Serious nonhealing wound ulcer, bone fracture, or major surgical procedure with 28 days If a woman, is pregnant or lactating An employee of the investigator or study center as well as family members of the employees</criteria>
