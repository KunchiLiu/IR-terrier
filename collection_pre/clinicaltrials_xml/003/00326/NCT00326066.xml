	<brief_title>A Study of the iStent in Combo With Cataract Surgery in Newly Diagnosed Open Angle Glaucoma or OH Patients.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will compare the reduction in IOP of those subjects implanted with two Glaukos micro-stents with the reduction in IOP for patients receiving only primary medical therapy (Xalatan - Latanoprost) or cataract surgery alone. Both groups will undergo routine cataract surgery.</detailed_description>
