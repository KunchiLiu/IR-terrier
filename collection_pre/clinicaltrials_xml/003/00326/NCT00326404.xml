	<brief_title>Continuous Versus Cyclic Use of Oral Contraceptive Pills in Adolescents</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Oral contraceptive pills have traditionally been prescribed in a cyclical manner, where there are 21-24 days of active pills and 4-7 days of placebo pills or a pill-free interval, creating a 28-day cycle. It has now been proven that as long as a woman has both estrogen and progesterone, her uterine lining is protected and is thin. To that effect, a new OCP (SeasonaleÂ®, Barr Laboratories, Pomona, NY) has been packaged in the United States that combines 84 days of active pills with 7 days of placebo pills. This allows a withdrawal bleed every 3 months. Like in adult women, OCPs are the most popular form of birth control and cycle control in adolescents. But, for a variety of reasons, adolescents tend to have poorer compliance when taking OCPs. Adult women tend to be noncompliant about 6% of the time, but, by the end of one year, adolescents have a non-compliance rate of 34-66%. There have been few studies that even describe improved compliance and decreased ovarian follicular development in women who take OCPs continuously, which could be beneficial in decreasing the rate of adolescent pregnancy. The majority of the studies looking at continuous use of OCPs have been performed in adult women. At present, there has been only one article that has addressed the use of continuous OCPs in adolescents. Sucato and Gold discussed the indications of continuous use of OCPs, how to prescribe them, and what type of progestin to use; but they did not specifically examine compliance or the safety and efficacy of continuous OCPs in adolescents. We plan to evaluate these issues in our study.</detailed_description>
