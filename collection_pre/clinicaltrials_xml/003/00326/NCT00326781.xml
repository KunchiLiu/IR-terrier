	<brief_title>Bio-Behavioral Predictors of the Efficacy of Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The ultimate objective is to obtain information necessary to match NRT to those smokers with the greatest need and likelihood of benefit. The investigators hypothesize that the nicotine nasal spray (NS) will result in significantly higher abstinence rates than transdermal nicotine (TN) for the following subgroups of smokers: those with genotypes associated with less transmission of dopamine or serotonin, or greater metabolism of nicotine; and those with higher levels of novelty-seeking, depression, and attention deficit symptoms.</detailed_description>
