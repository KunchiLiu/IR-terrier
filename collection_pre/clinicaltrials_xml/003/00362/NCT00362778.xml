	<brief_summary>Hyperglycemia at admission has been associated with bad prognosis in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The clinical benefit of intensive treatment with insulin has been evaluated in diabetic patients admitted to intensive care units. The aim of our study was to assess the short-term effects and the safety of strict glycemic control in subjects with AMI and hyperglycemia without a previous history of diabetes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intensive Insulin Therapy in Non-diabetic Patients With Acute Myocardial Infarction and Hyperglycaemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Twenty-eight non-previously diabetic patients admitted with AMI and hyperglycemia were randomized to two treatment arms, administered during the first 48 hours: the intensive group (n=13) received intravenous insulin with target glycemia levels of 80-110mg/dL, while the conventional group (n=15) received subcutaneous insulin only when glycemia was Â³ 160mg/dL. High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (HS-CRP) was determined at 48 hours and before discharge and an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed at 1 month.</detailed_description>
