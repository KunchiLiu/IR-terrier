	<criteria>1. The patients who have completed LFMAU301, LFMAU302 or LFMAU303. 2. Patients who have showed complete response (ALT normalization and HBV DNA &lt;4,700 copies/mL in LFMAU301 or LFMAU302, in addition, HBeAg seroconverted to antiHBe at the last two visits in LFMAU301) after completion of LFMAU301 or LFMAU302 and treated with the clevudine. 3. Patients who have showed complete response (ALT normalization and HBV DNA &lt;4,700 copies/mL, in addition HBeAg seroconverted to antiHBe at the last two visits who showed HBeAg positiv at baseline) after completion of LFMAU303 4. Patients who were able to give written informed consent prior to study start and to comply with the study requirements. 5. Patients with bilirubin levels less than 2.0 mg/dL, prothrombin time of less than 1.7 (INR), and a serum albumin level of at least 3.5 g/dL at the last visit in LFMAU301, LFMAU302 or LFMAU303. 1. Patients who have showed complete response but previously treated with placebo in the LFMAU301, LFMAU302. 2. Patients who were currently receiving antiviral, immunomodulatory or corticosteroid therapy. 3. Patients previously treated with interferon, lamivudine, lobucavir, famciclovir, adefovir or any other investigational nucleoside for HBV infection. 4. Patients with a history of ascites, variceal hemorrhage or hepatic encephalopathy. 5. Patients coinfected with HCV, HDV or HIV. 6. Patients with a liver mass (hemangioma, nodule), biliary diseases except asymptomatic GB stone during the LFMAU301, LFMAU302 or LFMAU303. 7. Patients who were pregnant or breastfeeding. 8. Patients with a significant gastrointestinal, renal, hepatic (decompensated), biliary diseases except asymptomatic GB stone, bronchopulmonary, neurological, cardiovascular, oncologic or allergic disease. The patients with a benign tumor were excluded if judged by an investigator that the continuation of study would be interfered by benign tumor. 9. Patients who were not suitable to the study if judged by an investigator.</criteria>
