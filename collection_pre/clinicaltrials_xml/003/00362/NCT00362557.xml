	<brief_summary>Any patient already receiving a scheduled MR scan of the body for any clinical indication will be eligible for this program. If patients agree to participate in this program, it would require only a slightly longer examination time. This time would vary according to the body area/organ being visualized but would not exceed 30 minutes over the length of the clinical examination. Volunteers are eligible if they are willing to undergo an MR examination. Patients would not be required to make any additional visits beyond their clinically-indicated visits. The study duration would vary according to the body area/organ visualized but would not exceed 30 minutes over the length of the clinical examination. Volunteers would be required to keep one study appointment to include one MR imaging examination. There will be no interruption to the standard care given to patients who participate in this trial since the clinical portion of their examination will be completed prior to the study portion of the exam.</brief_summary>
