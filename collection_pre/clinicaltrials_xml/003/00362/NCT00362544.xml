	<brief_summary>This pilot study was designed in order to evaluate the safety and efficacy of an AmBisome loading dose regimen, in a weekly administration schedule, during the aplastic phase following induction or consolidation chemotherapy for acute leukaemia, and during the initial phase of allogeneic stem-cell transplant, which are both high risk periods as far as severe fungal infections development is concerned.</brief_summary>
