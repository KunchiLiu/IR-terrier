	<brief_summary>This is a research study where researchers are collecting blood to evaluate the genetic characteristics of individuals with chronic lung diseases, including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), interstitial lung disease, cystic fibrosis, and lung cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Blood Collection From Individuals With Lung Disease for Genetic Studies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators hope to be able to identify an association between a genetic make-up in the blood samples and the risks of developing a particular lung disease, or severity of a lung disease. The findings of this study might be important to develop future preventative methods and potential treatments for the management of lung disease. The investigators aim to collect blood samples from 300 people with lung disease and 300 controls over 5 years.</detailed_description>
