	<brief_summary>This trial is studying two different schedules of docetaxel and bortezomib to compare how well they work in treating patients with progressive or recurrent non-small cell lung cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as docetaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Bortezomib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving docetaxel together with bortezomib may kill more tumor cells</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Docetaxel and Bortezomib in Treating Patients With Progressive or Recurrent Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: I. To compare the efficacy and tolerability of sequential vs concurrent docetaxel and bortezomib in patients with previously treated, progressive or recurrent, advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). SECOND OBJECTIVES: I. To compare time to progression in patients with previously treated NSCLC treated with these regimens. II. To compare 1-year and overall survival of patients treated with these regimens. III. To compare the toxicity of these regimens in these patients. IV. To determine the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel in the context of this study. TERTIARY OBJECTIVE: I. To determine levels of expression of molecular markers regulated by docetaxel and bortezomib and correlate with clinical response and overall survival of these patients. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to ECOG performance status (0 vs 1) and number of prior chemotherapy treatments (1 vs &gt;1). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. ARM I: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 60 minutes on day 1 and bortezomib IV over 3-5 seconds on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. ARM II: Patients receive docetaxel as in arm I and bortezomib IV over 3-5 seconds on days 2 and 8. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Criteria: No other prior malignancy except adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, in situ cervical cancer, adequately treated stage I or II cancer for which the patient is currently in complete remission, or any other cancer for which the patient has been diseasefree for 5 years. Histologically or cytologically confirmed nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Progressive or recurrent NSCLC after treatment with 1 prior platinumbased chemotherapy regimen for metastatic disease. Prior neoadjuvant/adjuvant chemotherapy and/or concurrent chemoradiation for earlystage disease allowed. At least 4 weeks since prior chemotherapy (6 weeks for mitomycin C or nitrosoureas) and recovered. No prior docetaxel or bortezomib Prior epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor therapy allowed. Prior paclitaxel allowed At least 4 weeks since prior major surgery and recovered. At least 2 weeks since prior and no concurrent enzymeinducing anticonvulsants. No concurrent hormonal therapy, biologic therapy, or radiotherapy to measurable lesions. Concurrent palliative radiotherapy to smallfield nonindicator lesions (e.g., painful bony metastases) allowed. Measurable disease* with &gt;= 1 unidimensionally objectively measurable lesion, including any of the following: Lung mass (measurable on chest xray, tomograms, or CT scan) Enlarged lymph nodes Liver metastasis (measurable as a discrete focal lesion on radionuclide or CT scan, or ultrasound) Metastatic abdominal mass (measurable on CT scan with &gt;= 1 perpendicular diameter ≥ the distance between cuts) Measurable disease must be outside the previous radiation field or a new lesion must be present. Life expectancy &gt;= 12 weeks Progressive disease within a previously radiated field allowed. [Note: *Measurable disease DOES NOT include bone metastases or nonfocal liver metastases]. No symptomatic or untreated brain metastasis requiring steroids. Asymptomatic, previously treated (surgical resection or radiotherapy) brain metastasis allowed provided they are neurologically stable and &gt;= 4 weeks since prior steroids.
