	<brief_title>Beta-hCG + Erythropoietin in Acute Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with a new stroke will be evaluated at the University of California Irvine Medical Center (UCIMC), a JCAHO-certified Stroke Center, and at Hoag Memorial Hospital Presbyterian. Standard stroke pathways will be used to identify such patients and to initiate standard of care therapy. Patients potentially eligible for study enrollment will be identified, screened, then consented and enrolled. Those meeting all entry criteria, and no exclusion criteria, will undergo additional baseline testing including brain MRI. A 9-day course of B-E therapy will then begin, always within 48 hours after stroke onset. This therapy will consist of hCG (3 once-daily IM doses at 10,000 IU per dose, one day apart, on days 1, 3 and 5 of study participation), followed by a one day washout period (day 6), followed by Epo (three once-daily i.v. doses at 30,000 IU per dose on days 7, 8, and 9 of study participation). Patients will be examined at several time points during therapy, as well as 6 weeks and 3 months after stroke onset. The primary outcome measures are related to safety, while secondary outcome measures are related to disability, neurological status, and MRI measures.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Age 2185 2. NIHSS score 624 at time of enrollment, ensuring that stroke is neither mild nor devastating 3. Stroke is ischemic in origin, supratentorial, and radiologically confirmed 4. Patient is 2448 hours from time of stroke onset at time that first dose of BE therapy is administered. Time of onset is when symptoms began, and stroke occurred during sleep, time of onset is when patient was last seen to be normal. 5. Reasonable expectation of availability to receive the full 9 day BE therapy course 6. Reasonable expectation that patient will receive standard poststroke physical, occupational, speech, and cognitive therapy as indicated 1. Preexisting and active major psychiatric or other neurological disease 2. History of significant alcohol or drug abuse in the prior 3 years 3. Serum hemoglobin &gt; 16 g/dL in a male patient or &gt; 14 g/dL in a female patient; or a platelet count &gt; 400,000/mm3 in either a male or female patient 4. Advanced liver, kidney, cardiac, or pulmonary disease; the former will be operationally defined as a serum bilirubin &gt; 4 mg/dL, alkaline phosphatase &gt; 250 U/L, SGOT &gt; 150 U/L, SGPT &gt;150 U/L, or creatinine &gt; 3.5 mg/dL 5. Pregnancy or lactating; note that a negative pregnancy test will be required if the patient is a female in reproductive years, using a test that reliably detects betahCG levels &gt; 25 with normal levels being &lt; 8 IU/L. 6. Contraindication to study participation on the basis of any of the following: 1. Allergy or other contraindication to initiating either betahCG or Erythropoietin 2. Known hypersensitivity to mammalian cellderived products or hypersensitivity to albumin 3. A known diagnosis of prostatic cancer; note that prostate specific antigen will be collected for retrospective assessment of safety, but will not be used to ascertain study eligibility 4. Dysuria of unexplained origin 5. Uncontrolled hypertension, defined in the context of acute stroke as blood pressure persistently above 220 mm Hg systolic or 120 diastolic despite antihypertensive therapy 7. Current use of either betahCG or Erythropoietin 8. Other condition known to elevate betahCG, active in the prior 24 months, e.g., choriocarcinoma or germ cell tumor 9. Terminal medical diagnosis consistent with survival &lt; 1 year 10. Known hypercoagulable state, which for the purposes of this study will deficiency of proteins C, S, or antithrombin III; activated protein C resistance; prothrombin gene mutation; or an antiphospholipid antibody syndrome as based on clinical and laboratory measures.</criteria>
