	<brief_summary>There are no therapeutic products on the market for celiac disease today. Current treatment is limited to gluten free foods and a gluten-free diet. The main purpose of this study is to test how safe, efficacious and tolerable the study drug AT1001 is in subjects with diagnosed celiac disease. A second purpose is to study how your body responds to the drug when you ingest gluten. This response is determined by testing your urine, and by capturing your daily and weekly gastrointestinal symptoms associated with celiac disease.</brief_summary>
