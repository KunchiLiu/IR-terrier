	<brief_summary>Mixed or combined hyperlipidemia is a common metabolic disorder characterized by both hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia. Statins and fibrates have complementary mechanisms and can be coadministered to patients with mixed hyperlipidemia. The overall objective of the study is to compare the efficacy and safety of combining fenofibrate and simvastatin versus atorvastatin monotherapy in patients with mixed hyperlipidemia at risk of cardiovascular diseases.</brief_summary>
