The included patient should have an intraventricular catheter placed for intraventricular pressure measurement and admitted to an intensive care unit. 3. Blood creatinine concentration up to 1.49 mg/dL measured at the inclusion day. 1. Patients or legal guardians who refuse to participate in the study. 2. Known allergy to amikacin. 3. Blood creatinine concentration of 1.5 mg/dL or higher. 4. Subjects without intraventricular catheter who will need repeated lumbar punctures for CSF amikacin determinations. 5.
