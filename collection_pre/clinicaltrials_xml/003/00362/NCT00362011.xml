	<brief_title>Effect of Chia Seeds (Salvia Hispanica L.) on Glucose Control in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cohort studies have linked consumption of whole grain with a reduction in the risk of developing diabetes and heart disease. Grain of the plant Salvia hispanica alba (Salba) contain a high concentration of Ï‰-3 fatty acids in addition to being a rich source of vegetable protein, fiber, calcium and antioxidants which have cardiovascular protective effect. To address the paucity of randomized, well-controlled clinical studies supporting the long-term cardioprotective benefits of whole grain we investigated the effects of a novel grain Salba in type 2 diabetes. Comparison(s): Participants on a conventional diabetes diet (50% carbohydrate, 20% protein, 30% fat) receive either addition of Salba or matched control supplement for 12 weeks separated by a 4-week washout period.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>All men or postmenopausal women with Type 2 diabetes optimally or suboptimally controlled (HbA1C &lt; 9.0%) on oral hypoglycemic agents or diet only were asked to participate. Those receiving insulin, alphaglucosidase inhibitors, or hormone replacement therapy, with BMI&gt;38 kg/m2, smoking or significant alcohol intake (&gt;2 drinks/day), serum TG &gt;4.0 mmol/L, and those with complications of diabetes were excluded. Subjects were also excluded if they regularly took fish oil and flax seed supplements or used steroids. Subjects were excluded during the course of the study if there were any changes to their regular antihypertensive, lipid, or oral hypoglycemic medications, if unable to consume &gt;50% of supplements provided, had a significant weight change (defined as &gt;2.5 kg), or if their level of physical activity did not remain constant over the course of the study.</criteria>
