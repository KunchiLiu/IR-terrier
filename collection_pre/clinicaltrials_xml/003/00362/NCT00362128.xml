	<brief_title>Cardiovascular Disease Risk Factors in Chinese American Immigrants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CVD includes diseases that affect the heart and blood vessels. The underlying cause of CVD is atherosclerosis, in which fatty plaques develop on the inner walls of arteries. There are many risk factors for CVD, including inflammation, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and obesity. Research has shown that CVD mortality rates differ greatly between Chinese immigrants living in NYC and individuals living in China. Because of this difference, it is important to understand the impact of immigration and acculturation on health habits and psychosocial factors, which may influence the development of CVD. This study will gather information from Chinese immigrants in NYC to identify the impact of immigration and acculturation on behavior and CVD risk factors. In addition, results from this study may provide insight into the CVD risk patterns in other immigrant groups. This study will enroll Chinese immigrants living in NYC. Participants will attend one study visit and will complete questionnaires to assess their health habits (diet, physical activity, and smoking), stress levels, and socioeconomic status. Participants will also undergo a physical examination and blood collection.</detailed_description>
