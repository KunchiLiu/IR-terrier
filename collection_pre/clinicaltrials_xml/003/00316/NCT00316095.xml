	<brief_summary>This study will investigate two registered drugs, one for the treatment of high blood pressure and one for the treatment of elevated cholesterol. High blood pressure (hypertension) is a common medical condition affecting millions of people worldwide. A wide variety of effective drug treatments is available to reduce blood pressure. Elevated cholesterol (hypercholesterolemia) is a common medical condition affecting people worldwide. A wide variety of effective drug treatments is available to reduce cholesterol levels. Hypertension and hypercholesterolemia often occur together. They are both important risk factors for the development of heart and vessel diseases (e.g. heart attack or stroke). Current guidelines advise treatment of high blood pressure and elevated cholesterol to reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases. This study will test the simultaneous use of a drug to reduce blood pressure and a drug to reduce elevated cholesterol. Both drugs are registered and are effective. The drug for treatment of high blood pressure is telmisartan Micardis). The drug for treatment of elevated cholesterol is simvastatin (Zocor). Since hypertension and hypercholesterolemia frequently occur together, the purpose of this study is to investigate whether both drugs can be used simultaneously. A low dose and a high dose of these drugs will be used. It will be investigated whether each of the drugs is still as effective when given together, at the same time of day, with the other drug.</brief_summary>
