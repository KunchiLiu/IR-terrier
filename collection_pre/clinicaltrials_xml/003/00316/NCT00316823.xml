	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Finding genetic markers for thyroid cancer in a biopsy specimen may help doctors diagnose thyroid cancer. PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well genetic analysis works in diagnosing thyroid cancer in patients with thyroid nodules.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Genetic Analysis in Diagnosing Thyroid Cancer in Patients With Thyroid Nodules</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of biomarkers and mRNA expression analysis using fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy samples from patients with thyroid nodules. - Correlate the level of gene expression with the aggressiveness of differentiated thyroid cancer in FNA biopsy samples. OUTLINE: Patients undergo fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy as part of routine care. Additional thyroid tissue is collected during the biopsy for gene expression analysis. Patients who have already had a biopsy undergo FNA biopsy during thyroidectomy. Tissue samples will be examined for gene expression by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (PCR), real-time quantitative PCR, and immunohistochemistry. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 400 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
