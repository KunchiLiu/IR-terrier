	<brief_summary>This randomized phase III study compares safety and efficacy of two sequence arms in advanced colorectal cancer: irinotecan and S-1 (IRIS) followed by oxaliplatin containing regimen (arm A), or l-leucovorin (l-LV), 5-FU and oxaliplatin (mFOLFOX6) followed by irinotecan containing regimen (arm B).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>IRIS Followed by mFOLFOX6 or the Reverse Sequence in Advanced Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A multicenter randomized open-label controlled phase III study is conducted in patients with inoperable advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer who receive no previous chemotherapy. Usefulness of IRIS and mFOLFOX6 regimens as the 1st-line therapy for colorectal cancer is evaluated in PFS, MST, incidence and severity of adverse events</detailed_description>
