	<brief_summary>A trial to characterize the immunogenicity of 2 different formulations of a vaccine from GSK Biologicals, including the following five antigens: diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B and Haemophilus influenzae type b. A vaccine from Commonwealth Serum Laboratories (diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis) which is co-administered with Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine will also be used as a comparator. Reactogenicity and safety of all vaccines will be assessed as well.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Immuno &amp; Safety Study With 2 Formulations of DTPw-HBV/HIB When Given at Birth With Hepatitis B at 2, 4 and 6 Mths.Age.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>"The study will be carried out in a partially double blind manner (i.e. double blind with respect to DTPwGöd-HBV/Hib Kft and DTPwCSL-HBV/Hib Kft groups and open with respect to CSL's Triple Antigen &amp; Hib group). Subjects will be randomly allocated to one of the three following groups to receive: - GSK Biologicals Kft's combined DTPwGöd-HBV/Hib Kft vaccine. - GSK Biologicals Kft's combined DTPwCSL-HBV/Hib Kft vaccine. - CSL's Triple Antigen + GSK Biologicals' Hib vaccines. There will be a specific follow-up of solicited local and general symptoms during 4 days after each vaccination and of unsolicited symptoms for 31 days after each vaccination. Serious adverse events reported during the study period will be recorded.</detailed_description>
