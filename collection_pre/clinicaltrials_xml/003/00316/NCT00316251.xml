	<detailed_description>Acute and chronic equilibrium disorders result in over five million patient visits per year in the United States with unknown additional individuals not seeking care. Symptoms of dizziness, vertigo, and lack of balance are among the most common symptoms reported to physicians. Equilibrium disorders not exclusively due to visual or vestibular conditions are typically due to problems in proprioception. Proprioception is the specialized sensory modality that informs the body as to movement, position, and spatial orientation through mechanisms that track sensations accompanying joint movement and position. Mechanoreceptors in joints, along with vestibular, visual, muscle spindle, Golgi tendon organ, ligament and tendon sensory receptors, comprise the propriosensory system, which conveys information to the motor system to maintain equilibrium on a reflexive, automatic basis. Alterations in somatosensory input from mechanoreceptors have been identified as causing aberrant muscle firing patterns. The NeuroCom Balance Master is an FDA approved device designed to both measure and treat balance problems and evaluate the neuromuscular control by quantifying the ability to maintain dynamic postural stability. The NeuroCom Unit is a microprocessor controlled balance unit that provides quantitative data regarding the patient’s ability to control the platform. This unit is widely used throughout the country in both university and clinical settings to help patients restore their balance.</detailed_description>
