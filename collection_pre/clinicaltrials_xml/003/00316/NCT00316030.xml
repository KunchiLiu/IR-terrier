	<brief_summary>Bexarotene may be useful in the treatment of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). This is the first study on the use of bexarotene to treat patients with AML. The main purpose of this study is to establish the proper dose of bexarotene when used to treat AML. The side effect profile of bexarotene in patients with AML will also be explored.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Bexarotene in Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite recent advances in cancer treatment, the prognosis is still poor for patients with relapsed or chemotherapy resistant AML. Further aggressive chemotherapy can be attempted, but generally yields poor results. This clinical study is the first use of bexarotene in the treatment of patient with relapsed or chemotherapy resistant AML. The main purpose of the study is to identify the maximum safe dose of bexarotene in patient with AML. Another objective of the study is to explore the side effect profile of bexarotene in AML patients. The study is organized so that the initial patients will get a low dose of bexarotene to be taken daily. If these patients tolerate the drug, then later patients will get higher daily doses. Further groups of patients will continue to increase their dose of bexarotene until a maximum tolerated dose is identified. The stu dy will end at that point. Patients will take the drug daily by mouth until such a time that their AML is worsening or they are experiencing unacceptable side effects. Their participating will end at that point.</detailed_description>
