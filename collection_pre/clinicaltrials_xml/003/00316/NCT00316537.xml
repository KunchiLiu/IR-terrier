	<brief_title>Safety and Preliminary Efficacy Study of Nicotine Gel to Treat Diabetic Foot Ulcers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This pilot study will be the first time that nicotine will be applied directly onto the surface of chronic diabetic ulcer. The goals of the study are to evaluate safety and tolerability (particularly at the wound site) of a gel formulation containing low-dose nicotine, and to obtain preliminary information on its effects on accelerating wound closure. The study will be carried out on a background of conventional wound therapy in patients with Type II diabetes mellitus. Patients will be randomized to receive either study medication (ATG002), vehicle gel, or standard-of-care.</detailed_description>
