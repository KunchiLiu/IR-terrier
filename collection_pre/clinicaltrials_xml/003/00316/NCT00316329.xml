	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: - To demonstrate the non-inferiority, in terms of clinical and parasitological efficacy on D28 of administration of Coarsucam™ (artesunate+amodiaquine fixed-dose combination), as a single daily dose, in comparison with administration of Coartem® (artemether+lumefantrine). Secondary Objectives: To compare the 3 treatment groups in terms of: - clinical and parasitological efficacy on D14 and D28 on the global population and on the subpopulation consisting of children aged under 5 years and that for patients aged 5 years and over - clinical and laboratory safety - time to parasite clearance - time to clearance of fever - changes in gametocytaemia - impact on anaemia</brief_summary>
