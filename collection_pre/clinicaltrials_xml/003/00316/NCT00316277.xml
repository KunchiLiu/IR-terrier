	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether treatment outcome for subjects dependent on prescription opioid analgesics can be improved by adding individual drug counseling to the prescription of buprenorphine/naloxone with standard medical management. This will be examined during: a) an initial four-week treatment with taper; b) a 12-week stabilization treatment for those who do not respond successfully to the initial treatment; and c) a long-term follow-up assessment at 1.5 years, 2.5 years, and 3.5 years after treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prescription Opioid Addiction Treatment Study (POATS)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized 2-phase, open-label; multi-center study conducted in outpatient treatment settings. The main objective of this study is to identify an effective sublingual buprenorphine/naloxone treatment regimen for subjects dependent on prescription opioids. Phase 1 of this study will assess the prevailing one-month detoxification practice. This phase will assess the benefits of individual drug counseling in a short-term treatment paradigm. The second phase of this study will assess the benefit of individual drug counseling in a longer-term treatment paradigm for participants who did not respond successfully to the short-term buprenorphine/naloxone treatment. There is also a long-term follow-up assessment to determine outcomes at 1.5 years, 2.5 years, and 3.5 years after treatment.</detailed_description>
