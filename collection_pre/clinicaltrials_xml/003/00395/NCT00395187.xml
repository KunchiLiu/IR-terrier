	<brief_summary>This study will investigate the efficacy of Photodynamic Therapy (PDT), which is the therapeutic use of photochemical reactions, in treating hidradenitis suppurativa (HS), a chronic inflammatory condition affecting areas of skin with sweat glands. We expect that PDT is effective in treating HS.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Small Clinical Study: Photodynamic Therapy to Treat Hidradenitis Suppurativa</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will investigate the efficacy of PDT using aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and either blue light or intense pulsed light on active lesions of HS. We will attempt to validate the success noted in a previously published case series using PDT with ALA and blue light (Gold, Bridges et al). We will evaluate effect of treatment by number of lesions, global disease severity, and patient self-assessment with the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI). Detailed informed consent will be obtained prior to treatment at study enrollment. The first four treatment visits will involve clinical evaluation, photography and application of the ALA to the affected area. After a 45 minute incubation period, the area will be washed and then treated with either blue light or intense pulsed light (IPL), depending on body area/investigator choice. One and three-month follow-up visits will involve evaluation of efficacy, but no active treatment. Gold M, Bridges TM, et al. ALA-PDT and blue light therapy for hidradenitis suppurative.
