	<brief_summary>High levels of good cholesterol (HDL) in our blood decreases our chance of having a heart attack. This relates in part to the role good cholesterol plays in reducing build up of fat in the arteries. However, good cholesterol has many other protective effects. We have recently identified three enzymes (proteins) activated by HDL in cells lining the blood vessels, which may be responsible for some of HDL's protective actions.</brief_summary>
