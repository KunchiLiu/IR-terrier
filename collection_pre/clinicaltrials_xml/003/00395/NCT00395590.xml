	<brief_summary>Obstructive sleep apnea is a common sleep disorder. It is known to be related with increased body mass, abdominal obesity, insulin resistance and hypertension. It is currently believed to be a feature of the metabolic syndrome. Other features of the metabolic syndrome-such as insulin resistace were found related to inflammation and inflammatory cytokines. Several polymorphisms in the genes that encode interleukin 6,inteleukin 10 and TNF-alpha have significant influence on the amounts of cytokine production. we thus hypothesize that polymorphisms related to increased pruduction are more common in subjects with OSA than in matched controls</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients attending a sleep apnea clinic for evluation will be recruited. Patients found positive for OSA will be compared to the patients with a negative study for OSA for the prevalence of polymorphisms in genes of inflammatory cytokines and cytokine levels</detailed_description>
