	<brief_summary>Rosacea is a common chronic dermatological condition, characterized by recurrent or persistent redness, permanent dilation of small blood vessel causing small red lesions, and papules/pustules. The signs of rosacea are usually confined to the face, but may appear on the neck, scalp or trunk. Opthalmologic findings are also common. Rosacea is usually described as being most common in fair skinned women over 40. The purpose of the study is to determine whether oral Zinc Sulfate treatment is an effective treatment for facial rosacea.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Zinc Sulfate in the Treatment of Rosacea: A Randomized, Controlled Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rosacea is a common chronic dermatological condition. The epidemiology of rosacea has not been determined extensively, due to part in problems with case definition. Rosacea is usually described as being most common in fair skinned women over the age of 40. However it occurs in most adult populations, including both men and women of all ages, and in people of many complexion types, including African Americans and Asians. Although rosacea is encountered frequently in primary care and dermatology practices, its precise incidence and prevalence are not known. The etiology and pathogenesis of rosacea are unknown. Both genetic and environmental factors are thought to be important. A wide range of medical and surgical interventions have been used in the management of rosacea, including dietary management, topical and systemic antibiotics, azelaic acid, low dose isotretinoin, and laser treatments for telangiectasia and rhinophyma. No single regimen has been found to be entirely satisfactory. Zinc has been found to be effective in managing several dermatological conditions, especially acne. It has also been found to be of benefit in dermatological conditions such as viral warts and cutaneous leishmaniasis. No studies have been published on the use of Zinc in the treatment of rosacea. This will be a prospective, double blind, randomized, controlled trial, comparing the effects of supplemental and placebo on the severity of rosacea. Enrolled subjects will be assigned to one of two study arms. Subjects and investigators will be blinded regarding treatment. After evaluation, meeting the study criteria,obtaining informed consent, and initiating study related procedures, the subject will take oral study drug or placebo, bid, for 90 days. Subjects are followed via phone call at one week and 6 weeks after enrollment into the study. At the conclusion of the 90 day study, subjects will be re-examined. The primary endpoint of this study will be the severity of rosacea at the end of the 90 day intervention period. The efficacy of Zinc vs. placebo will be assessed by a comparison of the change in the severity of rosacea.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Diagnosis of facial rosacea made or confirmed by one of the investigators. Severity of signs of rosacea "greater than mild" at the time of enrollment. Treatment for rosacea during the 3 months prior to enrollment. Use of zinc dietary supplement &gt; 25 mg per day during the 3 months prior to enrollment ( Most patients taking multivitamins with Zinc, often 15 mg per day, will not be excluded, whereas most patients taking additional Zinc supplements, often 2550 mg per day or more will be excluded.)
