	<brief_title>Efficacy of Lifestyle Changes in Modifying Practical Markers of Wellness and Aging.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A 10-week, randomized control study conducted in a wellness center in St. Petersburg, Florida. Adults age 21-65, exercising less than 3 days/week. 56 subjects were randomized to a control or an intervention group. Subjects followed a diet with &gt;30 grams of fiber and &lt;16 grams of saturated fat daily, and were taught to reach 70-85% of their maximum heart rate 5-6 days/week, and to perform strength training 3 days/week, plus were asked to participate in 10-20 minutes of stress management activities daily. The study was designed to determine body composition, maximal aerobic capacity (VO2 max), total cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein (TC/HDL), and cognition. Specific aspects ofcognitive performance were noted to increase with increasing levels of aerobic activity, but not with strength training, dietary fiber change, or stress managment. Having established that the treatment group would exercise at different levels of intensity, additional subjects were recruited, and the cognitive performance of no exercise, moderate aerobic exercise, and frequent aerobic exercise could be compared with specific domains of cognitive performance: memory, psychomotor speed, reaction time, attention, and cognitive flexibility. The St Anthonyâ€™s Institutional Review Board approved this research project.</detailed_description>
