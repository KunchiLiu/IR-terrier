	<brief_summary>This is an open-label, non-randomized Phase II study to evaluate immunochemotherapy in patients with R0 OR R1-resected pancreatic cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy Therapy of Gemcitabine and Erbitux® to R0 or R1 Resected Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Available study data indicated a possible benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with resected pancreatic cancer. The optimal therapy regimen has yet to be determined. Based on the experiences with cetuximab (Erbitux®)and gemcitabine in advanced pancreatic cancer and with gemcitabine as adjuvant therapy, the aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of the combined treatment of cetuximab and gemcitabine in patients with R0 or R1-resectable pancreatic cancer and to evaluate if the disease free survival can be increased by the addition of an EGFR-targeted therapy.</detailed_description>
