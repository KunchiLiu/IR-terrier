	<brief_summary>To compare the safety and efficacy of Allovectin-7® versus Dacarbazine (DTIC)or Temozolomide (TMZ) in subjects with recurrent stage 3 or stage 4 melanoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase 3 Pivotal Trial Comparing Allovectin-7® Alone vs Chemotherapy Alone in Patients With Stage 3 or Stage 4 Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Eligible patients will have a 66% chance of receiving Allovectin-7® alone (an investigational product designed to train your body's immune system to recognize and destroy tumor cells) vs. a 33% chance of receiving standard chemotherapy (either dacarbazine or temozolomide). The treatment course recommended for patients who receive Allovectin-7® is a minimum of 16 weeks. Each cycle will consist of weekly injections of Allovectin-7® alone for six weeks followed by two weeks of observation and assessments. For patients who receive the chemotherapy alone, their treatment course will follow standard dosing. During the trial all patients' tumors will be closely monitored. Patients whose melanoma does not clinically progress will be encouraged to continue on the treatment and be assessed for up to two years.</detailed_description>
