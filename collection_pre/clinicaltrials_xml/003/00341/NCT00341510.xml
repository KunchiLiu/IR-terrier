	<brief_summary>This study is a survey (Health Behaviors in School-age Children) sponsored by the World Health Organization to gather information about nutrition, dieting practices, physical activity, injuries, violence, relationships with family and friends, perceptions of school as a supportive environment, alcohol and tobacco use and drug use among adolescents, and about the communities in which students live. The U.S. sponsors of the survey are the National Institutes of Health and the Health Resources and Services Administration. The objectives of the international HBSC study are: - To assess the prevalence of early adolescent health behaviors - To identify psychosocial factors associated with adolescent behaviors - To provide an opportunity for analyses of cross-national comparisons - To provide an opportunity for analyses of trends in the U.S. and cross-nationally In addition to the above, the survey includes additional questions designed to provide information about areas of specific national interest, including the following: - To assess the association of school, family, peers, and other environmental factors on health behavior and health status - To assess the prevalence and identify factors associated with diet and physical activity - To assess the prevalence and identify factors associated with bullying and risk behaviors. This is the third U.S. administration of the HBSC survey, previously administered in 1997-1998 and 2001-2002. U.S. participants in the survey include about 15,000 students from 350 schools selected to take part across the country. In each school, one or two classes (about 25 students) in each grade 6 through 10 are picked randomly to participate. In one class period, the students complete the written survey, which has 80 multiple choice questions. Students do not put their name on the survey. When they finish the survey, the place it in an envelope and seal it shut. The envelopes are then put in a box. Reports will not include the names of participating counties, cities, school districts, schools, or students. The information collected from U.S. school children is compared with similar information collected from school children in 36 other countries. The survey is used to help set national priorities for school and youth programs, as well as to monitor the progress of these programs.</brief_summary>
