	<brief_summary>The Viral Epidemiology Branch (VEB) of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) conducts research on viral infections and their associations with various diseases including AIDS and cancer. For some research questions, specimens are available from "case" subjects as part of ongoing protocols but are not available from normal "control" subjects (i.e., those without the infection or disease under study) to whom the case subjects can be compared. This protocol is to obtain routine specimens (usually peripheral venous blood, occasionally other body fluid such as saliva, urine, or tears) from healthy volunteers.</brief_summary>
