	<brief_summary>By the end of 1999, it was estimated that 1.2 million children were living with HIV infection. During 1999 alone, 600,000 children were newly infected with HIV, mostly in less-developed countries. Most HIV-infected children are infected by transmission from mother to child during pregnancy, at birth, or through breast milk. Antiretroviral medications, cesarean section before rupture of membranes, and avoidance of breastfeeding are ways to reduce the risk of transmission. This study will determine mother-to-child transmission rates and the effects on infants of exposure to antiretroviral medications and mode of delivery. Approximately 180 to 240 HIV-infected pregnant women in Mexico and Argentina will be enrolled during the first year of this 5-year study. HIV-infected women will be evaluated during pregnancy, during delivery, and 6 months after delivery. At each visit, a history will be taken and physical examination given; blood will be collected for laboratory tests. HIV-exposed infants will be evaluated through 6 months of age. At each of 2 visits, a history will be taken and physical examination given; blood will be collected for laboratory tests; and growth will be assessed.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Prospective, Observational Study of HIV-Infected Pregnant Women and Their Infants at Clinical Sites in Latin American and Caribbean Countries</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prospective cohort study to describe the characteristics of HIV-infected pregnant women and HIV-exposed, uninfected children followed at participating Latin American sites, and to characterize adverse events during pregnancy and the postpartum period (HIV-infected women) and during childhood (HIV-exposed, uninfected children) according to receipt of/exposure to antiretroviral drug(s) . The study population is comprised of HIV-infected pregnant women and HIV-exposed infants/children. HIV-infected Women: The study enrolled HIV-infected pregnant women receiving medical care at participating clinical sites who: 1) plan to deliver at the clinical site; and 2) plan to continue postpartum and routine medical care for up to 5 years at the clinical site or associated outpatient facility. The Pediatric Cohort consists of HIV-exposed, uninfected children born to enrolled HIV-infected women. They were followed for up to 5 years. (HIV-exposed children ultimately determined to be HIV-infected were offered enrollment in a separate study, if eligible.) In addition, the NISDI study is using data from a locally conducted, single-site maternal-child health cohort study in Brazil (enrolled HIV-uninfected pregnant women and their HIV-unexposed infants) for NISDI analyses that benefit from making comparisons to healthy controls</detailed_description>
