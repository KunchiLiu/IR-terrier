	<criteria>Patients with AMD related lesions: Newly diagnosed (up to 6 months) nontreated CNV patients secondary to AMD in the study eye, or GA patients or Early and Intermediate AMD patients. Age Â³ 50 for AMD patients VA with habitual correction in study eye 6/60 or better Mental and physical ability to perform a PHP/HPHP test Subject able and willing to sign consent form and participate in study Subject is not participating in another study when conducting the test Evidence of macular disease other than AMD or Glaucoma in the study eye. Presence of any significant media opacity that precludes a clear view of the macular area as identified by biomicroscopy, fundus photography, or fluorescein angiography in the study eye Any nonmacular related ocular surgery performed within 3 months prior to the study in the study eye CNV patient inability to tolerate intravenous fluorescein angiography</criteria>
