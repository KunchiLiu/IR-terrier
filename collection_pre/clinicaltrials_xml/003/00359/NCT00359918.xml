	<brief_summary>Prehospital initiated facilitation of primary percutaneous coronary intervention by fibrinolysis might be helpful in re-opening the infarct related artery prior to percutaneous coronary intervention. This studies tests the hypothesis that prehospital initiated facilitated PCI is superior to primary percutaneous coronary intervention with respect to infarct size.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomized Multicenter Trial of Prehospital Initiated Facilitated Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) Versus Primary PCI in ST-segment-Elevation MI (STEMI)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with STEMI with symptoms &lt; 3 hours are randomized in the region of Leipzig to either prehospital full-dose fibrinolysis (+ASA, Clopidogrel and heparin) with subsequent facilitated percutaneous coronary intervention or to primary percutaneous coronary intervention (after ASA + heparin + clopidogrel). Patients undergo cardiac magnetic resonance for assessment of infarct size early at day 1-4 after randomization.</detailed_description>
