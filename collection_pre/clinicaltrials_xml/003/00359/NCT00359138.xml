	<brief_summary>This is a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, single center study in subjects with positive histamine skin prick test and a positive RadioAllergoSorbent Test (RAST) (class &gt; 2) to one of the tested standardized allergenic extracts: tree pollen, cat dander, house dust mite, or a mixture of five grass pollens. Subjects will be randomized to desloratadine 5 mg once daily, levocetirizine 5mg once daily, or placebo once daily for 8 days of treatment followed by 11 days of skin testing after discontinuation of the antihistamine treatment phase. The duration of the suppressive effects of desloratadine on cutaneous allergen-induced wheal and flare responses after discontinuation of a one-week treatment will be established.</brief_summary>
