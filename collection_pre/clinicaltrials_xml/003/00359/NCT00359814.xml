	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to improve or save renal function by optimizing the immunosuppressive regimen by reducing the Cyclosporine A dose and the exchange of Azathioprine by Mycophenolatmofetile, which is an effective immunosuppressive agent and will minimize the risk of acute rejection episodes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Exchange of Azathioprine by Mycophenolatmofetile and Cyclosporine A Dose Reduction After Heart Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The decrease of quality of life in patients after heart transplantation in the long-term is determined by an increasing incidence of transplant vasculopathy and by immunosuppression-related side effects.Long-term administration of calcineurin inhibitors is associated with chronic nephrotoxicity.</detailed_description>
