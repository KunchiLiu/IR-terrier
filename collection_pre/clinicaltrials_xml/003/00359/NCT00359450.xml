	<brief_summary>BMS-275183 given orally twice weekly to patients pretreated for locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC will show anti-tumor activity in any of the 3 separate cohorts of the patients enrolled: - Cohort I: Patients previously treated with one taxane containing regimen. - Cohort II: Patients previously treated with a platinum based but non-taxane containing regimen. - Cohort III: Patients previously treated with both a chemotherapy regimen and one EGFR-TKI (epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor) compound. Patients in cohorts I and II should have not been treated with a prior EGFR-TKI compound. Prior treatment with a VEGFR (vascular endothelial growth factor receptor) inhibitor compound is allowed for all the patients provided that the VEGFR inhibitor is not also an EGFR inhibitor.</brief_summary>
