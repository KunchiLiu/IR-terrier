	<brief_summary>To determine if Visudyne photodynamic therapy (low or very low fluence rate) combined with intravitreal injections of bevacizumab (Avastin) compared with bevacizumab alone will, with similar safety and efficacy, delay time to retreatment with bevacizumab after the initial treatment, in subjects with new wet AMD Hypothesis: PDT in combination with Avastin at either the low or very low fluence rate will delay time to retreatment and reduce the average number of treatments required, compared to Avastin alone, but will have a similar safety and efficacy profile.</brief_summary>
