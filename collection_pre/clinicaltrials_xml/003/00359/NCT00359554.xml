	<brief_title>Influenza Vaccination of Nursing Home Workers.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nursing homes will be randomized within each pair in two arms “incentive to vaccinate”, and “do-nothing”. In the arm “incentive to vaccinate”, vaccination campaigns will be carried out with face-to-face interviews of nursing home workers in order to achieve more than 80% of vaccination coverage. In the “do-nothing”, nursing home workers will be vaccinated as usual. The main endpoint criterion is all-cause mortality of residents. Population sets will be all residents who will be present at start of the influenza season (-2 weeks) or who will be admitted during the influenza season (+ 2 weeks). Onset and end of influenza season will be given by regional influenza surveillance system. Secondary criteria are hospitalizations of residents, morbidity of nursing home workers. A cost-effectiveness ratio of influenza vaccination will be calculated.</detailed_description>
