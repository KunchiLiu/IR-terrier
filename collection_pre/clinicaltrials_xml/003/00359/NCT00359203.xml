	<brief_title>ISSUE3: International Study on Syncope of Uncertain Etiology 3</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In asystolic neurally-mediated syncope (NMS) documented by Implantable Loop recorder (ILR), ISSUE-2, an observational trial, showed that pacemaker was effective in reducing the 1-year first syncope recurrence rate from 33% rate before implant (ILR phase 1) to 5% rate after implant (phase 2). Moreover, the control non-asystolic group still continued to have a 41% recurrence rate after the first recurrence of syncope, thus supporting the conclusion that the reduction with pacemaker was due to the beneficial effect of pacemaker itself and not to other factors. However a formal controlled trial is needed to confirm these findings.</detailed_description>
