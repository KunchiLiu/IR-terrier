	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Giving radiation therapy in different ways may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: This randomized clinical trial is studying the side effects and best way to give radiation therapy and to see how well it works in treating patients with invasive breast cancer.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Compare the ratio between post- and pre-treatment plasma transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-β) in women with invasive breast cancer undergoing hypofractionated radiotherapy vs standard-fractionated external-beam radiotherapy. Secondary - Establish longitudinal serum and plasma biorepository for retrospective evaluation of TGF-β and other biomarkers with special relevance to radiation response. - Correlate pre-treatment plasma TGF-β levels with clinical fibrosis development. OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. - Arm I (hypofractionated radiotherapy): Patients undergo external-beam radiotherapy once daily 5 days a week for up to 3.5 weeks (16 fractions total). - Arm II (standard fractionated radiotherapy): Patients undergo radiotherapy as in arm I at a lower dose for up to 5 weeks (25 fractions total). After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 6 months for 2 years and then annually for 3 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 100 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
