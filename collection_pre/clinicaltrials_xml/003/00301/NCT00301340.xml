	<brief_summary>Summers Laboratories has developed a non-pesticide treatment for head lice. Lice Asphyxiator (L.A.) works by mechanically blocking the respiratory spiracles of the head lice, therefore causing a quick-acting suffocation that will not result in the development of resistance. The objectives of this open label study are to evaluate the efficacy and safety of home use of two 10-minute treatments of 5% L.A. (applied one week apart).</brief_summary>
