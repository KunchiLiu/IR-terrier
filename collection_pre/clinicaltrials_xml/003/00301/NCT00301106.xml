	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Biological therapy using a gene-modified virus that can make interleukin-12 may help the body build an effective immune response to kill tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of a gene-modified virus that can make interleukin-12 in treating women with breast cancer that has spread to the liver.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Direct intratumoral injection of metastatic hepatic tumors using an adenoviral vector expressing the human recombinant interleukin-12 gene (Adv.RSV-hIL12, also termed ADV-hIL-12). OBJECTIVES: - Study the toxicity of escalating doses of adenoviral vector expressing the human recombinant interleukin-12 gene, administered by percutaneous intratumoral injection, in women with liver metastasis secondary to breast cancer. - Determine tumor responses produced by this regimen. - Determine immune responses induced by this regimen.</detailed_description>
