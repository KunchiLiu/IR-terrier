	<brief_summary>To determine the efficacy of thalidomide for treatment of the Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndrome (CPPS).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Open-Label Study of Thalidomide for Chronic Prostatitis/Chronic Pelvic Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prostatitis is the most common urologic diagnosis in men under the age of 50 and the third most common diagnosis in older men. In Chronic Prostatitis (CP) or Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndrome (CPPS), men have lower urinary tract symptoms, pelvic pain, sexual dysfunction and decreased quality of life. Little is known about the cause of CP/CPPS and no definitive therapy exists. Thalidomide is an immunomodulator (a drug that alters the immune system) and it may also interfere with the development of tiny blood vessels that help support tumor growth. Therefore, in theory, it may reduce or prevent the growth of cancer cells. Thalidomide is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for a leprosy skin condition, but not for the treatment of CP or CPPS.</detailed_description>
