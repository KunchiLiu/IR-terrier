	<brief_summary>This phase II trial is studying how well sorafenib works in treating patients with kidney cancer that has spread to the brain. Sorafenib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sorafenib in Treating Patients With Kidney Cancer That Has Spread to the Brain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the partial and minor response rate in patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) metastatic to the brain treated with sorafenib. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the toxicity of sorafenib in patients with RCC metastatic to the brain. II. Determine whether the effect of sorafenib on RCC metastatic to the brain is similar to its effect on non-brain metastatic sites. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive oral sorafenib twice daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.</detailed_description>
