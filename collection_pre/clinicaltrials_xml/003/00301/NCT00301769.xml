	<brief_summary>This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of SJG-136 in treating patients with relapsed or refractory acute leukemia, myelodysplastic syndromes, blastic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia, or chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as SJG-136, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>SJG-136 in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Acute Leukemia, Myelodysplastic Syndromes, Blastic Phase Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia, or Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Establish the maximum tolerated dose of SJG-136 in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), chronic myelogenous leukemia in blastic phase (CML-BP), or chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). II. Determine dose-limiting toxicities and pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive SJG-136 IV over 15 minutes on days 1-5. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of SJG-136 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. A total of 10 patients are treated at the MTD.</detailed_description>
