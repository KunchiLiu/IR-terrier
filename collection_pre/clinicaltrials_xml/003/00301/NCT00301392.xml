	<brief_title>Japan Prevention Trial of Diabetes by Pitavastatin in Patients With Impaired Glucose Tolerance (J-PREDICT)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diabetes mellitus and its complications are major health problems globally. People with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) are at high risk of developing diabetes. It is therefore important to focus on preventing diabetes in individuals with IGT. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) are widely used for hypercholesterolemia, one of the most frequent metabolic disorders. However, there is no direct evidence to whether statins are beneficial for preventing diabetes. This study is designed to compare the efficacy of life-style modification versus life-style modification with pitavastatin (a statin) administration, in individuals with IGT.</detailed_description>
