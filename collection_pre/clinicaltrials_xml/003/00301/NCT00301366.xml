	<brief_title>The Safety and Tolerability of Alpha-1 Modified Process (MP) In Subjects With Alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT) Deficiency</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective of this clinical trial (STAMP: Safety and Tolerability of Alpha-1 Modified Process) is to study the safety and tolerability of Alpha-1 MP in adult Alpha 1-antitrypsin deficient subjects as reported over 20 weeks of therapy. The primary objective is to describe the nature and frequency of treatment-emergent adverse events with "treatment-emergent" defined as any adverse event occurring after the start of the first study drug infusion.</detailed_description>
