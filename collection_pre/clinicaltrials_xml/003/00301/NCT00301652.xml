	<brief_title>MMF Versus CTX in the Induction Treatment of ANCA Associated Vasculitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The ANCA-associated vasculitides can be life threatening. Glucocorticoids and cyclophosphamide therapy is effective in about 80% patients. However, the side effects such as bone marrow suppression, infection, cystitis, infertility, myelodysplasia preclude further use of cyclophosphamide in some patients and the relapse rate is high. Recent studies have shown that mycophenolic acid(MPA), the active metabolite of mycophenolate mofetil(MMF), could exhibit multifarious effects on endothelial cells, including inhibition of ICAM-1 expression, neutrophil attachment,IL-6 secretion, and the process of angiogenesis, which contribute to the efficacy of MMF in the treatment of vasculitic lesions such as lupus nephritis with vasculitic lesions. This study was a feasibility study to assess the safety and effectiveness of MMF in inducing remission in subjects with ANCA-associated SVV compared with pulse intravenous cyclophosphamide. After enrollment, subjects were followed longitudinally, and formal measurements of disease activity were determined using the Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score (BVAS).</detailed_description>
