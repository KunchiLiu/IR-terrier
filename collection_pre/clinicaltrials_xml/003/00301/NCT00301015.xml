	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficiency of a rapid diagnostic test (Paracheck Pf) for the diagnosis of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria by community health workers at village level in Tanzania and how the use of rapid diagnostic test may influence prescription of antimalarial drugs. The hypothesis is that rapid diagnostic tests used by community health workers will reduce the use of antimalarial drugs (Coartem; Novartis) by 30% without affecting the health outcome.</brief_summary>
