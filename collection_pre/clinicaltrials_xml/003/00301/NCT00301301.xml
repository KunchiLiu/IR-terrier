	<brief_summary>There has been considerable international /national interest in the GEM−P regimen for treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory lymphoma. Currently, there is no accepted standard therapy for these patients. Since the publication of our experience with this regimen (Study with CCR ethics number 1857 closed to recruitment in July 2003:Ng M, Waters J, Cunningham D et al, Br J Cancer 2005;92:1352−7), we have treated relapsed/refractory lymphoma patients with this regimen and would like to undertake a retrospective review of a sub−group of these patients with diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Patients treated with GEM−P with or without Rituximab prior to March 2005 for refractory/relapsed DLBCL will be included in the analysis. Accrual of eligible patients currently under follow−up will be performed in clinic at the time of next appointment. All patients accrued will give informed consent for retrospective case note review, after discussion with a study investigator and after receiving a study information sheet. All eligible patients identified from the pharmacy database, and will be consented at the time of the next clinic appointment, if they are agreeable for the retrospective case note review.</brief_summary>
