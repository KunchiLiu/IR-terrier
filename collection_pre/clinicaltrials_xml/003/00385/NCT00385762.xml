	<brief_summary>According to the National Institute of Mental Health, depressive disorders afflict over six million U.S. men annually. Most cases of moderate or severe depression are treated with antidepressants, including monoamine oxidase inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, and, more recently, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and antidepressants with modest serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibition but unknown mechanism-of-action. Over the past two years, prescribing data show a steady increase in antidepressant dispensing rates (especially including serotonin reuptake inhibitors) for adults. SSRIs are known to have an effect on ejaculatory function and are therapeutically used for treatment of premature (rapid) ejaculation. However, few studies have evaluated the potential impact of antidepressant medications on male fertility, and no studies have been published with respect to the impact of newer antidepressants, such as SSRIs, on male fertility. In the high-volume male infertility practice at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, several patients have presented who have had a clear temporal association between SSRI use and impairment in sperm motility and/or sperm transport (emission). These men have shown improvement in sperm counts and motility after discontinuation of antidepressant medications. We propose a crossover pilot study of normal healthy males to ascertain possible effects of SSRIs on semen parameters. After initial screening semen analyses, subjects will take the SSRI paroxetine for five weeks. Serial semen analyses will be obtained while on medication and one month after discontinuation of medication. Comparisons between semen parameters on and off medication will be used to evaluate the frequency and significance of semen analysis changes during SSRI treatment.</brief_summary>
