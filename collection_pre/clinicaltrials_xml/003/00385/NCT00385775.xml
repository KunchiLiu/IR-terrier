	<detailed_description>This is a Phase I study, single-arm, open-label, dose escalation study to establish the recommended dose and activity of AEG35156 administered as a 2-hour daily infusion over 3 days initially followed by weekly 2-hour intravenous infusions in patients with advanced cancers. Subjects eligible for study entry must have proven advanced or metastatic cancer refactory to conventional treatment or for which no conventional therapy exists. The starting dose will be a fixed dose of 60 mg/day with escalation by steps of 50 to 100% in successive cohorts. Approximately of 30 patients will be entered in the study to determine the maximum tolerated dose.</detailed_description>
