	<brief_summary>Main objective: Therapeutic follow-up study Evaluate the clinical and biological safety of valproate administered as microgranules, under standard prescription conditions, with therapeutic follow-up and individual dosage adjustment, using valproate plasma concentrations and antiepileptic comedication as well as biological assays. Secondary objectives: Ancillary population kinetics study - Estimate the pharmacokinetic parameters of valproate administered as microgranules under standard therapeutic conditions within the population studied, from the therapeutic follow-up data. - Evaluate the influence of individual characteristics on the pharmacokinetic parameters. - Describe the relationship between plasma concentrations and adverse events for valproate and the main anti-epileptic comedications.</brief_summary>
