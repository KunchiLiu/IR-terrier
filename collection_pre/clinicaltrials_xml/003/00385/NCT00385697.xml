	<brief_summary>The primary purpose of this protocol is to assess the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of MGA031 when administered according to 3 different MGA031 dosing regimens in children and adults with recent-onset (diagnosis within past 12 weeks) type 1 diabetes mellitus. All regimens will be administered as an addition to insulin and other standard of care treatments. Efficacy will be defined primarily by the capacity of MGA031 to markedly reduce typical insulin requirements while maintaining relatively normal blood sugar levels. Other studies involving the study drug use the name hOKT3γ1 (Ala-Ala). MGA031, a humanized monoclonal antibody, is the name used for hOKT3γ1 (Ala-Ala) that is produced by MacroGenics, Inc. The United States Adopted Name (USAN) for MGA031 is teplizumab.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subjects must meet all of the following criteria: 1.

Male or female 7. Subject must be in one of the following age groups: Age 1835 years Age 1217 years pending approval by Data Monitoring Committee Age 811 years pending approval by Data Monitoring Committee 8. Body weight ≥ 36 kg Subjects must have none of the following: 1. Prior administration of a monoclonal antibody within the 1 year before enrollment or randomization at Study Day 0 that could potentially prevent or confound a therapeutic response to MGA031 2. Participation in any type of therapeutic drug or vaccine clinical trial within the 12 weeks before enrollment or randomization 3. Any medical condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would interfere with safe completion of the trial 4. Pregnant or lactating females 5. Prior murine OKT®3 treatment at any time before enrollment or randomization 6. Current or planned therapy with exenatide or any other agents that stimulate pancreatic beta cell regeneration or insulin secretion 7. Current or planned therapy with inhaled insulin 8.

History of epilepsy, cancer, cystic fibrosis, sickle cell anemia, neuropathy, peripheral vascular disease or cerebrovascular disease 10.
