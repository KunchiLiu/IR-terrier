	<brief_summary>Oral mucositis (OM) is a common and debilitating toxicity induced by many chemotherapy (CT) regimens and by radiation to the head and neck. The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of SNX-1012 in decreasing the duration of Grade 2, 3, or 4 oral mucositis (OM) according to World Health Organization (WHO) criteria.</brief_summary>
