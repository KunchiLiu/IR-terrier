	<detailed_description>30-day, 6-month, and 12-month clinical follow-up and 6 to 9-month IVUS or SCA follow-up to measure long-term efficiency of Excel stent in the inhibition of restenosis as well as the safety after the cessation of the 6-month anti-platelet drug treatment.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients who should fulfill with criteria of implanting Excel stents. Each patient enrolled is only allowed to implant Excel stents. Each patient are not allowed to be implanted more than 6 Excel stents.Also, 3 overlapped stents are not allowed to be implanted in the same vessel(35mm overlapping needed; length of stents totally are not allowed to be over 80mm; fully postdilated is essential for overlapping). Patients acknowlegement to the trial is essential. AMI withine 1 week. Patients who do not suitable to Excel stenting.(For example, nontolerant to antiplatelet drug or cardiac/noncardiac surgery undergoing recently.) Patients who have multiple branch lesions can not apply single Excel stenting. Patients who refuse to sign the Trial Acknowledgement. Patients with intrastent restenosis.</criteria>
