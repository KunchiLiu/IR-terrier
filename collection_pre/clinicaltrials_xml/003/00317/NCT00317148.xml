	<brief_title>Effect of Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) on Hot Flashes in Postmenopausal Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Humans, along with the other primates, are unique among animal species in having adrenals that secrete large amounts of the inactive precursor steroids dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and especially its sulfate DHEA-S. The marked reduction in the formation of DHEA-S by the adrenals during aging results in a dramatic fall in the formation of androgens and estrogens in peripheral target tissues, a situation that has been proposed to be associated with age-related diseases including skin atrophy, insulin resistance and obesity. Much attention has been given to the benefits of DHEA administered to postmenopausal women, especially on the bone, skin, vagina and well being after oral as well as percutaneous administration of the precursor steroid. This study proposes to study the effect of 50 mg oral DHEA capsules during a period of 4 months administered to postmenopausal women experiencing 50 or more moderate to severe hot flushes per week. Participants will be stratified by the number of hot flushes experienced per week. The two strata are: 50-70 or more than 70 hot flushes per week. During the study several biological and clinical parameters will be evaluated, as well as the reduction of the number of hot flashes and improvement of overall quality of life. Subjects will be evaluated at specific time intervals during the study for the above mentioned parameters as well as tolerability and adverse reactions.</detailed_description>
