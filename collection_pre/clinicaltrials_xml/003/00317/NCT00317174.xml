	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is as follows: - To evaluate the persistence of antibodies and the presence of immune memory induced by a 3-dose primary vaccination with Tritanrix™-HepB/Hib-MenAC (three formulations) in the study DTPwHB/HibMenACTT001 (CPMS No. 759346/001) by giving unconjugated PRP, PSA and PSC at 10 months age to one subset of subjects. - To evaluate the persistence of all antibodies pertaining to primary vaccination and the booster response to Tritanrix™-HepB/Hib2.5 vaccine or Tritanrix™-HepB/Hib-MenAC vaccine at 15-18 months age in the other subset of subjects.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Assess Antibody Persistence, Boostability &amp; Safety in Previously Primed Subjects.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will be conducted in two stages: At 10 months age, half of the subjects will receive a dose of plain meningococcal AC and PRP polysaccharide (PS) vaccine at 10 months age. At 15 to 18 months age (DTP booster phase), all subjects will receive a booster dose of Tritanrix™-HepB/Hib-MenAC or Tritanrix™-HepB/Hib2.5.</detailed_description>
