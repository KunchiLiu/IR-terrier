	<brief_summary>It has been shown in rodent models that chronic substance abuse is associated with a rigidification of cell membrane fluidity due to a change in the membrane cholesterol/phospholipids ratio. Upon substance withdrawal the membrane undergoes reequilibration of this ratio, a process resulting both in an acute and a prolonged severe withdrawal syndrome. MBM has developed a patented,phosphatidic acid-enriched phospholipid platform ("LIBERTAL"), which is supposed to facilitate the membrane fluidity recovery. The company has focused on nicotine withdrawal in smoking cessation,as primary target.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Smoking Cessation Assistance With LIBERTAL, A Phospholipid Mixture</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A randomized,double-blind, dose-finding,phase IIB study with Libertal has been performed in 493 volunteer smokers, wishing to quit. They were divided into 5 arms: 4 treatment groups of 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 4.0g/day respectively, and one placebo, divided BID. Treatment was administered during one week prior to smoking cessation, then continued during 8 weeks (56 days), followed by another 4 weeks without treatment (up to day 84). The primary endpoint was complete smoking cessation during at least 28 consecutive days. There were 6 on-site visits and 4 telephone interviews.</detailed_description>

Without a major cardiovascular or metabolic disease or condition. An uncontrolled major cardiovascular, metabolic, or other condition condition. Need for surgery during the period of participation in the trial. Any treatment for smoking cessation during the 2 months preceding enrollment in the present trial.</criteria>
