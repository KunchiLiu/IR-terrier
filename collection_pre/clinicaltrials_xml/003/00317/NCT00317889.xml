	<brief_summary>This is a prospective, randomized study comparing two different bone preparation techniques for insertion of a porous coated titanium cementless femoral stem. Patients receiving a bilateral total hip replacement are randomized to conventional broaching on one side and compaction on the other side. Hypothesis: Compaction results in significantly less stem migration [evaluated by radiostereometric analysis (RSA)], less peri-prosthetic bone mineral density (BMD) loss [evaluated by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA)], and a higher Harris hip score after two years.</brief_summary>
