Significant anemia (Hgb &lt;8 gm/dL). Thrombocytopenia (Platelets &lt; 100,000 per mm3) Impaired immunity: (Absolute lymphocyte count [ALC] for 1 year olds &lt; 4.0 x 103/mm3; for 2 year olds &lt; 3.0 x 103/mm3; for 3 year olds &lt; 2.0 103/mm3.

Prior receipt of a rabies vaccine or an investigational malaria vaccine. Use of any investigational drug or vaccine other than the study vaccine within 30 days preceding the first dose of study vaccine, or planned use up to 30 days after the third dose. Administration of chronic (defined as more than 14 days) immunosuppressants or other immunemodifying drugs within six months of vaccination. (For corticosteroids, this will mean prednisone, or equivalent, greater than or equal to 0.5 mg/kg/day. Inhaled and topical steroids are allowed).

History of allergic reactions or anaphylaxis to immunizations or to any vaccine components. History of surgical splenectomy. Administration of immunoglobulins or any blood products within the 3 months preceding the first dose of study vaccine or planned administration during the study period. Simultaneous participation in any other clinical trial.
