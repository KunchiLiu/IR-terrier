	<detailed_description>The primary objective is to directly compare the efficacy of acamprosate, naltrexone and placebo for relapse prevention in alcoholics. The secondary objective is to establish an association between patients' motivational type and drug effects. The aim is to improve alcoholism treatment by identifying characteristics for response to specific pharmacological relapse prevention. Such items could allow for an individually adapted pharmacotherapy of alcoholism. Specifically, we will study the possible dependence of the efficacy of naltrexone and/or acamprosate on different motivational types (reward versus relief craving) and genetic profiles referring to glutamatergic and opioidergic candidate genes. Lastly, the longterm costs and cost-effectiveness of the different treatment strategies for alcoholics chosen in our study are established.</detailed_description>
