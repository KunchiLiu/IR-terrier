	<brief_title>Does Static Ultrasound-Preview Reduce the Incidence of Difficult Lumbar Puncture?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a controlled trial randomizing lumbar puncture patients to groups utilizing ultrasound to preview the bony structures of the spine versus using standard palpation technique. The goal is to determine the helpfulness of ultrasound in performing lumbar punctures (to reduce difficult and traumatic lumbar punctures) among patients whose spines cannot be easily visualized.</detailed_description>
