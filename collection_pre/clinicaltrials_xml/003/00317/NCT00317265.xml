	<brief_summary>This is a randomized, prospective European Multicenter Study comparing complete arterial revascularization of the coronary arteries using arterial graft material exclusively and “conventional” coronary artery bypass surgery using the left internal thoracic artery as graft to the left anterior descending artery (LAD) and vein grafts to other vessels to be bypassed.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Coronary Bypass Surgery Trial: Complete Arterial Revascularization and Conventional Coronary Artery Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Coronary artery surgery effectively relieves angina and prolongs life in certain patient subsets. It is the most frequently performed major surgical procedure and therefore has profound economical impact. Unfortunately angina returns in 10 to 20 percent of patients by five years and in up to 50 percent at 10 years primarily because of graft failure and progression of atherosclerosis in the native coronary arteries. Serial angiography reveals that 15-30 percent of vein grafts are stenosed at one year and that nearly 50 percent are occluded at ten years. Recurrence of angina is associated with an increased risk of late myocardial infarction and reoperation. Reoperations after cardiac surgery carry a significantly increased risk of morbidity and mortality due to increased patient age, progression of coronary atherosclerosis, frequently reduced left ventricular function and technical difficulties. Thus prevention of restenosis by medical and surgical means is of eminent importance.The use of the IMA as a graft to the LAD is proven to reduce long-term mortality in patients after CABG throughout a 15 year follow-up period in all age groups. This data and the further improved survival with bilateral IMA grafting suggested by some have increased the interest of the surgical community in total arterial revascularization using both IMAs and various other arterial conduits. However to date there is no conclusive data demonstrating a clinical benefit of total arterial revascularization.Reports available on complete arterial revascularisation are either single institution / single surgeon, retrospective or non - randomized. Data on which we base our daily decision making is by and large from a different surgical period with different techniques used. Improved understanding of the pathogenic processes leading to graft occlusion have led to more rigorous use of antiplatelet drugs and lipid lowering which may significantly improve vein graft patency rates and slow or halt progression of native coronary artery atherosclerosis in the future. The scientific hypotheses underlying this randomized multicenter trial are: 1. With respect to the primary outcome variable “total mortality” complete arterial revascularisation does not cause a significantly higher mortality over 5 years of follow-up (as compared to conventional coronary artery surgery) i.e. non-inferiority due to increased tecnical complexity of the surgical procedure. 2. In terms of the combined secondary outcome variable “cardiac death, nonfatal myocardial infarction and re-revascularisation (PTCA or CABG)” and additional outcome variables “freedom from angina, functional status and quality of life” complete arterial revascularisation shows a clear benefit.</detailed_description>
