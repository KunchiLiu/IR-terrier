	<brief_summary>Magnesium iron hydroxycarbonate is a phosphate binder that absorbs phosphate from food, reducing the amount that the body can absorb. The purpose of this study it to look at how effective and safe Magnesium iron hydroxycarbonate is in controlling levels of phosphate in the blood in patients who receive hemodialysis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety Study of Magnesium Iron Hydroxycarbonate for the Reduction of High Blood Phosphate in Hemodialysis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>High levels of phosphate in the blood are linked with serious effects, due to calcium imbalances (high levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH), bone disease, formation of calcium deposits in the body, and blood-vessel disease). Current guidelines indicate that blood phosphorus levels should be maintained between 1.13 to 1.78 mmol/L in patients who receive hemodialysis. This study is designed to investigate magnesium iron hydroxycarbonate's ability to lower and control patients' blood phosphate to the recommended levels and compare the average blood phosphate, calcium, calcium-phosphate product, PTH and magnesium concentrations and overall safety with placebo (or "dummy") tablets.</detailed_description>

On a stable dose of a phosphate binder for at least 1 month prior to screening. Willing to abstain from taking any phosphate binder or oral magnesium, aluminum or ironcontaining products and preparations, other than the study medication. Willing to avoid any intentional changes in diet such as fasting, dieting or overeating. Willing to maintain their usual type and dose of Vitamin D supplementation. Participation in any other clinical trial using an investigational product or device within the previous 4 months. A significant history of alcohol, drug or solvent abuse in the opinion of the investigator. Any disease or condition, physical or psychological, which in the opinion of the investigator would compromise the safety of the subject or increase the likelihood of the subject being withdrawn. Clinically significant laboratory findings (for this subject population) in the opinion of the investigator. Any malignancy requiring treatment within 5 years of screening with the exception of basal cell carcinoma and Bowen's disease. A history of a motility disorder of the intestines, including, but not limited to, gastroparesis, ileus, pseudoobstruction, megacolon, or mechanical obstruction. A significant illness in the 4 weeks before screening. Taking medication prescribed for seizures. A history of haemochromatosis. A history of high serum ferritin concentration of â‰¥ 1000ng/ml (excluding transient, treatmentinduced ferritin elevation). A history of dysphagia or swallowing disorders that might limit the subject's ability to swallow study medication in the opinion of the investigator. Female subjects who are lactating or pregnant. Women of childbearing potential (premenopausal and not surgically sterilized) unless they are using a reliable contraceptive method, that is, barrier methods, hormones or intrauterine device.
