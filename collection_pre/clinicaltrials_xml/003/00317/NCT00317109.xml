	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and reactogenicity of a booster dose of diphtheria-tetanus-whole cell pertussis-hepatitis B virus/Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine (DTPw-HBV/Hib) at 15-18 m and to assess the immunogenicity, safety, and reactogenicity of a dose of Mencevax™ Group A, C and W135 polysaccharide meningococcal vaccine (ACW) at 24 to 30 m in primed subjects. The Protocol Posting has been updated in order to comply with the FDA Amendment Act, Sep 2007.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study to Asses DTPw-HBV/Hib at 15-18 Months (m) and Mencevax™ ACW at 24 to 30 m in Primed Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open study will have two parallel groups based on the vaccination received in the primary study: AC primed Group: primed with Tritanrix™-HepB/Hib-MenAC vaccine and AC unprimed Group (control): primed with Tritanrix™-HepB/Hiberix™ vaccine. All subjects will receive a booster dose of Tritanrix™-HepB/Hiberix™ vaccine at 15 to 18 months of age with GSK Biological's OPV vaccine given concomitantly and a dose of Mencevax™ ACW vaccine at 24 to 30 months of age. Blood sampling will be done prior to (pre) and one month after (post) the Mencevax™ ACW vaccine administration for immunogenicity analyses. The study will last minimum 7 to maximum 16 months per subject. Mencevax™ ACWY was changed to Mencevax™ ACW throughout the posting to correct an inconsistency in the earlier version of the protocol posting and to reflect the actual situation.</detailed_description>
