	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy of Low-Dose Pentavalent Antimony for Treatment of Cutaneous Leishmaniasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The first-choice drug for the treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis in Brazil is the pentavalent antimonial meglumine antimoniate. The treatment with meglumine antimoniate is toxic and at least some of the more relevant adverse events associated with that drug are dose-dependent. Recently, some research developed in Brazil has shown evidence that lower doses of pentavalent antimony are equally efficacious as compared to the standard-dose regimen. That evidence has been obtained in patients from the State of Rio de Janeiro who were infected by Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis. The purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the low-dose pentavalent antimony regimen in patients with cutaneous leishmaniasis infected by Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis living in a rural area of the State of Bahia, Brazil, where cutaneous leishmaniasis is highly endemic. The usefulness of the study is based on the possibility to reduce the toxicity observed during treatment and the treatment costs. The main comparison of the therapeutic response is going to be made between two groups composed of an equal number of properly randomized patients with localized cutaneous leishmaniasis treated with any of the following drug schemes: - Meglumine antimoniate (calculated dose based on the concentration of pentavalent antimony) 5 mg/kg/d intravenous for 20 days - Meglumine antimoniate (calculated dose based on the concentration of pentavalent antimony) 15 mg/kg/d intravenous for 20 days The clinical outcomes of cure or failure will be evaluated until the third month of follow-up.</detailed_description>
