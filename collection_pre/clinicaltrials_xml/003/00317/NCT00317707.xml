	<brief_summary>In the everyday practice cardiovascular prevention in people at high risk is still unsatisfactory and treatments with documented efficacy are generally under-used. Polyunsaturated fatty acids of marine origin (n-3 PUFA) are the latest more promising strategy to improve prognosis in these patients. The Risk and Prevention study combines an epidemiological and an experimental approach in order to: 1. Verify the possibility to optimise cardiovascular prevention in subjects at high risk by planning the intervention with patients and setting individual goals (outcome study) 2. Evaluate the efficacy of a long term n-3 PUFA treatment in reducing the incidence of cardiovascular events, through a controlled, randomised, double blind clinical trial.</brief_summary>
