	<brief_title>Pilot Study of Hemoglobin Based Oxygen Therapeutics in Elective Coronary Revascularization</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute coronary syndromes are due to an acute or subacute primary reduction of myocardial oxygen supply provoked by disruption of an atherosclerotic plaque associated with inflammation, thrombosis, vasoconstriction and microembolization. Occlusive thrombosis superimposed on a ruptured atheroma in an epicardial coronary artery is firmly established as the immediate cause of an acute ST-segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI). Rapid restoration of blood flow (oxygen supply) to jeopardized myocardium limits necrosis and reduces mortality. This can be accomplished medically with a thrombolytic agent, or mechanically, with so-called primary balloon angioplasty or stenting. Primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has become the preferred therapy for STEMI in most developed countries. HBOC-201 is a solution belonging to a new class of biologic oxygen therapeutics, hemoglobin based oxygen carriers. HBOC-201 is a crosslinked and glutaraldehyde-polymerized hemoglobin (Hb) extracted from isolated bovine red blood cells. On a gram-for-gram basis, HBOC-201 was calculated to be approximately three times more potent than stored fresh red blood cell hemoglobin at restoring baseline tissue oxygenation following severe acute anemia. Evaluation of this Hemoglobin Based Oxygen Carrier has been undertaken in 57 preclinical studies and 21 human clinical trials. The compound is under review by the US FDA and has been approved in the Republic of South Africa. However, HBOC-201 has not yet been evaluated in the setting of this disease (narrowing of a coronary artery). Biopure will be studying the safety and feasibility of HBOC-201 in patients with typical symptoms of Unstable Angina or Non ST-segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction eligible to undergo invasive revascularization through a PCI procedure.</detailed_description>
