	<brief_summary>The objective of this study was to treat anemic (Hemoglobin (Hb) &lt; 12 g/dL) HIV-infected subjects with once weekly (QW) PROCRIT (Epoetin alfa) to a target Hb of &gt; 13 g/dL and then to assess if the target Hb level and improvements in Quality of Life (QOL) could be maintained with every other week (Q2W) PROCRIT (Epoetin alfa) dosing.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Open-Label Study to Evaluate the Effect of Every Other Week PROCRITï¿½ (Epoetin Alfa) Dosing (40,000-60,000 Units) On Maintaining Quality of Life and Target Hemoglobin Levels in Anemic HIV-Infected Patients (CHAMPS II)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This was a Phase IV, open-label, non-randomized, multi-center study conducted in community based practices, physicians networks, or academic institutions in the US. This study included anemic (Hb &lt; 12 g/dL) HIV-infected subjects and HIV/hepatitis C (HCV) co-infected subjects not receiving HCV treatment on a stable anti-retroviral therapy (ART) regimen for at least 4 weeks prior to enrollment. Quality of life assessments, laboratory results, and transfusion information were obtained during the study. Laboratory tests, vital signs (blood pressure), and incidence and severity of adverse events were collected and assessed. The primary objective of this study was to assess if every other week PROCRIT (Epoetin alfa) dosing can maintain quality of life in anemic HIV-infected patients. The primary hypothesis of interest was that the mean quality of life score (as measured by MOS-HIV General Health Perception score) at the end of the every other week (Q2W) maintenance phase was not lower than that at the beginning of the maintenance phase by more than 7 points. It was anticipated that less frequent dosing, every other week, was more convenient for patients and will improve patient compliance. The starting dose (Baseline/Study Day 1) of PROCRIT (Epoetin alfa) for all eligible subjects was 40,000 U given subcutaneously QW. The maximum duration was 24 weeks. Subjects who achieved target Hb levels &gt;= 13 g/dL were converted to a maintenance dose of PROCRIT (Epoetin alfa) sc Q2W.</detailed_description>
