	<brief_summary>We have identified focussing problems related to myopia getting worse. Our trial uses optical and orthoptic interventions that correct the focussing problems to see if this retards myopia progression.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cambridge Anti-Myopia Trial: Accommodation Training and Aberration Control in Myopia Development</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Myopia is a burgeoning health and social problem. Currently there is no acceptable clinical treatment that prevents progression. This study is a double masked placebo controlled block randomized clinical trial of two interventions, to treat accommodative factors we have identified as being significantly correlated to myopia progression (rather than to the presence of myopia). We have shown that the interventions normalise the accommodative factors, and this trial examines the effect of these interventions on myopia progression.</detailed_description>
