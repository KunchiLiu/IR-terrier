	<detailed_description>To compare the efficacy, safety, and pharmacoeconomics of cefepime versus ceftriaxone. Double-blind study of nursing home residents &gt;60 years of age with pneumonia. Patients were randomized to cefepime or ceftriaxone 1 gm q24h to be administered intramuscularly. After three days, responding patients could be switched to oral antibiotics. Main Outcome Measures: clinical success, adverse events, and cost-effectiveness ratios.</detailed_description>
