	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study was to compare the safety, tolerability, and antiviral activity of once-daily (QD) and twice-daily (BID) dosing of the lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) tablet formulation in combination with nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) in antiretroviral-experienced human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infected subjects with detectable viral load while receiving their current antiretroviral therapy.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subjects were human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV1) positive, antiretroviralexperienced adults at least 18 years of age currently receiving an antiretroviral regimen which had not changed for at least 12 weeks. Subjects had plasma HIV1 ribonucleic acid (RNA) levels &gt; 1,000 copies/mL at screening and were not acutely ill. Subject was currently failing his/her antiretroviral regimen with the most recent 2 consecutive prestudy plasma HIV1 RNA levels &gt; 400 copies/mL with the most recent being &gt; 1000 copies/mL, and in the investigator's opinion, should change therapy Female subjects were nonpregnant and nonlactating. Subjects were excluded if screening laboratory analyses showed hemoglobin &lt;= 8.0 grams per deciliter. Subjects were excluded if screening laboratory analyses showed absolute neutrophil count &lt;= 750 cells/microliter. Subjects were excluded if screening laboratory analyses showed platelet count &lt;= 50,000 per cubic millimeter. Subjects were excluded if screening laboratory analyses showed alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &gt;= 5.0 x upper limit of normal (ULN).</criteria>
