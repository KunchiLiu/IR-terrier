	<brief_summary>Early physical therapy after knee surgery is very painful on top of pain from surgery. Pain following surgery can limit recovery. One way to treat pain is by giving intravenous (IV) pain medication with morphine. Another method is to use a “nerve block” which involves placing a thin catheter (tube) into the lower back near the nerves that sense pain in the knee and give a local anesthetic to numb the nerves. Sometimes both methods are used together. This research is being done to determine whether nerve blocks with a local anesthetic improve knee recovery in addition to providing pain relief as compared to IV pain medicine alone</brief_summary>
