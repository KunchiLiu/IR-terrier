	<brief_title>One Time Injection of Bacteria to Treat Solid Tumors That Have Not Responded to Standard Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Investigators at the SKCCC have developed a bacterial strain (C. novyi-NT) that can infect tumors and destroy them, but does not grow in normal tissues. In animal experiments, a single intravenous injection of these bacteria can cause dramatic regression of many tumors, and the tumors do not recur in approximately (~) 30% of the animals. This is a phase I dose escalation study using a single dose of Clostridium novyi-NT spores in patients with treatment-refractory solid tumor malignancies. The overall objective of this study is to determine the safety and document any preliminary evidence of anti-tumor activity in this patient population.</detailed_description>

Patients must be refractory to standard chemotherapy or for whom no standard treatment exists. At least four weeks must have elapsed since completion of any prior chemotherapy. 3. Patients must have measurable disease; defined as at least one lesion whose longest diameter can be accurately measured as &gt;2 cm. 4. ECOG performance status of 0 or 1. 5. Prior locoregional therapy, including cryotherapy, radiofrequency ablation, or regional chemotherapy is allowed if at least 6 weeks have elapsed. 6. Prior radiation therapy is allowed. At least 6 weeks must have elapsed since the completion of radiation therapy and the patient must have recovered from side effects. 7. Prior systemic radionuclide therapy is allowed. At least 4 weeks must have elapsed since completion of the therapy. 8. Prior surgery is allowed. At least 6 weeks must have elapsed since the completion of major surgery and the patient must be fully recovered from this surgery and any attendant postsurgical complications. 9. Patients must be 18 years of age or older 10. Patients of childbearing potential must use adequate birth control measures (e.g., abstinence, barrier method with spermicide; or use by partner of oral contraceptives, intrauterine device, implantable or injectable contraceptives [i.e., Norplant or DepoProvera] or surgical sterilization) for the duration of the study and should continue such precautions for 12 months after receiving treatment. 11. Screening physical exam must be obtained less than 7 days prior to treatment and the results must meet the following criteria: 1. Temperature range: &lt; 38.0 and greater and &gt;36.0 2.

Patient is able to stay within 45 minutes driving time of Johns Hopkins Hospital for 28 days following spore injection and the 7 day inpatient hospitalization period. 17. Patient is able to stay within 45 minutes driving time of Johns Hopkins Hospital for at least 35 days after recovery from all adverse events. Exclusion Criteria 1. Weight &gt; 135 kg 2. Chronic renal failure requiring hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis 3. Patients with renal cysts. 4. Tumor lesion that is not accessible to percutaneous drainage. 5. Any single contiguous lesion greater than &gt; 12.5 cm (largest diameter). 6. The sum of the largest crosssectional diameters from any number of noncontiguous lesions &gt; 2 cm cannot be &gt; 25 cm. 7. Use of any investigational drug within 30 days prior to screening or within 5 halflives of the investigational agent, whichever is longer. 8. Any documented evidence of primary brain malignancy or brain metastases 9. Patients with any clinically significant ascites or portosystemic hypertension, chronic jaundice or cirrhosis. 10. Patients with indwelling intrahepatic arterial pumps 11. Patients with prosthetic joints, prosthetic valves, pacemakers or any other implanted foreign materials. (nonCNS surgical clips or staples are excluded) 12. Patients with any clinically significant pleural effusions 13. Patients with any evidence of hemodynamic compromise from a pericardial effusion, circumferential pericardial effusion, or any effusion greater than 1.0 cm at any location around the heart. 14. Documented cirrhosis of the liver by clinical scenarios encompassing radiographic,clinical and laboratory results 15. Ongoing treatment with any immunosuppressive agent(s) 16. Any evidence of serious infections (such as pneumonia or pyelonephritis) or history of chronic or recurrent infectious disease in the previous 3 months. Less serious infections (such as acute upper respiratory tract infection(colds)or simple urinary tract infection) can be included upon the discretion of the investigator. 17. Patients with opportunistic infections, including but not limited to evidence of active cytomegalovirus, Tuberculosis, active Pneumocystis carinii, Aspergillosis,histoplasmosis, or atypical mycobacterium infection, within the previous 6 months. 18. Documented HIV infection. 19. Active or chronic Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C. 20. Presence of a transplanted solid organ (with the exception of a corneal transplant &gt; 3 months prior to screening). 21. History of an autoimmune disorder (eg, systemic lupus, pemphigus vulgaris,myasthenia gravis) ), requiring medication. 22. History of Diabetes Mellitus (type I or II) 23.
