	<brief_title>A Cognitive Behavioral Therapy of Primary Obsessions in Obsessive Compulsive Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants will be phone-screened to determine broad suitability and interest in being in the study, as well as availability. Following telephone screening, participants will meet with a clinician who will administer a semi-structured interview to determine diagnostic status followed by a more specific standard semi-structured interview to measure symptom strength in those participants who meet diagnostic criteria of OCD (primary obsessions). Participants will then be invited to join the study. Participants will be randomly assigned to either immediate treatment or delayed treatment (three month delay). Participants will then be again be randomly assigned to either Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) or Stress Management Therapy (SMT). The delayed participants (wait list control) will be randomly assigned to either of the two active treatment groups in three months time. Both active treatment conditions involve one hours, individual treatment sessions for 12 consecutive weeks by one of the treating psychologists. All participants will also be asked to complete a package of psychometric questionnaires before treatment. Participants assigned to the delayed treatment condition will be asked to complete these questionnaires again before proceeding to treatment once they have completed the three month wait. The participants will be re-evaluated at the end of treatment, at six months after treatment, and at one year after treatment, using the same assessment procedure.</detailed_description>
