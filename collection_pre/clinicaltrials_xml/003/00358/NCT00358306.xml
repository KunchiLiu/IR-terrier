	<brief_title>The Role of Endothelium Dysfunction in Progression of CKD (Chronic Kidney Disease) After AKI (Acute Kidney Injury)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study is designed to study what happens to the kidneys after they have an injury. There is some evidence that even if there appears to be great improvement of kidney function, an injury can put patients at risk for long-term problems with their kidney function and increase their risk to have high blood pressure. We want to collect information from participants to help explain why this injury can cause future problems, including Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) which may help us prevent these health problems.</detailed_description>
