	<brief_summary>This study will last for approximately 14 weeks and will involve 5 visits. The study is being carried out to look at different ways of measuring the effect of drug treatment on COPD. COPD is a respiratory disease which can affect your breathing and daily life. Symptoms of COPD can include breathlessness, cough, and wheeze. COPD varies enormously from patient to patient. The effects of drug treatment are usually measured by conducting lung function tests (breathing tests) using a machine called a spirometer but this does not always provide a complete picture of how well your COPD is responding. In this study we therefore want to look at new and more sensitive ways of measuring COPD. The results of this research will help in the assessment of new drugs for COPD in the future.</brief_summary>
