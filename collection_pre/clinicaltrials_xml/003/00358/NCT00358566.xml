	<brief_title>GV1001 and Gemcitabine in Sequential Combination to Gemcitabine Monotherapy in Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The trial is a Phase III, multinational, multicentre, controlled, randomised open-label trial. It will involve 520 advanced pancreatic cancer patients. Patients will be randomly assigned to receive Gemcitabine alone or GV1001 plus GM-CSF followed by addition of Gemcitabine at the time of 1st progression of disease. The experimental treatment is given prior to the current standard treatment in 50% of the patients.</detailed_description>
