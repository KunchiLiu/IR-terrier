	<brief_summary>The ICGG Gaucher Registry is an ongoing, international multi-center, strictly observational program that tracks the routine clinical outcomes for patients with Gaucher disease, irrespective of treatment status. No experimental intervention is involved; patients in the Registry undergo clinical assessments and receive care as determined by the patient's treating physician. The objectives of the Registry are: - To enhance the understanding of the variability, progression, and natural history of Gaucher disease with the ultimate goal of better guiding and assessing therapeutic interventions; - To provide the Gaucher medical community with recommendations for monitoring patients and to provide reports on patient outcomes to help optimize patient care; and - To evaluate the long-term effectiveness of Cerezyme.</brief_summary>
