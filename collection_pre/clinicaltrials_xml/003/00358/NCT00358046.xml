	<brief_title>Efficacy and Tolerability of ILY101 in Dialysis Patients With Hyperphosphatemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hyperphosphatemia is associated with abnormally high blood concentrations of phosphorus. Normally, phosphorus in the body is excreted into urine via the kidneys, but this process is impaired when renal function is reduced. Hyperphosphatemia occurs in many patients with renal insufficiency, especially those on dialysis. High blood phosphorus concentrations trigger various complications caused by phosphorous interaction with blood calcium or parathyroid hormones, and makes patients more prone to calcium deposition in soft tissues such as the coronary arteries, increasing the risk of ischemic heart disease. ILY101 is a non-absorbed, metal-free polymer that binds phosphorus in the gastrointestinal tract, allowing for excretion of phosphorus. It is therefore anticipated to ameliorate hyperphosphatemia by reducing the absorption of phosphorus from the gastrointestinal tract.</detailed_description>
