	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to check the usability of Virtual Reality (VR) Video Capture Projected System in children with acquired brain injury(ABI)and comparing their performance to the performance of normally developing children. The trial shall include 15 subjects in each group, aged 6-12 years old. ABI subjects are hospitalized at the hospital's Pediatric Rehabilitation Department Each subject will experience 3 different virtual environments. The subjects in the trial group will practice 3 experiences (3 times in 3 different days) during a period of a week to 10 days, to check the practice effect.In addition, all subjects will be tested in three tests: "PEDI" - to evaluate the functional abilities of daily living (dressing, eating...),The "Melbourne Assessment" - to evaluate functional movements of upper extremities, and the TEA-ch - to evaluate different attention abilities. Performance correlations will be tested between these tests and the performance in the VR first experience.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to check the usability of Virtual Reality (VR) Video Capture Projected System in children with acquired brain injury(ABI) comparing their performance with the performance of normally developing children, matched by age, gender,sector and parents' education. subjects' age: 6 - 12 years old. The trial shall include 15 subjects in each group. ABI subjects are hospitalized at Sheba Hospital's Pediatric Rehabilitation Department. Each subject will experience 3 different virtual environments. The subjects in the trial group will practice 3 experiences (3 times in 3 different days) during a period of a week to 10 days, to check the practice effect. In addition, all subjects will be tested in three tests: "PEDI" - to evaluate the functional abilities of daily living (dressing, eating...),The "Melbourne Assessment" - to evaluate functional movements of upper extremities, and the TEA-ch - to evaluate difference attention abilities. Correlations between those tests to the performance in the VR experiences will be checked with Pearson's statistical correlation tests. The differences between the trial group (ABI children) and the control group will be checked with Independent t-tests.</detailed_description>
