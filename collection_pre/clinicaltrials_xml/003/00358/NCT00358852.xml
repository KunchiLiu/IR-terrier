	<brief_title>Scale Validation Study for Prediction of Relapse and Short Term Rehospitalization in Patients With Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an epidemiological (study of the distribution and determinants of health-related states or events in defined population), multicenter (study conducted at multiple sites), observational (study in which patients are observed), cross-sectional (observation of all patients at one specific point in time), prospective (in which the patients are first identified and then followed forward as time passes) study.

The general data (age range, gender, highest level of educational attainment, level of family support, substance abuse, events stressors, type of schizophrenia according to DSM-IV criteria [Diagnostic and Statistical Manual fourth], etc) of approximately 2000 schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder / schizophreniform patients will be collected in this study. No special tests will be done during the study. The study will collect patients' data in electronic data collection workbook and model validation will be used at 6 and 12 months to confirm no relapse / hospitalization. The study observation period corresponds to the 3 years preceding the current relapse and current income (current hospitalization period) and 12 months after admission.</detailed_description>
