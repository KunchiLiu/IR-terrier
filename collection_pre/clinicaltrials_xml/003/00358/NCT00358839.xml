	<brief_title>Calcitonin Gene Related Peptide-Induced Headache in Patients With Familial Hemiplegic Migraine Type 1 and 2.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Calcitonin Gene Related Peptide (CGRP) induces migraine attacks indistinguishable from spontaneous attacks in approximately 50% of migraine sufferers. Treatment of spontaneous migraine attacks with an antagonist to CGRP is effective in many patients. These data show that CGRP is involved in both initiation and maintenance of migraine attack. The consequence of migraine gene mutations on relevant migraine pathways has never been tested. The aim of the present study is to explore functional consequences of migraine gene mutations on their responses to CGRP infusion. The project will improve our understanding of the neurobiology of migraine and stimulate development of new treatment targets.</detailed_description>
