	<brief_summary>This study is designed to investigate whether guanfacine (Tenex) is an effective treatment for borderline personality disorder (BPD), an illness often characterized by unstable mood and impulsive aggression. Guanfacine stimulates activity in the front portion of the brain, a region associated with attention and the control of behavior. We believe that guanfacine may improve symptoms of BPD by improving attention and aiding regulation of behavior.</brief_summary>
