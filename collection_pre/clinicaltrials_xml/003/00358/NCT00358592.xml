	<brief_summary>This is a randomized controlled trial comparing the use of the Mobius™ retractor to the use of traditional metal retraction instruments in non-urgent cesarean deliveries of obese women. The Mobius™ retractor was designed for abdominal surgery to improve visualization of the surgical field through standard surgical incisions and is now a standard instrument used for cesarean deliveries at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital. We hypothesize that the use of the Mobius™ retractor during cesarean deliveries in obese women decreases operative time, blood loss, number of transfusions, infectious morbidity, incision length, and intra- / post-operative antiemetic and pain medication use, while increasing surgeon satisfaction.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The Mobius™ retractor has been used in many obese cesarean deliveries based on the theory that it provides superior visualization. There have been no clinical trials to determine if this "added" exposure offers any measurable significant benefits to justify the added cost. This study will determine if the Mobius™ retractor does provide a measurable difference in outcomes, compared to the traditional retraction instruments.</detailed_description>
