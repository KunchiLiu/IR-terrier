	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to assess the ability of the PreView PHP(study device)to detect newly diagnosed non-treated Choroidal Neovascularization (CNV)lesion associate with advanced Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD) or Myopia and differentiate them from Intermediate AMD or Geographic Atrophy (GA)or patients with high Myopia with no CNV. This study secondary is to enhance NotalVision normative database.</brief_summary>
