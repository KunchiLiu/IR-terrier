	<brief_title>Safety of and Immune Response to a Novel Human Papillomavirus Vaccine in HIV Infected Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Genital HPV infection is the most common sexually transmitted infection in the world and may lead to genital warts, anogenital dysplasias, and invasive cancers. HIV infected people and others with compromised immunity are at greater risk for HPV-related complications. In particular, researchers are concerned about the risk of HPV infection to women, who may be infected by their male partners, especially if these partners engage in anal intercourse. HIV infected women tend to have multiple types of HPV (associated with a greater risk of HPV-related disease), are less likely to clear HPV-related conditions, and are more likely to progress to HPV-related disease. The quadrivalent HPV (types 6, 11, 16, 18) L1 virus-like particle (VLP) vaccine to be tested in this study was safe and generally well tolerated in previous studies conducted in healthy and HPV-exposed adolescents, young adults, and older women. However, it is still unclear if the vaccine will be safe and will elicit a similar immune response in younger children. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of the novel quadrivalent HPV (Types 6, 11, 16, 18) L1 VLP vaccine in HIV infected children 7 to 12 years of age. This study had two stages and lasted at least 108 weeks. In Stage I, participants were stratified by CD4 percentage (CD4%) nadir and CD4% at study screening (Stratum A: CD4% Nadir &lt; 15 and CD4% ≥ 15 at screening, Stratum B: CD4% Nadir ≥ 15 and &lt; 25 and CD4% ≥ 15 at screening, Stratum C: CD4% Nadir ≥ 25 and CD4% ≥ 25 at screening). Within each stratification group, they were randomly assigned to one of two arms. During Stage I, Arm A (QHPV:Quadrivalent human papillomavirus vaccine) participants received 3 doses of vaccine, while Arm B (Placebo/QHPV) participants received 3 doses of placebo. Participants did not know whether they were receiving vaccine or placebo. Participants received their assigned intervention at study entry and Weeks 8 and 24. At Week 96, Stage II began, and all study participants were told if they received vaccine or placebo in Stage I. Arm A participants received an additional dose of vaccine at Week 96; Arm B participants received doses of vaccine at Weeks 96, 104, and 120. Over the course of the study, there were at least 12 study visits. A physical exam and blood collection occurred at most visits; medical history occurred at selected visits. After each vaccination, participants were observed for at least 30 minutes to monitor for any allergic reactions possibly resulting from the vaccination. For 15 days following vaccination, parents or guardians were asked to complete a "report card" with details of each child's signs and symptoms. Three days after each vaccination, parents or guardians of study participants were contacted by telephone and asked about any adverse events that a child may have experienced.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Children ages ≥ 7 to &lt; 12 years of age. A confirmed diagnosis of HIV infection, defined as two positive assays from two different samples. The two results may be in any combination of the following: at any age: Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) polymerase chain reaction (PCR), Ribonucleic acid (RNA) PCR age &gt; 4 weeks: p24 antigen detection age &gt;18 months: licensed ELISA (Enzymelinked immunosorbent assay) with confirmatory Western Blot CD4% ≥ 15 at the time of screening is required (Note that this is a minimum requirement, and that for Stratum C the CD4% needs to be ≥ 25). For Strata A and B: Currently stable (≥ 3 months) on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) regimen, defined as three or more antiretrovirals from at least two different therapeutic classes, or therapy with the combination of azidothymidine, lamivudine, and abacavir. For stratum C no antiretroviral therapy is required. Parent or legal guardian able and willing to provide signed informed consent. Negative urine pregnancy test sensitive to 25 International Unit (IU) betahuman chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) for girls who are menstruating (child bearing potential). Female study volunteers who are participating in sexual activity that could lead to pregnancy must agree to use two reliable methods of contraception, one of which must be a barrier method. A barrier method of contraception (condoms or cervical cap) together with another reliable form of contraception (condoms a , with a spermicidal agent; a diaphragm or cervical cap with spermicide; an intrauterine device [IUD]; or hormonalbased contraception) must be used while on this study. Condoms are recommended because their appropriate use is the only contraception method effective for preventing HIV1 transmission Males participating in the study must not attempt to impregnate a woman, or participate in sperm donation programs. Males engaging in sexual activity that could lead to pregnancy must use a condom. Exclusion Criteria Body temperature ≥ 101 F or ≥ 38.3 C, orally determined, within 72 hours prior to the first and each subsequent injection. Subjects may be vaccinated any time in the next seven days thereafter, provided that the site investigator is satisfied that the febrile illness has ended. Total bilirubin ≥ 5 x Upper Limit of Normal (ULN) at screening. Alanine transaminase (ALT) or serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) ≥ 5 x ULN at screening in the absence of other explained causes (as determined by the site investigator) at screening. Serum creatinine ≥ 1.5 mg/dL at screening. Absolute neutrophil count ≤ 750 cells/mm3 at screening. Hemoglobin ≤ 9.9 g/dL at screening. Platelet count ≤ 75,000 cells/mm³ at screening. Presence of an acute opportunistic nonbacterial or bacterial infection requiring therapy at the time of enrollment; the subject may be entered once he/she is stable on appropriate antiinfective therapy. Chemotherapy for active malignancy. Other known or suspected disease of the immune system, or immunosuppressive therapy. Prior treatment with immunosuppressive or immunomodulation therapy within 60 days of screening. Prior treatment with three or more weeklong courses of corticosteroids (≥ 2.0 mg/kg or ≥ 20 mg total of prednisoneequivalent) within one year of screening; or any systemic (oral or parenteral) steroids (≥ 2.0 mg/kg or ≥ 20 mg total of prednisoneequivalent for ≥ 3 days) within 30 days of study entry. Prior vaccinations with inactivated vaccines received within two weeks of any dose of study vaccine, and no other vaccinations may be planned for two weeks after each dose of study vaccine. Prior vaccinations with live vaccines received within three weeks before any dose of study vaccine, and no other vaccinations may be planned for two weeks after each dose of study vaccine. Prior diagnosis of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), genital warts, or juvenile recurrent papillomatosis. History of any severe allergic reaction (e.g., swelling of the mouth and throat, difficulty breathing, hypotension, or shock) that required medical intervention. Known allergies to any vaccine component, including aluminum, yeast, or BENZONASE™ (nuclease, Nycomed [used to remove residual nucleic acids from this and other vaccines]). Previous treatment with any immune globulin preparation or bloodderived products within the six months prior to the first injection and none may be planned during the study. Known coagulation disorder that would contraindicate Intramuscular (IM) injections. Any clinically significant diseases (other than HIV infection) or clinically significant findings during the screening medical history or physical examination that, in the investigator's opinion, would compromise the outcome of this study.
