	<brief_summary>We propose a population-based case-control study among 7000 elementary school children in semi-rural Johnston County, NC. Teachers will complete a screening form on each child. Controls will be randomly selected. Mothers of potential cases and controls will be interviewed by telephone about their child's symptoms of ADHD and exposure history, their family history of ADHD, and their reproductive and exposure history. Children's shed baby teeth will be analyzed for lead. Mothers will complete brief parenting scales and the Child Behavior Checklist. School records will be collected. The study goals are to identify risk factors for ADHD including preterm delivery and childhood lead exposure.</brief_summary>
