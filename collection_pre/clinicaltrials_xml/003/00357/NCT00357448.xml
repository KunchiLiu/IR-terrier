	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Biological therapies, such as denileukin difitox, may stimulate the immune system in different ways and may prevent tumor cells from growing. PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of denileukin diftitox in treating patients with advanced refractory ovarian cancer, primary peritoneal carcinoma, or epithelial fallopian tube cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Denileukin Diftitox Used in Treating Patients With Advanced Refractory Ovarian Cancer, Primary Peritoneal Carcinoma, or Epithelial Fallopian Tube Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To estimate the maximum tolerated dose of intraperitoneal administration of ONTAK. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the change in the number of Tregs in the peritoneum with the administration of ONTAK. II. To evaluate the change in the number of Tregs in the peripheral blood with the administration of ONTAK. III. To assess the clinical impact of ONTAK on tumor burden by serial measurements of CA-125. IV. To assess the level of circulating cytokines IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, TGF-beta2, and TNF-alpha in the peritoneum and peripheral blood before and after I.P. ONTAK. OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients receive intraperitoneal denileukin diftitox over at least 15 minutes on days 1-3. Treatment repeats every 14 days for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of denileukin diftitox until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. After the completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 and 2 weeks, monthly for 3 months, and then at 6 months.</detailed_description>
