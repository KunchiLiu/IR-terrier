	<brief_title>Effect of Rosuvastatin in Abdominal Sepsis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The sepsis is often lethal, the mortality's ranks are identified among 25 to 70%, this depends on definition, severity and co-morbidities. The number of deaths by sepsis could be similar to myocardial infarct. Patients who get shock have 26-fold risk of death. In preliminary studies have been observed, that patients with treatment with statin have minor incidence of severe sepsis. A retrospective study suggests the association between using statins and reduction of bacteriemia by Gram negatives and S. aureus. There are many experimental studies which demonstrate the possible profit in sepsis. However there are no clinical prospective studies for determinate if statins are effective in management of sepsis. The investigators designed this study to demonstrate the utility of rosuvastatin in one kind of sepsis, abdominal sepsis.</detailed_description>
