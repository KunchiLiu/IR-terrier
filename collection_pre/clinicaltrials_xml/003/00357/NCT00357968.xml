	<criteria>Subjects greater than or equal to 18 years of age undergoing cardiac catheterization with planned percutaneous coronary intervention (if coronary anatomy is suitable) for an indication of chest pain +/or anginal equivalent felt by the treating physician to be related to coronary ischemia. At least one of the following (a through c): 1. Functional study (exercise, or pharmacologic) within the past 8 weeks consistent with ischemia as manifested by at least one of the following: 1. A reversible defect on nuclear imaging. 2. A reversible wallmotion abnormality by echocardiography. 3. Horizontal or downsloping STdepressions greater than 1 mm on electrocardiogram (ECG) (if no imaging performed). 2. Prior coronary revascularization [percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass graft (CABG)]. 3. A cardiac catheterization with at least one coronary artery lesion amenable to PCI (not yet performed) within 14 days prior to enrollment. Known creatine kinasemyocardial bands (CKMB)or cardiac troponin greater than the upper limit of normal at time of screening Planned PCI for acute myocardial infarction (MI) or planned PCI within 48 hours of fibrinolytic therapy for ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) Have cardiogenic shock at the time of screening (systolic blood pressure 90 mm Hg associated with clinical evidence of endorgan hypoperfusion, or subjects requiring vasopressors to maintain systolic blood pressure over 90 mm Hg and associated with clinical evidence of endorgan hypoperfusion). Refractory ventricular arrhythmias Have New York Heart Association Class IV congestive heart failure</criteria>
