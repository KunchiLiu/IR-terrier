	<brief_summary>Within 4 weeks after diagnosis of type 1 diabetes, 10 subjects (pubertal males, 12-17 years old) will be randomized to either receive multiple daily injection (MDI) using Lantus insulin, or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII; pump therapy). The proposed protocol compares the changes in diabetes control between pump therapy and MDI treatment groups. More importantly, however, the study evaluates how these modes of therapy may affect the honeymoon period and glycemic control, specifically focusing on changes in insulin sensitivity (measured by the euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp studies and adiponectin concentration changes) and beta cell function (measured by mixed meal tolerance testing). Demonstrating that pump therapy at the time of diagnosis of type 1 diabetes prolongs the honeymoon phase by improving insulin sensitivity and beta cell function may have important therapeutic implications that could influence the standard of care in pediatric diabetes.</brief_summary>
