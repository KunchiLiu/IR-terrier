	<brief_summary>Objectives: 1. To determine whether paroxetine can prevent major depression in patients with hepatitis C (HCV) who are receiving pegylated-interferon (Peg-IFN). 2. To determine whether paroxetine can prevent subsyndromal increases in depression and anxiety in patients with HCV who are receiving Peg-IFN. 3. To determine whether paroxetine can prevent a significant change in the health related quality of life in patients with HCV who are receiving Peg-IFN. 4. To determine whether paroxetine improves compliance with Peg-IFN therapy for HCV. 5. To determine whether paroxetine enables patients to complete Peg-IFN therapy for HCV who might otherwise require a dose reduction or discontinuation because of neuropsychiatric side effects.</brief_summary>
