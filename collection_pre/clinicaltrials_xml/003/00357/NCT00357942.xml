	<brief_summary>Stomatitis/oral mucositis is a common side effect to chemotherapy. Stomatitis is often associated with painful ulcers in the mouth. The study hypothesis is that morphine administrated as a mouthwash can relieve stomatitis-related pain by a local analgesic effect. The purpose of this study is to test the analgesic effect of a morphine mouthwash versus morphine injections or placebo (no active drug) in children/adolescents with stomatitis related to chemotherapy. Besides the investigational drugs (morphine mouthwash and morphine injections) the children/adolescents receive a standardized analgesic treatment for stomatitis-related pain.</brief_summary>
