	<brief_summary>B8: Atrial fibrillation and the risk of neurological complications Twenty-five thousand acute strokes are caused by atrial fibrillation every year. But even more frequent than symptomatic strokes are silent infarctions of the brain. Silent strokes remain undetected in most cases, but cumulate over time and progressively impair cognition. The impact of atrial fibrillation on subacute brain infarctions is not yet known. Moreover, it has not been elucidated so far how effective different therapeutic strategies in the treatment of atrial fibrillation prevent cognitive impairment. Thus, this study aims at evaluating the influence of different types of atrial fibrillation on silent strokes and the related impairment in cognitive functions. Other risk factors and cardiovascular diseases that are known to provoke the development of strokes will be assessed as well. So, it will be possible to isolate the contribution of atrial fibrillation to silent strokes and related cognitive impairment in segregation to other relevant factors. AF patients and controls will be examined twice in two years in order to evaluate the role of atrial fibrillation and differential therapeutic interventions with regard to the progression of silent strokes and cognitive impairment in a within subject-design.</brief_summary>
