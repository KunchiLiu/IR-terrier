	<brief_title>Continuous Use of the Contraceptive Patch and the Personal Economic Impact.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>30 adult women, 18-40 years of age, will be recruited to participate in a six month study. The focus of recruitment will be on women with menstrual-related symptoms who are currently working in physically demanding, low autonomous service jobs. The approximate first two months of women's participation will be spent documenting baseline information about their health and well-being, work patterns and performance, and the economic impact of their menstruation. Subjects will then initiate two, two month intervals of continuous use of ORTHO EVRA. Over this four month treatment period, subjects will document their health and well-being, work patterns and performance, and the economic impact of their menstruation while being treated with ORTHO EVRA. This will allow us to compare subjects' experiences pre- and post-treatment. The study's instruments will focus on eliciting information on the personal and economic costs of menstruation such as measuring time missed from work, changes in productivity and work satisfaction, and impact on quality of life.</detailed_description>
