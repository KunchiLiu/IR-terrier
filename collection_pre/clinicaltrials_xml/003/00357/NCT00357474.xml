	<criteria>The evidences of HBV(+) &amp;/or HCV(+) infection or liver cirrhosis Two to three tumor nodules with ChildPugh classification A or single to three tumor nodules with ChildPugh classification B The maximal, longest diameter of tumor mass measured by CT finding should be less than 2 cm. 1) Only for newly detected HCCs which were not treated before or 2) If treated before, it should be noted that there is no evidence of recurrence within the latest 6 months and, and also it should be remotely recurred more than 2cm apart from primary lesion. It should be compatible with the typical findings of HCCs radiologically(MD CT or dynamic MRI) In case of hepatic vein or portal vein invasion radiologically(CT or MRI)</criteria>
