	<brief_summary>This phase II trial is studying how well belinostat works in treating patients with myelodysplastic syndromes. Belinostat may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Belinostat in Treating Patients With Myelodysplastic Syndromes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Establish the efficacy and safety of PXD101 (belinostat) in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes that progressed after or is ineligible for azacitidine treatment. II. Assess the biological activity of PXD101 in these patients via assays of histone acetylation, gene expression profiling, and DNA methylation. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive belinostat intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving complete response, partial response, or hematologic improvement after 4 courses receive 4 additional courses of therapy. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3-6 months for up to 3 years.</detailed_description>
