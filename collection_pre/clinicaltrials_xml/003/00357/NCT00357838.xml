	<brief_title>Pulse Waves and Tongue Diagnosis Differences Between Follicular and Luteal Phase in Normal Healthy Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>As comparing with follicular and menstrual phases of the cycle, in women during the luteal phase, the heart rate, body temperature, foot skin temperature and body weight were significantly increased. Tongue inspection and pulse examination are two methods that Chinese medical doctors are used in the diagnosis of patterns. Pulse wave analysis of the radial artery is a non-invasive, widely applicable technique for assessing cardiovascular function. Radial artery waveforms have been demonstrated being associated with the blood pressure wave of ascending and central aorta, the function of left ventricle , the arterial wall properties and the endothelial function. Even when measure locally, carries characteristic information from the whole arterial system because of reflection of waves at distinct sites of the arterial system. Examination of the changes of the arterial pulse wave between follicular phase may offer valuable insights into cardiovascular physiologic feature in menstrual cycle. The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that the cyclic variations in hemodynamic and volume parameters during the menstrual cycle among normal healthy women. To that end we compared the following parameter of radial pulse contour between late follicular and late luteal time point: percussion wave, the difference between dicrotic wave and dicrotic notch, and the area of the wave.</detailed_description>
