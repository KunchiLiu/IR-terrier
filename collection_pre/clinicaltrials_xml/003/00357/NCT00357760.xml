	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial studies how well ziv-aflibercept (VEGF Trap) works in treating patients with kidney cancer that has spread from the primary site to other places in the body (metastatic) or is unable to be removed with surgery (unresectable). Ziv-aflibercept may stop the growth of kidney cancer by blocking blood flow to the tumor.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ziv-Aflibercept in Treating Patients With Metastatic or Unresectable Kidney Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: I. To determine the effect of two different doses of AVE0005 (vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF] Trap [ziv-aflibercept]) treatment on the progression-free proportion at 8 weeks in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma who had previous treatment with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the effect of AVE0005 (VEGF Trap) treatment on objective response rate in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma who have had previous TKI treatment. II. To describe progression-free survival among patients who undergo dose escalation following progression on low-dose AVE0005 (VEGF Trap). III. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of AVE0005 (VEGF Trap) in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma who have had previous treatment with a TKI. OTHER PRE-SPECIFIED OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the circulating levels of VEGF AVE0005 (VEGF-Trap) complex and correlate it with clinical activity. II. To evaluate the modulation of specific angiogenesis-related protein expression by AVE0005 (VEGF Trap). OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. ARM A (Higher dose of VEGF Trap): Patients receive a higher dose of ziv-aflibercept intervenously (IV) over 1 hour on day 1. ARM B (Lower dose of VEGF Trap): Patients receive a lower dose of ziv-aflibercept IV over 1 hour on day 1. In both arms, courses repeat every 14 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients receiving treatment on Arm B may crossover and receive treatment on Arm A at the time of disease progression. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 1 year.</detailed_description>
