	<brief_title>Study to Determine the Sensitizing Potential of PEP005 Topical Gel in Healthy Volunteers Using a Repeat Insult Patch Test Design</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a repeat insult patch test study. On treatment days, the investigational product PEP005 Topical Gel (0.01% concentration) and vehicle control will be applied under open conditions to sites on the infrascapular region of the back 3 times weekly for 3 weeks (9 applications in total) during the induction phase. Following a rest period of approximatley 10-14 days, a single challenge application will be performed. Local tolerability will be assessed visually using an ordinal scoring system. If a cutaneous response observed in the challenge phase indicates possible sensitisation, or at the discretion of the investigator, a rechallenge will occur</detailed_description>
