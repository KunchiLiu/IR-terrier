	<brief_summary>Malaria is fatal and increases the risk of death among children with sickle cell anemia. Chemoprophylaxis significantly improves quality of life in these children. In Uganda Chloroquine is the drug of choice for prophylaxis and yet it's effectiveness is limited due to high levels of resistance throughout the country. Intermittent presumptive treatment with sulfadoxine - Pyrimethamine a new approach to malaria prevention, has shown great potential in reducing incidence of malaria and anaemia among high risk groups such as pregnant women and infants. However no studies have been done in Uganda to determine if presumptive treatment with sulfadoxine- pyrimethamine reduces the incidence of malaria in children with sickle cell anaemia. Hypothesis : Presumptive treatment with sulfadoxine- Pyrimethamine is better than weekly chloroquine in reducing incidence of malaria in children with sickle cell anaemia.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Malaria is fatal and increases the risk of death among children with sickle cell anemia. Chemoprophylaxis significantly improves quality of life in these children. In Uganda Chloroquine is the drug of choice for prophylaxis and yet it's effectiveness is limited due to high levels of resistance throughout the country. Intermittent presumptive treatment with sulfadoxine - pyrimethamine a new approach to malaria prevention, has shown great potential in reducing incidence of malaria and anemia among high risk groups such as pregnant women and infants. However no studies have been done in Uganda to determine if presumptive treatment with sulfadoxine- pyrimethamine reduces incidence of malaria among high risk group such as children with sickle cell anaemia. We calculated a sample size of 110 patients in each group for a power of 95% assuming that the incidence of malaria in children receiving weekly chloroquine will be 0.36 and those receiving presumptive treatment with sulfadoxine - pyrimethamine the incidence would be 0.16 according to (schellenberg et al )</detailed_description>
