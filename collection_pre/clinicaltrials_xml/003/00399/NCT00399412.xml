	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to collect surface electrograms from standard and several non-standard configurations in patients with long QT syndrome, heart failure, cardiac resynchronization therapy or wide QRS during a routine outpatient assessment. The ECGs collected will be used as test signals by the sponsor for the development of a subcutaneous implantable defibrillator</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>ECG Signal Collection From Long QT Syndrome, Wide QRS Complexes, Heart Failure, and Cardiac Resynchronization Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective of this study is to record standard ECG signals is each of the 4 patient populations together with signals from 4 non-standard surface positions when these patients attend the outpatient department for follow-up. The non-standard electrode positions mimic the positions of the subcutaneous electrodes of the subcutaneous implantable defibrillator (S-ICD) system in development by Cameron Health. The collection of these signals will allow bench testing of the algorithms proposed for the S-ICD system. Additionally, it will allow a comparison of the response of different defibrillators to these same signals to asses how each would treat a particular rhythm.</detailed_description>
