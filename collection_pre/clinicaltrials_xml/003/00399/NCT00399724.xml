	<brief_summary>Primary objective: - To determine the optimal treatment algorithm for the clinical use of insulin glargine based on the incidence of severe hypoglycaemia. Secondary objectives: - To determine for each treatment algorithm the incidence of asymptomatic, symptomatic and nocturnal hypoglycaemia. - To determine the difference in glycaemic control as measured by HbA1c and fasting blood glucose between the treatment algorithms. - To determine the difference in glycaemic control as measured by HbA1c and fasting blood glucose between baseline and end of treatment. - To obtain safety data on the use of insulin glargine in each treatment algorithm. - To measure change in subject weight and insulin dose between baseline and end of treatment. - To determine subject quality of life and treatment satisfaction (sub-study)</brief_summary>
