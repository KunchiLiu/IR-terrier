	<brief_summary>Our hypothesis is that ex vivo activated immune cells would produce multiple known and unknown potent hematopoietic cytokines, working in concert, these cytokines help stem cell growth and differentiation. Additionally, these cells travel and home to bone marrow as well as spleen and liver involved in hematopoietic activities, where direct cell-cell contact may be beneficial.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients will be required to stay in our hospitals to receive the immunotherapy. Allogeneic peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy donors and the autologous peripheral mononuclear cells will alternately used for the treatment. Patients are expected to spend at least 6 to 12 months in the hospital and won't be released until they have improved significantly.</detailed_description>
