	<brief_summary>Chronic viral hepatitis C is a frequent liver disease. It is associated with variable degree of hepatic fibrosis. To date, liver histology is still regarded as the gold standard to detect, diagnose and quantify liver fibrosis. This requires to perform a liver biopsy. Severe complications are associated to this procedure in 0.01 to 0.1% of cases. Because of this, the repetition of the biopsy to evaluate the progression of the disease or the response to treatment poses ethical questions. Also, liver biopsy only explore a minimal portion of the liver and liver fibrosis, which is not homogeneous, may be under- or over-estimated. To avoid risks linked to invasive technique and sampling errors associated to liver biopsy, efforts are being made to develop non-invasive technology to detect and quantitate liver fibrosis. In this study we will perform in patients with chronic hepatitis C, serum tests, fibroscan (elastography of liver parenchyma determined by ultra-sounds), and elastography of liver parenchyma by MRI. This study will allow - to determine whether non-invasive tests effectively measure liver fibrosis - to compare each non-invase test with results of liver biopsy - to determine whether a non-invasive test or a combination of non invasive tests may be used to accurately evaluate liver fibrosis in patients with chronic hepatitis C.</brief_summary>
