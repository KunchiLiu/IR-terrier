	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to assess the effects of varying pulse width in suprathreshold dorsal column stimulation in patients with low back pain.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Pulse Width With Spinal Cord Stimulation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will generate data which may allow Precision SCS devices to be used or programmed in such a way as to relieve pain while minimizing any uncomfortable sensations. This study will extend anecdotal reports into a prospective analysis of outcome data. Patients invited to participate in this study will have recently been implanted with the Precision system, or will be eligible for SCS therapy and will have already selected therapy with the Advanced Bionics Precision system, independent of possible inclusion in this study.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Have chronic low back pain following spine surgery (Failed Back Surgery Syndrome), which is primarily located in the low back, with minimal lower extremity pain. Have been permanently implanted with a Precision spinal cord stimulation (SCS) system within 6 months, or be an appropriate candidate for SCS and for the surgical procedures required for SCS as determined by the physician and have independently selected SCS with Precision for treatment. Be 18 years of age or older. Be willing and able to comply with all study related procedures and visits. Be capable of reading and understanding patient information materials and giving written informed consent. Have any significant medical condition that is likely to interfere with study procedures or likely to confound evaluation of study endpoints. Have any other chronic pain condition likely to confound evaluation of study endpoints.</criteria>
