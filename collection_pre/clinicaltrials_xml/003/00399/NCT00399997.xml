	<brief_title>Evaluation of Effect of Exercise on Prescription</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Exercise prescriptions are used for initiating a physical active lifestyle in sedentary populations. A Danish project called ‘Exercise on Prescription’ (EoP) is implemented in primary healthcare. Patients eligible for EoP are non-institutionalised adults with medically controlled lifestyle diseases or risk factors of lifestyle diseases, who are motivated to change lifestyle, able to improve health status through a physical active lifestyle, and willing to pay a fee of €100 for the intervention. The purpose of this study is to assess the effect on: 1) maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max), 2) bodyweight and Body Mass Index, 3) glycemic control (in patients with impaired glucose tolerance), 4) physical activity level, and 5) health related quality of life. The EoP-group is compared to a control group.</detailed_description>
