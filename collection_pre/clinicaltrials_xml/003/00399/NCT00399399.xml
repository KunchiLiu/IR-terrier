	<brief_summary>To assess the efficacy of systemic corticosteroids alone as first-line treatment of Churg–Strauss syndrome without poor-prognosis factors as defined by the five-factor score (FFS=0), and to compare the efficacy and safety of azathioprine vs pulse cyclophosphamide as adjunctive immunosuppressive therapy to treat failure or relapse</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CHUSPAN SCS BP Treatment of Churg–Strauss Syndrome Without Poor-Prognosis Factors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All patients initially treated with systemic corticosteroids alone: optional IV methylprednisolone pulse (15 mg/kg) at treatment start followed by oral prednisone (1 mg/kg/day) according to a tapering schedule. Treating physicians allowed to treat minor relapses with corticosteroids without referring the patient for randomization, as long as the prednisone dose did not exceed 0.5 mg/kg for 1 month. Patients in whom prednisone doses could not be tapered below 20 mg, those who failed to enter remission and those who relapsed were randomized to receive either 6 months of oral azathioprine (2mg/kg/day) or 6 cyclophosphamide pulses (0.6g/m2 D1, D15, D30 then every month)</detailed_description>
