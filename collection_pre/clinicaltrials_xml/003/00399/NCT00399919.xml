	<brief_summary>Patients with peripheral artery disease have decreased blood flow to exercising muscle causing pain. This decreased blood flow to the muscle affects the level of acylcarnitines which in turn decreases the level of carnitine. Carnitine allows muscles to function properly. This study will test the safety and efficacy of Propionyl-L-Carnitine taken in combination with a monitored exercise training program.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy of Propionyl-L-Carnitine in the Treatment of Peripheral Arterial Disease (Intermittent Claudication)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To test the hypothesis that Propionyl-L-Carnitine taken in combination with monitored exercise training may improve exercise performance the study will randomize male or female adults with peripheral artery disease and claudication to receive either Proprionyl-L-Carnitine or Placebo.</detailed_description>
