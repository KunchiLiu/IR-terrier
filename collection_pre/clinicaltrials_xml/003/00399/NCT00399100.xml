	<brief_summary>People who has been in a fire accident have been shown often to be cyanide poisoned as well as poisoned with carbon monoxide(CO). According to recommendations from the Danish Health Agency people who are CO poisoned must be treated with hyperbaric oxygen (HBO). We want to see if HBO treatment can also treat cyanide poisoning. The hypothesis is that as cyanide binds the same place in the mitochondria as CO cyanide will be detached from the mitochondria like CO and diffuse back to the blood.This way it will be easier to treat with hydroxycobalamin.</brief_summary>
