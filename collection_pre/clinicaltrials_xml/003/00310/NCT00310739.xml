	<brief_summary>We previously reported early measurement of urinary MDA might be a useful marker for the prediction of CDDP-induced renal damage in rat. The purpose of this clinical study is to test whether the changes of human urinary excretion of MDA, and can be used as early biomarker for the prediction of development of CDDP-induced ARF.</brief_summary>
