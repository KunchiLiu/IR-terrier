	<brief_summary>The impact of sodium intake on plasma drug concentrations has previously been reported in the literature for verapamil and quinidine but, to the investigators' knowledge, never with renin-angiotensin system blockers such as AT1R antagonists and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Sodium Intake on (PK/PD) Relationship of a Single Dose of a Renin Angiotensin System-Blocker</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The impact of sodium intake on plasma drug concentrations concentrations obtained after a single oral dose of RAS blocking drugs (ramipril 10 mg, valsartan 160 mg, candesartan 8 mg) or a blocker as control (ATENOLOL 50 mg) will be compared in healthy normotensive men randomly assigned to a 6-day replated-sodium diet or a sodium depletion.</detailed_description>
