	<brief_summary>The aim of this trial is to evaluate if P-15 bone putty (investigational device) is not inferior in effectiveness and safety to local autologous bone (control device) when applied in instrumented anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) with use of a structural allograft ring in patients with degenerative cervical disc disease..</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Assessment of P-15 Bone Putty in Anterior Cervical Fusion With Instrumentation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Anterior Cervical Discectomy and Fusion (ACDF) is a common surgical treatment option for symptomatic degenerative cervical disk disease in patients who fail conservative treatment. i-FACTOR bone graft is a unique anorganic bone mineral (ABM) and small peptide, P-15â„¢. P-15 is a synthetic fifteen amino acid polypeptide that mimics the cell-binding domain of Type I human collagen and is responsible for osteogenic cell attachment via alpha2-beta1 integrins. This is randomized, controlled, multi-center, prospective FDA IDE study conducted to assess the safety and effectiveness of i-FACTOR bone graft (Cerapedics, Inc. Westminster, CO) in patients treated with single level ACDF. Patients received i-FACTOR bone graft or local autologous bone inside a structural allograft.</detailed_description>
