	<brief_summary>Primary objective: To compare the pharmacodynamics of insulin glulisine and insulin lispro injected subcutaneously before three 500 kcal standard meals during a 12 hour day, in obese subjects with type 2 diabetes. Secondary objectives: - To compare the pharmacokinetics of insulin glulisine and insulin lispro in obese subjects with type 2 diabetes, injected subcutaneously before three standard meals during a 12-hour day. - The safety of insulin glulisine, the relationship of the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics with skin thickness and C-peptide, non-esterified fatty acid, triglyceride and β-hydroxybutyrate levels in these subjects will also be assessed.</brief_summary>
