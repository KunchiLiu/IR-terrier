	<brief_title>Comparison Between Tramadol Hcl and Other Analgesics in the Treatment of Renal Colic</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Renal stones is a common condition affecting up to 1% of the american population. The main symptom is renal colic. Acute treatment is based on the administration of analgesics mainly those belonging to non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Tramadol is an analgesic of the opioid class of analgesics (i.e morphine) and it is considered to cause less side effects with more or less the same analgesic potency. In the present study the analgesic effect of intramuscular Tramadol will be compared with Voltaren (NSAID)in patients attending the Emergency Department (ED) for acute renal colic (Stage I). Most of these patients will not pass their stone during their visit to the ED and they are prone to develop another attack of renal colic.In the second phase of the study (Stage II)patients who improved, and are ready to go home, will be enrolled to get Dipyrone or Tramadol orally for the prevention of further pain.</detailed_description>
