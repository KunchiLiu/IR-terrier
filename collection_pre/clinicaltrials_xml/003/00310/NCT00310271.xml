	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate how well the vaccine is tolerated at sites where administrations are given and any effects it may have on subjects' wellbeing. The study will also test the ability of vaccine to cause particular immune responses in the body.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Safety Study to Assess a DNA Vaccine Administered by Particle Mediated Delivery to the Skin in Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) infection is a serious public health problem, with up to 20% of the US population infected. Following primary infection, HSV-2 establishes a latent infection that can lead to recurrent disease when the virus reactivates. Genital lesions are often experienced with viral recurrence and these can be uncomfortable and painful, resulting in significant anxiety and social distress. There are no commercial vaccines available for therapy of HSV-2 infection.The aim of a therapeutic vaccine would be to enhance such natural responses by boosting the appropriate cellular immune response to HSV-2 in those latently infected individuals who experience frequent and unwanted reactivations. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability profile of a therapeutic DNA vaccine (pPJV7630) in combination with a DNA encoded immunostimulator (pPJV2012) when administered by Particle Mediated Epidermal Delivery (PMED)</detailed_description>
