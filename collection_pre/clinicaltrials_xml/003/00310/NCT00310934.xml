	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to compare optimally given methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) for heroin dependence with a novel, sequential strategy, where patients are offered buprenorphine as first line treatment, allowed dose adjustments as needed, and switched to methadone if the maximal dose of buprenorphine is insufficient.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The objective of this study is to compare optimally given methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) for heroin dependence with a novel, sequential strategy (STEP), where patients are offered buprenorphine as first line treatment, allowed dose adjustments as needed, and switched to methadone if the maximal dose of buprenorphine is insufficient. For this purpose, 96 subjects at two centers (Uppsala and Stockholm) are randomized to MMT or STEP and followed for 6 months. Retention in treatment is the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes in completers are proportion urine samples free of illicit opiates on app. twice weekly sampling, and problem severity as measured by a semistructured interview, the Addiction Severity Index (ASI) at baseline and after 3 and 6 months.</detailed_description>
