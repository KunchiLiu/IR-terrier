	<brief_title>A Treatment Study Comparing Two Non-Drug, Self-Help Treatment of Chronic Insomnia.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic primary insomnia is a highly prevalent condition, affecting up to 15% of the population. The condition is associated with daytime fatigue, lack of concentration, and decreased quality of life. Most people with chronic primary insomnia go untreated, because of a desire to avoid medication or lack of access to quality non-drug treatments. Therefore, an affordable, easy to use, and effective computer to help assess and treat insomnia symptoms could bring treatment to this population. Comparison: We are comparing a new handheld computer that uses cognitive-behavioral treatment principles to a popular self-help manual for the treatment of primary insomnia symptoms.</detailed_description>
