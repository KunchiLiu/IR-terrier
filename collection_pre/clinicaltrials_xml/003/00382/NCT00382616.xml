	<brief_title>Supplementation of Phosphatidylserine (PS) and n-3 Long Chain Fatty Acids (EPA, DHA) in Children With ADHD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) encompasses a broad constellation of behavioral and learning problems, clinically describes inattentive, impulsive, and/or hyperactive children. These patients are characterized by low blood LC-PUFA (LC-PUFA) levels; however the LC-PUFA supplementation effect on ADHD symptoms is not clear. METHODS Eighty-three ADHD children (3:1 boys:girls), 8-13 years old, were assigned in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel design to receive 250 mg/d of eicosapentaenoic acid + docosahexaenoic acid provided as phosphatidylserine (300 mg/d PS-Omega3), or fish oil or placebo for 3 months. Stimulant medication or other dietary supplements were prohibited. The measured outcomes were inattention and impulsivity, evaluated by Test of Variables of Attention (TOVA) and blood lipids profile.</detailed_description>
