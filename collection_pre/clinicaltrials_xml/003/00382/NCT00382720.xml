	<brief_summary>This phase II study addressed the use of docetaxel in combination with oxaliplatin with or without 5-FU or capecitabine in metastatic or locally recurrent gastric cancer previously untreated with chemotherapy for advanced disease. Prior to this study a pilot phase I (part I) determined the optimal dose by assessing the safety and tolerability of 2 dose levels in each arm. The optimal dose was administered in the Part II study. Participants who received the optimal dose in each treatment arm in Part I were included in the Part II analysis population. Primary objective: - To assess the time to progression (TTP) of Docetaxel in combination with Oxaliplatin with or without 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) or Capecitabine in metastatic or locally recurrent gastric cancer previously untreated with chemotherapy for advanced disease (part II). Secondary objectives: - To establish the safety profile. - To assess the Overall Response Rate (ORR) based on the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria - To assess the Overall Survival (OS)</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study (Part II) was to evaluate the time to progression in the 3 arms at an optimal dose level of docetaxel and oxaliplatin defined during a prior pilot (Part I) phase study. The estimated duration of treatment was to be 6 months. Treatment was to be administered up to progression, unacceptable toxicities, or withdrawal of consent. The reason and date of removal of all participants was documented on the case report form. Participants who ended treatment but had not yet progressed (e.g. unacceptable toxicities or withdrawal of consent) were be followed every 8 weeks with a complete tumor assessment until documented progression or further anti-tumor therapy. Then, they would be followed every 3 months after progression for survival status; date of death or progression were reported. Participants who ended treatment for progression, were to be followed every 3 months until death. Date of death was reported. The planned duration of the study was 30 months.</detailed_description>
