	<brief_summary>Patients come to their doctor showing possible symptoms of a movement disorder. It is possible that these symptoms may get worse over time. There is more than one disease that can cause such symptoms. The most common movement disorder illnesses are Parkinson´s Disease and Essential Tremor. Sometimes it is difficult for doctors to make the right diagnosis because the symptoms caused by these illnesses are almost the same. On the other hand the correct treatment for Parkinson´s Disease is different from the correct treatment for Essential Tremor. This study aims to see whether having pictures of the brain taken with DaTSCAN can affect the way the doctor treats these patients and whether it can affect their quality of life directly.</brief_summary>
