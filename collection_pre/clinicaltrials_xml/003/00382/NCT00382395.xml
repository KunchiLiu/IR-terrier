	<brief_summary>Study Objective: To establish the substantial equivalence of the SOLX Gold Shunt to commercially available aqueous shunts, specifically the Ahmed™ Glaucoma Valve Model FP7, in the ability to reduce intraocular pressure (IOP) associated with glaucoma in eyes where medical and conventional surgical treatments have failed.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>SOLX Gold Shunt Versus Control Implant: Randomized Trial for Refractory Glaucoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This protocol is a randomized, controlled, multi-center, outpatient study to compare the IOP lowering ability and safety profile of the SOLX Gold Shunt to the selected, commercially available aqueous shunt product (i.e., Control shunt Model FP7 Ahmed™ Glaucoma Valve Flexible Plate™) for a period of up to one year. Extended follow up is scheduled for a period not to exceed two years, should this be necessary for regulatory purposes. Follow-up beyond one year will be expected unless other patients with SOLX Gold Shunt implants in earlier phase studies outside the US clearly show no significant adverse effects associated with the long-term use of the device for follow-up periods exceeding one year, and this information is deemed adequate to reduce the required follow-up period under this protocol to a shorter period, such as 6 months for the last-to-enter patients at the time of filing for 510(k) marketing clearance review with the FDA.</detailed_description>
