	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Radiofrequency ablation uses a high-frequency, electric current to kill tumor cells. Diagnostic procedures, such as PET scan and CT scan, may help doctors measure the patient's response to treatment. PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying PET scan and CT scan to see how well they work in evaluating response to treatment in patients undergoing radiofrequency ablation for lung metastases.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PET Scan and CT Scan in Evaluating Response in Patients Undergoing Radiofrequency Ablation for Lung Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the accuracy of positron emission tomography (PET) and CT scan in measuring response at 3 months after radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in patients with lung metastases. Secondary - Determine the agreement between observers analyzing PET/CT scan results. - Determine the outcome of these patients. - Determine the false-positive rate and false-negative rate of PET/CT scan at 1 and 3 months in these patients. - Determine the optimal time for obtaining a negative PET scan. - Determine the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of PET/CT scan at 1 and 3 months. - Determine the morbidity associated with RFA. - Determine the disease-free survival after RFA and the factors predicting recurrent disease in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients undergo positron emission tomography (PET) and CT scan at baseline. Patients then undergo radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for lung metastases. PET/CT scan is repeated at 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months after RFA. After completion of RFA, patients are followed by clinical examination and conventional scanning at 6, 9, and 12 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 80 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
