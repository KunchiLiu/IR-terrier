	<brief_summary>The purpose of this project is to see if weekly carboplatin compared with phenoxodiol in combination with weekly carboplatin, is effective against late stage ovarian cancer and to see what, if any, side-effects of treatment may result.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Histologicallyconfirmed ovarian, fallopian, or primary peritoneal carcinoma of epithelial origin Recurrent or persistent advanced disease Have measurable disease Undergone at least two courses of therapy with a platinum drug (cisplatin or carboplatin) and have responded to the first of those courses of therapy as determined by either Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) or Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup (GCIG) criteria Disease relapse as determined by either RECIST or GCIG criteria within 6 months of completion of the second or greater course of platinum therapy using a 2, 3 or 4weekly regimen and platinumfree interval of no greater than 6 months at the time of enrollment, being the time taken from the last day of platinum therapy Any number of previous courses of platinum therapy or nonplatinum therapy Likely to survive at least 3 months Karnofsky performance score of at least 60% Have adequate physiological function without evidence of major organ dysfunction as evidenced by: serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 mg/dl serum transaminase levels â‰¤ 3 x the upper limit of normal (ULN) for the reference laboratory and bilirubin level &lt; ULN Have adequate hematological function defined by: platelets &gt; 100,000/mm3 white cell counts (WCC) &gt; 3,000/mm3 neutrophils &gt; 1,500/mm3 hemoglobin &gt; 8.0 g/dl Aged &gt; 18 Be able to understand the risks and benefits of the study and give written informed consent to participation. Patients with mucinous histological type of ovarian cancer Patients who have failed to show a clinical response (RECIST or GCIG criteria) to at least one prior course of platinum therapy Patients with active infection Patients with concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled medical disease (e.g., uncontrolled diabetes, hypertension, ischemic heart disease, congestive heart failure, etc.) Patients with a history of chronic active hepatitis or cirrhosis Patients with HIV Patients with active central nervous system (CNS) metastases. Patients with known CNS metastases must have received prior radiation therapy, and CNS metastatic disease must be stable for 4 weeks. Patients who have not recovered from the acute effects of any prior antineoplastic therapy Patients with known hypersensitivity to platinum drugs that cannot be managed with concomitant medication.</criteria>
