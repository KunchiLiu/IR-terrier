	<brief_summary>Abnormalities of glucose, insulin and lipoprotein metabolism are common in patients with hypertension, and these metabolic abnormalities are reported to be related to insulin resistance. Therefore, whenever treating such patients, antihypertensive agents that may have the added effect of improving insulin resistance should be selected. CinalongTM (Cilnidipine) is expected to improve metabolic syndrome as well as insulin resistance by its dual effects on L and N-type calcium (Ca) channels. In this study, the researchers investigate the effects of CinalongTM on insulin resistance and other metabolic related factors.</brief_summary>
