	<brief_summary>This study was an international, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in subjects with PAH who were currently receiving approved therapy for their PAH (i.e., endothelin receptor antagonist and/or phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor). Study visits occurred at 4 week intervals for 16 weeks; the key measure of efficacy was the 6-minute walk test. Study procedures included routine blood tests, medical history, physical exams, disease evaluation, and exercise tests. One optional substudy was also a part of FREEDOM-C at select centers - a hemodynamic substudy with a right heart catheterization at Baseline and Week 16. Patients who completed all assessments for 16-weeks were also eligible to enter an open-label, extension phase study (FREEDOM - EXT).</brief_summary>

Baseline 6minute walk distance between 150 and 450 meters, inclusive. Currently receiving an approved endothelin receptor antagonist and/or an approved phosphodiesterase5 inhibitor for at least 90 days and on a stable dose for at least the last 30 days. Previous testing (e.g., right heart catheterization, echocardiography) consistent with the diagnosis of PAH. Reliable and cooperative with protocol requirements. Nursing or pregnant.
