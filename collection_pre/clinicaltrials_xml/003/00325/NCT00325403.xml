	<brief_summary>This study was an international, multicenter, randomized (2:1 active:placebo), double-blind, placebo-controlled study in subjects with PAH who were NOT currently receiving approved therapy for their PAH. Study visits occurred at 4 week intervals for 12 weeks (with an additional visit at Week 11) with the key measure of efficacy being the 6-minute walk test. Study procedures included routine blood tests, medical history, physical exams, disease evaluation, and exercise tests. Two optional substudies were also a part of FREEDOM-M at select centers - a hemodynamic substudy with a right heart catheterization at Baseline and Week 12 and a genetics and biomarkers substudy with blood samples collected at Baseline and Week 12. Patients who completed all assessments for 12 weeks were also eligible to enter an open-label, extension phase study (FREEDOM - EXT).</brief_summary>
