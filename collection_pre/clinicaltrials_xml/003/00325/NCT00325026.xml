	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the time to delivery of two different cervical ripening methods on the preterm gestation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomized Trial Comparing Misoprostol and Foley Bulb for Labor Induction in the Preterm Gestation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Labor induction for the preterm gestation is indicated for various maternal and fetal indications. The preterm cervix, however, is frequently not favorable for induction. Multiple methods have been evaluated in the term gestation. As these comparison studies have not included the preterm gestation, this study seeks to evaluate these two methods in terms of safety, efficacy and time to delivery.</detailed_description>
