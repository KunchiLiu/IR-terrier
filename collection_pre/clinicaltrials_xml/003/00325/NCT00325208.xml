	<brief_summary>It is increasingly recognised that rapid growth in infancy may be associated with a greater risk of cardiovascular disease later in life. This trial will investigate whether the use of infant feeding bottles with different designs influences the milk intake and growth of infants. We will compare the growth of bottle-fed infants with that of a breast-fed reference group.</brief_summary>
