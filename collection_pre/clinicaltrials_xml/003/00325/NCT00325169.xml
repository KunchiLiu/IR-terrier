	<brief_summary>This study was designed to evaluate the effects on lung function of a combination of SERETIDE 50/500mcg twice daily plus tiotropium bromide 18mcg once daily compared with the individual treatments (tiotropium bromide 18mcg once daily alone and SERETIDE 50/500mcg twice daily alone) in subjects with COPD. The study will utilise a three-way cross-over design with a 2-week wash-out period between each 2-week consecutive treatment period.</brief_summary>
