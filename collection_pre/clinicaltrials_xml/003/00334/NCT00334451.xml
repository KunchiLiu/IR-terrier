	<brief_summary>The RAPID-RF Registry aims to characterize LATITUDE® Patient Management's alert feature: LATITUDE Active Monitoring™ by evaluating type and frequency of alert notifications and alert-related medical interventions. This registry will also assess clinical outcomes including quality of life and New York Heart Association Class changes over time, mortality, hospitalizations and heart failure-related event rates.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients who meet current indications for a Guidant RFenabled CRTD device (e.g. CONTAK RENEWAL 3 RF family of CRTD devices) which is compatible with the LATITUDE Communicator. Indications include: NYHA Class III, IV; EF of ≤ 35%; QRS duration of ≥ 120 ms; and optimized pharmacologic therapy Patients who have an analog telephone line compatible with the LATITUDE Communicator. The LATITUDE Communicator must be placed within 8 feet of where they sleep for successful remote interrogations to occur.
