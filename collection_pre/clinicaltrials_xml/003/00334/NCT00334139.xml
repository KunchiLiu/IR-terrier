	<brief_summary>Bisphosphonates have been used extensively in the treatment and the prevention of skeletal complications associated with bone metastases in patients with breast cancer and prostate cancer. The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of zoledronic acid patients with prostate cancer or breast cancer and bone metastasis.</brief_summary>
