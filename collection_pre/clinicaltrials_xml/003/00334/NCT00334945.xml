	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of growth hormone treatment on phosphorus levels in the body. Phosphorus is an important mineral for bone growth. It is well known that growth hormone treatment improves bone density and bone mineral content. The amount of phosphorus is maintained by the kidneys. Fibroblast Growth Factor 23 has recently been recognized to help kidneys control phosphate levels.</brief_summary>
