	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if the naturopathic Anti-Inflammatory Diet results in reduced inflammation and a better response by the immune system when compared to a standard diabetic diet based on the current American Diabetes Association guidelines.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>RCT of the Naturopathic Anti-Inflammatory Diet</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will test the effects of two different diets on the immune system and inflammation in diabetes and pre-diabetes. These diets are the "Anti-Inflammatory Diet" (AI Diet) used by many naturopathic doctors and a standard diabetic diet based on the American Diabetes Association recommendations (ADA Diet). The AI diet excludes wheat, dairy products, eggs, red meat, caffeine, alcohol, peanuts and certain fruits and vegetables. The ADA diet includes most foods but controls the amount of each of the food groups. Naturopathic physicians often use healthful diets to treat diseases but many of these diets have not been compared to usual medical diet treatments. We will be looking at blood markers that show how the immune system responds to the different diets. We are expecting that the AI diet will result in less inflammation and a better response by the immune system than the ADA diet. We will also be looking at levels of blood lipids and glucose to see any effects on these risk factors.</detailed_description>
