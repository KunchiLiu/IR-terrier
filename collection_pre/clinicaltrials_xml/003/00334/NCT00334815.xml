	<brief_summary>This clinical trial studies combination chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and bevacizumab in treating patients with newly diagnosed stage III non-small cell lung cancer that cannot be removed by surgery. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin, etoposide, and docetaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Bevacizumab may also stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) together with radiation therapy and bevacizumab may kill more tumor cells.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the frequency and severity of toxic effects of induction therapy comprising cisplatin, etoposide, and radiotherapy with or without bevacizumab followed by consolidation therapy comprising docetaxel and bevacizumab, in terms of grade 4 or 5 hemorrhage, in patients with newly diagnosed, unresectable, stage III non-small cell lung cancer. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine progression-free and overall survival of patients treated with these regimens. II. Determine response (confirmed, unconfirmed, partial, and complete) in patients with measurable disease treated with these regimens. OUTLINE: This is a pilot, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to risk (high* vs low). NOTE: *High-risk stratum closed to accrual as of 2/20/09. INDUCTION THERAPY: Patients in each stratum are assigned to 1 of 3 sequential treatment groups. GROUP 1: Patients receive cisplatin intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days 1, 8, 29, and 36 and etoposide IV over 1 hour on days 1-5 and 29-33. Patients undergo concurrent thoracic radiotherapy once daily on days 1-5, 8-12, 15-19, 22-26, 29-33, 36-40, and 43-47. GROUP 2: Patients receive cisplatin, etoposide, and thoracic radiotherapy as in group 1. Patients also receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on days 15, 36, and 57. GROUP 3: Patients receive cisplatin, etoposide, and thoracic radiotherapy as in group 1. Patients also receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1, 22, and 43. CONSOLIDATION CHEMOTHERAPY: Beginning 3-6 weeks after completion of induction therapy, all patients receive consolidation chemotherapy comprising docetaxel IV over 1 hour and bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1. Patients also receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) beginning on day 2 and continuing until blood counts recover OR pegfilgrastim SC once on day 2. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 4 years.</detailed_description>
