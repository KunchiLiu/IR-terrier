	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to understand how the ovarian follicle (the fluid filled structure in the ovary that contains the egg) makes estrogen and other hormones during normal aging, in women with different ethnic backgrounds, and in Fragile X premutation carriers. During reproductive aging, estradiol levels are increased, a phenomenon that may be related to increased aromatase activity. The investigators' own preliminary data suggest that estradiol is increased in African-American women compared to Caucasian women, which may also be related to aromatase activity. In addition, the investigators have examined female fragile X premutation carriers who still have regular menstrual cycles and have demonstrated evidence of early ovarian aging compared to age-matched controls. **WE ARE RECRUITING ONLY WOMEN WITH FRAGILE-X PREMUTATION**</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose of the study is to examine intrafollicular changes in aromatase and ovarian growth factors in reproductive aged women,African-American women compared to Caucasian controls, and Fragile X premutation carriers. Hypotheses: - Aromatase activity is up-regulated in preovulatory follicles with aging, accounting for the increased estradiol levels in the face of decreased inhibin secretion in reproductive aging. - Increased estradiol in the face of normal inhibin A and inhibin B suggests up-regulation of aromatase in African-American women. - Aromatase activity is down-regulated in preovulatory follicles in fragile X premutation carriers compared to age-matched controls and the activity is associated with FMR1 mRNA levels.</detailed_description>
