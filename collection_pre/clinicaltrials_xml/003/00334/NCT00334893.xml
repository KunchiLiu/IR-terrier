	<brief_summary>This phase II trial is studying how well eribulin mesylate works in treating patients with recurrent ovarian epithelial, primary peritoneal cavity, or fallopian tube cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as eribulin mesylate, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Eribulin Mesylate in Treating Patients With Recurrent Ovarian Epithelial, Primary Peritoneal Cavity, or Fallopian Tube Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the frequency of objective response (complete and partial responses) in patients with recurrent ovarian epithelial, primary peritoneal cavity, or fallopian tube cancer treated with E7389 (eribulin mesylate). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: II. Determine the toxicity profile of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to prior platinum sensitivity (yes vs no). Patients receive eribulin mesylate intravenously (IV) over 15 minutes on days 1 and 8. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 4 weeks.</detailed_description>
