	<brief_title>Tenofovir/Emtricitabine for PMTCT in Africa and Asia (ANRS 12109 TEmAA)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Single-dose nevirapine (sdNVP) is the option of choice for the prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) of HIV-1 in countries with limited resources. However, the use of sdNVP results in resistance mutations with an estimated frequency at of least 15 to 70% in women at W4-W6 postpartum. These mutations could compromise the success of subsequent treatments of mother and child with antiretroviral combinations that include NVP. Pre-clinical and clinical studies suggest that a combination of TDF and FTC, drugs with interesting pharmacokinetic properties that may be a useful alternative or complement to sdNVP. The objectives are to study the pharmacokinetic properties, safety and viral resistance pattern of the combination of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate {TDF, 600 mg} and emtricitabine {FTC, 400 mg}) in HIV-1-infected pregnant women and their newborns, with a view to prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) of HIV-1 in Africa and Asia. Phase II trial, multicentre, open-label will be conducted in two steps with 30 mother-infant pairs per step and with a balanced allocation in Abidjan (Côte d'Ivoire), Soweto (South Africa) and Phnom Penh (Cambodia): Step 1: administration of TDF/FTC to the mother; Step 2: administration of TDF/FTC to the mother and the newborn.</detailed_description>
