	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Vaccines made from a person's white blood cells mixed with tumor proteins may help the body build an effective immune response to kill melanoma cells. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well vaccine therapy works in treating patients with metastatic melanoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy in Treating Patients With Metastatic Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine clinical response in HLA-A *0201-positive patients with metastatic melanoma treated with an intradermally administered vaccine comprising autologous dendritic cells pulsed with MART-1, gp100, and tyrosinase peptides and matured with a cytokine cocktail. Secondary - Determine immunologic response in patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients undergo apheresis to collect dendritic cells (DC). Autologous DC are pulsed ex vivo with tumor antigen peptides derived from MART-1: 26-35 (27L), gp100: 209-217 (210M), and tyrosinase: 368-376 (370D) and matured with a cytokine cocktail comprising interleukin (IL)-4, IL-6, IL-1β, sargramostim (GM-CSF), tumor necrosis factor-α, and prostaglandin E2. Patients receive 12 intradermal injections of DC vaccine over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, 22, and 36. Treatment repeats every 8 weeks for up to 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically until disease progression. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 41 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
