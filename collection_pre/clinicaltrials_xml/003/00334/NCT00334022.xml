	<brief_summary>In order to better understand the source(s) and the mechanism(s) of HIV persistence and to potentially lead to further suppression of HIV from viral reservoirs, we propose to examine the effect of co-administration of enfuvirtide, an entry inhibitor of HIV, on diminution of the size of the viral reservoir in infected individuals who are receiving effective antiviral therapy for extended periods of time (&gt; 5 years).</brief_summary>
