	<brief_title>Safety and Immunogenicity Study of the Malaria Vaccines FP9 PP and MVA PP</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Malaria infection kills over 2 million people each year. It is a major problem for those who live in endemic areas and for travellers. There is clearly a great need for a safe effective malaria vaccine. The purpose of this study is to test two candidate malaria vaccines (FP9-PP and MVA-PP) in different concentrations and combinations. These live viral vectors encode a ’polyprotein’ of six fused malaria antigens expressed at liver and blood stages of the malaria parasite lifecycle. MVA-PP uses the Modified Virus Ankara vector, a weakened form of the smallpox vaccine, vaccinia. FP9-PP uses a highly attenuated avian pox virus (FP9) as the vector instead. The two vaccines will be used in combination in a ’prime boost’ strategy to enhance the response of the cellular immune system. This study will: 1. Examine safety 2. Examine immunogenicity 3. Provide a subgroup of vaccinated volunteers to test clinical efficacy in the following malaria challenge study (VAC027.2)</detailed_description>
