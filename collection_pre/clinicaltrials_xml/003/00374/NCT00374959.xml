	<brief_title>Prevention of Pneumonia Comparing Ceftriaxone With Subglottic Aspiration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: In a previous double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial we found that a 3-day-course of ceftriaxone significantly reduced the incidence of early-onset ventilator-associated pneumonia (EOP). Continuous aspiration of secretions accumulating in the subglottic space above the cuff of the endotracheal tube has also been shown to prevent EOP. Objective: To compare the effect of both preventive measures on the incidence of EOP. Design: Randomized, multicenter. Setting: Three general intensive care units at university hospitals in Spain. Patients: Patients without signs of infection and no concomitant systemic antibiotics were included if expected to require endotracheal intubation exceeding 2 days. Intervention: All patients were intubated with an endotracheal tube equipped with a port for aspiration of subglottic secretions and subsequently randomized to receive a three day course of 2 gram/day iv ceftriaxone without aspiration of subglottic secretions or continuous aspiration of subglottic secretions. Measurements: All ICU-acquired infections, antibiotic therapy, colonization and infection with 3rd-generation cephalosporin-resistant microorganisms, duration of intubation and ICU-stay and-mortality.</detailed_description>
