On a monthly basis, questionnaires are filled out about sexual desire and psychosocial, relational en sexual parameters. Also the sexual desire of the partner is questioned. On a three-monthly basis, blood samples are drawn to determine changes in hormonal parameters (one sample per product period). 75 lesbian women are doing the same trial, but during an extra 3 months period, they are asked to have their natural menstrual cyclus as a control condition. Blood samples during these extra months will be drawn at the third or fourth day after start of the menses.</brief_summary>
