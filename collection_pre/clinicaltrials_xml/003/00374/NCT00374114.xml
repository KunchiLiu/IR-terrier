	<brief_title>A Pilot Study to Evaluate Ultrasonic Surgical Aspiration as a Treatment Modality for Cervical Dysplasia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Women age 18 to 55 years of age with Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia 2 or 3 on colposcopy with a negative EndoCervical Curettage are enrolled in a pilot study comparing ultrasonic surgical aspiration and traditional cervical excision procedure for the treatment of cervical dysplasia. In this pilot study, the patients serve as their own control group. Prior to receiving the traditional treatment for cervical dysplasia consisting of Cold Knife Conization with EndoCervical Curettage, each patient's cervix is treated with ultrasonic surgical aspiration. The aspirate is sent to pathology and the results compared with the findings from the cervical cone biopsy. The patients then are followed with Liquid-based Cytology pap smears every 4 to 6 months until completion of the study enrollment/treatment period.</detailed_description>
