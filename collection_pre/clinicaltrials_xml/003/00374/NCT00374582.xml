	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to see how effective bioelectric impedance analysis (BIA) is in determining body composition (the amount of fat versus muscle in the body) and nutritional status in patients with End Stage Liver Disease (ESLD)</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>End Stage Liver Disease and Body Composition Assessment: Utilizing Bioelectric Impedance Analysis (BIA)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of this study is to report the validity of mBIA to determine body composition changes pre and post LVP (Large Volume Paracentesis) - 18 years of age or older - Cirrhotic patients with refractory ascites requiring LVP (a treatment to remove large volumes of excess fluid from the abdominal cavity) - End Stage Liver Disease</detailed_description>
