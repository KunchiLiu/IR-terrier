	<brief_title>Phase II Trial of RAD001 (Everolimus) in Previously Treated Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a phase II, two-stage, open-label, single-agent study of the experimental drug RAD001 (everolimus) in patients with previously treated small cell lung cancer. Patients may have received up to 2 prior chemotherapy regimens for small cell lung carcinoma, but no prior therapy with an m-TOR inhibitor. RAD001 will be administered orally at a dose of 10 mg daily. A cycle will be defined as 3 weeks of study drug administration, and patients will have tumor measurements every 2 cycles. Study participation will continue until disease progression or intolerable toxicities. In addition, in patients who consent, archival tumor tissue (paraffin block from original biopsy) will be collected for research purposes.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Cytologically or histologically confirmed small cell carcinoma of the lung that has progressed post firstline therapy. Mixed small and nonsmall cell tumors are excluded. 2. Prior chemotherapy for small cell carcinoma. Up to 2 prior chemotherapy regimens for small cell lung carcinoma are allowed. No prior therapy with an mTOR inhibitor (e.g. CCI779). 3. Unidimensionally measurable disease (RECIST criteria). If the only site of measurable disease is in a previously irradiated area, the patient must have documented progression of disease in this area. 4. ECOG performance status 02. 5. A minimum of 4 weeks should elapse from prior chemotherapy. Patients must have fully recovered from the effects of any prior surgery or radiation therapy or other anticancer therapies, including immunotherapy and investigational agents. 6. No progressive brain metastases. Brain metastases should have been previously treated with surgery and/or radiation. 7. Patients with a prior malignancy should have at least 3 years of diseasefree survival. Prior curatively treated squamous cell or basal carcinoma of the skin or in situ cervical cancer or other in situ malignancies are allowed. 8. No other coexisting medical condition that would preclude full compliance with the study. 9. Required laboratory values (obtained &lt; 1 week prior to enrollment): ANC &gt;/= 1500/mm³ Platelets &gt;/= 100,000/mm³ AST and ALT ≤ 3 x ULN (upper limits of normal). In patients with liver metastases AST and ALT should be &lt; 5 x ULN. Total bilirubin up to 1.5 x ULN (upper limits of normal). 10. Age &gt;/= 18 years and capacity to give informed consent. 11. Patients should be advised to discontinue drugs that interact with CYP3A4 (see list of examples in Table 3.1 of the full protocol), if medically safe. 12. All patients must have given signed, informed consent prior to registration on study. 1. Prior treatment with any investigational agent within the preceding 4 weeks. 2. Other concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled medical disease which could compromise participation in the study (i.e., uncontrolled diabetes, uncontrolled hypertension, severe infection, severe malnutrition, unstable angina, or congestive heart failure New York Heart Association Class III or IV, ventricular arrhythmias active ischemic heart disease, myocardial infarction within six months, chronic liver or renal disease, active upper GI tract ulceration). 3. A known history of HIV seropositivity. 4. Impairment of gastrointestinal function or gastrointestinal disease that may significantly alter the absorption of RAD001 (e.g., ulcerative disease, uncontrolled nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, malabsorption syndrome or small bowel resection). 5. Patients with an active, bleeding diathesis or on anticoagulation (except low dose warfarin). 6. Pregnant and lactating women are excluded from the study because the agents used in this study may be teratogenic to a fetus and there is no information on the excretion of the agents or their metabolites into breast milk. 7. Women of childbearing potential and sexually active males must agree to use an accepted and effective method of contraception (hormonal or barrier methods, abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of the study. 8. Patients should not be on chronic systemic glucocorticoids or other immunosuppressant.</criteria>
