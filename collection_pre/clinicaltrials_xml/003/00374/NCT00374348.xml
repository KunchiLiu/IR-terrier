	<brief_title>Aripiprazole in the Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia and Symptoms of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Symptoms of OCD is a rather common co-morbid condition in patients with Schizophrenia. Some studies suggest that obsessive-compulsive symptoms may be present in 7.8-46% of schizophrenic patients and who seem to be poorly responsive to drug therapy. The serotonergic medications in combination with cognitive-behavioral therapy stil remain the preferred treatment for OCD symptoms. There are controversial data regarding effect of neuroleptics on symptoms of OCD. It was noted that the use of Risperdone, Quatiapine and Clozapine might aggravate OCD symptoms. Serotonin antagonism of these neuroleptics is believed to exacerbate obsessive-compulsive symptoms in schizophrenia. On the other hand, Pourovsky M. at(2000) reported three cases of Schizophrenia with symptoms of OCD successfully treated with Olanzapine.One of our patients with Schizophrenia and co-morbid symptoms of OCD who was unsuccessfully treated with various neuroleptics in combination with anti-obsessive agents,demonstrated significant improvement in both Schizophrenic and obsessive compulsive symptoms after she was switched to Aripiprazole. This result encouraged us to initiate pilot study of effectiveness of Aripiprazole in the treatment of specific population of schizophrenic patients with symptoms of OCD.</detailed_description>
