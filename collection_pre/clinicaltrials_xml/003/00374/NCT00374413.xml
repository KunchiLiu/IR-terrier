	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to show that the Kineflex|C Spinal System is no worse than conventional Anterior Cervical Diskectomy with Fusion (ACDF) in patients with single level degenerative disc disease at any cervical level from C3 to C7.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Kineflex|C Artificial Disc System to Treat Cervical Degenerative Disc Disease (DDD)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Kineflex|C disc is a 3-piece modular design consisting of two cobalt chrome molybdenum (CCM) end-plates and a fully articulating CCM core. The system is available in two foot print sizes.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>have symptoms of cervical degenerative disc disease (DDD) at only one cervical level from C3 to C7, disc herniation on CT or MRI; have radiculopathy symptoms in neck, one or both shoulders, and/or one or both arms; have at least six months of prior conservative treatment (e.g., physical therapy and/or use of antiinflammatory medications and muscle relaxants at the manufacturer's recommended therapeutic dose), the presence of progressive symptoms (e.g., increasing numbness or tingling), or signs of nerve root compression; have moderate disability neck disability index (NDI) score; AND be likely to return for all followup visits and be willing and able to provide informed consent for study participation marked cervical instability; non discogenic neck pain or non discogenic source of symptoms; radiographic confirmation of severe facet disease or facet degeneration; bridging osteophytes; prior surgery at the level to be treated; prior fusion at any cervical level; more than one neck surgery via anterior approach; previous trauma to the C3C7 levels resulting in compression or bursting; documented presence of free nuclear fragment at any cervical level; severe myelopathy; any paralysis; history of chemical or alcohol dependence; active systemic infection; infection at the site of surgery; prior disc space infection or osteomyelitis in the cervical spine; any terminal, systemic or autoimmune disease; metabolic bone disease (e.g., osteoporosis, gout, osteomalacia, Paget's disease); any disease, condition or surgery which might impair healing; known metal allergy; arachnoiditis; currently experiencing an episode of major mental illness; pregnancy at time of enrollment, or planning to become pregnant, since this would contraindicate surgery; morbid obesity; use of spinal stimulator at any cervical level prior to surgery; currently a prisoner; currently involved in spinal litigation which may influence the subjects reporting of symptoms; OR lives more than 300 miles from study center or participation in any other investigational drug, biologic, or medical device study within the last 30 days prior to study surgery</criteria>
