	<brief_title>High Versus Standard Dose of Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs) in Peptic Ulcer Bleeding</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The recent Canadian consensus conference on the management of patients with non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding recommends a high regimen of PPIs, consisting in a dosage of 80-mg bolus followed by the 8 mg/H infusion, as being superior to the standard dosage (40 mg twice daily by bolus injection) in conjunction with some type of endoscopic therapy. However, by pooling data fromm studies comparing high doses of PPIs as continuous infusion versus regular doses as intermittent bolus, rebleeding, surgery, and mortality were not significantly different. As the previous conclusion became apparent in a meta-analytical evaluation of only 2 randomized clinical trials, more studies are needed on this topic.</detailed_description>
