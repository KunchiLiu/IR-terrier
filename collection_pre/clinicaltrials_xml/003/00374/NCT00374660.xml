	<criteria>1. Signed informed consent obtained prior to initiation of any studyspecific procedures and treatment. 2. Malignant solid tumor confirmed by a biopsy sample. 3. Pancreatic, endometrial, gastric, and hepatocellular cancer patients that have exhausted standard treatment options. 4. Measurable disease according to RECIST. 5. 18 years of age or older. 6. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status (PS): 01. 7. Life expectancy greater than 3 months. 8. Previous anticancer treatment must be discontinued at least 4 weeks prior to first dose of study treatment (6 weeks for mitomycin C, 8 weeks for bicalutamide). 9. Patients of reproductive age must be using effective contraceptive methods. 10. Negative pregnancy test for patients of reproductive potential. 1. Prior therapy with irofulven or oxaliplatin. 2. Patients who have had radiation therapy to more than 30% of the bone marrow prior to entry into the study. 3. Prior chemotherapy with nitrosoureas or high dose carboplatin (AUC &gt; 6), prior mitomycin C cumulative dose greater than or equal to 25 mg/mÂ², prior bone marrow transplant or intensive chemotherapy with stem cell support. 4. Presence of any serious concomitant systemic disorders incompatible with the study (e.g., uncontrolled congestive heart failure, active infection). 5. Any previous history of another malignancy (other than cured basal cell carcinoma of the skin or cured insitu carcinoma of the cervix) within 5 years of study entry, unless the active malignancy can be unmistakably identified by evidence such as recent biopsies or tumor specific markers. 6. Treatment with any other investigational agent, or participation in another clinical trial within 28 days prior to study entry. 7. Pregnant or lactating patients or any patient with childbearing potential not using adequate contraception. 8. Patients with retinopathy or significant visual impairment not correctable by refractory lens will be enrolled on a case by case basis according to the expected benefit ratio, taking into account the malignant disease and the existence of an objective decreased visual acuity and its degree. Please note: There are additional criteria that must be met in order to be eligible for this study.</criteria>
