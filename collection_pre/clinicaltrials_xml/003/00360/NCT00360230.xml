	<brief_summary>This study will investigate the safety and immunogenicity of 2 candidate malaria vaccines administered according to 3 different vaccination schedules in 5 to 17 months old Ghanaian children. The Protocol Posting has been updated in order to comply with the FDA Amendment Act, Sep 2007.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Partially-blind (Observer-blind) Study of Safety and Immunogenicity of Two Malaria Vaccines in Ghanaian Children</brief_title>

	<criteria>A male or female child between 5 months and 17 months of age at the time of first vaccination. Written or oral, signed or thumbprinted and witnessed informed consent obtained from the parent(s)/guardian(s) of the child. Subjects who the investigator believes that their parents/guardians can and will comply with the requirements of the protocol. Proof that child has received a full 3dose regimen of licensed Hepatitis B vaccine in infancy. Acute disease at the time of enrolment. Serious acute or chronic illness determined by clinical or physical examination and laboratory screening tests. Laboratory screening tests for haemoglobin, total white cell count, platelets, ALT and creatinine out of acceptable limits. Planned administration/administration of a vaccine (not in the scope of the study) within 30 days of the first dose of vaccine(s) with the exception of tetanus toxoid or scheduled Yellow fever or Measles vaccine. Use of any investigational or nonregistered drug or vaccine other than the study vaccines within 30 days preceding the first dose of the study vaccine, or planned use during the study period. Administration of immunoglobulins, blood transfusions or other blood products within the three months preceding the first dose of study vaccine or planned administration during the study period. Chronic administration of immunosuppressants or other immunemodifying drugs within six months prior to the first vaccine dose. Simultaneous participation in any other clinical trial; Previous participation in any other malaria vaccine trial; Any twins History of allergic reactions (significant IgEmediated events) or anaphylaxis to previous immunizations. History of allergic disease or reactions likely to be exacerbated by any component of the vaccine. Any other findings that the investigator feels would increase the risk of having an adverse outcome from participation in the trial.</criteria>
