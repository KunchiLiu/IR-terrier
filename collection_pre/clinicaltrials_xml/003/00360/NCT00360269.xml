	<brief_title>Atomoxetine Treatment for ADHD and Marijuana Dependence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to determine whether the medication atomoxetine, or Strattera, plus 3 sessions of counseling can help people to reduce the symptoms of ADHD and to help cut back on their marijuana use. Participation in the study is approximately 12 weeks of medication treatment and doctor's visits once a week. The first 2 visits consist of evaluations to determine if you qualify to participate. These visits are approximately 2-3 hours long and will include questions about your past and present substance use, psychiatric history, a routine physical exam, bloodwork, and paper and pencil questionnaires about your marijuana use. Once you are enrolled in the study, visits are typically 30 minutes long, once a week. The one-on-one counseling sessions regarding marijuana use are 1 hour long and you will have 3 sessions throughout the study. If you qualify for this study, you will receive either atomoxetine, or a placebo (sugar pill). Study participants will have a 50% chance of receiving atomoxetine. Atomoxetine is a non-stimulant, commonly used to treat ADHD.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Healthy men and women, 18 to 65 years of age 2. Meet DSMIV criteria for marijuana dependence 3. Meet DSMIV criteria for current ADHD, determined by a clinical interview and confirmed by semistructured interview with the Conners' Adult ADHD Diagnostic Interview for DSMIV (CAARD; Conners et al, 1999) 4. ADHD symptom severity indicated by a score of 12 or greater on the WenderReimherr Adult Attention Deficit Disorder Scale 5. ADHD symptoms must be corroborated by a second informant on either current symptoms (by a significant other or close friend) or childhood symptoms (by a parent or older sibling) 6. All subjects will agree to and sign a written, IRBapproved informed consent 7. Subjects must live within a 60mile radius of Charleston, SC, to facilitate study visit compliance 1. Individuals meeting DSMIV dependence for a substance other than marijuana with the exception of nicotine and caffeine. Dependence on nicotine and caffeine will be allowed since dependence on these substances commonly cooccurs with marijuana dependence and excluding these individuals would compromise study recruitment 2. Individuals meeting DSMIV criteria for a lifetime history of schizophrenia or another nonaffective psychotic disorder or bipolar disorder, since these patients will most likely be taking other psychotropic medications and often require intensive psychiatric care 3. Individuals meeting DSMIV criteria for current major depressive disorder or eating disorder, since these individuals will likely require treatment with psychotropic medications. Subjects may meet criteria for a minor mood disorder (dysthymia) and for anxiety disorders. The inclusion of subjects with these disorders will be allowed as they commonly coexist among patients with marijuana dependence (Stephens et al, 1993) 4. Individuals who present significant suicidal risk 5. Individuals with significant cognitive impairment as measured by a score of less than 26 on the MiniMental Status Exam, as they may be unable to understand the informed consent, comply with study protocol, or accurately complete assessments 6. Individuals currently receiving stimulants, benzodiazepines, antidepressant or antipsychotic medications, as these medications could confound the effects of atomoxetine treatment 7. Individuals currently receiving psychotherapy focusing on reducing marijuana use or on ADHD symptoms, as this could confound the effects of atomoxetine treatment. Participation in 12step programs will be allowed 8. Pregnant or nursing women, or women who refuse to use adequate birth control, as atomoxetine has not been approved for use in pregnancy 9. Individuals without stable housing, as contacting these individuals would be difficult 10. Individuals with major medical illnesses (e.g., HIV, renal failure, unstable angina, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, infectious hepatitis) 11. Patients with hypertension (defined as having blood pressure greater than 140/90 measured on 3 or more occasions), as atomoxetine treatment can be associated with increases in blood pressure 12. Patients with evidence of hepatic insufficiency, as atomoxetine requires hepatic metabolism 13. Patients with urinary hesitancy or urinary hesitation, as atomoxetine has been associated with some urinary hesitation in clinical trials 14. Individuals who, in the investigators' opinion, would not be able to comply with study procedures, such as individuals unable to reliably present for intake appointments</criteria>
