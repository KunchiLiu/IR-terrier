	<brief_summary>Parkinson's Disease (PD) is often thought of as affecting movement only. In fact, most patients also experience psychiatric and cognitive symptoms, sometimes from the disease itself, and sometimes as a side-effect of PD medications. The goals of this study are to evaluate the causes, effects, and clinical correlates of psychiatric and cognitive symptoms in PD.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Psychiatric and Cognitive Manifestations of Parkinson's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Parkinson's Disease (PD) is defined by the presence of motor symptoms, but in recent years there has been increasing recognition of non-motor manifestations, including anxiety, depression, and cognitive symptoms. In addition, PD medications have been shown to cause impulse control disorders, cognitive changes, and non-motor withdrawal symptoms (dopamine agonist withdrawal syndrome) when they are discontinued. The goals of this study are to test the hypothesis that the presence of psychiatric and cognitive symptoms are associated with greater self-perceived disability (out of proportion to objective deficits), increased utilization of healthcare resources, and decreased quality of life. In addition, we will examine the clinical correlates of these psychiatric symptoms. To test these hypotheses, we will screen PD patients for anxiety, depression, impulse control disorders, and dopamine agonist withdrawal syndrome, and compare cases and controls with regard to demographic characteristics, motor features of PD, disability, healthcare utilization, and quality of life.</detailed_description>
