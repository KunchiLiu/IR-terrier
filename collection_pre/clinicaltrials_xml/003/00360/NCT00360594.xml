Subjects over the age of 70 years old will be included at the discretion of the PI, with the expectation that these subjects should comprise of no more than 5% of the subjects. 2.

If necessary, can be medically detoxified in the outpatient setting, as determined by a medical clinician. 4. Meets the following drinking criteria, measured by TLFB: a. reports a minimum of 48 standard alcoholic drinks (avg 12 drinks/wk) in a consecutive 30day period over the 90day period prior to starting pharmacotherapy, b. has 2 or more days of heavy drinking (defined as 5 or more drinks per day in males and 4 or more drinks per day in females) within 30 days of starting pharmacotherapy treatment and c. has had a drink within 48 hours of the intake/screening visit or has a CIWA score equal to or greater than 3. 5.

Female Subjects who are pregnant or lactating, or female Subjects of child bearing potential who are not using acceptable methods of birth control. Acceptable methods of birth control include: tubal ligation, barrier (diaphragm or condom) with spermicide, intrauterine progesterone contraceptive system, levonorgestrel implant, medroxyprogesterone acetate contraceptive injection, and oral contraceptives. 5. Clinical laboratory tests (CBC, blood chemistries, urinalysis) outside normal limits that are clinically unacceptable to the Principal Investigator. EKG first degree heart block, sinus tachycardia, left axis deviation, and nonspecific ST or T wave changes are allowed; liver function tests [LFTs] &lt;5 x ULN are acceptable), Subjects with impaired renal function as indicated by corrected creatinine clearance below 80 ml/min/70 kg as determined by the modified Cockcroft equation (CDC, 1986). 6. Subjects who have a positive urine drug screening (cocaine, amphetamines, opiates, barbiturates, benzodiazepines) 7. Subjects who have any disease of the gastrointestinal tract, liver or kidneys that could result in a possibility of altered metabolism or excretion of the study drug. As it is not possible to enumerate the many conditions which might impair absorption, metabolism, or excretion, the investigators will be guided by evidence such as: History of major gastrointestinal tract surgery (gastrectomy, gastrostomy, bowel resection, etc.) or a history of an active peptic ulcer or chronic disease of the GI tract, (ulcerative colitis, regional enteritis, or gastrointestinal bleeding). 8. Current unstable heart disease. 9. Known hypersensitivity to acamprosate. 10. Subjects taking psychotropic drugs (e.g., antidepressants, anxiolytic, antipsychotic, naltrexone, disulfiram, modafinil, stimulants and anticonvulsants) with the exception of oxazepam 11. Subjects receiving formal psychotherapy 12. Subjects having participated in any investigational drug trial within 30 days prior to the study. 13. Subjects with AIDS or other serious illnesses that may require hospitalization during the study. Inclusion Criteria for PostDetoxification Rehabilitative Treatment Phase (RP/Phase 2) with OpenLabel Acamprosate 1. Has taken at least 5 days of acamprosate or placebo directly prior to initiating openlabel acamprosate. 2. Successfully completed, within a 14day period, outpatient detoxification. Successful completion of detoxification is defined as having a score of 1 or lower on the Clinical Institutes Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol (CIWA; Shaw et al., 1981), and has at least 3 consecutive days of abstinence. 3. Has reduced medication taken specifically for detoxification (if applicable), i.e., oxazepam to 45 mg within 24hour period prior to the postdetoxification rehabilitative treatment phase.</criteria>
