	<brief_summary>The investigators are studying a new antidepressant medicine, duloxetine, for the treatment of people with chronic depression. Duloxetine (trade name Cymbalta) was recently approved by the FDA for the treatment of major depression. The investigators are testing whether this medicine is also effective for adults with chronic depression (dysthymic disorder or dysthymia). Chronic depression, lasting two or more years, often causes significant suffering and impairment. The investigators study involves a 6 to 10 week double-blind Initial Phase during which half of the participants will take the new medication and half will take a placebo (an inactive look-alike pill). After the Initial Phase, a 12-week Continuation Phase will begin, during which all subjects can be treated with an FDA-approved antidepressant medication. Eligible subjects may also receive MRI scans, to help the investigators understand how antidepressants work in treating depression.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Duloxetine for Chronic Depression: a Double-blind Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a 22-week study of the tolerability, dosing, and efficacy of duloxetine in chronically depressed outpatients. Participants can have Dysthymic Disorder (Dysthymia), or Depression, Not Otherwise Specified (Depression NOS). The first 10 weeks (Acute Phase) are double blind, placebo-controlled, and the second 12 weeks (Continuation Phase) is open-label and all subjects will receive active medication. Tests of cytokine functioning will be performed and analyzed for treatment and placebo effects. In addition, a subset of patients will be enrolled into an Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) sub-study, in which a variety of brain imaging techniques (including anatomical MRI, functional MRI (fMRI), MR Spectroscopy, and Diffusion Tensor Imaging) will be performed at baseline and week 10. Duloxetine responders will have a third MRI performed at week 22.</detailed_description>
