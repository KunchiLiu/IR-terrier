	<brief_summary>This study will investigate the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of Mircera in adult anemic patients with multiple myeloma. In the first stage of the study, patients will be randomized to receive subcutaneous injections of Mircera once every 3 weeks, at doses of 2.0, 3.5 or 5.0 micrograms/kg. Following the administration of 2 doses, an evaluation of hemoglobin increase will be made at week 6. In the second stage, further groups of patients will receive additional doses of Mircera,at doses of 1.0, 6.5 or 8.0 micrograms/kg, depending on efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetic considerations.The anticipated time on treatment is 3-12 months, and the target sample size is &lt;100 individuals.</brief_summary>
