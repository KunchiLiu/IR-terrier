	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if Rizatriptan, a migraine medication, lowers motion sickness in migraine sufferers.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Does a Migraine Medication Decrease Rotational Motion Sickness in People Suffering From Migraines?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Migraine sufferers undergo vestibular tests and were excluded if there were clinically significant abnormalities. Following screening, there were 2 experimental visits in which migraine sufferers were pre-treated with either Rizatriptan or placebo. After taking the drug, subjects were idle for 2 hours. Baseline motion sickness and subjective units of distress levels were assessed prior to undergoing sinusoidal-earth-vertical earth axis rotation in darkness at 0.05 Hz. Scores were taken immediately after stopping. Subjects were given a 2 minutes rest and then underwent a motion sickness provoking rotation. Subjective scores were assessed immediately following. Another two minute rest was given and if the subject was able, underwent a second motion sickness provoking stimulus followed by an assessment.</detailed_description>
