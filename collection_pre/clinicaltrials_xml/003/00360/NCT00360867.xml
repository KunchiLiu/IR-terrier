	<brief_summary>This is an extension study to provide ongoing treatment with AMG 706 monotherapy for subjects with solid tumors who have completed the planned duration of AMG 706 treatment on a separate Amgen protocol and have been evaluated as having stable disease or better. Subjects who are no longer eligible to continue AMG 706 treatment on a separate Amgen protocol (for reasons other than AMG 706 intolerance), but who are receiving clinical benefit or have the potential to receive clinical benefit from AMG 706 per the investigator are also eligible to participate in this trial.</brief_summary>
