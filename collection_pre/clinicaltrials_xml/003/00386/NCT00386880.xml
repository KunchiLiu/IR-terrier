	<brief_summary>Cutaneous allodynia is an increased skin sensitivity experienced during a headache. It has been noted in several studies that in patients with migraine, seventy nine percent of the patients experienced allodynia on the facial skin on the same side as the headache. Understanding more about the occurrence of phonophobia (increased sensitivity to sound) and allodynia may help us understand how the pain system works in migraine. It is hoped that the knowledge gained from this trial may enable us to more effectively treat patients with migraine headache.</brief_summary>
