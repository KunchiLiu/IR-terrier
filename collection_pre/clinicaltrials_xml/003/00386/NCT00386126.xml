	<brief_summary>Anemia has been demonstrated to be a common finding in patients with heart failure (HF). Previous studies in hospitalized patients with HF have found a prevalence of anemia ranging from 15% to 63%. More importantly, anemic patients with HF have increased morbidity and mortality. The mechanisms underlying anemia in HF are multifactorial, involving mild to moderate forms of anemia of chronic disease and ferropenic anemia. The clinical impact of iron supplementation in HF patients who have a relatively preserved renal function and either chronic disease anemia, ferropenic anemia or both remains largely unknown. The route of iron administration that could be most clinically effective is also unclear. Thus, the primary aim of the IRON-HF study is to assess the effects of iron supplementation alone (IV or PO) on parameters of functional capacity in HF patients with anemia with decreased availability of iron.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Iron Supplementation in Heart Failure Patients With Anemia: The IRON-HF Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The IRON-HF study is an investigator initiated, multicenter, prospectively designed,randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled clinical trial. Randomization:Each of the eight participating centers will randomize patients by telephone contact with the randomization center at Hospital de Clínicas de Porto Alegre. The randomization system will be based on a computerized table of random numbers and performed in blocks of three per participating center. Blinding:Each participating center will elect a third party blind individual (usually a RN) who will open the allocated medication box, prepare iron sucrose infusions or saline and administer to patients in opaque devices. Both patient and attending physicians and/or nurses will be blind to allocated therapy. Oral medications and oral placebo will be identical in all aspects.</detailed_description>
