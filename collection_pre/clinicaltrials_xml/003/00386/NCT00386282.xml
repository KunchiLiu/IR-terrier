	<detailed_description>The study recruited women with pregnancies up to 63 days gestation. Eligible women took 200 mg mifepristone, followed by 800 buccal misoprostol. They later underwent clinic follow-up to determine if their medical abortions were complete. The study assessed the acceptability and feasibility of the above regimen and sought to determine the efficacy and acceptability of buccal administration of misoprostol as well as the acceptability of side effects experienced by women.</detailed_description>
