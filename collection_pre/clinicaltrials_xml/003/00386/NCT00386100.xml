	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the longer-term glycemic effect of two medicines approved for initial treatment of type 2 diabetes. The study consists of a 2 week screening period (2 study visits), followed by an 80 week double-blind treatment period (11 study visits). Also, a sub-study was included to look at changes in bone mineral density (BMD) at the lumbar spine.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Type 2 Diabetes Study of the Longer-Term Glycemic Effect of AVANDAMET vs. Metformin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This was a phase IV, randomized, double-blind, global, multi-centre study. The study consisted of a 2 week screening period followed by an 80 week double-blind treatment period. Subjects who met all eligibility requirements were randomized in a 1:1 ratio, stratified by country, gender (male and female) and pre-screening HbA1c (≤9% or&gt;9) either to MET or AVM. When the substudy was added, a new randomization was created for the participating centers. Those subjects in the bone sub-study were stratified by country, gender (male, premenopausal female, and postmenopausal female), pre-screening HbA1c (i.e., ≤9%; &gt;9%), and either to MET or AVM. At randomization, Visit 3 (Week 0), subjects were initiated at Dose Level 1. Treatment with AVM was initiated at a dose of 4 mg/500 mg and titrated up to a maximum total daily dose of AVM 8 mg/2000 mg. Treatment with MET therapy was initiated at a dose of 500 mg and titrated up to a maximum daily dose of 2000mg.</detailed_description>

The subject is currently treated with diet and exercise, and has not taken more than 2 weeks of an antidiabetic monotherapy or insulin in the past 6 months. The subject has a BMI &gt;25 kg/m2 at prescreening. The subject has a Quest HbA1c 7.5% to 10.5% at prescreening. The subject has a fasting capillary blood glucose 126 mg/dL (7mmol/L), as measured by the site staff at week 0. If the subject is a premenopausal female of childbearing potential, she agrees to practice acceptable contraceptive measures (e.g. oral birth control pills, Norplant, DepoProvera, an intrauterine device (IUD), a diaphragm with spermicide or a condom with spermicide, or abstinence) at least 1 month before screening, during the study, and for 30 days after the last dose of study medication is taken The subject is able and willing to perform selfmonitoring of blood glucose as specified in this protocol. The subject has taken an oral antidiabetic monotherapy or insulin for more than 14 days in the past 6 months. The subject has presence of clinically significant renal or hepatic disease (serum creatinine 1.5 mg/dL (132.6 mol/L) for males and 1.4 mg/dL (123.8 mol/L) for females): ALT, AST, total bilirubin, or alkaline phosphatase &gt;2.5 times the upper limit of the normal (ULN) reference range. The subject has anemia defined by hemoglobin concentration &lt;11g/dL (110g/L) for males or &lt;10g/dL (100g/L) for females.

The subject has systolic blood pressure &gt;160 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure &gt;90 mmHg The subject has a chronic disease requiring intermittent or chronic treatment with oral, intravenous, or intraarticular corticosteroids (i.e., only use of topical, inhaled or nasal corticosteroids is permitted). The subject has acute or chronic metabolic acidosis or a history of diabetic ketoacidosis. The subject has a clinically significant abnormality which in the judgment of the investigator makes the subject unsuitable for inclusion in the study (e.g., physical examination, laboratory tests, or electrocardiogram, etc). The subject has used an investigational agent within 30 days or 5 halflives (whichever was longer) prior to prescreening. The subject is a female who is lactating, pregnant, or planned to become pregnant. The subject has a prior history of severe edema or a medically serious fluid related event (e.g., heart failure). The subject has a history of macular edema. The subject has significant hypersensitivity (e.g., difficulty swallowing, difficulty breathing, and tachycardia or skin reaction) to TZDs, biguanides, or compounds with similar chemical structures. The subject has a diagnosis of cancer (other than squamous, basal cell, or cervical cancer insitu) in the past 3 years and is receiving treatment for cancer. The subject has a history or suspicion of drug abuse or alcohol abuse within the last 6 months. The subject is known to have severe lactose intolerance.
