	<brief_summary>PRINCIPAL ENDPOINT To value valganciclovir efficacy in advance treatment of CMV in patients received allogenic transplant with a uniform treatment. SECONDARY ENDPOINT To value valganciclovir security in advance treatment of CMV in in patients received allogenic transplant with a uniform treatment. The security will be valued by the % of patients that: Will have negative CMV Neutropenia &lt;1000 neutrophils/mm3 or &lt;500 neutrophils/mm3 in the first 35 days of treatment - follow-up Renal toxicity in the first 35 days of treatment - follow-up (defined by elevated creatinine &gt;1mg/dL or twice the basal value) CMV illness during the treatment or in the next 2 months Blood Antigenemia / PCR positive in the next 2months of treatment This dates Hill be compared with a patients control group treated with intravenous valganciclovir</brief_summary>
