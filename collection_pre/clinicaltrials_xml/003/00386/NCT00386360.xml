	<brief_summary>The primary purpose of the protocol is to evaluate the sensitivity of 3D-pQCT (3D-Peripheral Quantitative Computed Tomography) technology to detect minute changes in bone microarchitecture.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of the Effect of Once a Week Risedronate on the Microstructure of Tibia and Radius Using a New Scanning Method</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The 3D-pQCT equipment allows the evaluation of changes occurring within the bone at "microarchitecture" level, without the need for invasive bone biopsies. The primary objective is to evaluate the sensitivity of the technology to detect a difference between those treated with risedronate 35mg OAW (once a week) or placebo. Early phase postmenopausal women with osteopenia have been chosen because they have a more rapid and higher level of bone loss during the first few years of the menopause.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>cessation of menstruation (surgical or natural) between 6 and 36 months prior to study enrollment; osteopenic must have at least 1 evaluable radius and tibia, without history of fracture (traumatic or atraumatic) BMI (body mass index) between 18 and 28 kg/m2 inclusive; history of any generalized bone disease, including hyperparathyroidism, Paget's disease of bone, renal osteodystrophy, or any other acquired or congenital bone disease; or any known condition that would interfere with the assessment of DXA (dualenergy Xray absorptiometry) at either the lumbar spine (3 nonevaluable lumbar vertebrae at lumbar spine L1 L4) or the femoral neck. clinical or radiological evidence of osteoporosis, such as atraumatic vertebral compression fracture (* 20% reduction in anteriortoposterior or middletoposterior height ratio; or 20% reduction of the anterior, middle, and/or posterior height as compared with the adjacent vertebrae) documented by spinal X ray or a history of osteoporosisrelated atraumatic fracture of the hip or of the wrist; glucocorticoidinduced osteopenia; previous bisphosphonate therapy;</criteria>
