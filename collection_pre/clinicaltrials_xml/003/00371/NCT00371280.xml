	<brief_summary>Pegging the hydroxyapatite for increasing prosthetic motility sometimes leads to some complications for the patient. These complications ranging from discharge, granuloma formation, exposure, implant infection to socket discomfort and etc. We are going to compare prosthetic motility, objectively and subjectively (patients satisfaction) before and after pegging the hydroxy- apatite, and evaluate the complications after pegging.</brief_summary>
