	<brief_title>Comparison of Penetrating Keratoplasty and Deep Lamellar Keratoplasty With the Big Bubble Technique for Keratoconus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this randomized clinical trial 50 keratoconic eyes of 50 patients randomly assigned in two groups: 25 patients underwent DLK with the big bubble technique and the other 25 patients underwent PK with the standard technique using hessburg – Barron trephine. One surgeon performed all operations using a 16 bites separate 10-0 nylon sutures. We used A-scan ultrasonic biometry for measuring vitreous length (VL) before surgery. If VL≥15.50mm, a trephine 0.25mm larger than recipient and if VL was &lt;15.50mm, a trephine 0.50 mm larger than recipient were considered. Selective suture removal was started 3 months after operation. quality of vision endothelial cell changes and correlation between refractive outcome and VL in relation to donor-recipient disparity, were measured and analyzed in both PK and DLK 15 mos postoperatively.</detailed_description>
