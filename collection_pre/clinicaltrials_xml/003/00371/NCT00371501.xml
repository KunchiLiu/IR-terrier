	<brief_title>Aspirin and Statins for Prevention of Atherosclerosis and Arterial Thromboembolism in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To study if aspirin and statins (lipid-lowering agents) can reduce the progression of subclinical atherosclerosis in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. Subclinical atherosclerosis is assessed by ultrasound study of the carotid vessels and CT scan of the coronary arteries for calcium scores. Blood markers of endothelial activation will also be studied.</detailed_description>
