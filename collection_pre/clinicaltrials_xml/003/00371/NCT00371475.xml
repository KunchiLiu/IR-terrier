	<brief_summary>TAXUS ATLAS is a global, multi-center, single-arm, non-inferiority trial comparing results from patients treated with the TAXUS Liberté 38 mm stent to an historical TAXUS Express control. The control group is a case-matched, blended, long lesion subset population of TAXUS Express patients from the TAXUS IV and TAXUS V de novo clinical trials. The objective of the study is to evaluate clinical outcomes of TAXUS Liberté-SR 38 mm stent in de novo lesions and to assess the non-inferiority of TAXUS Liberté versus TAXUS Express. The TAXUS Liberté-SR stent is hypothesized to have comparable safety and efficacy to the TAXUS Express stent.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>General 1. Patient is at least 18 years old. 2. Eligible for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) 3. Documented stable angina pectoris or unstable angina pectoris with documented ischemia, or documented silent ischemia 4. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of at least 25% 5. Acceptable candidate for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) 6. Patient or legal guardian understands the study requirements and the treatment procedures and provides written Informed Consent before any studyspecific tests or procedures are performed 7. Willing to comply with all specified followup evaluations Angiographic 1. Only one lesion (target lesion) may be treated with the study stent.However, one additional lesion in a nontarget vessel may be treated during the index procedure with a commercially available bare metal stent, heparincoated stent or TAXUS Express stent. 2. Successful predilation is mandatory for entry into study 3. Target lesion located within a single native coronary artery 4. Target lesion enrolled for treatment may be composed of multiple lesions (not more than 10mm between diseased segments) but must be completely covered by one study stent. 5. Cumulative target lesion length is greater than or equal to 26 mm and less than or equal to 34 mm (visual estimate) 6. Target lesion RVD is greater than or equal to 2.7 mm and less than or equal to 4.0 mm (visual estimate) 7. Target lesion diameter stenosis at least 50% (visual estimate) 8. Target lesion is de novo (i.e., a coronary lesion not previously treated) General 1. Known hypersensitivity to paclitaxel 2. Any previous, concurrent or planned treatment with a nonstudy antirestenotic drugcoated or drugeluting coronary stent. 3. Planned use of both the study stent and a nonstudy stent (i.e., commercial stent) in the treatment of the target vessel 4. Previous or planned treatment with intravascular brachytherapy in the target vessel 5. Planned CABG within 9months postindex procedure 6. MI within 72 hours prior to the index procedure and/or creatine kinase(CK) &gt;2x the local laboratory's ULN unless CKMB is &lt;2x ULN 7. Cerebrovascular Accident (CVA) within the past 6 months 8. Cardiogenic Shock 9. Acute or chronic renal dysfunction 10. Contraindication to ASA, or to both clopidogrel and ticlopidine 11. Leukopenia 12. Thrombocytopenia or thrombocytosis 13. Active peptic ulcer or active gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding 14. Known allergy to stainless steel 15. Any prior true anaphylactic reaction to contrast agents 16. Patient is currently, or has been treated with paclitaxel or other chemotherapeutic agents within 12months of the index procedure 17. Anticipated treatment with paclitaxel or oral rapamycin during any period in the 9months after the index procedure 18. Male or female with known intention to procreate within 3 months after the index procedure 19. Female of childbearing potential with a positive pregnancy test within 7 days before the index procedure, or lactating 20. Life expectancy of less than 24 months due to other medical condition 21. Comorbid condition(s) that could limit the patient's ability to participate in the study, compliance with followup requirements or impact the scientific integrity of the study 22. Currently participating in another investigational drug or device study that has not completed the primary endpoint or that clinically interferes with the endpoints of this study Angiographic 1. Unprotected and protected left main coronary artery disease (patient with protected left main disease can be enrolled ONLY if the target lesion is in the RCA) 2. Target lesion is ostial in location (within 3.0 mm of vessel origin) 3. Target lesion and/or target vessel proximal to the target lesion is moderately or severely calcified by visual estimate 4. Target lesion and/or target vessel proximal to the target lesion is tortuous 5. Target lesion is located within or distal to a &gt;60 degree bend in the vessel 6. Target lesion involves a bifurcation with a side branch vessel &gt;2.0mm in diameter 7. Target lesion is totally occluded (TIMI flow &lt;1), either at baseline or predilation 8. Angiographic presence of probable or definite thrombus 9. Pretreatment of the target vessel at the index procedure is not allowed with any device except for predilation with balloon angioplasty or cutting balloon. 10. A previously treated lesion within the target vessel: &lt;15mm from the target lesion (visual estimate) Performed &lt;/= 6 months from index procedure &gt;30% residual stenosis after previous treatment</criteria>
