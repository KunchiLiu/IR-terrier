	<brief_summary>1. whether the intake of n-3 PUFA has additional effects on insulin sensitivity and adiposity (total fat mass and adipocyte morphology and function) in T2D women. 2. n-3 PUFA supplementation might influence inflammatory genes expression in the adipose tissue of T2D patients.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Thus, the present study was designed to evaluate the effects of n-3 PUFAs dietary supplementation on lipid and glucose homeostasis and to address the impact of this treatment on adiposity and adipose tissue gene expression in T2D women.A total of 27 T2D women (BMI 27-35kg/mÂ², age 40-60 y) were randomly allocated to two months of 3 g/day of either fish oil (1.8 g n-3 PUFA) or placebo (paraffin oil), in a double-blind parallel design.</detailed_description>
