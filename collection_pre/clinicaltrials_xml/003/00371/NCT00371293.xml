	<brief_summary>Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a serious sleep disorder in which a person's breathing is restricted during sleep. Obese individuals with OSA are at an increased risk of inflammation and heart conditions, but it is unknown whether this risk is related to the effects of OSA or obesity. This study will evaluate whether OSA or obesity plays the primary role in inflammation related to heart disease. The study will also determine the independent effects of OSA and obesity on insulin resistance and blood vessel function.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effects of Obesity and Obstructive Sleep Apnea on Inflammation and Heart Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OSA is a common sleep disorder that is characterized by a brief collapse of the upper airway during sleep. This blockage prevents air from flowing properly into the lungs and causes pauses in breathing. If left untreated, OSA can cause high blood pressure, memory problems, weight gain, impotency, and headaches. It is also associated with an increased risk of inflammation-related heart conditions. Obesity is common among individuals with OSA and it may also be associated with inflammation. It is not known, however, whether the increased risk of heart problems is caused primarily by the inflammatory effects of OSA or obesity. The most common treatment for OSA is continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy, in which a mask is worn over the nose during sleep. Air flows through the mask to maintain a level of pressure that keeps the throat open. The most common treatment for obesity is weight loss. This study will determine the primary cause of heart-related inflammation by evaluating the individual and combined effects of CPAP therapy and a weight loss program in treating obese individuals with OSA. The study will also determine the independent effects of these therapies on insulin resistance and blood vessel function (arterial stiffness, central arterial pressures). This study will enroll obese individuals with moderate to severe OSA for a total of 24 weeks. Potential participants will first take part in an overnight sleep study at the University of Pennsylvania sleep lab. Sensors will monitor body functions during the night, including brain and muscle activity, eye movement, heart rate, breathing effort, air flow, and blood oxygen levels. Eligible participants will then be randomly assigned to CPAP therapy, a weight loss program, or a combination of the two. Participants in the weight loss program will receive weekly dietary counseling and will be encouraged to decrease caloric intake and increase physical activity. Participants receiving CPAP therapy will use a CPAP machine each night while they sleep. Study visits for all participants will occur at baseline and Weeks 6, 12, and 24. Blood will be collected to measure levels of triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), which is an inflammation biomarker. Insulin resistance will be evaluated using a glucose tolerance test, and blood vessel function will be evaluated using a brachial artery reactivity test in which artery size and blood flow will be measured with an ultrasound.</detailed_description>
