	<brief_summary>About one third of prospective kidney transplant recipients have antibodies in their blood directed against the tissues of their only available kidney donor. Recently, "desensitisation" treatments when administered pre-transplant have allowed successful transplantation of these patients despite high rates of acute antibody mediated rejection (AAMR). The investigators propose to test in a randomised controlled trial whether rituximab, a monoclonal antibody that depletes B-lymphocytes, will safely lower antibody mediated rejection (AMR) rates when added to "standard" therapy. The investigators will also test whether rituximab enables more patients to achieve a negative crossmatch against their donor and thereby allow more transplants to proceed.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial of Rituximab Given Pre-Transplant to Sensitised Live Donor Kidney Recipients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is designed to investigate in a prospective, randomised fashion whether a single intravenous dose of rituximab (375 mg/m2) given two weeks prior to transplant, in addition to standard therapy, will allow sensitised renal transplant subjects to achieve a negative CDC crossmatch and thereby proceed to live donor transplantation. We will also evaluate whether rituximab will reduce the number of AAMR episodes in the post-transplant period, compared to controls. All eligible subjects must have a positive T- and/or B-cell CDC or flow cytometry crossmatch and have donor-specific antibodies identified by solid-phase assay at screening. All subjects will receive a standard desensitisation regimen that includes plasma exchange/IVIG + MMF before and immediately after transplantation followed by a standard care immunosuppressive regimen (IL-2R antagonist, tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil [MMF] and corticosteroids) after transplantation.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: 1. Subjects, age &gt; 18 years 2. Subjects receiving a single organ renal transplant from a living donor 3. Positive Tcell and/or Bcell crossmatch by complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and/or positive flow cytometry crossmatch with confirmed donorspecific antibodies on solidphase assay at screening. Positive CDC Tcell and/or Bcell crossmatch titre must be less than or equal to 1:64. 4. Subjects capable of understanding the purposes and risks of the study and who can give written informed consent Exclusion Criteria at Study Entry (4 weeks prior to transplant): 1. Primary renal transplant lost from acute rejection less than six months prior to randomisation 2. Women of childbearing potential with a positive serum or urine pregnancy test or nursing mothers 3. Subjects with history of malignancy (other than non melanoma skin cancer that has been totally excised with no recurrence for two years) 4. Subjects with known contraindications to treatment with rituximab 5. Subjects with haemoglobin &lt; 8.5 g/dL, WBC value of &lt; 3000/mm3 or a platelet count of &lt; 50,000/mm3 that is unlikely to resolve prior to randomisation 6. Subjects with a positive ABO crossmatch with donor 7. Subjects with severe diarrhoea or other gastrointestinal disorders that might interfere with the ability to absorb oral medication and is unlikely to resolve prior to randomisation 8. Subjects participating in another interventional clinical trial or requiring treatment with unmarketed investigational drugs or who would be expected to require other medications prohibited by the protocol 9. Subjects who cannot be followed for the study duration 10. Subjects with disorders or conditions that may interfere with the ability to comply with study procedures and/or requirements Additional Exclusion Criteria at Day 2 before Transplantation: 1. All exclusion criteria as at study entry 2. Positive T and/or Bcell CDC crossmatch at Day 2</criteria>
