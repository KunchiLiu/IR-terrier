	<brief_summary>Miltefosine and liposomal amphotericin B (AmBisome) are approved drugs for visceral leishmaniasis. In this study both drugs will be given in a sequential manner. AmBisome will be given on day 1, followed by Miltefosine for 14 days. Final Cure will be evaluated at six months.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Short Course of Miltefosine and Liposomal Amphotericin B for Kala-azar</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Methodology Multicenter trial, eligible patients will be treated with Liposomal amphotericin B (5 mg/kg) on day 1 and then with miltefosine capsules for 14 days (days 2-15). At two weeks after the end of treatment the initial cure (clinical and parasitological cure) and the clinical response will be determined. If initial cure is observed, a patient will be evaluated after a 6 months (after end of treatment) follow up period for final clinical cure. Number of patients planned Total number of patients planned: 150 patients at both centers combined. 75 pediatric (2-11 years); 75 adult (12-65 years). Lack of suitability for the trial: - Post Kala-azar Dermal Leishmaniasis (PKDL) - Concomitant treatment with other anti-leishmanial drugs - Any condition which compromises ability to comply with the study procedures Administrative reasons: - Any condition or situation that compromises compliance with study procedures including follow-up visit Study medication, dose and mode of administration Liposomal amphotericin B administered intravenously as single dose on day 1, Dosage: 5 mg/kg. Miltefosine administered orally (50 mg capsules) for 14 days (on days 2-15) Dosage: 1. weighing â‰¥ 25 kg: 100 mg miltefosine daily as one capsule (50 mg) in the morning and one capsule in the evening, after meals for 14 days. 2. weighing &lt; 25 kg: 50 mg miltefosine daily as one capsule (50 mg) in the morning, after meals for 14 days. Parameter for evaluation - Final cure rate (initial parasite cure and clinical assessment at six month EOT) - Initial parasitological cure rate (based on splenic aspirates or Bone marrow aspirate) - Clinical response at end of treatment (clinical assessment) - Adverse events Statistical methods - Calculation of cure rate with 95% and 90% lower confidence limit according to Clopper Pearson - Calculation of overall incidence of adverse events</detailed_description>
