	<detailed_description>This study is designed to examine the effects of hatha yoga on autonomic, immune, and endocrine function. The data from both inexperienced and experienced groups will help us better understand how longer-term practice of yoga may be beneficial. The study consists of one 3-hour screening session and three 6-hour activity sessions with 30 minute follow-up appointments the following morning scheduled 2 - 4 weeks apart. Each participant will complete the 3 activity sessions, which will consist of either yoga, mild movement, or a neutral activity (watching a videotape), in randomly assigned order. Thus, both novices and experts will participate in 3 activity sessions each (yoga, movement control, video control). The order in which each participant goes through the activity sessions is counterbalanced. Data for each activity session will be aggregated by group (i.e. novice or expert). We will measure responses to tape stripping to assess skin barrier repair, and evaluate responses to computer tasks, self-report measures, and a battery of unobtrusive behavioral measures. We will also collect blood and saliva samples to measure immune and endocrine outcomes.</detailed_description>
