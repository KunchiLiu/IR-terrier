	<brief_summary>Multidetector Computed Tomographic Coronary Angiography (MDCTCA) has been recently demonstrated to be accurate and may be used as a potential alternative to conventional invasive coronary angiography, which requires cardiac catheterization, for the diagnosis of coronary artery disease. The purpose of this study is to see if MDCTCA can identify significant coronary artery disease as good as or better than conventional coronary angiography (CICA). The study is designed to enroll 900 subjects and is being conducted in 6 hospitals in Ontario. Subjects scheduled for conventional cardiac catheterization and coronary angiography will receive an additional test using MDCTCA. The information gathered during the MDCTCA will be compared to the results of the scheduled conventional invasive coronary angiogram.</brief_summary>
