	<brief_title>The Effect of Cinnamon on HbA1c Among Adolescents With Type I Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Widespread achievement of glucose control remains an elusive goal for adolescents with Type 1 diabetes. Previous research has suggested that cinnamon may be effective at improving glucose control in type 2 diabetes. To date, no research has investigated the effect of cinnamon on type 1 diabetics. If the addition of a simple, natural, pill to a standard insulin regimen can significantly improve glucose control, the clinical implications would be substantial. Comparison: Using a prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled design, 72 adolescent type I diabetics were treated with cinnamon (1 gram/day) or an equivalent appearing placebo for 90 days. HbA1c, total daily insulin intake, and adverse events were recorded and compared between groups.</detailed_description>
