	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to assess whether fracture union is accelerated in subjects with humeral fractures (proximal,diaphyseal) treated with conservative therapy (standard of care) and a single dose of rhBMP-2/CPM compared to subjects who receive standard of care alone.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Skeletally mature subjects age 18 years or older. Subjects with either a closed proximal humeral fracture or a diaphyseal humeral fracture. Treatment plan that includes only conservative (nonoperative) therapy within 48 hours following injury. Shoulder dislocation at the time of injury. Planned procedure(s) at that would stimulate fracture union at the time of application of the initial immobilization device. Fractures located in the distal third of humerus.</criteria>
