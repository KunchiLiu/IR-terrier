	<brief_title>Study of Home-Based Exercise to Alleviate Postpartum Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Postpartum depression occurs in 10-16% of women, with depressive symptoms lasting up to one year post delivery. Women affected by depression in the postpartum have been shown to be at higher risk for developing a recurrent depressive disorder. While the direct and indirect costs associated with postpartum depression are unknown, those associated with depression have been found to exceed 43 billion dollars in the United States alone. Moreover, maternal depression can negatively impact the mother-infant relationship and infant development. Despite the high prevalence of postpartum depression, the condition often goes undiagnosed and untreated by primary care providers. Alternative non-medical interventions for treating postpartum depression have not been widely investigated, leaving women and health care providers with few evidence-based options for treatment. If this exercise program is shown to be effective, then this intervention can be an alternate treatment option for alleviating depressed mood for women in the postpartum period. This nonpharmacological approach may be particularly attractive as many women are reluctant to take medication in the postpartum.</detailed_description>
