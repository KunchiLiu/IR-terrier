	<brief_summary>Pulmonary valve replacement in the adult population is an uncommon operation. The majority of native valve pathology in adults involves the mitral, aortic, and occasionally tricuspid valves. On the other hand, right ventricular outflow tract and pulmonary valve disease is quite common in children, especially with tetralogy of fallot, truncus arteriosus, pulmonary atresia/ventricular septal defect, and double outlet right ventricle. Unfortunately, right ventricular pathology often develops in adulthood as a result of pulmonary insufficiency or pulmonary stenosis created by previous childhood operations. Without the valve size constraints present at prior operations, these patients can be well-served by the placement of adult-sized bioprosthetic valves. There are limited descriptions in the adult cardiac literature of the actual technique of pulmonary valve replacement. We present our current technique and the pitfalls encountered when performing pulmonary valve replacement in adults.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Adult Pulmonary Valve Replacement: A Simple and Reproducible Technique</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This will be primarily a technique paper. The only clinical data points I am interested in are the presence of pulmonary stenosis, pulmonary insufficiency or perivalvular leak on the initial post-operative echocardiogram. I estimate reviewing 50 patients' charts dated March 22.2003 through and including March 22.2006 at Emory Hospital . Primary Aim: Present an effective technique for pulmonary valve replacement Secondary Aim: Present our excellent technical results of PVR in our adult congenital patients</detailed_description>
