	<criteria>1. Aged 2 months (42 to 98 days) at the time of enrollment. 2. Available for entire study period and whose parent(s)/legal guardian(s) could be reached by telephone. 3. Healthy infant, as determined by medical history, physical examination, and judgment of the investigator. 4. Parent(s)/legal guardian(s) had to be able to complete all relevant study procedures during study participation. 1. Previous vaccination with licensed or investigational pneumococcal vaccine. 2. Previous vaccination with Hib conjugate, diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio, or meningococcal vaccines. 3. A previous anaphylactic reaction to any vaccine or vaccinerelated component. 4. Contraindication to vaccination with Hib conjugate, diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio, pneumococcal conjugate, or meningococcal conjugate vaccines. 5. Bleeding diathesis or condition associated with prolonged bleeding time that would contraindicate intramuscular injection. 6. Known or suspected immune deficiency or suppression. 7. History of cultureproven invasive disease caused by S pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, or Hib. 8. Major known congenital malformation or serious chronic disorder. 9. Significant neurological disorder or history of seizure, including febrile seizure, or significant stable or evolving disorders, such as cerebral palsy, encephalopathy, hydrocephalus, or other significant disorders. This did not include resolving syndromes due to birth trauma such as Erb palsy. 10. Receipt of blood products or gammaglobulin (including hepatitis B immunoglobulin and monoclonal antibodies; eg, SynagisÂ®). 11. Participation in another investigational trial. Participation in purely observational studies was acceptable. 12. Infant who was a direct descendant (eg, child or grandchild) of the study site personnel.</criteria>
