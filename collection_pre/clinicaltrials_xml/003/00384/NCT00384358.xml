	<mesh_term>Fractures, Bone</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Age 55 or older. Acute fracture of the proximal femur: displaced femoral neck fracture or unstable intertrochanteric femur fracture. Anatomic reduction (open or closed) and internal fixation within 48 hours following injury using any one of the following fixation constructs: 1) multiple parallel interfragmentary screws; 2) sliding hip screw and side plate fixation; or 3) cephalomedullary nail. Concurrent fractures of the ipsilateral or contralateral lower extremity that would impede performance on functional assessments. Previous arthroplasty of contralateral (unaffected) hip. Planned procedure(s) to stimulate fracture healing after internal fixation of the fractured hip.</criteria>
