Patients willing to avoid the following medications during the study: oral and intravenous metronidazole oral vancomycin antiperistaltic drugs opiates (patients on opiates may be included in the study if they were taking opiates prior to enrollment and the dose is not increased during the study) Saccharomyces cerevisiae (baker's yeast) Lactobacillus GG cholestyramine colestipol Patients with other known causes of diarrhea or colitis (e.g., Shigella, Salmonella, Cryptosporidium parvum, Giardia lamblia, Entamoeba histolytica, inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, advanced AIDS or chemotherapy for malignancy).

Patients with more than 1 recurrence of CDAD during the 6 months prior to enrollment. Patients unable to take oral medications. Use within 1 week of enrollment of any drug or therapy with antiC. difficile activity such as oral or intravenous metronidazole and oral vancomycin. [Patients that have taken up to 3 doses of metronidazole or vancomycin can be included in the study]. Females of child bearing age who are either pregnant, breastfeeding or not using birth control and are sexually active. Patients who are either clinically unstable (e.g., fulminant disease patients with signs of toxic megacolon, imminent perforation, colectomy or death) or unlikely to live throughout the 31day duration of the study due to underlying illness. History of hypersensitivity to nitazoxanide or vancomycin or any active ingredient in the formulations.</criteria>
