	<brief_summary>The primary objectives were: - To demonstrate the superiority of Lantus plus stepwise addition of mealtime ApidraÂ® (Lantus/Apidra-3) versus twice-daily Premixed insulin based on the proportion of patients achieving target glycemic control (as measured by hemoglobin A1c [HbA1c] &lt;7.0%) at Week 60 - To demonstrate the noninferiority of Lantus plus addition of 1 mealtime Apidra injection (Lantus/Apidra-1) versus twice-daily Premixed insulin based on the reduction from Baseline to Week 60 in HbA1c</brief_summary>
