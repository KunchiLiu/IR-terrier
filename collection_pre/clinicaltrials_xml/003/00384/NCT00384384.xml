	<brief_summary>Background: 18B Glycyrrhetinic acid (active compound of Licorice) decreases serum potassium via enhanced renal potassium loss in healthy individuals and thereby inducing renal sodium retention and arterial hypertension.In dialysis patients this mechanism is disturbed and compensatory intestinal potassium secretion is enhanced. 18B Glycyrrhetinic acid is an inhibitor of 11B Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11b HSD1). Inhibition of 11 b HSD1 offers a novel potential therapy to lower intracellular cortisol concentrations and thereby enhance insulin sensitivity. Hypothesis: Glycyrrhetinic acid decreases serum potassium by enhanced intestinal excretion in dialysis patients and increases insulin sensivity by inhibition of 11b HSD Methods: double blind, 6 month cross over trial comparing oral 18b Glycyrrhetinic acid with placebo in 24 nondiabetic dialysis patients. Endpoints: predialytic serum potassium levels, insuline sensitivity assessed by fasting glucose and fasting insulin concentrations</brief_summary>
