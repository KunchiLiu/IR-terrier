	<brief_summary>This trial will explore the various advantages and possible disadvantages of pioglitazone and insulin glargine when added to monotherapy. Glycemic control, hypoglycemia, weight, lipid profiles, quality of life and cost will be studied given a comprehensive set of data that may help future treatment decisions.</brief_summary>
