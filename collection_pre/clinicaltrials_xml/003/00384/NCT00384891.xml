	<detailed_description>The study is a randomized controlled study, designed to test the efficacy and safety of a new treatment modality for the prevention of tumor recurrence in superficial bladder cancer. Patients must have their tumors surgically resected prior to study enrollment, and undergo a series of tests to prove their bladder is now free of tumor. Eligible patients will be randomly assigned to one of 2 treatment arms: 1. A combination of bladder wall heating and local chemotherapy (Synergo) 2. Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) Patients will be treated during the first year of the study, and will be followed up for a total of 2 years. The follow up will include a visual evaluation of the patient's bladder by cystoscopy, a cytological examination of the urine (to look for malignant cells) and other additional exams. The patients' general welfare will be monitored through out the study. The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of the novel treatment (Synergo) to that of the well-known BCG</detailed_description>
