	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare High Frequency Pressure Ventilation (HFPV) to conventional mechanical ventilation. Hypothesis: Patients placed on HFPV will have significantly higher number of ventilator-free days compared to patients placed on a conventional volume mode.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>BEST (Burn Center Evaluation of Standard Therapies) Ventilator Mode Study-</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, randomized, controlled trial comparing HFPV to conventional ventilator modes in the support of burn patients with respiratory failure. Burn patients who develop the need for mechanical ventilation present a variety of challenges that call for innovative therapeutic options. Even in the absence of smoke inhalation injury,decreased chest wall compliance from full thickness burns as well as massive fluid requirements are just a few variables that make it difficult to achieve gas exchange goals when attempting to apply conventional lung protective strategies recommended by the ARDS Net investigators.</detailed_description>
