	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of Ketoprofen Topical Patch 20% in the Treatment of Pain Associated With Ankle Sprain or Strain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study will be conducted in patients with Grade 1 or Grade 2 ankle sprains or strains. Eligible patients will be randomized (in a 1:1 ratio) to receive double-blind treatment with either the KTP or a matching placebo patch to be applied once daily for 14 days. Patients will return to the clinic for assessments on Day 3, Day 7 and Day 14; a follow-up assessment will be conducted by telephone on Day 28. At each visit through Day 14, patients will rate their average pain intensity during daily activities and while at rest using an 11-point scale, and will rate their functional disability. Patients will also complete an electronic diary in which pain intensity and pain relief ratings will be recorded three times daily. Ratings of the quality of sleep will be recorded in the diary each morning, and the use of study treatment and rescue medication will be recorded in the diary each day. Ibuprofen will be provided as rescue medication</detailed_description>
