	<brief_summary>This is a Phase I/II trial of elderly patients (&gt; 70 years of age). Patients in this age group with previously un-treated Advanced Stage Non-Squamous Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) with Stage IIIB (with malignant pleural effusion) and stage IV disease will be enrolled. Therapy consists of three drugs (Premetrexed[Alimta™], Bevacizumab and Erlotinib[Tarceva™]) which are given every 28 days.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I/II Trial of Bevacizumab, Pemetrexed and Erlotinib in Elderly Patients With Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase I/II trial of elderly patients (&gt; 70 years of age) with previously un-treated Advanced Stage Non-Squamous NSCLC with Stage IIIB (with malignant pleural effusion) and stage IV disease will be enrolled. Treatment Regimen: Premetrexed (Alimta™) 500 milligrams(mg)/Meter squared(m20 Intravenous(I.V.) Day 1 and Day 15; Bevacizumab 10mg/Kilogram(Kg) I. V. Day 1 and Day 15; Erlotinib (Tarceva™) 150mg Per Orally(PO) Once Daily(QD) for 7 days starting day 2 and day 15; Repeat cycles every 28 days. All three drugs will be continued for two cycles after maximal response. After which patient will be maintained only on the Bevacizumab and Erlotinib until progression. If patient has stable disease after the first two cycles then patient will be given another two cycles with all three drugs before maintenance treatment with Bevacizumab and Erlotinib is initiated.</detailed_description>

NSCLC histologies that will be included in this trial will be adenocarcinoma, large cell carcinoma and adenosquamous carcinoma. Patients with bronchioloalveolar carcinoma (BAC) will be also included in this trial. Patients must be 70 years of age or older. Patient must have either stage IIIB disease with malignant pleural effusion or stage IV disease. All patients must have measurable disease. Evaluable disease will be separately outlined and elucidated. Patients must have Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of either 0 or 1.

Patients must be more than 28 days since prior open biopsy; more than 7 days since prior fineneedle aspiration; more than 7 days since prior core biopsy; more than 28 days since prior surgery. Patients must be able to take dexamethasone, folic acid and vitamin B12 supplementation. All patients must sign informed consent that will detail the investigational nature of the study in accordance with the institutional and federal guidelines. Lung carcinoma of squamous cell histology or any histology in close proximity to a major vessel, with or without cavitation. Patients with hypercalcemia (corrected calcium of more than 11 mg/dl) will be excluded. Patients with history of hemoptysis, hematemesis, coagulopathy or thrombosis will be excluded. Patients requiring anticoagulation for any reason will be excluded. Patients who recently have an acute infection. History of palliative radiation therapy within 2 weeks.
