	<brief_summary>Title: Evaluation of efficacy of two different preventive therapy regimens for tuberculosis in HIV infected persons Phase: Phase III trial Population: 650 HIV positive patients without tuberculosis Number of sites: Three 1. Tuberculosis Research centre, Chennai 2. Government General Hospital, Chennai 3. Government Rajaji Hospital, Madurai Study Duration: 36 months Study Objectives: To compare the efficacy of two TB preventive therapy regimens in reducing the incidence of tuberculosis and mortality among HIV-infected persons Study Design: The study will be a two-armed prospective randomized clinical trial among HIV- positive patients without active tuberculosis. Enrolled patients will be assigned to one of the two unsupervised self-administered treatment regimens i.e. EH for 6 months or INH alone for 3 years. At the end of a 3-year follow-up, incidence of TB and overall mortality will be compared in each group. Study Endpoints:The primary end point of the study will be development of tuberculosis and the secondary endpoints will include adverse drug reactions and mortality rate.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study population and enrollment: All HIV positive patients seeking care at one of the study centers, above the age of 15 years, not suffering from a serious illness, non-pregnant, and in whom TB was ruled out using the enhanced screening process, will be enrolled in the study. The consent form for prophylaxis trial will be read to the patients in the local language and written consent will be obtained from willing patients Randomization and Dosing: All patients enrolled in the prevention trial will be randomized to one of the study groups using a permuted block randomization scheme of four. Stratification will be done by Mantoux reading (&gt;5mm and â‰¤5mm). The group assignment list will be generated centrally before the start of trial and sequentially numbered sealed envelopes containing the study group assigned will be prepared independently. At the initiation of prophylaxis, each patient will be counseled about the importance of taking drugs regularly. Patients will be asked to return the empty packets as well as unused tablets at each monthly visit. The treatment regimens in each study group will be as follows: 1. Ethambutol (800 mg) and Isoniazid (300 mg) daily for six months, self-administered, collected once in fifteen days. 2. Isoniazid (300 mg) daily for 3 years with fortnightly collection of drugs Subjects in both study groups will receive 10 mg of Pyridoxine daily during treatment.</detailed_description>
