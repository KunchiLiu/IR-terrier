	<brief_title>A Phase II Randomized Trial of Fish Oil in Patients With Acute Lung Injury (ALI)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute lung injury (ALI) is common among critically ill patients and is associated with a high case fatality. Only one intervention has been shown to improve survival in a large clinical trial, and new therapies targeting the inflammatory response are needed. Nutrient interventions may provide benefit; specifically there is plausible biologic rationale for administering n-3 fatty acids (n-3 FAs) found in fish oil to patients with ALI, as n-3 FAs decrease formation of eicosanoid inflammatory mediators. However, although promising results have emerged from prior studies, fish oils have only been tested in ALI patients in a commercial enteral formula containing additional nutrients, and the control group received a high-fat enteral formula that may have been proinflammatory. Therefore, no conclusion can be drawn about the independent effect of fish oils. Furthermore, the inclusion of key pharmaconutrients in feeding formulas, instead of delivering them separately as pharmaceuticals, limits exposure to the agent, as intensive care unit (ICU) patients commonly receive less than 60% of prescribed caloric needs. Finally, specialized feeding formulas are very expensive, and it may be substantially cheaper to administer pharmaconutrients separately. We believe it is time to begin to approach nutrient trials in critically ill patients differently -- to move away from including them in feeding formulas and begin delivering them like pharmaceuticals. With appropriate scientific investigation and the use of non-nutrient placebos, this novel and innovative approach is a new paradigm of investigating nutrient delivery to critically ill patients. This study is a phase II randomized controlled trial to determine the effects of enteral eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexanoic acid (DHA), both n-3 FAs found in fish oil, versus placebo on the pulmonary and systemic environments, and on clinical outcomes, in patients with ALI. We will investigate the effect of fish oil administration on several biological markers of injury and inflammation in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and serum, on pulmonary physiologic outcomes, and on clinical outcomes. Comparison(s): Mechanically ventilated patients with acute lung injury randomized to receive enteral fish oil versus compared to mechanically ventilated patients with acute lung injury randomized to receive placebo.</detailed_description>
