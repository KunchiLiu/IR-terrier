	<brief_summary>Patients with chronic hepatitis C genotype 1 virus infection are usually treated with Interferon alfa plus Ribavirin over 48 weeks. For some patients this might be too long, for others too short. An individually adapted therapy length from 24 to 72 weeks will be determined in dependence of the initial virus load and the time to HCV RNA negativity. The primary objective is to compare the cumulative rate of the sustained viral response (SVR) of the patients with the individually adapted therapy duration to the SVR rates of a historic patient collective under the 48 week standard therapy.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Further objectives of this trial are: To record the tolerance of the therapy with Peginterferon alfa-2b plus Ribavirin over 72 weeks inclusive the adverse reactions and the withdrawal rates. To evaluate the biochemical response to the treatment (ALT values during and after the therapy) in comparison to the virological response to the treatment. To evaluate the validity of the withdrawal rules of this trial at week 12 and 24 in comparison to the 2-log-rule and a qualitative detection of the HCV RNA at week 24 with a detection limit of 50 IU/ml. To evaluate the impact of the HCV RNA concentration before the therapy, and the HCV kinetic during the therapy on the response to the treatment in the different groups. To evaluate the impact of the serum concentration of Ribavirin on anaemia and the virological therapy response, as well as the dependence of the serum concentration of Ribavirin on the creatinine clearance in comparison to the body weight.</detailed_description>
