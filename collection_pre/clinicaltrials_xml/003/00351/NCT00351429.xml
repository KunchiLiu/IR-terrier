	<brief_summary>To evaluate the safety and efficacy of polyglycolic acid suture in ophthalmic surgical procedures</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of PGA Suture in Ophthalmology</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The sutures are classified into non-absorbable and absorbable sutures. Violet braided polyglycolic acid suture is the synthetic absorbable suture used in wound closure in ophthalmology, cardiology, neurology and plastic &amp; reconstructive surgeries. In ophthalmology, PGA sutures are used in Trabeculectomy (Glaucoma), Orbit and Oculoplasty, Lid and Socket Reconstruction, Squint, ptosis and retinal detachment surgeries. Glaucoma patients who met the inclusion criteria were recruited for this study. Uniform surgery and suturing technique was performed in all patients (Trabeculectomy with IOL implantation). Surgeon assessed suture characteristics during surgery and wound integrity at the end of surgery. Patients were followed up during 1 day, 1 month and 3 months post operatively. Visual acuity, Intraocular Pressure (IOP), suture characteristics, wound integrity, inflammation and conjunctival status were examined during each follow up visit.</detailed_description>
