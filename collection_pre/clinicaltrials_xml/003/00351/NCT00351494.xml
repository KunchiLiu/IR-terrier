	<brief_summary>Contrast-enhanced ultrasound is supposed to improve the detection of myomas as well as improve the follow-up after specific treatments like embolization. It will also help the investigators better understand the mechanism of success or failure for embolization and could reduce the amount of particles injected by determining the endpoint of the procedure in order to treat the myomas while preserving the myometrium.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Myoma Microvascularization Analysis Using Sonovue Before and After Uterine Artery Embolization</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Before embolization of the uterine artery, 40 patients with unique or multiple myomas will be included prospectively in our study and evaluated with sonography before and after injection of Sonovue (2.4 ml) (Bracco Int Milano Italy). Pelvic ultrasound with contrast enhancement will be done the day after and six months after the procedure. Microvascularization of the myomas and the endometrium will be described. Some tiny myomas which are not visible on conventional sonography could be identified for a perfect matching with MRI detection.</detailed_description>
