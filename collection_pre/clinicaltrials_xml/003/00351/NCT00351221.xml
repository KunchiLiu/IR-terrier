	<brief_summary>The trial will investigate the treatment of growth failure in children with Noonan syndrome. Abnormalities in the growth hormone (GH) – insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) axis resulting in low IGF-I levels have been suggested as a possible cause of short stature seen in Noonan syndrome children. Administration of our investigational product is intended to bypass the abnormalities in the GH-IGF axis, and hopefully improve body growth.</brief_summary>
