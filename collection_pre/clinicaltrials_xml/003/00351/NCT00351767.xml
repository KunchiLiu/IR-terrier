	<brief_summary>This is a Phase II, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of three different doses of topically applied telbermin in subjects ≥ 18 years old with diabetic foot ulcers. Approximately 160 adult subjects with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes mellitus will be enrolled at approximately 40 investigational sites in the United States and Canada.</brief_summary>
