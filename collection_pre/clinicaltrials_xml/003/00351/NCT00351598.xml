	<brief_summary>The main aim is to determine, in patients with locoregional, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated by definitive radiotherapy, the influence on survival of the volume of primary tumour, as measured from CT imaging, after adjusting for the effect of the current TNM staging system and other known prognostic factors (especially ECOG performance and weight loss).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lung Tumour Volume Database</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with locoregional non small cell lung cancer are registered on study after tumour volumes are outlined by a radiologist and prior to the commencement of any treatment. All patients must have recorded the volume of disease in the primary tumour (and of involved nodes &gt; 1 cm diameter) as measured from a CT scan performed according to a standard set of conditions. Following registration patients are treated with Definitive radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy. Follow-up will occur with the collection of a minimum amount of data every 12 months from the date of registration on study. Quality Assurance procedures will be implemented with each site that participates in the study.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Must satisfy ALL of the following NSCLC histological or cytological diagnosis of nonsmall cell lung cancer Intrathoracic disease disease is confined to the primary site, with or without intrathoracic lymph nodes CT planning CT imaging of the thorax has been performed as part of the planning procedure Definitive radiotherapy it is planned to give definitive radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy (prior to, during or after radiotherapy). Definitive radiotherapy is defined as 60 Gy in 6 weeks, 50 Gy in 4 weeks or at least the equivalent of either of these. The size of each individual; fraction should not exceed 2.5 Gy. Measurable disease the primary tumour and nodes with maximum diameter greater than 1cm represent measurable disease A patient satisfying ANY of the following is ineligible Symptomatic or radiological evidence of metastatic disease Prior treatment for nonsmall cell lung cancer Surgical resection is part of initial treatment Palliative radiotherapy planned</criteria>
