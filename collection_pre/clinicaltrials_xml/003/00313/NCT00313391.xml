	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if Risperdal Consta will affect the healthcare utilization costs in chronically ill schizophrenic patients with multiple admissions to the psychiatric hospital compared to the previous utilization costs under standard oral treatment of any atypical antipsychotic. We hypothesize that higher Risperdal Consta acquisition costs can be offset by reduction in total medical utilization costs, such as hospitalizations, ER visits, unscheduled outpatient visits or incarcerations due to worsening of psychotic symptoms.</brief_summary>
