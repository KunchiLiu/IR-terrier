	<criteria>1. Patients who received placebo in LFMAU201 study 2. Female of childbearing potential with a negative serum (betaHCG) pregnancy test within 14 days of starting therapy. 3. Patients who were able to give written informed consent prior to study start and to comply with the study requirements. 4. Patients who met the following criteria after completion of the Week 48 visit were to have additional followup visits at Weeks 54 and 60: 1)had received no additional therapy since completion of 24week treatment of clevudine and 2)experienced a &gt;= 1 log10 decrease from baseline in HBV DNA at Week 48 1. Patient with HBeAg seroconverted to antiHBe at the last 2 consecutive visits (one month apart) in LFMAU201 study. 2. Patient who was currently receiving antiviral, immunomodulatory or corticosteroid therapy. 3. Patient who was treated with lamivudine, lobucavir, famciclovir, adefovir or any other investigational nucleoside for HBV infection after cessation of treatment in LFMAU201 study. 4. Patient who had a history of ascites, variceal hemorrhage or hepatic encephalopathy. 5. Patient who was coinfected with HCV, HDV or HIV. 6. Patient with clinical evidence of cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma (Â®Fetoprotein)Evaluation was based on alphafetoprotein primarily. If alphafetoprotein level was suggestive of cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma, confirmation was made with ultrasonography etc. 7. Patient who was pregnant or breastfeeding. 8. Patient who was unwilling to use an "effective" method of contraception during treatment period and for up to 3 months after cessation of therapy. For males, condoms should be used. Females must be surgically sterile (via hysterectomy or bilateral tubal ligation), postmenopausal or using at least a medically acceptable barrier method of contraception (i.e., IUD, barrier methods with supermicide or abstinence) 9. Patient who had a clinically relevant history of abuse of alcohol or drugs. 10. Patient who had a significant gastrointestinal, renal, hepatic (decompensated), bronchopulmonary, neurological, cardiovascular, oncologic or allergic disease. 11. Patient who had creatinine clearance less than 60mL/min as estimated by the following formula: (140age in years) (body weight [kg])/(72) (serum creatinine [mg/dL]) [Note: multiply estimates by 0.85 for women]</criteria>
