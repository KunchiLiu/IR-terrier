	<brief_title>Phase III Trial of DP Followed by FOLFIRI or the Reverse Sequence in Unresectable Gastric Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Gastric cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death worldwide and is the most common malignancy in Korea. Metastatic gastric cancer remains a therapeutic challenge for medical oncologists due to poor prognosis. A recent phase III trial comparing docetaxel-cisplatin-5-FU (DCF) to the reference arm of cisplatin-5-FU (CF) showed a significant superiority of DCF in terms of survival, time-to-progression, and response rate. However, because DCF regimen was associated with high incidence of toxicities, the regimen has not yet been widely accepted as the standard first-line chemotherapy for gastric cancer patients. Thus, the optimum front-line chemotherapy regimen should be extensively investigated in these patients to improve survival.</detailed_description>
