	<brief_summary>The investigators want to test the hypothesis that patients with chronic renal disease have a poorer ability to preserve water after being thirsty and a poorer ability to excrete water after a load of fluid. They presume that these abilities become poorer when renal insufficiency progresses. The investigators further hypothesize that patients with hypertension also have a decreased ability to concentrate and dilute urine.</brief_summary>
