	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Nordihydroguaiaretic acid may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of nordihydroguaiaretic acid in treating patients with nonmetastatic relapsed prostate cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nordihydroguaiaretic Acid in Treating Patients With Nonmetastatic Relapsed Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the maximum tolerated dose of nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA) in patients with nonmetastatic, biochemically relapsed prostate cancer. Secondary - Determine prostate-specific antigen-modulating effects of NDGA in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive oral nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA) twice daily on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of NDGA until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
