	<brief_title>Phase I Study of KW-0761 in Relapsed Patients With CCR4-Positive ATL and PTCL</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase I open-label dose escalation study of KW-0761 in relapsed patients with CCR4 positive Adult T-Cell Leukemia-Lymphoma (ATL) and Peripheral T-Cell Lymphoma (PTCL). This study is designed to evaluate safety, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity and preliminary efficacy. Enrollment will proceed until a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and a recommended Phase II dose (RPIID) have been established.</detailed_description>
