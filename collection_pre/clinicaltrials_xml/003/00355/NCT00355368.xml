	<brief_summary>Emergency intubation of patients in intensive care is a high-risk endeavour. For many decades, succinylcholine has been the neuromuscular blocking agent of choice. However, succinylcholine may have life-threatening side effects and is contraindicated in a variety of diseases relevant in intensive care. The nondepolarizing agent rocuronium has been propagated as alternative for succinylcholine. Though a recent meta-analysis found no difference in intubating conditions between succinylcholine and rocuronium in elective cases, there are no data in emergent cases in intensive care. The aim of the present study is to compare succinylcholine and rocuronium with regard to 1) quality of intubating conditions, 2) length of the intubating sequence, 3) failed intubating attempts, 4) hemodynamic sequelae of intubation, and 5) desaturations.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective: to compare succinylcholine and rocuronium with regard to 1) quality of intubating conditions, 2) length of the intubating sequence, 3) failed intubating attempts, 4) hemodynamic sequelae of intubation, and 5) desaturations. Design: prospective, randomized, single-blind study. Setting: Intensive care units of an University Hospital. Patients: adult patients in intensive care requiring emergency intubation. Randomization: 1:1 randomization to either succinylcholine (1mg/kg) or rocuronium (0.6 mg/kg). Data: 1) assessment of the quality of intubating conditions by means of a score, 2) length of the intubating sequence defined as time between injection of neuromuscular blocking agent and first end-tidal CO2 on the monitor, 3) number of failed intubating attempts, 4) hemodynamic sequelae of intubation, defined as events requiring injection of vasoactive drugs, and 5) desaturations, defined as saturation below 90% and/or any decrease in saturation of 5% or more.</detailed_description>
