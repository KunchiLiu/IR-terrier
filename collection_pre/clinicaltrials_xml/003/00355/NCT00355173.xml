	<brief_title>Pilot Study to Assess the Efficacy and Safety of the Lubo Cervical Collar</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cervical spine stabilization is usually achieved by a semi-rigid collar. While these collars achieve the goal of supporting the cervical spine, they limit the possibilities for jaw thrust or other airway manipulations. Definitive airway protection usually must be achieved by orotracheal intubation. Thee Lubo collar is a device that simultaneously maintains cervical spine control and keeps an open airway in a non-invasive manner that is simple to operate. The objective of the study is to test the safety of the collar volunteers. The study is composed of two stages:1.healthy volunteers that will not undergo any intervention except testing the LCC.2. second group of patients scheduled to undergo an operation under general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation or laryngeal mask airway.</detailed_description>
