	<detailed_description>This study is a Phase II open-label study to investigate, using the continual reassessment method procedure by pain intensity and safety as indicators, the recommended conversion ratio (oral morphine dose to KW-2246) when switching oral morphine or oxycodone to KW-2246 in cancer patients who have been maintained on oral morphine or oral oxycodone for pain and to evaluate the safety and efficacy of KW-2246.</detailed_description>

Use of opioid analgesics other than oral morphine or oxycodone within 7 days prior to study entry. 10. Use of narcotic antagonists within 7 days prior to study entry. 11. Interventions that may affect pain evaluation, such as surgery, radiation to the pain site (including those sites that influence pain) and nerve block, within 7 days prior to study entry or scheduled to be given during the study. 12. Patients with a history of serious adverse reactions to the combination of opioid analgesics and other drugs/substances who are currently receiving or expected to receive those drugs/substances combined to opioid analgesics. 13. History of hypersensitivity to fentanyl. 14. Pregnant or lactating women, possibly pregnant women or women who are planning to become pregnant. 15. Participation in any other clinical trial within 28 days prior to the start of KW2246 treatment. 16. Prior exposure to KW2246. 17.
