	<brief_summary>: Researchers would like to see if a new test called SELDI (Surface Enhanced Laser Desorption Ionization) analysis can predict biopsy results better than PSA tests.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>UCI 03-72 Prostate Cancer Detection by Serum Proteomic Profiling</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A blood sample of approximately 30 cc will be collected prior to the patients standard of care radical prostatectomy surgery. This blood will be used for the SELDI analysis. The remainder of the blood sample will be stored and may be used for the PSA test at a later date. The patient will have a final blood draw 3 months to 1 year following surgery.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>For all subjects: Men 50 years of age or older. Serum PSA greater than or equal to 2.5 ng/ml and less then or equal to 10.0 ng/ml determined by a measurement within the past six months, and/or digital rectal exam suspicious for prostate cancer as determined by the patient's Urologist. It has been determined by the treating physician that a prostate biopsy is clinically indicated. Patients will have already been diagnosed with prostate cancer and scheduled for a radical prostatectomy. For study on treatment effect Men with clinically localized prostate cancer (total PSA &lt; 20 ng/ml and clinical T2b or less). Men with organ confined prostate cancer as determined by final pathologic diagnosis. Exclusion criteria for all subjects: Known prostate cancer or prior treatment for prostate cancer. Acute prostatitis. Untreated urinary tract infection. Presence of Foley catheter or any urethral instrumentation in the previous 48 hours. Hormonal therapies including LHRH agonists, oral antiandrogens, estrogenic compounds, Proscar or any phytotherapies within the previous 6 months. Exclusion Criteria (for study on treatment effect) Men with nonorgan confined prostate cancer. Men with detectable serum PSA levels more than 1 months following radical prostatectomy.</criteria>
