	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (the study of the way a drug enters and leaves the blood and tissues over time), safety, tolerability and antiviral activity to support dose recommendations of TMC114 with ritonavir and other antiretroviral agents in treatment-experienced, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infected children and adolescents.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase 2 Study to Evaluate Pharmacokinetics, Safety and Efficacy of TMC114/Ritonavir (Rtv) in Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-1 Infected Children and Adolescents</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention) and randomized (study drug assigned by chance) study to evaluate pharmacokinetics, safety, tolerability, efficacy, antiviral activity, immunology and resistance characteristics of TMC114 with ritonavir in treatment-experienced, HIV-1 infected children and adolescent participants. The study consists of 3 periods: Screening period (maximum 4 weeks); Treatment period (maximum 48 weeks); and Follow-up period (4 weeks). The Treatment period consists of two parts: Part-1 for pediatric dose selection and Part-2 for the recommendation of pediatric or adult dose. Part-1 was further divided into two groups: Group A with adult equivalent dose of TMC114 with ritonavir twice daily and Group B with 20-33 percent higher dose of TMC114 with ritonavir twice daily. The recommended dose will be selected based on short-term safety, tolerability, antiviral activity and pharmacokinetics at Week 2. Once selected, all Part-1 participants who will not be on the selected dose will be switched to the selected dose at their next visit and will continue the study up to 48 weeks in Part-2. Participants with less than or equal to 18 years at Week 48 visit, and continued to benefit from treatment with TMC114 and will be living in a country where TMC114 pediatric use is not yet part of the label, will have the opportunity to roll-over to the extension phase where they will continue to receive TMC114/ritonavir until the participant became 18 years and TMC114 will be available through the local Health Care Systems or until TMC114 is indicated for use in pediatrics. Efficacy will primarily be evaluated by virologic response. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.</detailed_description>
