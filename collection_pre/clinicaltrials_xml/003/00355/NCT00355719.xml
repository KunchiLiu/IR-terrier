	<brief_title>Study to Evaluate the Influence of Nevirapine to Atazanavir in Steady State Equilibrium in HIV Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In recent years, new treatment strategies have appeared aimed at reducing the risk of treatment-derived toxicity without compromising efficacy. Of the recent antiretroviral drugs, atazanavir is a protease inhibitor (PI) whose pharmacokinetic profile allows it to be given in a single daily take with a scant impact on lipid metabolism. This second characteristic makes atazanavir a good alternative for patients with a high vascular risk. However, one of its drawbacks is that it may present clinically relevant interactions with other drugs. Another antiretroviral agent with a scant impact on lipid metabolism is nevirapine. Different studies have described an improvement in lipid profile, as well as a less atherogenic tendency in patients treated with nevirapine. Moreover, the combination of nevirapine with PI drugs in the context of nucleoside-sparing strategies may permit a suitable control of viral replication, and an improvement in the mitochondrial toxicity derived from treatment with NTRI, which may possibly result in a minor incidence or in a clinical improvement of lipodystrophy. The combination of atazanavir with nevirapine may be of major interest in HIV-infected patients that have had a cardiovascular event (secondary prevention) or are at a high risk of having one (primary prevention). Similarly, this combination of drugs may be promising as a nucleoside-sparing strategy. However, according to preliminary data, the joint administration of nevirapine with atazanavir may lead to a reduction in the atazanavir plasma concentration. Thus, before evaluating the clinical utility of this combination of drugs, pharmacokinetic studies evaluating the existence of significant pharmacokinetic interactions between both are necessary</detailed_description>
