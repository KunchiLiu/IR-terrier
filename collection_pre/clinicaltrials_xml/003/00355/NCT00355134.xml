	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of Fingolimod (FTY720) in Patients With Relapsing-remitting Multiple Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomized, multicenter, parallel-group study consisted of 2 phases: a 24-month double-blind, randomized, multicenter, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study and an Extension phase which consisted of a dose-blinded period and an open-label period. In the Core phase, patients were randomized to receive a fixed dose of fingolimod (0.5 mg/day), fingolimod (1.25 mg/day) or placebo for up to 24 months. For the Extension phase, patients who were treated with fingolimod during the Core phase continued treatment at the assigned dose level, while those previously treated with placebo during the Core phase were re-randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive one of the two doses of fingolimod (1.25 mg or 0.5 mg). All patients in the extension received blinded investigational drug: fingolimod 1.25 mg and 0.5 mg in capsules for oral administration once daily until the decision to discontinue the fingolimod 1.25 mg dose became effective and subsequently all patients were switched to open-label fingolimod 0.5 mg. With the implementation of Amendment 11, the 1.25 mg dose was discontinued and all patients were switched to fingolimod 0.5 mg dose. With the implementation of Amendment 12, all patients treated with Placebo in the fingolimod Core phase were switched to treatment with 0.5 mg fingolimod per day. The Extension phase continued until all patients either discontinued or transferred to Study CFTY720D2399 (NCT01201356; initiated in September 2010).</detailed_description>
