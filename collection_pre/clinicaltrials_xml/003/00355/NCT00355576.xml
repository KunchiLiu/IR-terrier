	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to compare two combinations of drugs, minocycline and creatine or celecoxib and creatine, in a phase II trial designed to determine which combination is more effective for ALS.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Excess free radicals, energy mishandling, excitotoxicity, activation of cell death pathways and inflammation likely all contribute to neurodegeneration in ALS. Past trials may have been negative in part because they tested single agents, usually influencing only one mechanism of cell death. Combinations of agents that affect different and multiple mechanisms of neurodegeneration may be necessary to reach meaningful outcomes in trials of ALS. This trial has several unique features. First, it compares the neuroprotective potential of two combinations of agents that impact multiple mechanisms of cell death. The combinations of minocycline/creatine and celecoxib/creatine are the only agents that have had additive effects in the mouse model of ALS, reducing neurodegeneration and prolonging survival more than individual agents alone. Second, it uses an important new phase II selection trial design to determine which combination is superior. Not only does this trial test combination therapy, but there is no placebo, so everyone who enrolls in the trial will receive active treatment. Minocycline, creatine and celecoxib have been tested individually and have been shown to be safe in patients with ALS. This will be the first time human trials will be conducted with combinations of minocycline/creatine and celecoxib/creatine. We will compare combinations of drugs in a phase II trial design to determine which combination is superior. If successful, this trial will lead directly to a phase III trial of the selected combination. If the design is found useful, this trial will lead to larger phase II selection trials assessing greater numbers of agents simultaneously, thereby improving the efficiency of drug screening in ALS.</detailed_description>
