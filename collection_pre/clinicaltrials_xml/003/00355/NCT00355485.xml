	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research project is to study the effect of micordermabrasion to try to improve the appearance of facial acne. The microdermabrasion machine is a hand-held device that directs pressurized aluminum oxide crystals at its target accompanied by a suction device. It is not yet clear how much improvement can be seen with these treatments or exactly how the skin's response causes these improvements. In this study, we are interested in learning how well microdermabrasion works to improve the symptoms of acne.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Microdermabrasion for Acne</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acne vulgaris remains among the most common cutaneous disorders, impacting the vast majority of people at some point during their lives. It is associated with significant psychosocial morbidity, and there remains the need for efficacious and low risk therapeutic options. Microdermabrasion is a technique combining abrasion and negative pressure used primarily in the treatment of aging skin. It has also been proposed to improve acne presumably through a comedolytic effect. Negative pressure and abrasion may remove debris from follicular orifices that act as a nidus for acne lesions. Many physicians and spas use micordermabrasion as a treatment for acne, however, there has never been a randomized controlled trial to substantiate this practice. We propose to evaluate the efficacy of microdermabrasion in the treatment of inflammatory acne. We will use the Bellamed microdermabrasion system produced by Bella products or the Altair Diamondtome System.</detailed_description>
