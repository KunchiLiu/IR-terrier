	<brief_summary>Diabetes is a major cause of peripheral vascular disease(PVD) and is associated with male hypogonadism. Diabetes and PVD are both associated with arterial stiffness and intima -media thickness which are also related to severity of the clinical syndrome of PVD. Artificially induced hypogonadism results in increasing arterial stiffness whilst testosterone is known to improve risk factors for vascular disease and act as a vasodilator. The purpose of this pilot study is to assess the effect of testosterone treatment on PVD arterial stiffness and intima-media thickness in men with type 2 diabetes and hypogonadism,</brief_summary>
