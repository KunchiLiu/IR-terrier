	<brief_title>Green Laser Photocoagulation Study in Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy is ocular pathology in poor glycaemic controlled Diabetic patient Characterized by micro-vascular pathology with capillary closure in the retina leading to hypoxia of tissue there by formation of immature vessels to provide better oxygenation of retinal tissue. In this randomized double blinded study a convenient sample size of 24 eyes assigned to compare indigenously developed green laser with already available green laser.</detailed_description>
