	<brief_summary>The investigators want to test a navigation system for guidance during insertion of stent graft in abdominal aortic aneurysms. The navigation system consists of software developed by SINTEF Health, a custom made catheter with a micro position sensor in the tip and an emitter than induces an electromagnetic field around the patient. Preoperative CT- and intraoperative DynaCT- data are reconstructed into 3 dimensional images. The 3 dimensional images are loaded into the navigation system. Then the magnetic field, in which the patient finds himself, is calibrated with the 3 dimensional images. When the catheter is inserted into the iliac artery and aorta, the position sensor (in the tip of the catheter) is displayed in real time at the exact anatomic location in the 3 dimensional image. Null hypothesis (H0): - Insertion of stent graft is performed equally satisfactorily with fluoroscopy alone as with both fluoroscopy and new navigation technology Alternative hypothesis (H2): - Insertion of stent graft is NOT performed equally satisfactorily with fluoroscopy alone as with both fluoroscopy and new navigation technology</brief_summary>
