	<brief_summary>The present randomized trial was initially intended to study the benefits of a combined treatment with growth hormone (GH) and a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist for pubertal children with idiopathic short stature. However, treatments were stopped in January 2012 at the request of the French drug agency. Therefore, a protocol amendment divided the study in two study periods. Study Period 1 involved combined treatment with somatropin and leuprorelin or treatment with somatropin alone. Participants from France who participated in this Period 1 of the study were asked to participate in a long term safety follow up defined as a Period 2 of the study. Participants from the Netherlands were offered participation in Genetics and Neuroendocrinology of Short Stature International Study (GeNeSIS, clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01088412) for long term safety follow up independent of this study.</brief_summary>
