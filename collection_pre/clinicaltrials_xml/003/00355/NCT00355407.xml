	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to find out if Darbepoetin alfa is effective in treating low red blood cell levels after allogeneic stem cell transplant. Darbepoetin alfa has been shown to help raise red blood cell levels without blood transfusions.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Darbepoetin Alfa (Aranesp) Following Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Participants will receive Darbepoetin alfa through an injection under the skin, about 28-35 days after their allogeneic stem cell transplant. They will continue to receive the study drug once every three weeks for a maximum of four doses. - Blood tests will be performed at weeks 3, 6, 9 and 12. The blood tests done at week three will check to make sure the participant has enough iron in their system. If not, they will need to take an iron supplement. Participants will also take a folate supplement to help cell growth and reproduction.</detailed_description>
