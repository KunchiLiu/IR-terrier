	<brief_summary>This is an open-label, international, multi-center study designed to provide access to pazopanib for subjects who have been enrolled in the Phase III renal cell carcinoma study (VEG105192) and have progressed on placebo. Subjects will receive 800 mg pazopanib once daily. The study treatment will continue until subjects experience disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or death. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of pazopanib for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma. The secondary objectives of the study are to assess response rate (defined as complete response or partial response), progression-free survival, and overall survival. Response rates will be collected per investigator assessment (no central review). Subjects will have a CT/MRI scan every 6 weeks until week 24 and every 12 weeks thereafter.</brief_summary>
