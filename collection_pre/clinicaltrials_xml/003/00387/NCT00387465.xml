	<brief_summary>This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of azacitidine when given together with entinostat and to see how well they work in treating patients with recurrent advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Azacitidine and entinostat may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving azacitidine together with entinostat may kill more tumor cells.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Azacitidine and Entinostat in Treating Patients With Recurrent Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess safety, characterize toxicities, and determine the maximum tolerated dose of 5-AZA (azacitidine) with a fixed-dose of entinostat in patients with recurrent advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). (Phase I) II. To determine the objective response rate of 5-AZA and entinostat in patients with recurrent NSCLC. (Phase II) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the pharmacokinetic profile of 5-AZA and entinostat in patients with recurrent NSCLC. II. To assess the pharmacodynamic effects of 5-AZA and entinostat on deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylation, histone acetylation, and gene re-expression in patients with recurrent NSCLC through analysis of blood, sputum and tissue biopsies. III. To explore the effect of 5-AZA and entinostat on progression-free and overall survival in patients with recurrent advanced non-small cell lung cancer. IV. To explore the differing response rates and progression-free survivals of two schedules of 5-AZA and entinostat in patients with recurrent advanced non-small cell lung cancer. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, phase I, dose-escalation study of azacitidine followed by an open-label, phase II study. Patients receive azacitidine subcutaneously (SC) on days 1-6 and 8-10 and entinostat orally (PO) on days 3 and 10. Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months.</detailed_description>
