	<brief_summary>This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of sunitinib in treating young patients with refractory solid tumors. Sunitinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for their growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sunitinib in Treating Young Patients With Refractory Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase II dose of sunitinib malate in pediatric patients with refractory solid tumors. II. Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients. III. Characterize the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients. IV. Evaluate the tolerability and pharmacokinetic profile of sunitinib malate capsule contents sprinkled over applesauce or yogurt using the recommended phase II dose. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine, preliminarily, the antitumor effects of this regimen in these patients. II. Describe changes in peripheral blood monocyte counts, circulating endothelial cells, and plasma angiogenic factors during treatment with sunitinib malate. III. Explore changes in tumor vascular permeability using dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE)-magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients receiving sunitinib malate. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study (part A) followed by a pediatric-friendly formulation study (part B). PART A: Patients receive oral sunitinib malate once daily on days 1-28 days. Treatment repeats every 42 days for up to 18 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of sunitinib malate until the MTD is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. PART B: Patients receive sunitinib malate capsule contents sprinkled over applesauce or yogurt once daily on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 42 days for up to 18 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After the first course, patients may switch to capsule formulation for convenience. NOTE: Patients will not receive sunitinib malate on day 2 of the first course to allow for pharmacokinetic testing. Blood is collected on days 1, 7, 14, 21, and 28 of course 1 for pharmacokinetic studies using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.</detailed_description>
