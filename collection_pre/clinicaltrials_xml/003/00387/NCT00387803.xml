	<brief_title>Safety and Effectiveness of Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy With Defibrillation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients enrolled received a device with cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) and defibrillation. Patients were randomized to CRT on or off for up to six months and evaluated for mortality, hospitalization, and functional outcomes including exercise capacity, quality of life, symptomatic status, and echocardiographic analysis.</detailed_description>
