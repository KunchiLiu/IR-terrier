	<brief_title>Computer-Based Training in Patients With Post-Chemotherapy Cognitive Impairment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women in the United States, with an estimated 211,240 new cases of invasive breast cancer diagnosed among women, and 1,700 diagnosed in men, in 2005. While cure rates have improved significantly, chemotherapy for breast cancer is associated with a number of negative side effects. One of which is a deficit in cognitive function, a condition commonly referred to as "chemobrain". While the debate about cognitive decline being a result of chemotherapy is still ongoing, there is clear evidence of cognitive decline in women with breast cancer post-chemotherapy. Cognitive decline is often reported to affect memory, attention, executive functioning and information processing speed. Studies suggest that incidence of "chemobrain" ranges from 17% - 75% in women who have undergone chemotherapy.This cognitive impairment affects quality of life by impacting patients' ability to concentrate, make decisions and to fulfill family, career, and community responsibilities. Although there is uncertainty about the mechanisms that can lead to this cognitive decline, there is a pressing need to identify interventions that will alleviate its symptoms and help breast cancer survivors recover their cognitive functioning and resume their roles and activities at the pre-cancer level. Brain plasticity refers to the brain's capacity for physical and functional change; it is this capacity that explains how experience induces learning throughout life. On the basis of a growing body of literature in the fields of psychophysics, neurology, neuropsychology, and brain plasticity, we hypothesize that the brain processing machinery can be refined, elaborated, and strengthened through rigorous training and learning. The purpose of this study is to investigate if such training can improve cognitive functioning. We hypothesize that continuous active interaction with environments that are demanding to sensory, cognitive, and motor systems, together with imbedded rewards for successful performance will help improve memory and cognitive functioning in patients suffering from "chemobrain".</detailed_description>
