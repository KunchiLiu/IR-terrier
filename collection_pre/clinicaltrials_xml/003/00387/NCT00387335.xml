	<brief_summary>This phase II trial is studying how well sunitinib works in treating patients with recurrent and/or metastatic head and neck cancer. Sunitinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sunitinib in Treating Patients With Recurrent and/or Metastatic Head and Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the overall response rate of patients with recurrent and/or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck treated with sunitinib malate. II. Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients. III. Determine the feasibility of administering this drug to patients with ECOG performance status 2 (cohort B). OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, cohort study. Patients are assigned to one of two cohorts according to ECOG performance status (ECOG 0-1 [cohort A] vs ECOG 2 [cohort B]). Patients receive oral sunitinib malate once daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for at least 1 year.</detailed_description>
