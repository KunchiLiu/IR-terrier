	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to assess whether a single dose of rhBMP-2/CPM administered at the fracture site via percutaneous injection, in combination with standard of care, accelerates fracture union and return to normal function in subjects who have a closed diaphyseal tibial fracture when compared to standard of care alone.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Skeletally mature, male and female subjects who are at least 18 years old. Closed diaphyseal tibial fracture. Closed reduction and definitive internal fixation by means of a reamed, locked intramedullary nail within 72 hours after injury. Concurrent fractures of the ipsilateral or contralateral lower extremity other than the ipsilateral fibula, that would impede performance on the functional assessment of weight bearing. Planned procedure(s) to stimulate fracture healing after intramedullary nailing. Neurovascular impairment of the fractured limb, deep vein thrombosis, or (impending) compartment syndrome.</criteria>
