	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to quantify the amount of corneal staining observed with various marketed contact lens/multipurpose solution combinations. The hypothesis is that there are measurable differences in the amount of corneal staining between the various combinations.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of Corneal Staining With Various Contact Lens/Solution Combinations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A series of clinical studies is being conducted at one research site using a double-masked, randomized cross-over design. Each study consists of asymptomatic daily wear soft contact lens wearers observed at baseline and at two and four hours post lens insertion. Corneal staining is being assessed using sodium fluorescein, a cobalt filter and a yellow filter. Subjective comfort assessments are obtained at each visit.</detailed_description>
