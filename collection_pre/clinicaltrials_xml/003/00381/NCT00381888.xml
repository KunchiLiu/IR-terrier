	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Fondaparinux may help prevent blood clots from forming in patients who are undergoing surgery for gynecologic cancer. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well fondaparinux works in preventing blood clots in patients undergoing surgery for gynecologic cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fondaparinux in Preventing Blood Clots in Patients Undergoing Surgery for Gynecologic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Evaluate the efficacy of prolonged (4 weeks) fondaparinux sodium administration in venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in patients undergoing gynecologic oncology surgery. Secondary - Evaluate the safety of this regimen in these patients (4 weeks). - Determine the feasibility of this regimen in these patients (4 weeks). OUTLINE: This is an open-label study. Beginning after surgery, patients receive fondaparinux sodium subcutaneously once daily on days 1-28 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo duplex ultrasonography of the lower extremities between day 28-35.</detailed_description>
