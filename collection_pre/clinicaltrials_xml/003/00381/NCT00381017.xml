	<brief_summary>This is a Phase 3b, randomized, open-label, parallel-group, multi-center, multi-national study of low-dose maintenance Peg interferon alpha-2b (Peg-Intron®) in subjects with human immunodeficiency virus-hepatitis C virus (HIV-HCV) co-infection. The primary objective is to compare at end of study the efficacy of Peg-Intron® monotherapy (0.5 µg/kg subcutaneously once weekly for 24-36 months) versus standard supportive care, using the time to any of the following clinical events (death, decompensation, liver transplant, hepatocellular carcinoma [HCC]) as endpoints.</brief_summary>

Creatinine clearance &gt;50 mL/min, as assessed by the indirect calculation method. Demonstrate stable status of HIV1 infection. On stable antiretroviral therapy (HAART) for at least 6 weeks prior to baseline, with the expectation of their HAART regimen (drugs and dosage) remaining unaltered for the first 8 weeks of the study OR Willing to delay initiation of HAART therapy for at least 6 weeks (for subjects who have not been on HAART for at least 8 weeks prior to randomization). "Structured treatment interruptions" will be permitted during the study. Counseled in the appropriate use of birth control while in this study, as confirmed by the principal investigator or a subinvestigator. Free of any clinically significant disease (other than HCV and HIV) that would interfere with study evaluations. Female who is pregnant, intends to become pregnant during the study or within two months after study completion, or is nursing. Male subject whose partner wants to become pregnant. Using silymarin. Positive test at screening for antiHAV IgM Ab, HBsAg, antiHBc IgM Ab, or HBeAg. Any cause of liver disease other than chronic hepatitis C. Suspected or having hypersensitivity to interferon. History of liver decompensation status or other evidence of bleeding from esophageal varices, signs of current bleeding, significant ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, jaundice or other conditions consistent with decompensated liver disease. Present with a lesion suspicious for hepatic malignancy on the screening imaging. Any active malignant disease, suspicion, or history of malignant disease within 5 years prior to study enrollment (except for adequately treated basal cell carcinoma). Known coagulation or hemoglobin diseases. Organ transplant, except corneal or hair transplant. Any known preexisting medical condition that, in the investigator's opinion, could interfere with the subject's participation in and completion of the study, such as major depressive disorder. Active HIVrelated opportunistic infection and/or malignancy requiring systemic therapy. Evidence of known severe retinopathy. Subject has not observed the designated washout periods for any of the prohibited medications. Participating in any other hepatitis C clinical study.</criteria>
