	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare pharmacokinetics by IFN assays and pharmacodynamics by patient's HCVRNA suppression of 360 mug peginterferon QW, 9 MU interferon daily or 4,5 MU interferon daily in combination with 180 mug peginterferon QW in the first 4 weeks of treatment. Comparison of virological breakthrough/relapse rate after dose adjustments and sustained virological response rate will be assessed by the type of induction.</brief_summary>
