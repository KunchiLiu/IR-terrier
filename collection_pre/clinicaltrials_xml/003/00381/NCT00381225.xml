	<brief_title>Feasibility of Radiofrequency Ablation in the Management of Papillary Thyroid Cancer Under Ultra-Sound Guidance.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Around 23,000 cases of thyroid cancer are discovered annually in the US, and PTC accounts for 70-75% of those cases. The conventional treatment consists mainly of surgical resection, in the form of lobectomy with/without isthmusectomy, or total thyroidectomy, making it one of the most commonly performed procedures. It has high costs, and exposes the patients to morbidity of surgery and anesthesia. PTC tends to be indolent with a 90% cure rate and controversy exists regarding extent of treatment. Percutaneous image-guided RFA has received increasing attention as a promising minimally invasive technique for the treatment of focal malignant disease. It permits the in situ destruction of tumors without necessitating their surgical excision.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Aged 1890 years old Patients with low risk welldifferentiated PTC, diagnosed by US guided FNA, and whose management decision is total thyroidectomy. Patients with only one dominant malignant nodule will be included in the study. Patients with size of their thyroid nodule ranging only between 14cm in diameter will be included in the study. Patients with nodules located only in between the mid and lower pole of the thyroid gland will be included in the study. When the patient does not meet the inclusion criteria. When the patient has a contraindication of surgery or anesthesia. If the patient refuses involvement in the study.</criteria>
