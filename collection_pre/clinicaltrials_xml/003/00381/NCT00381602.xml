	<brief_summary>Malnutrition and altered protein catabolism are serious problems in renal failure and hemodialysis (HD) patients. The purpose of this study is to characterize the safety of GHRP-1/AG in subjects with ESRD on HD; to characterize the pharmacodynamics (PD) of GHRP-1/AG in subjects with ESRD on HD by following GH and IGF-1; to describe the relationship between GHRP-1 PD and plasma concentrations of GHRP-1 and des-Ala-GHRP-1; and to evaluate the preliminary efficacy of GHRP-1/AG on nutritional status of subjects with ESRD on HD using subjective global assessment of malnutrition inflammation scores (MIS) and changes in caloric intake.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase II, Randomized, Cross-Over, Vehicle-Controlled, Double-Blind, Multicenter Study of the Safety, Pharmacodynamics, and Preliminary Efficacy of GHRP-1/AG in Subjects With ESRD on Hemodialysis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized, cross-over, double-blind, vehicle-controlled study. Subjects will receive single subcutaneous injections of the active GHRP-1/AG study treatment and vehicle control (ATRIGEL delivery system) in a randomized sequence. Each injection will be followed by a 4-week period of treatment exposure and a 2-week period of washout/follow-up. Treatments will be administered on the 2nd dialysis day of a 3x/week dialysis schedule. The total duration of study participation will be 12 weeks. Safety will be followed throughtout the study with vital signs, electrocardiogram, clinical chemistry and hematology parameters, endocrine parameters, adverse events, and concomitant medications. PD effects of GHRP-1/AG will be evaluated by measuring GH, ICF-1, IGF-BP3, prolactin, and cortisol. Efficacy will be evaluated throughout the study with MIS, caloric intake, nPCR, dry weight, BMI, and albumin, BUN, creatinine, calcium, potassium, HGB, HCT, and CBC.</detailed_description>
