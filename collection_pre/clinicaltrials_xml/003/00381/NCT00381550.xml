	<brief_summary>This phase II trial is studying how well giving 3-AP together with fludarabine works in treating patients with myeloproliferative disorders (MPD), chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), or accelerated phase or blastic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as 3-AP and fludarabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. 3-AP may help fludarabine work better by making cancer cells more sensitive to the drug. 3-AP and fludarabine may also stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving 3-AP together with fludarabine may kill more cancer cells.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>3-AP and Fludarabine in Treating Patients With Myeloproliferative Disorders, Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia, or Accelerated Phase or Blastic Phase Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the efficacy of 3-AP (Triapine®) followed by fludarabine phosphate in patients with myeloproliferative disorders or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia in aggressive phase or transformation or chronic myelogenous leukemia in accelerated phase or blast crisis. II. Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients. III. Determine, preliminarily, the effect of this regimen on circulating leukemic cell genetics in these patients. Outline: This is an open-label study. Patients receive 3-AP (Triapine®) IV over 4 hours followed by fludarabine phosphate IV over 30 minutes on days 1-5. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo bone marrow and/or peripheral blood collection at baseline and periodically during study treatment for molecular analysis of Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) mutations, GATA-1 mutations, and expression of the death-inducer-obliterator (Dido) genes on chromosome 20q. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.</detailed_description>
