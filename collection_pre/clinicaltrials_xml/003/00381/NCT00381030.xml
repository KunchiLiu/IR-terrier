	<brief_summary>The purpose of our study was to determine if a strategy of starting a heart medication (Beta-blocker) before patients leave the hospital and then being seen by a nurse manager would reduce subsequent hospitalizations compared to usual care. Hypothesis: A nurse-directed heart failure management program with inpatient initiation of beta blockers will improve health outcomes in a vulnerable, predominantly Hispanic and African American population.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Carvedilol on Health Outcomes in Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Heart failure is a leading cause of death and hospitalization in the US. Designing practical approaches to improving heart failure care is therefore a national health priority. One retrospective study suggested that patients taking beta-blockers while hospitalized for heart failure had a lower risk of rehospitalization at 6-months. One prospective study suggested that starting beta blockers among hospitalized heart failure patients is safe and improves compliance. However, improved outcomes of this approach have not been prospectively demonstrated. Comparison: Inpatient initiation of the beta-blocker carvedilol coupled with outpatient follow-up with a nurse manager was compared to usual care by internists and cardiologists.</detailed_description>
