	<brief_summary>The primary aim of this study is to examine the effect of a multi-component intervention, designed to reduce consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages, on weight gain, total energy intake, and diet quality in adolescents. The secondary aim is to evaluate whether outcomes of the intervention differ between adolescents for whom 100% fruit juice vs. other products (i.e., soda, fruit punch, lemonade, iced tea, coffee drinks, energy drinks, sports drinks) constitutes the primary source of sugar from beverages.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Reducing Sugar-sweetened Beverage Consumption in Overweight Adolescents</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We are partnering with community organizations (including high schools) in the greater Boston area and a major regional supermarket. Participants will be 240 high school students who drink at least 1 serving of sugar-sweetened beverage (including 100% fruit juices) per day and who have a BMI ≥ 85th percentile. They will be randomly assigned to an intervention or control group. The intervention, of 1-year duration, will target the home/family environment in combination with a behavioral intervention provided during brief check-in visits. The environment will be changed by delivering non-caloric beverages to the homes of adolescents who regularly consume sugar-sweetened beverages. Parents will be counseled by telephone to serve as role models in consuming non-caloric beverages. The behavioral intervention for the adolescents will include didactic and experiential components during the check-in visits. Study outcomes will be assessed at baseline, 1 year (end of intervention period), and 2 years (end of follow-up period). Additional relevant material based on the original proposal (NIH grant application) is provided below: Each outcome will be compared between groups using a general linear model, adjusted for baseline covariates that could affect body weight: sex, race, ethnicity (Hispanic vs non-Hispanic), household income, parents' education, BMI, beverage consumption (sugar-sweetened, artificially sweetened, unsweetened), energy intake (total, sugar-sweetened beverages, fruit juice), physical activity level, and daily television viewing. Each covariate will be tested for confounding, mediation, and interaction effects on the primary outcome. Stratum-specific estimates of the group difference will be constructed for any covariates showing significant interaction.</detailed_description>
