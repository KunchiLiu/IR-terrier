	<brief_summary>Most chronic pain patients with insomnia are currently not well-managed using existing medications. If found to safely improve sleep with chronic pain patients, nabilone could be added to the treatment options available in the management of fibromyalgia and associated symptoms. The principle hypothesis of this study is that nabilone at a dose of 0.5-1mg is as efficacious as amitriptyline at a dose of 10-20mg, in improving sleep quality in patients with fibromyalgia.</brief_summary>
