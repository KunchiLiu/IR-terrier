	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Aprepitant, palonosetron, and dexamethasone may help lessen or prevent nausea and vomiting in patients receiving chemotherapy. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving aprepitant together with palonosetron and dexamethasone works in preventing nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy in patients receiving chemotherapy for metastatic colorectal cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Trial Evaluating the Efficacy and Tolerability of Aprepitant &amp; Palonosetron for Prevention of Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Evaluate the efficacy, in terms of nausea and vomiting control, of aprepitant, palonosetron hydrochloride, and dexamethasone, in preventing chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in patients receiving FOLFOX or FOLFIRI chemotherapy for metastatic colorectal cancer. Secondary - Assess the percentage of patients with no emesis and no rescue therapy when treated with aprepitant, palonosetron hydrochloride, and dexamethasone during repeated courses of FOLFOX or FOLFIRI chemotherapy. - Assess the effects of aprepitant on nausea, appetite, taste changes (via visual analogue scale), nutritional intake, and mucositis in these patients. - Assess the safety of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study. Beginning 1 hour prior to the initiation of chemotherapy on day 1, patients receive oral aprepitant on days 1-3, oral dexamethasone on days 1-4, and palonosetron hydrochloride IV on day 1. Nausea is assessed daily for up to 4 courses of chemotherapy. Quality of life is assessed at baseline. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 100 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
