	<brief_title>C2P - Phase III: MPowerment and Community Promise</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Community Promise: Role model stories comprise the "heart" of printed materials distributed throughout the target community. The role model stories are brief publications that depict personal accounts from individuals in the population of focus who have made or are planning to make a risk-reducing behavioral change. The messages in the role model stories are reinforced by interpersonal communication with trained peer advocates. MPowerment: is a community level HIV/STD prevention program that relies on peer advocates from the community to lead outreach activities including discussion groups (M-groups), venue-based outreach, social events and a publicity campaign. Sites will adapt MPowerment for local use remaining faithful to the core elements.</detailed_description>
