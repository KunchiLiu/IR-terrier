	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as azacitidine, work in different ways to stop the growth of abnormal cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well azacitidine works in treating patients with myelofibrosis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Azacitidine in Treating Patients With Myelofibrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the efficacy of azacitidine in patients with myelofibrosis (MF) with myeloid metaplasia. - Evaluate the safety of azacitidine in these patients. Secondary - Evaluate pertinent biologic characteristics of MF before and during therapy with azacitidine. - Assess the effects of study treatment on constitutional symptoms in these patients. - Estimate time to event distributions for overall survival and progression. OUTLINE: Patients receive azacitidine subcutaneously once daily on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 3 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 35 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically confirmed myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia (MMM), including any of the following subtypes: Agnogenic myeloid metaplasia Postpolycythemic myeloid metaplasia Postthrombocythemic myeloid metaplasia Evaluable and symptomatic disease, defined as 1 of the following: Anemia (hemoglobin &lt; 10 g/dL or erythrocyte transfusiondependent, requiring 1 transfusion ≤ 8 weeks) Treatment required* for symptomatic palpable splenomegaly (palpable hepatomegaly is acceptable if previously splenectomized) NOTE: *Subjective but painful enough to mandate intervention Absence of t(9;22) by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) or standard cytogenetics (by peripheral blood or marrow) Previous demonstration of a lack of this translocation (at any point) is sufficient No advanced malignant hepatic tumors PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: ECOG performance status 02 Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,000/mm³ Platelet count ≥ 50,000/mm³ Creatinine ≤ 2.0 mg/dL Total bilirubin ≤ 2.0 mg/dL OR direct bilirubin ≤ 2.0 mg/dL if total bilirubin elevated (unless attributed to underlying disease) AST and ALT ≤ 2 times upper limit of normal (unless clinically attributed to hepatic extramedullary hematopoiesis) Not pregnant or nursing Negative pregnancy test Fertile patients must use effective contraception No baseline peripheral or autonomic neuropathy ≥ grade 2 No condition, including the presence of laboratory abnormalities, that would preclude study compliance No hypersensitivity to mannitol or azacitidine Not incarcerated in a municipality (i.e., county, state, or federal prison) PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: At least 14 days since prior chemotherapy, including interferon alfa, anagrelide, or other myelosuppressive agents At least 14 days since prior systemic corticosteroids At least 14 days since prior investigational agents</criteria>
