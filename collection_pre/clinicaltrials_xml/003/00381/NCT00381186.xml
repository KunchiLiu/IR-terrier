	<detailed_description>Objective To evaluate the effect of a 3-year diet- and exercise lifestyle intervention, based on general public health recommendations, on glucose tolerance, insulin resistance and metabolic cardiovascular risk factors in Dutch subjects with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). Research design and methods 147 IGT subjects (75 male, 72 female) were randomized to the intervention group (INT) or control group (CON). 106 subjects (52 INT, 54 CON) completed 3 years of intervention. Annually, glucose, insulin and FFA concentrations were determined during fasting and after an oral glucose tolerance test, in addition to measurements of body weight, serum lipids, blood pressure and maximal aerobic capacity.</detailed_description>
