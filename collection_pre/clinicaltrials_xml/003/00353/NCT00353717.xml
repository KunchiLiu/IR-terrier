	<brief_summary>Basal like breast carcinoma is a Her2, estrogen receptor (ER) progesterone receptor (PR) negative breast cancer. It is notable for the high level of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression in this tumor subtype . Thus the investigators wanted to combine the use of anti EGFR therapy in the form of Erbitux (cetuximab) with the widely used weekly taxol chemotherapy for the treatment of these women. This is a small phase I/II study.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Basal like breast carcinoma is a Her2, ER PR negative breast cancer. It is notable for the high percentage of EGFR expression in this tumor subtype.Weekly taxol (paclitaxel) is widely used in breast cancer patients with metastatic disease. Erbitux (cetuximab) is a monoclonal antibody that shown its ability to enhance activity of chemotherapy in colon carcinoma. Thus we wanted to combine the use of anti EGFR therapy in the form of Erbitux (cetuximab) with the widely used weekly taxol chemotherapy for the treatment of women with basal like breast carcinoma. This is a small phase II study that will hopefully provide initial data as to the general tolerability and response rate of this combination in this disease. Furthermore, pathologic analysis will be used to try and assess relation of response with the presence of immunohistochemical markers such as EGFR expression.</detailed_description>
