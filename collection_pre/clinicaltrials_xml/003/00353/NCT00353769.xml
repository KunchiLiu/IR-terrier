	<brief_title>Comparison Study on Hair Apposition Technique Performed Between Nurses and Doctors in Emergency Department.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hair Apposition Technique (HAT) is a relatively new technique for treating certain scalp lacerations. It has been shown to be equally acceptable as compared to the standard toilet and suture. This procedure has been the technique of choice for suitable scalp lacerations in Department of Emergency Medicine, Singapore General Hospital (DEM, SGH) and Emergency Medicine Department, National University Hospital (EMD, NUH). Currently HAT is being performed by doctors in the respective hospitals. Nurses, on the other hand, are routinely using tissue adhesives for minor wound closure. However, nurses in Kandang Kerbau Women and Children Hospital (KKWCH) have been routinely using HAT for 1 year now. Studies had been also been done by nurses in treating of minor wounds using various tissue adhesives as well as hair knotting technique.The trend of nurses handling minor wounds with tissue adhesives, hair knotting technique as well as HAT suggested the possibility of nurses performing HAT to a degree as competent as a doctor. This study aims to compare the effectiveness, complications and benefits HAT performed between nurses and doctors in the Emergency Department.</detailed_description>
