	<brief_summary>This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active comparator-controlled phase 2/3 study of three dose levels of MBX-102 (200, 400, 600 mg) given orally to patients with type 2 diabetes receiving concomitant therapy with insulin. Eligible patients will be adults with type 2 diabetes who are taking intermediate- and/or long-acting insulin or pre-mixed (e.g., "70/30") insulin, or a combination of insulin and one or two non-TZD hypoglycemic agents including sulfonylurea, metformin, acrabose or Byetta, but who are poorly controlled on their existing therapy. Preference for enrollment will be given to patients on insulin monotherapy. Patients treated with a combination of insulin and other hypoglycemic agent(s) must be willing and able to discontinue and washout of the hypoglycemic agent(s) for the entire duration of the study (in toto, approximately 28 weeks). Patients who are taking fixed doses of a short-acting insulin (e.g., not a "sliding scale") in combination with intermediate-acting insulin may qualify for the study if both the patient and investigator are willing to either change to pre-mixed insulin (e.g., 70/30) or discontinue use of the short acting insulin for at least 26 weeks. Patients treated with a sliding scale of short-acting insulin will not be eligible for enrollment.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active comparator-controlled phase 2/3 study of three dose levels of MBX-102 (200, 400, 600 mg) given orally to patients with type 2 diabetes receiving concomitant therapy with insulin.

Patients treated with a sliding scale of short-acting insulin will not be eligible for enrollment. Following any insulin dose adjustment during the first few weeks of the study, insulin dose and regimen should remain constant for the duration of the study. No stand alone (e.g., other than pre-mixed) short- or ultrashort-acting insulin and/or sliding scale will be allowed for the entire duration of the study. A minimum of 400 patients will be randomized in this study (approximately 80 to each of the five treatment arms). Additional patients may be enrolled as appropriate to replace screen failures and drop-outs during the initial period of the study.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Type 2 diabetes (as described by the Expert Committee on the Diagnosis and Classification of Diabetes Mellitus24) treated with insulin alone (a stable dose of long and/or intermediateacting insulin or premixed insulin e.g., "70/30") ≥ 30 units/day for at least 3 months, but poorly controlled on their existing therapy Or, patients treated with insulin (as above) in combination with nonTZD hypoglycemic agents (e.g., a sulfonylurea, metformin, acrabose, or Byetta for at least 3 months, but poorly controlled on their existing therapy Or, patients treated with fixed doses of shortacting insulin in combination with intermediateacting insulin for at least 3 months, but poorly controlled on their existing therapy Patients in last 2 categories must be willing to discontinue the use of OHA and/or shortacting insulin (or change to premixed insulin) for at least 26 weeks. Male or female, 1875 years of age Provide informed consent and agree to comply with study requirements Current monotherapy insulin dose regimen ≥ 30 units/day (stable for 8week Runin/stabilization Period); or patients who need insulin dose adjustment must have a stabilized dose ≥ 30 units/day. Patients must not have taken TZDs within 5 months of screening All female patients must be surgically sterile, postmenopausal (at least 40 years of age with no history of menses for at least 2 years) or agree to use adequate contraception(s) that must include a barrier method (other methods may include oral contraceptives, double barrier methods, intrauterine devices, or abstinence).
