	<brief_summary>The overall goal of this study is to use MRI to: - Examine the relationship between known risk factors for cardiovascular disease and coronary artery wall thickness; - Examine the relationship between coronary artery wall thickness and other markers of subclinical coronary atherosclerosis, such as carotid wall thickness and coronary calcium scores; and, - Examine the feasibility of measuring the progression of coronary artery wall thickness over time in a subset of participants.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Each enrolled participant will undergo MR Imaging of the coronary arteries in conjunction with their routine MESA follow-up visit. The MRI will last approximately 45-60 minutes</detailed_description>
