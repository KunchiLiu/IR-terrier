	<brief_summary>This single arm study will investigate possible pharmacokinetic interactions between Xeloda and oxaliplatin, and assess whether the pharmacokinetics of Xeloda and/or oxaliplatin is influenced by the addition of Avastin. All subjects will provide samples for pharmacokinetic analysis during the first 3 cycles of treatment. In cycles 1 and 2 patients will receive a treatment regimen containing Xeloda (1000mg/m2 bid) and oxaliplatin (130mg/m2 iv) and in cycle 3 Avastin (7.5mg/kg iv) will be added to the regimen. The anticipated time on study treatment is 3-12 months, and the target sample size is &lt;100 individuals.</brief_summary>
