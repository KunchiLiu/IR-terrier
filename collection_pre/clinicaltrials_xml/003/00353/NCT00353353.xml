	<brief_summary>In the Netherlands fortification of food products is not yet mandatory. One of the major arguments of the Dutch Health Council to advise against mandatory fortification is the possibility of masking of a vitamin B12 deficiency. A possible solution to overcome the possibility of masking is: fortification of foods with both folic acid and vitamin B12. In this study we want to assess the effects of this fortification strategy on markers of folate and vitamin B12 status.</brief_summary>
