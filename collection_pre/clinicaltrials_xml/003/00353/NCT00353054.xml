	<brief_title>Effect of Calcium/Vitamin D Supplementation on Body Weight and Fat Loss.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The effect of a calcium supplementation on body weight loss is inconclusive and some studies have suggested that adequate calcium intake can have a favourable effect on some metabolic variables. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the impact of (Caltrate 600 + D ®) on body composition and various indicators of metabolic health in overweight and obese females characterised by a usual low daily calcium intake, on a weight-reducing program. The main hypotheses of this study were: - Caltrate 600 +D® increases body weight and fat mass losses of individuals on a weight-reducing program. - Caltrate 600 +D® improves the metabolic profile of these subjects, independently of variations promoted by body fat loss.</detailed_description>
