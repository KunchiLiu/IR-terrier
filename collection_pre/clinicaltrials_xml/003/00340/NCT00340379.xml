	<brief_title>Ziprasidone vs. Sertraline/Haloperidol in Psychotic Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Psychotic depression is a well-established DSM-IV diagnostic subtype indicating the presence of hallucinations and/or delusions as part of the clinical presentation. Currently the treatment of choice for psychotic depression is either electroconvulsive therapy or combination of antipsychotic and antidepressant medications. Ziprasidone will be compared to standard of care treatment comprising a combination of an antidepressant, sertraline and an antipsychotic, haloperidol, over a 12-week period. An additional 12-week extension phase is also included for responders to the initial study.</detailed_description>

Baseline blood chemistries that are outside local reference ranges and which are felt clinically significant by the site investigator, or a potassium, magnesium or calcium level outside of local reference ranges or liver function tests that are greater than 20% above the upper limit of local reference ranges. If magnesium and/or potassium are below the lower limit of the local laboratory norm, they may be repeated and rechecked during the screening phase, and if within laboratory norms, the subjects may be included.
