	<brief_summary>In a collaborative effort with the IBN AL-NAFEES Hospital (Damascus, Syrian Arab Republic), individuals from multiplex families determined to have hereditary oral clefts will be studied. The purpose of this study is to identify the gene(s) involved in heritable oral clefts by linkage analysis and gene mapping strategies. Characterization of genes involved in inherited oral clefts could provide important insight into the inheritance and pathogenesis of this disease.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA: Enrollment in this study will be limited to individuals with nonsyndromic unilateral or bilateral cleft lip with or without cleft palate and their unaffected relatives, from families which meet the following criteria: 1. A cluster of 2 or more affected first degree relatives, such as a parent and two offspring or 2 siblings, or 2. The occurrence of oral clefts in each of 2 generations in either the proband's paternal or maternal lineages. EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Families with syndromic forms of oral clefts. Individuals unable to provide consent, except for cases who are children and mentally impaired persons with consenting parents or guardians.</criteria>
