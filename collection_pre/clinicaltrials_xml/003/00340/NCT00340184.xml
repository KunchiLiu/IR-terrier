	<brief_title>A Safety and Efficacy of CCRT With Paclitaxel/Carboplatin as Adjuvant Therapy to Post-operative Cervical Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Stage Ib to IIa cervical cancer can be treated effectively with either radioterapy or radical hysterectomy plus pelvic lymph node dissection. However, several pathological risk factors have been identified to compromise the treatment outcome. They include lymph node metastasis, the involvement of vaginal resection margin, and the parametrial invasion. In these patients, postoperative RT is commonly recommended and has been demonstrated to improve the local control, but not survival rate. Recently, It is reported that the additon of concurrent chemotherapy to postoperative RT reduced pelvic failures and enhanced progression free survival. In addition, paclitaxel/platinum combination chemotherapy was demonstrated to have superior progression-free survical over single agent platinum in a primary treatment of stage IV or recurrent cervical cancer. Based on this obseration, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of CCRT with paclitaxel/carboplatin in patients with postoperative high risk factors.</detailed_description>
