	<brief_summary>To evaluate azithromycin tear concentrations after instillation of one drop of one of the three T1225 concentrations (0.5%, 1% and 1.5%) and to evaluate the ocular safety.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ocular Pharmacokinetics After a Single Drop Instillation of T1225 0.5, 1, 1.5% in 91 Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of the present study was to compare azithromycin tear ocular concentrations after a single instillation of three different T1225 concentrations in order to determine early azithromycin tear concentration and to assess the T1225 concentration, which allowed having the higher azithromycin tear concentration, 24 hours after a single instillation.</detailed_description>
