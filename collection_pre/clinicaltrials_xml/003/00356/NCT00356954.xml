	<brief_summary>The contrast induced nephropathy (CIN) has been known to be associated with significant clinical and economic consequences. Many studies were performed to find the pathophysiology and preventive measures for CIN. But the results were somewhat frustrating. Recently, it has been reported that the N-acetylcysteine and ascorbic acid might have preventive effects for CIN by their antioxidant effects.There have been no study to compare these two antioxidant.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>NASPI: N-Acetylcysteine vs. Ascorbic Acid for Prevention of Contrast Induced Nephropathy in Renal Insufficiency Undergoing Coronary Catheterization</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>N-acetylcysteine and ascorbic acid may prevent the CIN in the patients with underlying renal insufficiency who is undergoing the coronary angiography. The effect may derive from the antioxidant function of these two antioxidant. We studied to find which of the two antioxidants is more beneficial in prevention of CIN</detailed_description>
