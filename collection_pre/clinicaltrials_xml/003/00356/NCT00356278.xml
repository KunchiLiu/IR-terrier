	<brief_title>D-cycloserine and Virtual Reality Exposure to Treat Iraq War Veterans With PTSD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a type of anxiety disorder affecting people who have witnessed or experienced a traumatic event. Veterans of war are at an increased risk for developing PTSD because of their experiences with war and combat. Symptoms of PTSD often include flashbacks or nightmares, depression, anxiety or uneasiness, and feeling emotionally numb or distant toward others. Fortunately, PTSD can be treated, usually with some combination of anti-depressants, anti-anxiety medication, and therapy. Virtual reality exposure (VRE) therapy is a new type of treatment that helps people to overcome anxiety about trauma by facing situations with the use of virtual reality. D-cycloserine is a medication that has been found to enhance the effects of psychotherapy in recent studies. This study will determine the effectiveness of VRE therapy plus D-cycloserine at reducing PTSD symptoms in Iraq war veterans. During this study, all participants will undergo one educational session and five VRE sessions. The first session will involve gathering information, learning common reactions to trauma, and participating in a breathing relaxation approach. The following five sessions will involve reviewing memories of Iraq and watching virtual Iraq sequences. Each participant will wear a head-mounted display during which they will view scenario settings such as cities, humvee convoys, and scenes related to combat. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive D-cycloserine, alprazolam (anti-anxiety drug), or placebo one half-hour before each VRE session. Prior to the first treatment session, participants will undergo a startle reaction procedure. This will entail hearing sudden tones that last a fraction of a second, and viewing virtual reality scenes. Three small electrodes, attached to each participant's face, will measure the number of eye blinks during the procedure. At several times throughout the study, heart rate and skin conductance will also be measured with electrodes. Collection of saliva samples and measurement of blood pressure will also occur several times during this study. Before, during, and immediately after treatment, participants will complete questionnaires. Participants will be contacted 3, 6, and 12 months after treatment to assess symptoms and to schedule a time for an interview, additional questionnaires, and the virtual reality-based assessment.</detailed_description>
