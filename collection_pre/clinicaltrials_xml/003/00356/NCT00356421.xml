	<brief_summary>To compare efficacy and safety of Exubera® vs Humalog in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Clinical Trial Comparing Efficacy and Safety of Exubera® and Humalog®</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pfizer announced in October 2007 that it would stop marketing Exubera®. At that time recruitment for study, A2171035 was placed on hold. Nektar, the company from which Pfizer licensed Exubera®, announced on April 9, 2008 that it had stopped its search for a new marketing partner. Accordingly, there will be no commercial availability of Exubera®. As a result, study A2171035 was terminated on May 12, 2008. Neither safety nor efficacy reasons were the cause of the study termination.</detailed_description>
