	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is identify biological parameters reflecting proteolytic activity in the exhaled condenstaes which might be useful to follow up pulmonary inflammation in various conditions including cystic fibrosis, COPD, asthma, tobacco exposure. Three proteases will be analyzed, i.e. elastase, proteinase 3 and cathepsin G. Results in the condensates will be compared to those obtained in sputum.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>5 groups of 20 individuals each: group 1 CF, group 2 COPD, group 3 asthma, group 4 tobacco exposure, group 5 control subjects. Collection of exhaled condensates in all subjects and of sputum in subjects belonging to groups 1 and 2. Clinical examination and PFTs in all patients.</detailed_description>
