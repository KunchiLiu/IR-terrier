	<brief_title>Opioid Rotation From Morphine to Methadone in Treatment of Non-malignant Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Twelve patients with poor pain control or unacceptable side effects during treatment with morphine were switched to methadone and followed for nine months in this open prospective study. Primary outcomes were patient preference for opioid and pain control while physical, cognitive and role functioning were secondary outcomes. The morphine dose was decreased by 1/3 daily and was replaced with an equianalgesic dose of methadone over a three-day period. During switching and a one-week dose titration period, patients were given additional methadone if required. During dose titration one patient experienced sedation requiring naloxone. Four patients were switched back to morphine due to poor pain control, drowsiness or sweating. Seven patients preferred long-term (&gt;nine months) treatment with methadone and reported reduced pain and improved functioning while cognition was not improved. This study brings novel information on the long-term consequences for pain control, health-related quality of life and cognitive functioning with a switch from morphine to methadone in the treatment of chronic non-malignant pain.</detailed_description>
