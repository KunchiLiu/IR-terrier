	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of biventricular pacing over conventional right ventricular pacing in patients with persistent or permanent, symptomatic atrial fibrillation undergoing atrioventricular (AV) node ablation and permanent pacing therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) Study for the Approval of Closed Loop Stimulation (CLS) and Cardiac Resyncronization Pacing Therapies (CRT) for the Treatment of Atrial Fibrillation (AF) With Ablate and Pace</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a multi-center, prospective, randomized, blinded trial. The study will consist of approximately 265 patients who require treatment of persistent or permanent, symptomatic atrial fibrillation by atrioventricular (AV) node ablation and permanent pacing therapy i.e. "Ablate and Pace" therapy. All patients enrolled into the clinical study will be randomly assigned to one of three groups using a randomization ratio of 2:2:1. Patients will be assigned to receive either biventricular (biV) pacing with CLS-based rate adaptive pacing using the legally marketed Protos DR/CLS (Group 1), or biventricular pacing with accelerometer-based rate adaptive pacing using the Stratos LV (Group 2), or right ventricular (RV) pacing with accelerometer-based rate adaptive pacing using the Stratos LV (Group 3). Patients in all three groups will be implanted with legally marketed right and left ventricular pacing leads. The patients, the core lab used to interpret the echocardiographic data and the Clinical Events Committee adjudicating crossover, patient death and congestive heart failure (CHF) hospitalizations will be blinded to the randomization assignment.</detailed_description>
