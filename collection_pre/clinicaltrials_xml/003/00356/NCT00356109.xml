	<brief_summary>A study to test for non-inferiority of preprandial HIIP [also known as AIR® Inhaled Insulin Powder][AIR® is a registered trademark of Alkermes,Inc.] compared with preprandial injectable insulin (insulin lispro) with respect to HbA1c after 6 months of treatment in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus. This study is designed also to examine insulin antibody levels in AIR Insulin -treated patients compared with injectable insulin-treated patients with type 1 diabetes. The present study is intended to determine if preprandial AIR Insulin is non-inferior to preprandial injectable insulin (insulin lispro) with respect to mean change in HbA1c from baseline to endpoint at 6 months in patients with type 1 diabetes.</brief_summary>
