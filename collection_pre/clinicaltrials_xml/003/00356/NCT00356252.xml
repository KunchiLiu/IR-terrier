	<brief_summary>This study will examine the the efficiency fo absorption of major plant pigments, carotenoids, (lutein, beta-carotene and lycopene)and will measure the biological functions of carotenoids in healthy women in response to an 8-week period of carotenoid supplementation. The antioxidant capacity (in both the aqueous and lipid compartments), DNA oxidation (single cell gel electrophoresis), Insulin-like Growth Factor (IGF-1), Insulin-like Growth Factor Binding Protein-3 (IGFBP-3), (gene expression profile (high-density filter-based cDNA microarrays), lipid peroxidation (MDA analysis and Isoprostane determination), and antioxidant nutrient levels (carotenoids, tocopherols, ascorbic acid and uric acid) in the circulation will be measured every other week throughout the study period.</brief_summary>
