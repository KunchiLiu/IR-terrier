	<brief_title>Azithromycin Combination Therapy for the Treatment of Uncomplicated Falciparum Malaria in Bangladesh</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In view of spreading antimalarial drug resistance there is an urgent need for new combination treatments for a disease that kills more than one million people every year. Azithromycin is a macrolide antibiotic that is particularly attractive due to its safety in children and experience with use in pregnancy. Recent trials suggest that azithromycin has a strong potential as an antimalarial. The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy of azithromycin combination therapy for the treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria in Bangladesh.</detailed_description>

Malaria drug therapy administered in the past 30 days by history 5. Previous participation in this trial, or participation in any other studies involving investigational or marketed products, concomitantly or within 30 days prior to entry in the study 6. History of significant cardiovascular, liver or renal functional abnormality or any other clinically significant illness, which in the opinion of the investigator would place them at increased risk. 7.
