	<brief_title>Safety of Cardiac Pacemakers in 3 Tesla MRI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recently, a shift could be observed from cardiac pacemakers being an absolute contraindication to being a relative contraindication for MR imaging at 1.5 Tesla, depending on a patient-per-patient risk-benefit-evaluation, which includes an urgent clinical need for MR imaging (other imaging modalities non-conclusive) and co-morbidities (especially cardiac co-morbidities). At the same time, MR imaging at 3 Tesla is evolving from a research application only to an important imaging modality today. Using the improved signal-to-noise-ratio, high field MR-Systems with a field strength of 3 Tesla offer a variety of diagnostic advantages to 1.5 Tesla systems. These advantages lead to a higher sensitivity and specificity in diagnosing, foremost neurological, disorders. In this study, we evaluate the safety of MR imaging of the brain in patients with cardiac pacemakers at 3T.</detailed_description>
