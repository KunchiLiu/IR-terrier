	<brief_title>Comparison of Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy and Roux-Y-gastric Bypass in the Treatment of Morbid Obesity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Obesity is reaching epidemic proportions in the developed world. In morbidly obese patients only surgical treatment (bariatric operations) leads to a sustained weight loss and cure of comorbidities in the majority of patients. There exist a number of different operations resulting in either a restrictive effect and/or malabsorption, accompanied by a humoral effect which is caused by changes of the different gastrointestinal hormones. It is still unknown which patients needs which operation. Working Hypothesis The laparoscopic sleeve-gastrectomy (SG) compared to laparoscopic proximal Roux-Y-gastric bypass (PGB) is as successful in the treatment of morbid obesity in the majority of patients. In case of insufficient weight loss malabsorption can to be added by performing laparoscopic bilious-pancreatic diversion duodenal switch (BPD). The resection of the gastric fundus (LG) leads to changes in gastrointestinal hormones that are possibly different to bypassing the fundus (PGB). Specific Aims We plan to compare the SG and PGB in a prospective randomized study. Primary outcome measure is effectiveness in terms of weight loss, reduction in co-morbidity and quality of life, secondary outcome measures are early morbidity, duration and cost of the operation, late morbidity, re-operations (for complications, for insufficient weight loss), postoperative changes of gastrointestinal hormones. Experimental Design/Methods An interdisciplinary team evaluates morbidly obese patients for bariatric surgery. After informed consent eligible patients will be randomized into SG or PGB, a number of 45 per group. Preoperative examination consists of: quantification of comorbidity, eating behavior, indirect calorimetry, body composition by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), routine blood chemistry, gastrointestinal hormones before and after test meal, gastroscopy, manometry of the esophagus, upper GI series, abdominal ultrasound, quality of life. Perioperative investigations: operative time, fat tissue samples (omental and subcutaneous), early morbidity, gastrointestinal hormones before and after test meal, duration of hospital stay, costs; Follow-up data will be obtained every 3 months in the first year, twice in the second year and once per year thereafter: weight, reduction in comorbidities, blood tests, gastrointestinal hormones before and after test meal, DEXA and quality of life.</detailed_description>
