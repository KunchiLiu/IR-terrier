	<brief_summary>The primary purpose of the study is to evaluate the long term efficacy of sodium oxybate (Xyrem®) and zolpidem tartrate (Ambien®) in treating chronic insomnia. We will compare the efficacy of sodium oxybate with zolpidem tartrate (Ambien®), and compare the efficacy of each of these two medications with placebos.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Xyrem(Sodium Oxybate) and Ambien(Zolpidem Tartrate) in the Treatment of Chronic Insomnia.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary aim: 1. To assess the long term efficacy of sodium oxybate and zolpidem tartrate in reducing insomnia and improving sleep quality. Secondary aims: To compare the magnitude of sleep improvement sodium oxybate produces with that of zolpidem tartrate. To compare and contrast the profile of effects of oxybate and zolpidem on sleep architecture, sleep latency, wake after sleep onset, and sleep efficiency. To explore the extent to which sodium oxybate and zolpidem tartrate improve daytime functions that are adversely affected by poor/inadequate sleep. To assess the extent of rebound insomnia that is associated with abrupt discontinuation of sodium oxybate and zolpidem tartrate.</detailed_description>
