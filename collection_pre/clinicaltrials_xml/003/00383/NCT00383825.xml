	<brief_title>ICG Angiography in Amniotic Membrane Graft and Conjunctival Autograft After Pterygium Excision</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The vascularization and perfusion of conjunctival autografts and amniotic membrane grafts after surgery may have significance in terms of pterygium recurrence and progression. Fluorescein angiography of the anterior ocular segment has been used to evaluate ocular inflammation in scleral inflammation. However, when fluorescein is used, the quality of the angiograms is limited by rapid extravasation of the dye due to diffusion through the fenestrated capillaries of the conjunctiva and episclera. Because fluorescein has a low molecular weight and is not a protein bound molecule, patchy leakage during the first transit of the dye, which obscures the angiographic details even before the late phases of the angiogram, can be seen. In contrast, indocyanine green (ICG) is a larger molecule than fluorescein and is more highly found in protein bound form. Therefore, it remains within the fenestrated vessels and shows negligible extravasation, which makes it ideal for use in anterior segment angiography. Tan and coworkers have shown that the morphology of pterygium recurrence inevitably reflects a high degree of vascularity. In this prospective study, we evaluated the anterior segment indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) findings for graft vascularization after primary pterygium excision with LCAT or AMT.</detailed_description>
