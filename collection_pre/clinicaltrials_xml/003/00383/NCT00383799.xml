	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether intravenous amiodarone has less cardiac significant adverse events compared to intravenous procainamide in the acute treatment of haemodynamically well tolerated wide QRS tachycardia, the majority of them of probably ventricular origen.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Iv Amiodarone Versus Iv Procainamide to Treat Haemodynamically Well Tolerated Ventricular Tachycardia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multicenter, prospective and randomized study in phase IV. A total of 302 patients will be included in the study within 40-50 institutions in Spain. Patients with regular and monomorphic tachycardia ≥ 120 bpm, QRS ≥ 120 ms and haemodynamically well tolerated will be randomized to receive iv amiodarone (single dosage: 5 mg/kg in 20 minutes) vs iv procainamide (single dosage: 10 mg/kg in 20 minutes). The study period will be 40 minutes from infusion initiation. Study variables include the presence of clinically cardiac significant adverse events: hypotension, syncope, heart failure, symptomatic sinus bradycardia, AV block, proarrhythmia and tachycardia acceleration (&lt;20 lpm)and death. Total observation period will be 24 hours after the end of the infusion.</detailed_description>
