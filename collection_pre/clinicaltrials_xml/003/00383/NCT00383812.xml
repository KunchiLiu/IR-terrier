	<brief_summary>1. Primary objectives a. To evaluate the Effects of intravitreal Bevacizumab on polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy(PCV) 2. Secondary objectives 1. To assess the changes in visual acuity 2. To assess the change in lesion characteristics of PCV - size of PCV - fluorescein leakage - foveal thickness 3. To investigate the safety of intravitreal Bevacizumab in patients with PCV 4. To assess the effect of intravitreal Bevacizumab on the recurrence rate and the the incidence of submacular hemorrhage in patients with PCV</brief_summary>
