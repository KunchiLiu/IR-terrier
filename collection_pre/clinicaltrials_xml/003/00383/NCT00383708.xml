	<brief_summary>The main aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of the co-administration of lanreotide Autogel 120 mg (administered via deep sub-cutaneous injections every 28 days) and pegvisomant (administered at 40 to 120 mg per week via sub-cutaneous injection given once or twice a week) on IGF-1 levels over 28 weeks in acromegalic patients. The primary endpoint will be the percentage of acromegalic patients with normalised (age and sex adjusted) IGF-1 level at the end of the co-treatment period.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>The patient must have had documentation supporting the diagnosis of acromegaly, including elevated GH and/or IGF1 levels The patient is treated with pegvisomant, because of IGF1 level remaining above ULN when treated with somatostatin analogue, on a daily basis for at least 3 months and has normal (age and sex adjusted) IGF1 level, or IGF1 level above the upper limit of normal (ULN) after treatment with pegvisomant 30 mg per day, OR the patient is treated with lanreotide Autogel or octreotide LAR for at least 6 months including 3 months at the highest marketed dose and has a serum IGF1 level above ULN, 28 days after the last injection At the end of the runin period, The patient has a serum IGF1 level above 1.2 x ULN, or a serum IGF1 level between ULN and 1.2 x ULN and a serum GH nadir &gt; 1 Âµg/L (assessed by an OGTT), 28 days after the 3rd injection of lanreotide Autogel 120 mg OR the patient is diabetic and has a serum IGF1 level above 1.2 ULN, 28 days after the 3rd injection of lanreotide Autogel 120 mg The patient has undergone pituitary surgery or radiotherapy within 6 months prior to study entry, or it is anticipated that it will be done during the study The patient has already been treated with a somatostatin analogue associated with a GH antagonist The patient has received dopamine agonist within 6 weeks prior to the study entry The patient has abnormal hepatic function at study entry (defined as AST, ALT, GGT, alkaline phosphatase, prothrombin time or total bilirubin above 2 ULN) The patient is at risk of pregnancy or is lactating</criteria>
