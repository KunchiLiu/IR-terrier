	<brief_title>Pegylated Interferon and Ribavirin in Hepatitis C Virus Infection After Liver Transplantation.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hepatitis C recurrence after liver transplantation remains the main cause of graft loss after liver transplantation. Several strategies can be used to prevent or treat hepatitis C in the setting of liver transplantation. There are no controlled studies evaluating the efficacy and safety of antiviral treatment (using pegylated interferon and ribavirin) in liver transplant recipients. The main endpoint of this study was: 1) histological outcomes (effect of antiviral treatment on disease progression, i.e. liver fibrosis). The secondary endpoint were 1) Sustained virological response (persistent HCV-RNA clearance) and 2) Safety of pegylated interferon and ribavirin</detailed_description>
