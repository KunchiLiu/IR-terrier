	<brief_summary>Data from other countries have suggested that oral mifepristone used as a cervical ripening agent may decrease induction to delivery time in midtrimester inductions. To our knowledge, there are no trials comparing mifepristone to laminaria in a standard clinical setting with standardized misoprostol induction protocol to examine the issue of induction to delivery time. We hypothesize that mifepristone will work at least as well as laminaria for midtrimester cervical ripening prior to induction of labor with misoprostol.</brief_summary>
