	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Finding out which problems affect employment in survivors of gynecologic cancer may help in planning cancer treatment and improve the quality of life of future cancer survivors. PURPOSE: This research study is looking at ways to improve employment in patients who have survived cervical cancer, uterine cancer, or ovarian cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Improving Employment in Patients Who Have Survived Cervical Cancer, Uterine Cancer, or Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Conduct formative work, including 4 to 5 focus groups, leading to development of a structured interview instrument assessing factors related to employment outcomes among women with gynecologic cancers. - Pilot a recruitment strategy and administer the interview among a sample of 60 to 70 gynecologic cancer survivors; and, with each woman's permission, a family member, a key health care provider, and her supervisor will be interviewed. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, pilot study. Patients complete a survey, meet with a focus group, and undergo a short interview. Patient-designated participants are also interviewed; these individuals may include a health care provider, a significant other, and/or a work supervisor. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 70 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
