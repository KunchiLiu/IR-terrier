	<brief_summary>This is a randomized, multi-center, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study, evaluating the efficacy of mometasone furoate/formoterol fumarate (MF/F) metered dose inhaler (MDI) versus MF for 26 weeks. Prior to the 26-week double-blind Treatment Period, participants will receive open-label (OL) MF MDI 100 mcg twice daily (BID) for 2 to 3 weeks during the Run-in Period. Efficacy will be measured by the Area Under the Curve from 0 to 12 hours [AUC](0-12 hours) of the change from Baseline to the Week 12 Endpoint in Forced Expiratory Volume in One Second (FEV1) and by the time-to-first severe asthma exacerbation across the 26-week treatment period.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>&gt;=12 years, either sex, any race, asthma diagnosis &gt;=12 months that is consistent with the following: Diagnosis based on clinical history &amp; examination, pulmonary function parameters &amp; response to beta2agonists, according to international guidelines. Been using low daily dose of inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) (either alone or in combination with longacting beta agonist [LABA]) &gt;=12 weeks &amp; been on stable asthma regimen for &gt;=2 weeks prior to Screening. Low daily doses of ICS are: 200500 mcg beclomethasone chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), 100250 mcg beclomethasone hydrofluoroalkane (HFA), 200600 mcg budesonide dry powder inhaler (DPI), 5001000 mcg flunisolide, 100250 mcg fluticasone, 200 mcg MF, 4001000 mcg triamcinolone acetonide, 80 to 160 mcg ciclesonide. Note: Dose delivery by method/modality other than these must be equivalent. No harm in changing current asthma therapy to investigator, subject (legal representation, if applicable) must be willing to discontinue his/her ICS or ICS/LABA combination prior to initiating MF MDI runin medication at Screening Visit, &amp; transferred to openlabel treatment with MF MDI 100 mcg BID for 23 weeks prior to Baseline Visit. To document diagnosis of asthma &amp; assure responsiveness to bronchodilators before randomization 1 of these can be used at Screening Visit or thereafter, but prior to Baseline Visit: Demonstrate increase in absolute FEV1 &gt;=12% &amp; &gt;=200 mL within approximately 15 to 20 minutes after administration of 4 inhalations of albuterol/salbutamol (total dose 360400 mcg) or nebulized shortacting beta agonist (SABA) (2.5 mg) if confirmed as standard office practice, OR Demonstrate peak expiratory flow (PEF) variability &gt;20% expressed as percentage of the mean highest &amp; lowest morning prebronchodilator (before taking albuterol/salbutamol) PEF over &gt;=1 week, OR Demonstrate diurnal variation in PEF of &gt;20% based on difference between prebronchodilator (before taking albuterol/salbutamol) morning value &amp; postbronchodilator value (after taking albuterol/salbutamol) from evening before, expressed as percentage of mean daily PEF value. At Screening Visit, FEV1 must be &gt;=60% &amp; &lt;=90% predicted. At Baseline Visit, FEV1 must be &gt;=60% &amp; &lt;=85% predicted when all restricted drugs have been withheld for appropriate intervals. Lab tests at Screening Visit must be normal or acceptable to investigator/sponsor and include serum pregnancy for females of childbearing potential). Electrocardiogram (ECG) at Screening Visit, using centralized transtelephonic technology must be acceptable to investigator. Chest xray performed at Screening Visit or within 12 months prior to Screening Visit must be acceptable to investigator. Subject (legal representation, if applicable) must be willing to give written informed consent &amp; able to adhere to schedules. A nonpregnant woman of childbearing potential must use birth control. Includes: hormonal contraceptives including hormonal vaginal ring, hormonal implant or depotinjectable; Intrauterine device (IUD); medically prescribed topicallyapplied transdermal contraceptive patch; condom in combination with spermicide; monogamous relationship with male who had vasectomy. Started birth control method &gt;=3 months prior to Screening (exception condom), &amp; must agree to continue its use. Female of childbearing potential who is not currently sexually active must agree &amp; consent to using birth control, should she become active. Women who have been surgically sterilized or are &gt;=1 year postmenopausal are not considered to be of childbearing potential. Female must have negative serum pregnancy test at Screening. Increase/decrease in absolute FEV1 of &gt;20% at any time from Screening Visit up to &amp; including Baseline Visit. Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) will be performed in the morning. &gt;8 inhalations/day of SABA MDI or &gt;=2 nebulized treatments/day of 2.5 mg SABA on 2 consecutive days from Screening Visit up to &amp; including Baseline Visit. Decrease in AM/PM PEF below Screening Period stability limit on 2 consecutive days prior to randomization. Asthma deterioration results in emergency treatment, hospitalization, or treatment with additional, excluded asthma medication (including oral or other systemic corticosteroids, but allowing SABA) as judged by investigator at any time from Screening Visit up to &amp; including Baseline Visit. Treated in emergency room (ER) (for severe asthma exacerbation requiring systemic glucocorticosteroid treatment) or admitted to hospital for management of airway obstruction within last 3 months. Ever required ventilator support for respiratory failure secondary to asthma. Upper/lower respiratory tract infection within previous 2 weeks prior to Screening &amp; Baseline Visits. Visits can be rescheduled 2 weeks after complete resolution. Smoker or exsmoker &amp; has smoked within previous year or has cumulative smoking history &gt;10 packyears. Significant abnormal vital sign. Evidence upon visual inspection of significant oropharyngeal candidiasis at Baseline or earlier with or without treatment. If there is evidence at Screening or PreBaseline Visit, may be treated as appropriate &amp; Baseline Visit can be scheduled upon resolution. History of significant renal, hepatic, cardiovascular, metabolic, neurologic, hematologic, ophthalmologic, respiratory, gastrointestinal, cerebrovascular, or other which, in judgment of investigator, could interfere with study or require treatment which might interfere with study. Examples include (but are not limited to) insulindependent diabetes, hypertension being treated with betablockers, active hepatitis, coronary artery disease, arrhythmia, significant QTc prolongation (ie QTcF or QTcB [Fridericia or Bazett corrections, respectively &gt;500 msecs), stroke, severe rheumatoid arthritis, chronic openangle glaucoma or posterior subcapsular cataracts (including prior cataract surgery), acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), or conditions that may interfere with respiratory function such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic bronchitis, emphysema, bronchiectasis, cystic fibrosis. Others which are wellcontrolled &amp; stable (eg hypertension not requiring betablockers) will not prohibit participation if deemed appropriate by investigator. Allergic/intolerant of glucocorticoids, beta2agonists, or any inactive excipients in study drugs. Female who is breastfeeding, pregnant, or intends to become pregnant while in study. Illicit drug user. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive (testing not done). Unable to use oral MDI inhaler. Has been taking any restricted medications prior to Screening without meeting required washout. Cannot adhere to prohibited &amp; permitted concomitant medications. May not participate in same study at another site. Cannot participate in different study at any site, during same time. Must not be randomized into study more than once. No person directly associated with administration of study may participate. Previously participated in trial with MF/F.</criteria>
