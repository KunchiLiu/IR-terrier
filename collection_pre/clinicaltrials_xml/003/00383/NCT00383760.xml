	<brief_summary>This phase II trial is studying how well E7389 works as second-line therapy in treating patients with locally advanced, unresectable, or metastatic pancreatic cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as eribulin mesylate, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Eribulin Mesylate as Second-Line Therapy for Locally Advanced, Unresectable, or Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: I. To determine the objective response (complete and partial) to E7389 in patients with locally advanced, unresectable, or metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma that progressed after prior gemcitabine hydrochloride-based therapy. SECONDARY OBJECTIVE: I. To determine the antitumor activity of E7389, in terms of median survival, 1-year survival rate, response or stable disease duration, toxicity, and time to disease progression, in these patients. OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study. Patients receive eribulin mesylate IV on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, all patients are followed at 4 weeks. Patients with complete response, partial response, or stable disease are followed every 3 months.</detailed_description>
