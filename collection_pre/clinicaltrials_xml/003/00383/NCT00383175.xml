	<brief_title>Reading Fluency and Accommodative Lag</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Many children are believed to under accommodate (have a lag of accommodation) when looking at near targets. If this occurs, the retinal image is out of focus. Children who have a lag of accommodation may have difficulty in focusing their eyes at near for long periods of time. This difficulty could reduce their ability to read fluently. Children with above average lags of accommodation will be randomly assigned to a group which receives special reading glasses or a group which does not. The groups will be assessed using a standard test for reading fluency.</detailed_description>
