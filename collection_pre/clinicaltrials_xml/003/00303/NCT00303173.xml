	<brief_summary>Over 10% of women have high blood pressure during their pregnancy which may affect their health or that of their baby. There are currently no methods to prevent most high blood pressure in pregnancy and some treatments are not desirable for use in pregnancy. Previous research indicates that simple relaxation methods can reduce blood pressure and anxiety levels for some people, but this has not been well-studied, especially during pregnancy. This pilot study is intended to determine how guided imagery (imagining relaxing scenes) affects blood pressure and anxiety, and to assess how satisfied women are with this technique. Sixty-six pregnant women with high blood pressure will be randomly assigned to (1) listen to a guided imagery audio-compact disc or (2) quiet rest, at least twice-daily for 4 weeks. All women in both groups will receive all usual care, plus will have their blood pressure measured regularly during 1 day per week for 4 weeks. This study will determine if imagery lowers maternal blood pressure, and if further research on imagery effects on pregnancy health outcomes is feasible.</brief_summary>
