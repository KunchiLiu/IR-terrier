	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Cryotherapy kills tumor cells by freezing them. This may be an effective treatment for primary lung cancer or lung metastases that cannot be removed by surgery. PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well cryotherapy works in treating patients with primary lung cancer or lung metastases that cannot be removed by surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cryotherapy in Treating Patients With Primary Lung Cancer or Lung Metastases That Cannot Be Removed By Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Estimate the local and distant failure rates after percutaneous thoracic cryotherapy (PTC) in patients with unresectable primary lung cancer or lung metastases. - Estimate rates of PTC complications and adverse reactions. - Determine the correlations between procedural parameters and follow-up imaging parameters, with the latter being used as surrogates of local and/or distant treatment failure. OUTLINE: Patients undergo CT-guided percutaneous thoracic cryotherapy over 2 hours under local or general anesthesia. Grouped cryoprobes are inserted into the tumor, utilizing a freeze-thaw-freeze cycle, creating cytotoxic temperatures (less than -20°C to -40°C) that encompass the entire anticipated tumor volume. Patients undergo positron emission tomography at baseline and after cryotherapy to assess tumor standard uptake variable. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
