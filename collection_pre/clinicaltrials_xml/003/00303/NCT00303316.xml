	<brief_summary>This study will assess both the antibody persistence of the investigational vaccine and the immune response and safety of a booster dose of PENTAXIM™ vaccine in 18 months-old toddlers who participated in an earlier study in order to determine if they are still protected before they receive a booster dose of D, T, IPV, pertussis or Hib vaccines and also to assess the quality of the induced immune memory in response to a booster dose of the same vaccine as in the primary series. Primary Objective: To describe the antibody persistence at 18 months of age and the booster effect of a dose of PENTAXIM™ on immunogenicity. Secondary objective: To describe the safety profile of the booster dose PENTAXIM™ in each vaccine group defined by the vaccines received during the primary series.</brief_summary>
