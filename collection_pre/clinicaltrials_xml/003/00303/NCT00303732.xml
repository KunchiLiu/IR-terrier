	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Vatalanib and everolimus may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking blood flow to the tumor and by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of vatalanib and everolimus and to see how well they work in treating patients with advanced solid tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vatalanib and Everolimus in Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of vatalanib and everolimus in patients with advanced solid tumors. - Determine the safety and tolerability of vatalanib and everolimus in patients with advanced solid tumors. - Evaluate the safety and tolerability of vatalanib and everolimus at the MTD in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Secondary - Describe the non dose-limiting toxic effects associated with vatalanib and everolimus. - Describe the pharmacokinetics of vatalanib and everolimus in patients with advanced solid tumors. - Determine the functional extent of mTOR inhibition by changes in the phosphorylation status of S6K protein in peripheral blood mononuclear cells in patients treated with vatalanib and everolimus. - Describe any clinical responses seen in patients with metastatic RCC in a dose-expansion cohort treated at the MTD. - Observe overall survival of RCC patients treated with vatalanib and everolimus. - Determine the time to progression of patients with RCC treated with vatalanib and everolimus. OUTLINE: This is a phase I dose-escalation study followed by a phase Ib study. - Phase I (solid tumors): Patients receive oral vatalanib on days 1-28 and oral everolimus on days 15-28 during course 1 and on days 1-28 during all subsequent courses. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of vatalanib and everolimus until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. - Phase Ib (renal cell carcinoma only): Patients receive oral vatalanib and oral everolimus at the MTD on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 6 months. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 44 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
