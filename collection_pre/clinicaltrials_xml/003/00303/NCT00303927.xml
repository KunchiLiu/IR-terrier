	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as capecitabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well capecitabine works as second-line therapy in treating patients with stage IV pancreatic cancer who have the thymidylate synthase gene.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Capecitabine as Second-Line Therapy in Treating Patients With Stage IV Pancreatic Cancer Who Have the Thymidylate Synthase Gene</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Characterize the 6-month survival of patients with stage IV pancreatic cancer (progressing after at least 1 prior gemcitabine-containing chemotherapy regimen) who carry the double tandem repeat (S/S) variant of the thymidylate synthase (TS) gene enhancer region (TSER) treated with capecitabine. - Characterize toxicity of capecitabine in patients with stage IV pancreatic cancer who carry the S/S variant of the TSER. Secondary - Explore the association between capecitabine exposure at steady-state, allelic variants in candidate genes (carboxylesterase 1, carboxylesterase 2, cytidine deaminase, thymidine phosphorylase [TP], dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase [DPD], methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase) and drug response (toxicity and efficacy) in this patient population. - Determine the relationship between expression of TS, TP, and DPD in tumor tissues and the response to capecitabine in this patient population. - Analyze response rate to capecitabine, based on the presence of homozygous S/S variant of the TSER. OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study. Patients receive oral capecitabine twice daily on days 1-14. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 65 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
