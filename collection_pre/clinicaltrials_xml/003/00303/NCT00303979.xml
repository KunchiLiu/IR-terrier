	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to characterize current management of patients with either heart failure or prior myocardial infarction and left ventricular dysfunction and to assess the effect of education, specific clinical guidelines, reminder systems, comprehensive disease state management tools, benchmarked quality reports, and academic detailing on the use of evidence-based heart failure therapies in cardiology practices. This study is a quality improvement initiative that is being conducted through review of patient records.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>IMPROVE HF: Registry to Improve the Use of Evidence-Based Heart Failure Therapies in the Outpatient Setting</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>IMPROVE HF, the largest US outpatient HF patient registry, has substantially contributed to our knowledge of how systolic HF and post MI left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) patients are treated in the outpatient setting. The findings of IMPROVE HF clearly support this guideline and may help to establish a model framework for future performance improvement programs for outpatient cardiology practices.</detailed_description>
