	<brief_title>Pulse Steroids Versus Oral Steroids in Problematic Hemangiomas of Infancy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently there is no prospective study in hemangioma patients answering critical questions such as: which type of steroid should be used,how much should we use and for how long. This study is an investigator blinded study with two arms:one arm is receiving standard treatment with daily oral corticosteroids and the other is receiving intravenous pulse corticosteroids daily for 3 days, monthly for 3 months. The main outcome of the study is assess the efficacy of each treament modality as the percentage improvement in the hemangioma's appearance. The secondary outcomes are the safety profiles of the two drugs and the changes in the angiogenesis markers as a result of treatment intervention.</detailed_description>
