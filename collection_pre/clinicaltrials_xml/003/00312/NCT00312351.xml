	<brief_summary>The purpose of this trial is to compare the ability of three different doses of pegaptanib sodium to safely and effectively minimize fluid leakage within the eye, thereby stabilizing or improving vision in patients with wet AMD. The study will also examine the effects of pegaptanib sodium on the cornea and sensory retina of patients with wet AMD.</brief_summary>
