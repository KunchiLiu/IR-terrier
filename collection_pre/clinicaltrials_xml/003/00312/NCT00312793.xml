	<brief_summary>This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Myospare, a non-invasive device, which is connected to the body via electrodes placed in the injured leg. The electrodes which are placed in the middle or upper thigh will stimulate the quadriceps muscle. Myospare will be installed 1 day after the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction surgery and will be removed after 6 weeks of treatment. The patients will be assigned to two groups: 1. Physiotherapy plus Myospare 2. Only physiotherapy The hypothesis of the study is that electrical stimulation combined with voluntary exercise is more effective than voluntary exercise alone.</brief_summary>

Patients who underwent or are planned to undergo meniscus stitching. 6. Additional fracture/s in the lower limbs as a result of the same injury. 7. Signs of infection in the surgical wounds while installing the Myospare device. 8. Known skin hypersensitivity. 9. Known heart disease 10. Patients with a cardiac pacemaker. 11. History of peripheral blood vessel disease 12. Administration of drugs which might disrupt bone metabolism: Total accumulating dosage of 150 gr' prednisone or any other glucocorticoid for seven days or more, within 6 months prior to the trial. Calcitonin for 7 days or more, within 6 months prior to the trial. Bisphosphonates for 30 days or more within 12 months prior to the study. Fluoride for bone strengthening for 30 days or more within 12 months prior to the study. Vitamin D or vitamin D metabolite for bone strengthening for 30 days or more within 12 months prior to the study. Current treatment with chemotherapeutic drugs. 13. Past or current malignant disease within 10 years of study entry. 14. Participating in another clinical study during the past four weeks. 15. Patients who are planned to undergo femoral nerve block. 16. Patients claiming social security/work accident benefits. 17. Professional athletes whose livelihood depends on sports. 18. Pregnant and or lactating women. 19. Additional symptoms, which in the doctor's opinion would prevent inclusion of the patient in the study.</criteria>
