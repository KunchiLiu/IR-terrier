	<brief_summary>Standard treatment for recurrent ovarian cancer is chemotherapy with one or more drugs. One of these drugs, Doxil, can cause skin toxicity at the standard dosages. This study investigates using a lower dose given more frequently in combination with a second drug Gemcitabine.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Doxil and Gemcitabine in Recurrent Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will evaluate the toxicities of Doxil and Gemcitabine given on an every two week basis. Our hypothesis is that toxicity will be less than that with standard dosing without any negative effect on survival. Patients will also be evaluated with CT scans every 3 months. Toxicity will be assessed with every cycle of treatment. Treatment will continue until toxicity or signs of progression.</detailed_description>
