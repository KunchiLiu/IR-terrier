	<brief_title>Posterior Capsule Opacification Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cataract is the vision impairing disease characterized by gradual, progressive thickening of the lens. Posterior Capsular Opacification (PCO) remains the most frequent long term complication. This is initiated by the migration and proliferation of residual lens epithelial cells from the lens equator in the space between the posterior capsule and intraocular lens (IOL) The combination of IOL material and a sharp edged design is effective in preventing PCO. Aurolab has developed 360 degree square edge IOL with polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) 100 bilateral senile cataract patients are going to be recruited. First group of 50 patients will receive square edge PMMA in one eye and round edge PMMA in fellow eye. Another group of 50 patients will receive square edge PMMA in one eye and acrysof in fellow eye. PCO will be assessed during each follow up using EPCO software.</detailed_description>
