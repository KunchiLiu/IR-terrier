	<brief_summary>This is a pilot study to find a correlation between MRI and ICD therapy in patients with known cardiomyopathies, aiming to determine if cardiac scarring identified by MRI correlates with ventricular arrhythmias and the occurrence of ICD therapy.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is an observational study over a 3 year period of 50 patients with known cardiomyopathy and LVEF of 35% or less who will have ICD implantation as part of their standard of care. All subjects will undergo a contrast-enhanced cardiac MRI using gadolinium to determine the morphological characteristics of their left ventricle prior to ICD implant. Subjects will not be offered sedation to minimize risk, thus those suffering from claustrophobia will be excluded or dropped from participation. MRI will be evaluated, and subjects will be followed during standard of care device interrogations for 12 months after implant.</detailed_description>
