	<detailed_description>In Germany ovarian cancer belongs to the most frequently forms of cancer in the female population. The prognosis for women with a platin refractory ovarian cancer is very bad. The median survival time amounts for less a year. Especially in this palliative situation therapies regarding efficacy as well as quality of life are needed. in Germany Topotecan is approved since 1996 for patients after previous treatment with platin, the rare non-hematological side-effects making it interesting for a palliative therapy. Since best results in a chemo-therapeutical treatment are commonly obtained with the combination of two or more cytostatic agents this study tests a Topotecan Monotherapy and two Topotecan combinations. Both combination agents show efficacy alone against solid cancer using from Topotecan different mechanism resulting in different main side effects. Total survival, remission rates, time ti progression and quality of life are the main criteria investigated.</detailed_description>
