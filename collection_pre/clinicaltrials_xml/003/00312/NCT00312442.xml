	<brief_summary>The aim of this clinical trial is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the WST09-mediated vascular-targeted photodynamic therapy (VTP) in patients with localized prostate cancer recurrent after external radiation therapy or temporary (High Dose Rate, or HDR) brachytherapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II/III Study of WST09 in Prostate Cancer After Radiation Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multicentre, open labelled, phase II/III, 6-month clinical trial with an additional follow-up at Month 12, aiming to determine the efficacy and tolerability of the WST09-mediated VTP treatment. This treatment consists of an I.V. infusion of WST09 (2 mg/kg), in combination with per-cutaneous interstitial illumination using laser light (wavelength at 763nm) delivered through optical fibres positioned through the perineum in the prostatic lobes. Patients who are eligible to participate in the study must have a clinically diagnosed positive biopsy of the prostate (up to stage T2b-N0-M0) diagnosed after external radiotherapy or temporary brachytherapy (no seeds), and present with increasing PSA levels on three consecutive occasions (at least 3 months apart) post-radiation treatment.</detailed_description>
