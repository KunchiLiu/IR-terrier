	<brief_title>Comparing Gabapentin and Amitriptyline for the Treatment of Neuropathic Pain in Children and Adolescents</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Clinical experience and case reports suggest that both amitriptyline and gabapentin are effective treatments for neuropathic pain in children; however we do not know which drug is more effective for specific pain conditions or for specific children. This study will be the first prospective, randomized double-blind controlled trial directly comparing gabapentin and amitriptyline for the treatment of neuropathic pain in a paediatric population. We will also study the time course for pain reduction and evaluate changes in children's physical function, mood, and sleep. This information is needed to determine which drug is better for which children and which pain conditions.</detailed_description>
