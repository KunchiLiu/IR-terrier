	<brief_summary>Lay Language Summary: High cholesterol levels are common in persons with HIV infection. However, conventional cholesterol-lowering medications may have harmful side effects when given to HIV-infected persons. Therefore, we plan to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of policosanol, a dietary supplement derived from sugar cane that has cholesterol-lowering properties, to lower cholesterol levels in persons with HIV infection. We hypothesize that policosanol will lower levels of LDL cholesterol ("bad" cholesterol) and raise levels of HDL cholesterol ("good" cholesterol).</brief_summary>
