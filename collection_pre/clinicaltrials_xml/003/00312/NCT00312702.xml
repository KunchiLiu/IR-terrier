	<brief_title>Phase I/II Trial of a Malaria Vaccine in Adults Living in the United States of America</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Controlled challenge, Phase I/IIa WRAIR study. - Healthy, malaria-naive adults aged 18 - 50 years. - 2 groups, 5 subjects in group A (10µg dose) and 15 subjects in group B (50µg dose). - Control: none for immunization phase; infectivity controls for challenge and rechallenge phases. Six infectivity controls per day of challenge will be enrolled for the challenge phases, with 3 alternates available for challenge if needed. - Vaccination schedule of 0, 1 months. - Challenge of up to 15 subjects in Group B. - Contingent upon short term efficacy, rechallenge of initially protected subjects 6 months (+/- 2 months) after second dose of vaccine. - Self-contained study. - Duration of the study, per subject: approximately 15 months (screening, enrollment, vaccination, challenge and rechallenge). - Data collection will be by done at the site.</detailed_description>
