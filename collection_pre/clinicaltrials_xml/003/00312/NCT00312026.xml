Patients will undergo testing during screening, and any patients who are seropositive for hepatitis B antigen, hepatitis C antibody, or HIV will be excluded. Have a history of active tuberculosis or are currently undergoing treatment for tuberculosis. A purified protein derivative (PPD) test or chest xray will be performed at the screening visit. Patients with a positive PPD test (not due to BCG vaccination) or chest xray will be excluded. Have the presence or history of malignancy within the past 5 years, including lymphoproliferative disorders. Patients with a history of fully resolved basal or squamous cell skin cancer may be enrolled. Are pregnant or lactating women Have a diagnosis of hepatic cirrhosis, regardless of cause or severity Have a history of thrombocytopenia Have a history of hemolytic anemia Have a history of clinically significant anemia Have a WBC count &lt;4,000 cells/uL or &gt;14,000 cells/uL Have a hematocrit (HCT) &lt;30% or a hemoglobin (Hgb) level &lt;11 g/dL Have a platelet count &lt;150,000 cells/uL Have hepatic enzyme levels ≥3 times the upper limit of normal Have a serum creatinine level ≥2 times the upper limit of normal Have been exposed to any experimental drugs or treatments within 30 days or 5 halflives, whichever is longer, prior to the screening visit Have had any previous exposure to efalizumab Have been vaccinated with a live virus or live bacteria within the 14 days prior to the first dose of efalizumab Have any medical condition that, in the judgment of the investigator, would jeopardize the patient's safety following exposure to study drug (efalizumab or placebo equivalent) or would significantly interfere with the patient's ability to comply with the provisions of this protocol</criteria>
