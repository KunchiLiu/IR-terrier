	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as cetuximab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Cetuximab may also stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for their growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin and irinotecan, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving cetuximab together with cisplatin and irinotecan may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving cetuximab together with cisplatin and irinotecan works in treating patients with metastatic esophageal cancer, gastroesophageal junction cancer, or gastric cancer that did not respond to previous irinotecan and cisplatin.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cetuximab, Cisplatin, and Irinotecan in Treating Patients With Metastatic Esophageal Cancer, Gastroesophageal Junction Cancer, or Gastric Cancer That Did Not Respond to Previous Irinotecan and Cisplatin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the response rate in patients with irinotecan hydrochloride- and cisplatin-refractory metastatic esophageal, gastroesophageal junction, or gastric cancer treated with cetuximab, cisplatin, and irinotecan hydrochloride. Secondary - Determine the median survival of patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the tolerability of this regimen in these patients. - Determine the adverse event profiles in patients treated with this regimen. - Assess epidermal growth factor receptor expression in tumor tissue from patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is an open-label, nonrandomized study. Patients receive cetuximab IV over 60-120 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15 and cisplatin IV over 30 minutes and irinotecan hydrochloride IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo tumor biopsy at baseline to evaluate epidermal growth factor receptor by immunohistochemistry. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for up to 1 year.</detailed_description>
