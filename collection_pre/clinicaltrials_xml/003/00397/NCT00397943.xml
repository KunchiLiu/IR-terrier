	<brief_title>Safety and Immunogenicity of 2 Formulations of Tuberculosis Vaccine GSK692342 Given at 0,1 Months to Healthy Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study is designed to have a vaccination phase (includes screening, 2 doses of vaccine 1 month apart and follow-up until 1 month post dose 2), which will be performed in an observer blinded manner. This will be followed by 3 years of follow-up which will continue in an open manner. No new subjects will be recruited at the follow-up phase. The Protocol Posting has been updated in order to comply with the FDA Amendment Act, Sep 2007.</detailed_description>

Written informed consent obtained from the subject prior to any study procedure. Free of obvious health problems as established by medical history and clinical examination before entering into the study. Subjects must have PPD negative skin reactivity (0 mm induration 48 to 72 hours after PPD skin test administration). Clinically normal laboratory values for creatinine, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), complete blood count (CBC) and differential, haemoglobin, platelet count and urinalysis. Seronegative for human immunodeficiency virus1 and 2 (HIV 1/2) antibodies, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), and hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibodies If the subject is female, she must be of nonchildbearing potential, or, if of childbearing potential, she must be abstinent or have used adequate contraceptive precautions for 30 days prior to vaccination, have a negative pregnancy test and must agree to continue such precautions for two months after completion of the vaccination series. No evidence of pulmonary pathology (i.e. acute or chronic pulmonary disease; past TB infection/disease) as confirmed by chest Xray. History of previous exposure to experimental products containing components of the experimental vaccine. Use of any investigational or nonregistered product (drug or vaccine) other than the study vaccine within 30 days preceding the first dose of study vaccine, or planned use during the study period. Chronic administration of immunosuppressants or other immunemodifying drugs within 6 months prior to the first vaccine dose. Any chronic drug therapy to be continued during the study period. Vitamins and/or dietary supplements, herbal medications, birth control pills, antihistamines for seasonal allergies, SSRIs (e.g. Prozac, Zoloft, Paxil), NSAIDs (nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs e.g. aspirin, ibuprofen), and acetaminophen are allowed. History of documented exposure to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. History of prior vaccination with experimental Mycobacterium tuberculosis vaccines. Administration of any immunoglobulins, any immunotherapy and/or any blood products within the 3 months preceding the first dose of study vaccination, or planned administrations during the study period. Participation in another experimental protocol during the study period. Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition; or family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency. History of hypersensitivity to vaccines or vaccine components History of any acute or chronic illness or medication that, in the opinion of the investigator, may interfere with the evaluation of the safety or immunogenicity of the vaccine. Volunteers with a personal history of autoimmune disease or who describe a firstdegree relative with clearly documented autoimmune disease. History of any neurological disorders or seizures. History of chronic alcohol consumption and/or drug abuse. History of allergic disease or reactions likely to be exacerbated by any component of the vaccine. Major congenital defects.
