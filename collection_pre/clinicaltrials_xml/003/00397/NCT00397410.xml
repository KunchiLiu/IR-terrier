	<brief_title>Prevention of Hip Fractures With Soft and Hard Hip Protectors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hip fractures are a major cause of disability and functional limitation. Hip protectors have shown to have the potential to lower the risk of a fracture by reducing the impact on the hip region during falls, but low uptake and adherence have been a problem. Changing the hip protector`s design might give a higher uptake and adherence. The aim of this study is to compare uptake, adherence and effect of soft and hard hip protectors in Norwegian nursing homes. Because a soft hip protector seems to be more comfortable, we expect a higher uptake and adherence with the soft hip protector, specially when it comes to 24 hour use. If the soft hip protector has the same protective quality as the hard hip protector, the soft hip protector will be a better alternative than the hard one. This cluster randomized study is performed in 18 Norwegian nursing homes in 2 municipalities. The study started May 15. 2006 and will end November 30. 2006. All permanent residents are invited to participate in the study either as a user of hip protector or as a non user.</detailed_description>
