	<brief_summary>1. Purpose: To compare the use of the menstrual cup "The DivaCupTM " to a menstrual strategy using tampons as the primary method of menstrual flow management using indicators of user-satisfaction, urinary tract infection, vaginal irritation, cost and waste. 2. Hypothesis: The "The DivaCupTM" will have similar rates of user-satisfaction, urinary tract infection, and vaginal irritation as a menstrual strategy using tampons as the primary method of menstrual flow management but will likely be more reasonable in terms of cost and will generate less waste.</brief_summary>
