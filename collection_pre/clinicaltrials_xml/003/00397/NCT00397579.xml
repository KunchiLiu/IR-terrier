	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Combinations of biological substances in DT388IL3 fusion protein may be able to carry cancer killing substances directly to the cancer cells. PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of DT388IL3 fusion protein and to see how well it works in treating patients with acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndromes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>DT388IL3 Fusion Protein in Treating Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia or Myelodysplastic Syndromes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the maximum tolerated dose of DT_388IL3 fusion protein in patients with refractory or relapsed or poor-risk acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). - Define the dose-limiting toxicities of this regimen in these patients. - Measure the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients. - Measure the immune responses in patients treated with this regimen. - Evaluate response and correlate with disease type (relapsed/refractory or poor-risk de novo AML or high-risk MDS), pretreatment marrow blast percentage, and leukemia blast interleukin-3 receptor density. OUTLINE: This is a phase I, multicenter, dose-escalation study followed by a phase II, open-label study. - Phase I: Patients receive DT_388IL3 IV over 15 minutes daily for 5 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of DT_388IL3 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. - Phase II: An additional 15 patients receive DT_388IL3 at the MTD as in phase I. Patients undergo serum and blast collection periodically for laboratory studies, including analysis of expression of interleukin-3 receptors and anti-DT_388IL3 antibodies at baseline. Samples are also analyzed by immunoenzyme assays and flow cytometry. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 5 years. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
