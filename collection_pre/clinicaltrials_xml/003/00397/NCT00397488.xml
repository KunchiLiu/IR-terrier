	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Sunitinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for their growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well sunitinib works in treating patients with progressive metastatic transitional cell cancer of the urothelium.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sunitinib in Treating Patients With Progressive Metastatic Transitional Cell Cancer of the Urothelium</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the response rate in patients with progressive metastatic transitional cell carcinoma of the urothelium treated with sunitinib malate. - Determine the safety of this regimen in these patients. Secondary - Determine the time to disease progression in patients treated with this regimen. - To determine time to tumor progression (TTP) for sunitinib malate on a continuous dosing schedule for treatment of metastatic urothelial carcinoma. - To estimate sunitinib and SU012662 trough plasma concentration (Ctrough) data for the continuous daily schedule and to determine potential association with efficacy and safety.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically confirmed transitional cell carcinoma of the urothelium, including 1 of the following sites: Bladder Urethra Ureter Renal pelvis Progressive metastatic disease Progressive disease defined as new or progressive lesions on crosssectional imaging Progressed despite prior treatment with cytotoxic chemotherapy Measurable disease Previously treated disease, as defined by the following: Received treatment with 14 cytotoxic agents Prior therapy must have included ≥ 1 of the following: Cisplatin Carboplatin Paclitaxel Docetaxel Gemcitabine hydrochloride Prior cytotoxic agents in the perioperative or metastatic setting allowed and may have been administered sequentially (e.g., firstline treatment followed by secondline treatment at time of progression) or all as part of a single regimen No symptomatic CNS metastases PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Karnofsky performance status 60100% Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,000/mm³ Platelet count ≥ 100,000/mm³ Hemoglobin ≥ 8.0 g/dL Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 mg/dL (unless Gilbert's disease is present) AST and ALT ≤ 2.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN) (5 times ULN if liver function abnormalities are due to underlying malignancy) Creatinine ≤ 2.0 mg/dL Not pregnant or nursing Negative pregnancy test Fertile patients must use effective contraception None of the following within the past 6 months: Myocardial infarction Severe or unstable angina Coronary or peripheral artery bypass graft Symptomatic congestive heart failure Cerebrovascular accident or transient ischemic attack Pulmonary embolism No ongoing cardiac dysrhythmias ≥ grade 2 No prolonged QTc interval on baseline ECG No uncontrolled hypertension, defined as blood pressure &gt; 150/100 mm Hg despite optimal medical therapy No preexisting thyroid abnormality (i.e., thyroid function tests that cannot be maintained in the normal range with medication) No known HIV or AIDSrelated illness or other active infection PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: See Disease Characteristics At least 4 weeks since prior radiotherapy or chemotherapy At least 4 weeks since prior major surgery No other concurrent investigational drugs No concurrent participation in another clinical trial (supportive care trials or nontreatment trials [e.g., quality of life] allowed) No concurrent therapeutic doses of warfarin (lowdose warfarin ≤ 2 mg once daily for thromboembolic prophylaxis allowed)</criteria>
