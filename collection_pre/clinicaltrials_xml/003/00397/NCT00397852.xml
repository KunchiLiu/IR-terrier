	<brief_title>Dislocated Stable Distal Both-Bone Forearm Fractures in Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>children who arrive at the emergency unit with a dislocated both-bone distal forearm fracture will be asked to join the trial. After informed consent, a randomization between 2 kinds of treatment will be done: K-wire fixation or no K-wire fixation of the fracture after a stable reposition. Outpatient clinic visits till a follow-up of 6 months. During these visits we will investigate: the number of re-dislocations, re-operations, consolidation and dislocation on X-ray, function of both arms, complains in daily living and complications.</detailed_description>
