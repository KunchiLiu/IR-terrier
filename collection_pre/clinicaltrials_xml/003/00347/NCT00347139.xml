	<brief_summary>In order to obtain information on a wider range of doses of GW642444 (a possible new medication to treat asthma) than has been previously examined in asthmatic patients, this current study will be conducted at doses of 25 100 and 400 mcg of GW642444 and will be compared with salmeterol (50 mcg twice daily). This study will be conducted in a similar manner to a study that has already been completed (study number B2C101762) which examined repeat doses of 50, 100 and 200 mcg of GW642444. The data obtained will compliment the data from study B2C101762 and will provide confidence (or not) that the desired bronchodilation can be achieved and maintained without undesirable side effects.</brief_summary>
