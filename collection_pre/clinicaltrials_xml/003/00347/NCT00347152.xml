	<brief_title>Comparison of Immediate vs Gradual Switch to Divalproex in Adults With Intellectual Disability</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Considering that there are potential advantages to once-daily depakote extended release in terms of decreased side effects, decreased medication errors and patient compliance, there is a need to determine the best method of conversion from multiple-daily dose delayed release depakote to once-daily for subjects with epilepsy bipolar disorder or behavior disorders.</detailed_description>
