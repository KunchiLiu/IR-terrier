	<brief_summary>Forehead and eyebrow surgery is a frequently performed cosmetic surgical procedure in which the eyebrows are raised to a more aesthetically pleasing position. Typically, this position is judged by the surgeon pre-operatively based on traditional aesthetic concepts, some of which date to the Classical era. This study is designed to assess the variance of the eyebrow from the desired aesthetic position (as determined by the subject), as wel as to assess the distance of normal excursion of the brow from maximum voluntary depression to maximum voluntary elevation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Photographic Assessment of Eyebrow Position and Range of Motion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A set of 5 digital photographs will be taken of 100 (30 male, 70 female) adult study participants. Prior to photography, water soluble ink will be used to mark the inferior aspect of the superior orbital rim above the medial and lateral canthi and in the mid pupillary line. Photographs taken will image patients from crown to chin and will be taken with eyes open and closed, brows raised, maximally contracted and at rest. A final photograph will be taken with the subject manually holding both brows in the position he/she finds most aesthetically pleasing as seen in a mirror. During all photography, a ruler will be held against the face for later calibration, all photographs will be taken with a camera mounted flash and with the patient in a Frankfort horizontal plane. All photographs will be analyzed with proprietary computer software.</detailed_description>
