	<brief_title>A Randomized Trial of Base-in Prism Reading Glasses Convergence Insufficiency in Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Base-in for Convergence Insufficiency Treatment Trial (BI-CITT) is a multi-center, placebo-controlled, masked, clinical trial designed to compare the benefits of base-in prism for patients with convergence insufficiency (CI). The goals of this clinical trial are: - To compare the effectiveness of Base-in prism and Placebo eyeglasses for the treatment of CI in children - To study the long-term effect of these treatments for CI - To identify factors that may be associated with successful treatment of CI with base-in prism</detailed_description>
