	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to evaluate the change in glucose and insulin metabolism(early markers for development of diabetes) after 6 weeks of weekly Vitamin D supplementation. As vitamin D has been reported to be associated with lipid levels, CRP and blood pressure , we will also be measuring the changes in these variables.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Trial to Study the Effect of Vitamin D Supplementation on Glucose and Insulin Metabolism in Centrally Obese Men</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Accumulating evidence suggests that serum Vitamin D levels may be inversely related to the prevalence of diabetes, to the concentration of glucose , insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome.These results have been replicated in patients at risk for diabetes with documentation of impairment in insulin secretion in Vitamin D deficient subjects. Therefore, vitamin D could be implicated in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes, by affecting either insulin sensitivity or ß cell function, or both. However, there is paucity of literature on the effect of Vitamin D supplementation on insulin resistance or glucose metabolism. As vitamin D has been reported to be associated with lipid levels, CRP and blood pressure , we will also be measuring the changes in these variables.</detailed_description>
