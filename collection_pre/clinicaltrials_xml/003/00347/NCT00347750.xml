	<brief_summary>The objective of this proposal is based on the assumption that the HIV infected Ethiopian population responded in a different way in comparison to the Caucasian subjects to Lopinavir therapy. Our preliminary data demonstrated that Ethiopian's have different Lopinavir serum concentration in comparison to non-Ethiopian's. For these reasons the plan of this study is to investigate the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) profile in both populations. The results will allow to establish a better personalised medicine for HIV infected individuals.</brief_summary>
