	<brief_title>Effectiveness Study of Zymar Versus Vigamox for Preoperative Sterilization of the Ocular Surface After Loading Dose</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Topical antibiotics are frequently used before surgical procedures with the intent of targetting and reducing the number of bacteria on the surface of the eye. These bacteria serve as potential sources for post-operative infection. One commonly used method is the administration of antibiotic drops 3 times: 1 hour prior to surgery at intervals of 5 minutes. Studies in the lab have shown that the preservative benzalkonium chloride 0.005%, part of the Zymar antibiotic drop preparation, allows the antibiotic to act more effectively than the antibiotic Vigamox, which does not include this preservative. Comparison: The effect of Zymar antibiotic eye drops on conjunctival cultures compared to the effect of Vigamox on conjunctival cultures as measured by conjunctival cultures taken prior to treatment and then one hour after administration of eye drops 3 times, at 5 minute intervals.</detailed_description>
