	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>End stage renal failure requiring maintenance hemodialysis at least twice a week Has arteriovenous fistula or arteriovenous graft in upper extremities which can apply to blood flow &gt; or = 250ml/min as a vascular access for hemodialysis. Stable hemodialysis prescription at least 1 month before enrollment UFH (Unfractionated Heparin) was prescribed as an anticoagulant in the previous hemodialysis prescription No sign of active infection . Absence of recent cardiovascular complication such as myocardial infarction, DVT (Deep Venous Thrombosis), arterial occlusion, pulmonary embolism, cerebrovascular disease in previous 3 months. Women who are breastfeeding, pregnant or of childbearing age and not using medically acceptable effective contraception Patients with any evidence of an active bleeding disorder Contraindication to anticoagulation: Prior history of cerebral hemorrhage at any time Coagulopathy (acquired or inherited) Recent surgery Major surgery such as neurosurgery within the past 3 months Minor surgery such as intraocular surgery within 1 month. Uncontrolled predialytic arterial hypertension (systolic BP &gt; 200 mmHg or diastolic BP &gt; 110 mmHg) at 2 successive readings Impaired hemostasis i.e., known or suspected coagulopathy (acquired or inherited): baseline platelet count &lt;100,000/mm3 in patients without baseline diagnosis of active cancer and undergoing chemotherapy treatment (for patients with diagnosis of cancer and undergoing chemotherapy, baseline platelet count &gt;70,000/mm3); aPTT (activated Partial Thromboplastin Time) 1.5X the laboratory upper limit of normal; or international normalized ratio (INR) &gt;1.5 Indication for thrombolytic therapy such as ischemic heart disease, ischemic stroke. Need for a curative treatment of anticoagulant therapy(DVT ,pulmonary embolism, ischemic heart disease) Patients treated with oral anticoagulant therapy within 72 hours prior to inclusion Patients who have had spinal or epidural analgesia or lumbar puncture within the preceding 24 hours Abnormal liver enzyme and total bilirubin within 2 weeks (SGPT, SGOT, total bilirubin above 2 times of Upper normal limit) Known hypersensitivity to heparin or LMWH (Low Molecular Weight Heparin), or pork derived products History of documented episode of heparin or LMWH induced thrombocytopenia and/or thrombosis.
