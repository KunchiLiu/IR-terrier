	<brief_summary>This study is intended to evaluate the role of paclitaxel poliglumex and carboplatin in the treatment of unresectable Stage III non-small cell lung cancer along with radiation therapy in a multi-institutional trial. Consolidation chemotherapy with paclitaxel poliglumex and carboplatin will follow the completion of chemoradiation.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Histologically or cytologically documented NSCLC, including squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma (including bronchoalveolar cell), and large cell anaplastic carcinoma (including giant and clear cell carcinomas). Eligible Disease Stages: Inoperable IIIA and Selected IIIB Local radiation oncologist must approve patient eligibility prior to entry on study. Patients must have measurable disease. Prior Therapy: ≥ 2 weeks since formal exploratory thoracotomy. No prior chemotherapy or radiation therapy for NSCLC. ECOG performance status 01 Required Initial Laboratory Values (must be submitted within 16 days prior to registration): Granulocytes ≥ 1,500/µl Platelets ≥ 100,000/µl Calculated Creatinine Clearance ≥ 20 cc/min Bilirubin &lt; 1.5 mg/dl AST (SGOT) &lt; 2 x ULN INR &gt; 0.8 &lt; 1.2* *Values apply exclusively to patients not being treated with warfarin. Values for patients being treating with warfarin should fall within the following therapeutic range: &gt; 2.0 &lt; 3.0. Currently active second malignancy other than nonmelanoma skin cancers. Patients are not considered to have a "currently active" malignancy if they have completed therapy and are considered by their physician to be at less than 30% risk of relapse. Pregnant or nursing because of significant risk to the fetus/infant. Age &lt;18 years. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements. No HIVpositive patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy. Because patients with immune deficiency are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrowsuppressive therapy Onesecond forced expiratory volume (FEV1) &lt;50% or hemoglobincorrected carbon monoxide diffusion capacity (DLCO) &lt;50% of predicted, as measured within 21 days of study entry Symptoms of esophageal dysfunction (dysphagia, odynophagia, or inability to swallow solid food) within 4 weeks prior to study randomization. Patients must not require prophylactic placement of percutaneous enterogastrostomy (PEG) tube or other nonoral nutritional supplement methods Weight loss of &gt; 10% in the past 3 months.</criteria>
