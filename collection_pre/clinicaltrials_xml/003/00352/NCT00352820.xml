	<detailed_description>Caregiver Consent: If you agree to take part in this study, you will be asked to have 1 interview. This will be a face-to-face interview that will take place at M. D. Anderson while you are there for the patient's physician appointment. During this interview, you will be asked to describe what it has been like for you to help care for a person with a primary brain tumor in the past, what it is like to care for a person with a primary brain tumor now, and what you think it might be like in the future. You will be interviewed alone, and your interview will be tape recorded and then written on paper. The information that is gathered (the tape and the written information) will be kept strictly confidential. The tapes and any paperwork will be kept in a locked box during and after this study. The written information will be kept in password-protected computer files. The researcher is the only person who will have access to the tapes. You will also be asked to answer a questionnaire on paper. This questionnaire will ask specific personal information, such as your age, occupation, and relationship to the patient. This questionnaire will take about 5 minutes to complete. The entire interview will take about 30 minutes to complete. Your participation in this study will be over after you complete the interview and the questionnaire. This is an investigational study. Up to 20 caregivers will take part in this study.
