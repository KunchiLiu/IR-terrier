	<brief_summary>Investigation of the outcome of an adjuvant treatment with catumaxomab as compared to surgery alone in patients after curative resection of a gastric adenocarcinoma in order to gain more detailed information primary on safety, tolerability and feasibility and secondary on relevant efficacy parameters.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy Study With Catumaxomab in Patients After Curative Resection of a Gastric Adenocarcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A controlled, randomized, open-label, multi-center, parallel-group, Phase II study to generate valid hypotheses on safety and efficacy issues in patients with a primary confirmed diagnosis of gastric adenocarcinoma and a high risk of disseminated tumor cells due to serosal infiltration after curative gastrectomy. Eligible patients will be centrally randomized by IVRS during operation to one of the two study groups in an 1:1 ratio: surgery plus catumaxomab or surgery alone. Treatment with catumaxomab will consist of an initial dose of 10 µg given intraoperatively as an intraperitoneal bolus on day 0 and of four following ascending doses (10-20-50-150 µg) which will be administered as an i.p.-infusion via a provided indwelling catheter on the days 7, 10, 13 and 16, respectively.</detailed_description>
