	<brief_summary>The main purpose of the study is to compare the mean AERP between treatment groups based on the hypothesis that in subjects with paroxysmal AF, Irbesartan prevents electrophysiological remodeling resulting in a prolonged atrial effective refractory period relative (AERP) to placebo.</brief_summary>
