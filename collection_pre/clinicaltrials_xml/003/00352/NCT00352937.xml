	<brief_title>Comparison of Cardiac Computed Tomography for the Detection of Coronary Artery Disease With Nuclear Stress Test</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nuclear stress testing is currently the established non-invasive modality in detecting flow-obstructing coronary artery disease (CAD). Recently, multi-detector CT (MDCT) has emerged as a new modality that offers a non-invasive means to directly visualize coronary anatomy and any CAD. Studies have shown that MDCT has excellent sensitivity and a high negative predictive value in detecting significant CAD. The purpose of this study is to compare MDCT with nuclear stress testing for detecting CAD in previously undiagnosed patients.</detailed_description>
