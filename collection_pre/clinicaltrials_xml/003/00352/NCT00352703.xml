	<brief_summary>This is an open-label, single-arm, multicentre study conducted in Spain to estimate the effectiveness of palifermin administered at a dose of 60 mg/kg/day IV for 3 consecutive days before the start of the conditioning regimen and for 3 consecutive days after autologous PBSCT for treating oral mucositis in patients with NHL and MM who have received high-dose conditioning chemotherapy.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>NonHodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) subjects scheduled to receive BEAM conditioning chemotherapy followed by autologous PBSCT, or multiple myeloma (MM) subjects scheduled to receive highdose Melphalan (200 mg/m2) conditioning chemotherapy, in a one or twoday schedule, followed by autologous PBSCT ≥Age 18 years ECOG performance status &lt;= 2. In the MM group, ECOG status &gt;2 will be accepted provided that it is exclusively due to MM (e.g. pathological fracture) Adequate pulmonary function as measured by a corrected carbon monoxide (CO) diffusing capacity (DLCO) ≥ 60% of predicted Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥ 50% Minimum of 1.5 x 10^6 CD34+ cells/kg for autologous transplantation Adequate haematological function (ANC ≥ 1.5 x 10^9/L and platelet count ≥ 100 x 10^9/L) Serum creatinine &lt;= 2.0 mg/dL Total bilirubin &lt;= 2 mg/dL Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &lt;= 4.0 x IULN Negative serum or urine pregnancy test for women of child bearing potential within 14 days prior to enrolment Each subject must give informed consent directly or through a legally acceptable representative before participating in any study specific procedure, or receiving any study medication. History of or concurrent cancer other than NHL or MM Prior treatment with palifermin, or other keratinocyte growth factors (eg, KGF2) Prior autologous or allogeneic transplants Oral abnormalities defined as baseline oral assessment of WHO grade &gt;0 Other investigational procedures are excluded Subject currently is enrolled in or has not yet completed at least 30 days since ending other investigational device or drug study(s), or subject is receiving other investigational agent(s) Subject of childbearing potential is evidently pregnant (eg, positive HCG test) or is breast feeding Subject is not using adequate contraceptive precautions Known to be seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), or hepatitis C virus (HCV) Subject has known sensitivity to any of the products to be administered during dosing, including E coliderived products Subject has previously been treated on this study or with other keratinocyte growth factors Unwilling or unable to complete the patientreported outcome questionnaires Subject has any kind of disorder that compromises the ability of the subject to give written informed consent and/or to comply with study procedures.</criteria>
