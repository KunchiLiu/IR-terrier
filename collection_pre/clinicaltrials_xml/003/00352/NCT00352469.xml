	<brief_summary>Alcohol use disorders (AUDs) are a major problem facing our society. Their treatment is complex, and involves multiple behavioral and pharmacotherapy interventions. There are 3 approved medications for AUDs, but their efficacy for AUDs that co-exist with anxiety disorders is unknown. This study explores the effects of the medication, sustained-release quetiapine fumarate (Seroquel SR) for the treatment of alcohol dependence and co-morbid anxiety. Primary outcome measure is the amount of alcohol used. Secondary outcome measures include craving for alcohol, length of sobriety from drinking and level of anxiety with Seroquel SR.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial of Seroquel SR for Alcohol Dependence and Comorbid Anxiety</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>STUDY OBJECTIVES: The objective of this proposal is to study the efficacy of the medication Seroquel SR for the treatment of alcohol dependence and co-morbid anxiety in a prospective double blind placebo-controlled randomized clinical study. Patients, meeting the DSM-IV criteria for Alcohol Dependence and an Anxiety Disorder, will be enrolled and randomized to receive placebo or Seroquel SR. All subjects will be referred to usual treatment program, where they can receive group/self help group therapy. Method: This is a 12-week prospective, double blind placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial of Seroquel SR in patients who meet the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Psychiatric Disorders (DSM-IV) criteria for alcohol dependence and anxiety disorders. Potential candidates will be allowed sufficient time to review the consent document and ask questions about the trial prior to signing the consent document. Consenting adults will be randomized to receive active medication, Seroquel SR or placebo for 12-weeks. The study will enroll 20 patients, 10 will be randomized to receive Seroquel SR, and 10 will receive placebo. All participants will also be referred to usual alcohol treatment, including individual, group and/or self help group therapy (Alcoholics Anonymous). Subjects will be randomized to receive either Seroquel SR or placebo. Dosing of Seroquel SR will occur on the following schedule: At the baseline visit, Seroquel SR will be started at 50 mg QHS for Day 1 and 2, and dose increase to 150 mg QHS on day 3-4, and increased further to 300 mg QHS from day 5-day 42. After day 5, the Seroquel SR dosage can be increased by up to 100 mg per week to a maximal dose of 400 mg per day. During the treatment period, dose reductions (because of physical illness or adverse event) are allowed for patients taking at least 200 mg per day.</detailed_description>
