	<criteria>1. Have a confirmed diagnosis of Ph+ ALL or CML in chronic, accelerated, or blastic phases that are either resistant to or intolerant of imatinib therapy. 2. Be ≥18 years old. 3. Have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of ≤2. 4. Have an estimated life expectancy of ≥12 weeks. 5. Be male or nonpregnant, nonlactating female. Patients who are fertile must agree to use an effective barrier method of contraception while on therapy and for 90 days following discontinuation of study drug. 6. Have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 7 days prior to the first dose of study drug (if patient is a female of childbearing potential). 7. Have acceptable pretreatment clinical laboratory results. 1. Have received chemotherapy ≤1 week from the start of therapy, with the exception of hydroxyurea and corticosteroids. 2. Have received imatinib ≤3 days prior to enrollment or have not recovered from side effects of imatinib therapy. 3. Have impaired cardiac function. 4. Have an active, uncontrolled systemic infection considered opportunistic, lifethreatening, or clinically significant at the time of treatment. 5. Have clinically significant acute or chronic liver or renal disease considered unrelated to tumor. 6. Have impaired gastrointestinal function that may significantly alter drug absorption (e.g., uncontrolled vomiting, ulcerative colitis, malabsorption, or small bowel resection). 7. Are pregnant or lactating. 8. Have psychiatric disorder(s) that would interfere with consent, study participation, or followup. 9. Have not recovered from acute toxicity of all previous therapy prior to enrollment. 10. Have any other severe concurrent disease and/or uncontrolled medical conditions, which, in the judgment of the investigator, could predispose patients to unacceptable safety risks or compromise compliance with the protocol. 11. Have a history of another primary malignancy that is currently clinically significant or requires active intervention.</criteria>
