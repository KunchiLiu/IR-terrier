	<brief_summary>Physical activity as treatment for patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Treatment of T2D is often done by medication, changing the diet and increased physical activity. It is well established that physical training has a positive effect on the pathology of T2D such as increased insulin sensitivity and reduced fasting plasma glucose (7) and blood lipids (15). It is also well known that in healthy subjects endurance training increases mitochondrial density, lipid oxidation during submaximal exercise, and results in a number of qualitative changes in the control of OXPHOS (24). However, the effect of physical training on the mitochondrial function in skeletal muscle of patients with T2D has not been investigated. The purpose of this project is to investigate the effect of physical training on the mitochondrial respiratory function in muscles of patients with T2D. Skeletal muscle biopsies will be taken before and after 10 weeks of physical training in patients with T2D and matched control subjects. Mitochondria will be isolated from the muscle biopsies, and respiratory function, free radical production and UCP3 will be determined. Furthermore, measures of maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max), heart rate and capillary lactate concentrations and carbohydrate and lipid oxidation will be determined partly to verify an increased aerobic capacity and partly to investigate the changes in these factors in T2D patients.</brief_summary>
