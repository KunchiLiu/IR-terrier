	<criteria>HIV1 positive patients who have maintained an HIV1 viral load &lt;200 copies/mL, for at least 3 months. Patients must be on their first HAART or have documented viral suppression on a PIbased regimen at the time of any prior change in therapy. HAART must consist of either: 1. A PI (with or without ritonavir) + at least 2 NRTIs or 2. An NNRTI + at least 2 NRTIs. Negative serum pregnancy test. Patients who have taken any NNRTI prior to their current therapy. Patients who have taken a NRTIonly therapy for greater than 7 days prior to their current therapy. Patients who are currently taking EFV+FTC+TDF. Patients who have a creatinine clearance of &lt;60 mL/min by CockcroftGault estimation. Patients who have experienced virologic failure with any previous ARV therapy. Patients who have documented resistance to any of the study agents at any time in the past.</criteria>
