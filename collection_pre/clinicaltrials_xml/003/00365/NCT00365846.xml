	<brief_title>"A Pilot Study to Determine the Safety of Campath-1H (Anti-CD52) Therapy in Primary Renal Allograft Transplantation"</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Twenty nine primary recipients of either a live donor or deceased donor renal transplant were enrolled in this study. Subjects were administered two 20mg doses of Campath-1H antibody therapy (Day 0 and Day 1) in combination with a short course of corticosteroids, and maintenance sirolimus. Subjects were followed for 3 years to compare the incidence and severity of rejection episodes, complications related to the immunosuppression, including infections, malignancies and adverse events. All subjects underwent protocol renal transplant biopsies at 6 and 12 months (unless medically contraindicated).</detailed_description>
