	<brief_title>Ketoprofen Topical Patch, 20% in the Treatment of Pain Associated With Osteoarthritis Flare of the Knee</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled parallel group study will be conducted with patients who have experienced a flare of osteoarthritis of the knee. At screening, patients whose pain is currently controlled by an analgesic will agree, after giving Informed Consent, to discontinue that analgesic. Eligible patients will be randomized (1:1 ratio) to receive double-blind treatment with either the ketoprofen topical patch or a matching placebo patch to be applied once daily for 28 days. Patients will return to the clinic on Days 7, 14, 21 and 28. At Day 28, patients may choose to open a 2 month open-label period. Patients will rate their pain using the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) which contains the WOMAC pain subscale. Patients will also complete an electronic diary in which pain intensity, pain relief, and quality of sleep ratings will be captured. In addition, rescue medication consumption data will be collected. Ibuprofen will be provided as prn rescue medication.</detailed_description>
