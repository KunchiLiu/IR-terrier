Is only minor, i.e. oozing, or moderate haemorrhage persisting after primary surgical haemostatic procedures of the major vessels (no pulsating arterial haemorrhage and/or major venous bleeding)? All inclusion criteria must be answered "yes" for a child to participate in the study. Exclusion criteria: 1.

Has the child a history of allergic reactions after application of human fibrinogen, human thrombin and/or collagen of any origin? 4. Has the child fulminant hepatic failure, portal vein thrombosis or anamnestic or clinical evidence of cirrhotic condition of the liver, including cirrhosis due to genetic deficiency of a1 Antitrypsin? 5. Did the child undergo an emergency operation? 6. Does the child participate in another clinical trial during the intraoperative phase? 7. Has any serious surgical complication occurred? 8. Has any fibrin glue haemostatic (including TachoSil ® ) been used on the target wound before the planned application of TachoSil ® ?
