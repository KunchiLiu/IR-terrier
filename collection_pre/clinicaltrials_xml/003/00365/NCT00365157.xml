	<brief_summary>This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of eribulin mesylate and to see how well it works in treating patients with cancer of the urothelium that has spread to nearby tissue or to other places in the body and kidney dysfunction. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as eribulin mesylate, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Chemotherapy drugs may have different effects in patients who have changes in their kidney function.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Eribulin Mesylate in Treating Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Cancer of the Urothelium and Kidney Dysfunction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To establish whether E7389 (eribulin mesylate) can be given safely to patients with moderate and severe renal dysfunction at 1.4 mg/m^2/week (the maximum tolerated dose [MTD] previously defined for patients with normal renal function) on days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle. (Phase I) II. To characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of E7389 in patients with moderate and severe renal dysfunction. (Phase I) III. To determine the response rate of patients with advanced urothelial carcinomas to E7389 in the first-line setting. (Phase II) IV. To determine the 6-month, progression-free survival and overall survival of patients with advanced urothelial carcinomas treated with E7389. (Phase II) V. To document the toxicity associated with the administration of E7389 to patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma patients and varying degrees of renal dysfunction. (Phase II) VI. To determine the response rate of patients with advanced urothelial carcinomas to E7389 in the setting of progression after prior platinum-based chemotherapy for advanced or recurrent disease, in two cohorts: tubulin-inhibitor treated or tubulin-inhibitor na√Øve. (Tubulin inhibitors in common use for urothelial cancer include paclitaxel, docetaxel and vinblastine). (Phase II) VII. To determine the 6-month progression-free survival and overall survival of patients with advanced urothelial carcinomas treated with E7389 after platinum-based therapy for recurrent or advanced disease. (Phase II) VIII. To document the toxicity associated with the administration of E7389 to patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma patients in the second line and later setting. (Phase II) IX. To compare men and women with advanced bladder cancer treated with E7389 with respect to toxicity of E7389 as classified by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version (v)4 for (i) all hematologic toxicities, (ii) all non- hematologic toxicities, and (iii) the most frequently observed toxicities (neutropenia, anemia, leucopenia, infection). (Enrollment to additional females) X. To compare men and women with advanced bladder cancer treated with E7389 with respect to response to E7389 as evidenced by (i) disease control rate (DCR) defined as stable disease (SD)+partial response (PR)+complete response (CR) at 12 weeks, (ii) progression-free survival (PFS), and (iii) overall survival (OS). (Enrollment to additional females) XI. To compare men and women with advanced bladder cancer treated with E7389 with respect to pharmacokinetics of E7389. (Enrollment to additional females) XII. To compare men and women with advanced bladder cancer treated with E7389 with respect to tumoral expression of genes involved in the mechanism of action of E7389, including tubulin isotypes, microtubule-associated protein 4 (MAP4), and stathmin. (Enrollment to additional females) OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study followed by a phase II study. Patients receive eribulin mesylate intravenously (IV) over 1-2 minutes on days 1 and 8. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up monthly for 12 months and then every 3 months for up to 24 months.</detailed_description>
