	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as topotecan, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as Avastin (bevacizumab), can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Bevacizumab may also stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Giving topotecan together with bevacizumab may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving topotecan together with bevacizumab works in treating patients with stage IIIB or stage IV non-small cell lung cancer that did not respond to previous systemic chemotherapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Topotecan and Bevacizumab in Treating Patients With Stage IIIB or Stage IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer That Did Not Respond to Previous Systemic Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the progression-free survival of patients with stage IIIB or IV non-small cell lung cancer treated with topotecan hydrochloride and bevacizumab who have failed prior systemic chemotherapy. Secondary - Determine the objective response rates in patients treated with this regimen. - Measure time-to-event efficacy variables, including time to objective tumor response (for responding patients), duration of response (for responding patients), time to treatment failure, and overall survival. - Characterize the quantitative and qualitative toxicities of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients receive topotecan hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15 and Avastin (bevacizumab) IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1 and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 6 months from registration.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Patients with extrathoraciconly squamous cell NSCLC are eligible. Intrathoracic squamous cell carcinoma will not be eligible. Mixed tumors will be categorized by the predominant cell type unless small cell elements are present, in which case the patient is ineligible. Disease that has failed one or more prior standard therapy and is no longer likely to respond to such therapy. Prior systemic chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or biological therapy is allowed, except for prior use of Avastin and topotecan in combination. Patient must be at least 14 days from previous radiation or systemic therapy (at least 30 days for investigational agents) and have recovered from the acute toxic effects of the treatment prior to study enrollment. Disease status must be measurable or evaluable as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST criteria) Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance status of 0 or 1 Age 18 years or greater Adequate organ function within 14 days of study registration including the following: Adequate bone marrow reserve: absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt; or = to 1.5 x 10^9/L, platelets &gt;100 x 10^9/L, hemoglobin &gt; 9 g/dL Hepatic: bilirubin &lt;1.5 times the upper limit of normal (x ULN), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) &lt;3.0 x ULN (ALP, AST, and ALT &lt;5 x ULN is acceptable if liver has tumor involvement) Renal: serum creatinine &lt; 2.0 urine dipstick for proteinuria &lt; 2+ (patients discovered to have ≥2+ proteinuria on dipstick urinalysis at baseline should undergo a 24 hour urine collection and must demonstrate ≤ 1g of protein in 24 hours to be eligible) Coagulation: International Normalized Ratio (INR) &lt; 1.5 Partial thromboplastin time (PTT) &lt; the upper limits of normal (ULN) Women of childbearing potential and sexually active males are required to use an effective method of contraception (ie, a hormonal contraceptive, intrauterine device, diaphragm with spermicide, condom with spermicide, or abstinence) during the study and for 3 months after the last dose of study drug. Voluntary written informed consent before performance of any studyrelated procedure not part of normal medical care, with the understanding that consent may be withdrawn by the subject at any time without prejudice to future medical care. Pregnant (positive pregnancy test) or breastfeeding. Topotecan is pregnancy category D clear evidence of risk in pregnancy; Avastin is pregnancy category C risk in pregnancy cannot be ruled out. Pregnancy testing is not required for postmenopausal or surgically sterilized women Known hypersensitivity to any component of Avastin (bevacizumab) Inadequately controlled hypertension (defined as systolic blood pressure &gt; 150 and/or diastolic blood pressure &gt; 100 mmHg) Any prior history of hypertensive crisis or hypertensive encephalopathy New York Heart Association (NYHA) Grade II or greater congestive heart failure History of myocardial infarction or unstable angina within 6 months prior to Day 1 History of stroke or transient ischemic attack within 6 months prior to Day 1 Known central nervous system (CNS) disease, except for treated brain metastasis. Treated brain metastases are defined as having no evidence of progression or hemorrhage after treatment and no ongoing requirement for dexamethasone, as ascertained by clinical examination and brain imaging (MRI or CT) during the screening period. Anticonvulsants (stable dose) are allowed. Treatment for brain metastases may include whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT), radiosurgery (RS; Gamma Knife, LINAC, or equivalent) or a combination as deemed appropriate by the treating physician. Patients with CNS metastases treated by neurosurgical resection or brain biopsy performed within 3 months prior to Day 1 will be excluded Significant vascular disease (e.g., aortic aneurysm, requiring surgical repair or recent peripheral arterial thrombosis) within 6 months prior to Day 1 History of hemoptysis (≥ ½ teaspoon of bright red blood per episode) within 1 month prior to Day 1 Evidence of bleeding diathesis or significant coagulopathy (in the absence of therapeutic anticoagulation) Active malignancy other than nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC), treated superficial basal cell and superficial squamous (skin) cell, or carcinoma in situ of the cervix within last five years are allowed. Major surgical procedure, open biopsy, or significant traumatic injury within 28 days prior to Day 1 or anticipation of need for major surgical procedure during the course of the study Core biopsy or other minor surgical procedure, excluding placement of a vascular access device, within 7 days prior to Day 1 History of abdominal fistula, gastrointestinal perforation, or intraabdominal abscess within 6 months prior to Day 1 Serious, nonhealing wound, active ulcer, or untreated bone fracture Inability to comply with study and/or followup procedures</criteria>
