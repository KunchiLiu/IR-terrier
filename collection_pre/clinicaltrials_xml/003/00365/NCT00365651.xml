	<detailed_description>Female overweight and obese public school students will be recruited during the summer of 2006 based on FitnessGram testing done by graduate students at MSU during their prior (4th grade) school year. After receiving informed consent from parent/child, the subjects will be checked for height/weight and other screening criteria, then exposed to 2005 My Pyramid for Kids, "Tips for Families" information, and watch a short 8 minute DVD that discusses the importance of exercise and fitness by way of interviewing two club level female soccer players of equivalent age. Subjects will then be randomly assigned to fall youth soccer in Starkville, or spring youth soccer, after first phase data collection occurs in November, 2006.</detailed_description>
