	<brief_summary>IgA nephropathy (IgAN) is the most common type of glomerulonephritis worldwide. 15-40% of individuals diagnosed with IgAN, including children, will eventually progress to chronic renal insufficiency (CRI) and end stage renal disease (ESRD). The study is to evaluate the safety and benefits of MMF in patients with IgAN who have been pre-treated (and continue to be treated) with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and fish oil supplements (FOS).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mycophenolate Mofetil (MMF) in Patients With IgA Nephropathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A multi-center, randomized, controlled clinical trial to test the hypothesis that treatment with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) will lead to significant and sustained improvement in proteinuria in patients with IgA Nephropathy who have been pre-treated (and continue to be treated) with ACEi and FOS compared to a placebo control group of patients receiving comparable doses of ACEi and FOS without MMF. Data for this outcome will be examined every six months and at the end of 2 years of study. Comparisons will be made between the two treatment groups for change from entry level in urine protein to creatinine (UPr/Cr) ratio, 24-hour urine protein excretion rate and estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR).</detailed_description>
