	<brief_title>Prognosis Factors Associated With Convulsive Status Epilepticus in Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Status epilepticus is a neurologic and medical emergency associated with high mortality and morbidity rates. According to the operational definition Convulsive Status Epilepticus (CSE) is defined as a single clinical seizure lasting more than 10 min, or two or more repeated seizures over a period of more than 10 minutes without intervening recovery of consciousness. There are a few to date in literature reporting prognosis factors associated with this condition and, at this time, there are no published data considering an operational definition of CSE. In a retrospective study considering an operational definition we identified a seizure duration of 15 min associated with poor outcome (not yet published). The principal goal of this study is to evaluate factors associated with outcome in CSE, in particular seizure duration of more than 15 minutes. The secondary goals are to evaluate the epidemiology and management at every stage of CSE thus redefined.</detailed_description>
