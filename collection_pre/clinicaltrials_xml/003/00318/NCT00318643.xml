	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to explore other treatments for patients with superficial bladder cancer. The investigational medication to be studied is an enzyme called hyaluronidase, and it is a human recombinant form of the enzyme. An investigational medication is a medication or formulation of a medication that is not approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for use in this country but it may be used in studies such as this one. The drug company name for this medication is Chemophase. Chemophase will be given in combination with mitomycin C. Mitomycin C will be given alone one time and then both drugs will be given together weekly for 5 weeks. Mitomycin C is an anti-tumor drug that is commonly used to treat superficial bladder cancer. Treatments are administered directly into the bladder. It is envisioned that Chemophase with mitomycin C may potentially increase the local penetration of mitomycin C into remaining cancer cells following surgery to treat superficial bladder cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Safety Study of Recombinant Human Hyaluronidase (Chemophase) in Combination With Mitomycin in Patients With Superficial Bladder Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objectives of this study are to: 1. determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) of escalating doses of Chemophase in combination with mitomycin (mitomycin C, MMC) administered as weekly intravesical instillations for five weeks, and 2. establish the dose of Chemophase with MMC recommended for future studies. The secondary objectives of this study are to: 1. assess the pharmacokinetics of intravesical administration of MMC alone and in combination with intravesical administration of Chemophase, 2. for those patients treated at the MTD, assess the safety and tolerability of intravesical administration of MMC with Chemophase over up to 7 additional maintenance treatments every 3 months following the initial six weekly instillations, and 3. observe patients for any preliminary evidence of anti-tumor activity of MMC and Chemophase when combined. Study patients will receive six (6) weekly study treatments (at Weeks 1 through 6) followed by post-treatment evaluations, at Weeks 8 and 12. The 12 patients treated at MTD will continue to receive combination therapy every three months until the end of Year 2 or until the time of documented tumor recurrence, whichever occurs first. For other patients, long-term follow-up after Week 12 will consist of disease monitoring of patients by telephone and will be performed every three (3) months beginning three months after last study treatment for two years and then every six (6) months thereafter, until bladder tumor recurrence. The following therapies are prohibited from the time of enrollment through Week 12 of the study: - Treatment with heparin - Any intravesical therapy except for MMC and Chemophase - Any potentially myelosuppressive therapy For the MTD patients who are receiving continued study drug treatments after Week 12, the following therapies are prohibited for the duration of study drug treatment: - Any intravesical therapy except for MMC and Chemophase - Any potentially myelosuppressive therapy</detailed_description>
