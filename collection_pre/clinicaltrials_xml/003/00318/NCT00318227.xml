	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether a less restrictive strategy of red blood cell transfusion in elderly patients following coronary bypass surgery results in enhanced postoperative recovery as determined by quality of life assessment, exercise tolerance and clinical outcomes. Two postoperative transfusion strategies: 1. Liberal - transfused when Hgb is &lt;100g/L 2. Restrictive - transfused when Hgb is &lt;70g/L</brief_summary>
