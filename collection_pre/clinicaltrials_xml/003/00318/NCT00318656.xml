	<brief_summary>A better glycemic control is associated with less complications (cardiac diseases, blindness, etcetera) for type 2 diabetic patients. The objective is to study if rosiglitazone may lead to a more regular glycemic pattern with less hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia episodes than with a sulphonylurea (glimepiride).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Males and females aged 40 to 80 years Diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus for at least 6 months Body mass index (BMI) ≥25kg/m2 7%≥HbA1c ≤ 9% at visit 2 Treatment with metformin between 1.7g/day and 3g/day for at least 12 weeks prior to visit 1 Female subjects must be nonpregnant, postmenopausal, surgically sterile or using effective contraceptive measures Written informed consent Use of any oral antidiabetic drug other than metformin within 12 weeks prior to screening Significant hypersensitivity to thiazolidinediones and sulfonylureas or compounds with similar chemical structure Subjects who have required the use of insulin for glycaemic control at any time in the past or subject with a history of metabolic acidosis including diabetic ketoacidosis Subjects with clinically significant ongoing oedema or with a history of oedema in the 12 months prior to visit 1 Subjects with a history of severe hypoglycaemia Anemia defined by haemoglobin concentration &lt;11.0g/dL for males or &lt;10.0g/dL for females Renal disease or renal dysfunction, e.g. as suggested by serum creatinine levels ≥135µmol/L in males and ≥110µmol/L in females Presence of clinically significant hepatic disease (i.e. ALT, AST, total bilirubin or alkaline phosphatase &gt;2.5 times the upper limit of the normal reference range) Congestive heart failure (NYHA class I to IV), unstable or severe angina, recent myocardial infarction Subjects with chronic diseases requiring periodic or intermittent treatment with oral or intravenous corticosteroids Female who are lactating, pregnant, or planning to become pregnant Any clinically significant abnormality identified at screening which in the judgement of the investigator makes the subject unsuitable for inclusion in the study (e.g. physical examination, laboratory test, ECG, ...) Use of any investigational agent within 30 days or 5 halflives (whichever is longer) prior to enrolment in this study Active alcohol, drug or medication abuse within the last 6 months or any condition that would indicate the likelihood of poor subject compliance Subjects not willing to comply with the procedures described in this protocol.</criteria>
