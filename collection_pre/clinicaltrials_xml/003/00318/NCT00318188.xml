	<brief_summary>Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a connective-tissue disease characterized by excessive collagen deposition, vascular hyper-reactivity and obliterative microvascular phenomena leading to disability, handicap, and worsening of quality of life. Pharmacological treatments are mainly used for vascular involvement. To date, no pharmacological treatment have been shown to be effective for the fibrosis leading to skin, tendon, and joint disability. Our hypothesis is that rehabilitation could be an interesting non pharmacological treatment in order to decrease the handicap of SSc patients. Our objective is to evaluate the effect of a personalized standardized rehabilitation program on the quality of life of SSc patients in a multicentric randomized controlled trial. This trial will compare a personalized standardized rehabilitation program to the usual non pharmacological treatment. The primary outcome measure will be the HAQ DI (Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index). A Zelen design will be used for this study.</brief_summary>
