	<brief_title>NMP22 Provides Improved Sensitivity in Detecting Bladder Cancers.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients who have been previously treated for bladder cancer and are at a high risk for recurrence are being monitored for recurrence every 3 months with urine cytology and cystoscopy as part of standard care.The NMP22 Bladder Cancer ® Test Kit has been designed to provide an alternative to regular urine cytology. A urine sample will be provided and divided with a portion being used to assess the NMP22 test kit and the remaining sample to be sent to the lab for regular urine cytology. Patient charts will be reviewed by a medical student to record age, clinical stage, pathologic stage, time to disease progression/recurrence, site of recurrence and survival data.</detailed_description>
