	<brief_summary>This study will assess the effect of multiple dosing of 125 mg azimilide on glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and total creatinine clearance (GFR + active secretion) in healthy subjects. Also, it will assess the effect of multiple dosing of 125 mg azimilide on renal hemodynamics (RPF) in healthy subjects.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Azimilide Dihydrochloride on Renal Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, multiple-dose, single-site study in healthy male and female volunteers. Oral azimilide 125 mg or placebo will be administered every 12 hours for 3 days, followed by 125 mg every 24 hours for 3 days. The study will include a total of 21 healthy subjects (14 active and 7 placebo), all of whom will be confined at the study center for 9 nights.</detailed_description>
