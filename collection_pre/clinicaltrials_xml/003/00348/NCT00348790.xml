	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Vatalanib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking blood flow to the tumor and by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well vatalanib works in treating patients with recurrent or progressive meningioma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vatalanib in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Progressive Meningioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the efficacy of vatalanib, in terms of radiographic improvement and clinical improvement, in patients with recurrent or progressive meningioma. Secondary - Determine the 6-month progression-free survival of these patients. - Describe the response rate and overall survival of these patients. - Determine the safety of vatalanib in these patients. - Correlate the response rates with expression of vascular endothelial growth factor, epidermal growth factor receptor, platelet-derived growth factor, and HER2. - Develop exploratory data concerning surrogate markers of angiogenic activity in vivo using magnetic resonance perfusion. OUTLINE: Patients receive oral vatalanib twice daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days for 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 1 year. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 25 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
