	<brief_title>Group Intervention for Interpersonal Trauma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of this study is to assess the acceptability and effectiveness of a six-session, modular, repeating group for low-income women who have symptoms of depression and/or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) following interpersonal trauma exposure. Group participants will be recruited from public sector/safety net primary care clinics. Study participants will be randomized to immediate or delayed treatment. Participants in both conditions will receive information about PTSD and depression, in the form of a brochures and a DVD about trauma and its emotional consequences. Groups will be comprised of three components at each meeting: psycho-education, current relationship issues, and coping skills. Each group session will focus on a different aspect of education. Next, relationship difficulties typically associated with the symptoms discussed in that module will be addressed, and there will be group discussion about participants' relationship difficulties. Each group will end with the therapist teaching a coping skill that fits with the issues discussed earlier. Participants will be free to attend any of the sessions they missed during the first group when the group repeats. Participants in the delayed condition will be able to attend the groups after a 12-week waiting period. Assessments of PTSD, depression, functioning, and quality of life will be conducted at three time points: baseline (prior to the start of the group), 12 weeks after the start of the group, and 6 months from the start of the group. Gift cards will be sent to the women for completing each of the assessments.</detailed_description>
