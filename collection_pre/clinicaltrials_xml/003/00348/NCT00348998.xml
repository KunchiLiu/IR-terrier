	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Androgens can cause the growth of prostate cancer cells. Drugs, such as goserelin and bicalutamide, may stop the adrenal glands from making androgens. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Bevacizumab may also make tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy. Giving bevacizumab together with hormone therapy and radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving bevacizumab together with hormone therapy and radiation therapy works in treating patients with high-risk locally advanced prostate cancer.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the safety and efficacy of giving bevacizumab together with hormonal therapy and radiotherapy in patients with high-risk locally advanced prostate cancer. OUTLINE: This is an open-label, pilot study. Beginning in week 1, patients receive goserelin subcutaneously once every 3 months for 2 years. Patients also receive oral bicalutamide once daily and bevacizumab IV over 30- to 90-minutes once every 2 weeks in weeks 1-16 and undergo radiotherapy 5 days a week in weeks 9-16. After completion of radiotherapy, patients receive a higher dose of bevacizumab once every 3 weeks in weeks 17-28. After completion of study treatment, patients are evaluated at 30 days. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
