	<brief_title>ESGVS: Sclerotherapy With Lauromacrogol</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A multicenter randomized double blind study to evaluate the efficacy and the tolerance of echoguided sclerotherapy using 3% versus 1% Lauromacrogol 400 foam in the treatment of Great Saphenous Vein (GSV) insufficiency. One hundred fifty eligible patients will be recruited during 6 months from 9 study centers with a follow up period of 3 years and 7 visits at day 8, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 1,2 ,and 3 years. After randomization, the patients will be treated by echoguided sclerotherapy with 1% or 3% Lauromacrogol 400 foam (ratio 1:1). Monitoring is performed by doppler at 8 days, 6 weeks, 6 months , 1,2 ,and 3 years. Effectiveness of sclerotherapy is determined at 6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months. A additional injection of 4 ml of foam can be performed if needed. Severity clinical score and Quality-of-life questionnaire are performed at 6 months ,1 ,2, and 3 years. The absence of obliteration with a reflux of crural great saphenous vein at 6 months will be a criterion of therapeutic failure. The therapeutic success or failure criteria are evaluated by a non investigator angiologist for 5 patients randomized from each investigational site at 1, 2 and 3 years.</detailed_description>
