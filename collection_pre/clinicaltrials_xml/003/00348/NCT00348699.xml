	<brief_summary>This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of AFP464 in treating patients with metastatic or refractory solid tumors that cannot be removed by surgery. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as AFP464, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>AFP464 in Treating Patients With Metastatic or Refractory Solid Tumors That Cannot Be Removed By Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of AFP464 in patients with advanced solid tumors. II. Evaluate the toxicity profile of AFP464. III. Characterize the plasma pharmacokinetics and urinary excretion of AFP464 and aminoflavone in these patients. IV. Identify any activity of AFP464 in patients with metastatic cancer. V. Explore whether AFP464 induces cytochrome p450, family 1, member A1 (CYP1A1) expression in tumor (patients enrolled at the MTD) (patients enrolled at the MTD) and/or circulating tumor cells (CTCs) (dose-escalation phase and at the MTD). VI. To explore the relationship between the pharmacogenetic analysis and toxicity or response. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive AFP464 intravenously (IV) over 3 hours on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for up to 3 months.</detailed_description>
