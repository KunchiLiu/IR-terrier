	<brief_summary>NDV is a virus tht is harmful in chicken, but harmless in man. There are 2 major sub-strains of NDV, one oncolytic and one non-oncolytic. Oncolytic NDV (MTH-68H) preferentially homes and replicates in cancer cells and therefore, administration of NDV intravenously or preferentially intra-tumor, either by direct injection or by injection into an afferent artery results in direct lysis of tumor cells. NDV activates apoptotic mechanism in cancer cells and thus, results in natural cell death. Both oncolytic and non-oncolytic NDV were used clinically in hundreds of patients with different types of cancer worldwide. NDV were proved harmless in man. Clinical studies were done for more than a decade and the efficacy of NDV was documented on pre-clinical animals models as well as in man. For a large number of patients with metastatic cancer and chemotherapy resistant hematological malignances, no cure can be provided by conventional anti-cancer modalities, new treatment options are urgently indicated. The goal of the study is to use NDV, in order to provide such treatment for patients in need.</brief_summary>
