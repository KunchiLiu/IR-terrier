The primary objective of this Pase III trial is to compare IMOVAX Polio to the current Chinese standard of care (OPV) that is administered following a schedule of 2-3-4 months. The objective is to demonstrate that after the 3 doses primary series, in terms of seroprotection rates, IMOVAX Polio is not inferior to OPV.
