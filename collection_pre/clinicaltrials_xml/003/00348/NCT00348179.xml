	<brief_summary>The objectives of this investigator initiated study are to: 1. Determine if and when vascular abnormalities occur during early adolescence 2. Determine if poor diabetic control is related to vascular abnormalities. The development of vascular plaques and vascular contractility will be assessed through the use of the SyphmgnoCor equipment.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Up to 85 Type 1 diabetic and healthy controls, 12-14 years of age, will be recruited for the study. Once the Permission/Assent form has been completed, a cuff will be applied to the arm and the pressure tonometer will be used on various vessels. Cardiovascular data will be recorded. The procedure is non-invasive, will last approximately 10 minutes and will be performed during a routine clinic visit. Onset of diabetes and level of diabetic control as measured by the most recent Hbg A1c (relative to the study visit) will be obtained from the medical record. Microalbumin levels covering the prior 12 months will be collected from the medical record of diabetic subjects.</detailed_description>
