	<brief_title>THERMARTHROSE: Gonarthrosis and Water Cure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Gonarthrosis is a frequent pathology and the prevalence increase with age (prevalence: 6,1% in an adult population more than 30 years old and 40% after 75 years). It has a large impact on the quotidian life of the patients and it cause important costs for social protection. Relative to the treatment, numerous recommendations have been proposed (EULAR, ACR specifically). But no one of them recommends thermal treatment even if it is largely used in Europe and especially in France for the treatment of this pathology. Several prospective controlled randomized studies have evaluated the effect of the thermal treatments in rheumatology and some of them are relative, in part, to Gonarthrosis. So, we conduct a phase III randomized, controlled, single blind study evaluating the therapeutic effect at 6 month of a thermal cure on gonarthrosis. In a situation of physical treatment, it's impossible to use a placebo as control: blind can't be respected. Whatever the methodology employed, non blind of the patient create a bias. So, we hope that the Zelen method for randomization will reduce the bias due to the dissatisfaction of the patients in the control group.</detailed_description>
