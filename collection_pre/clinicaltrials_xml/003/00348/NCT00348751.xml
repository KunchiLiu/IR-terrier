	<brief_summary>Indirect evidence show alerting physicians with clinical decision support systems (CDSS) seem to change behaviour more than requiring users to actively initiate the system. However, randomized trials comparing these methods in a clinical setting are lacking. In this study we compare the effect of Alerting physicians with a CDSS or actively requiring initiation of CDSS on the adherence of Dutch general practitioners to the Cholesterol guideline of the Dutch college of General Practitioners.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Indirect evidence show alerting physicians with clinical decision support systems (CDSS) seem to change behaviour more than requiring users to actively initiate the system. However, randomized trials comparing these methods in a clinical setting are lacking. In this study we compare the effect of Alerting physicians with a CDSS or actively requiring initiation of CDSS on the adherence of Dutch general practitioners to the Cholesterol guideline of the Dutch college of General Practitioners, using a clinical decsion support system called CholGate. This system has the functionality to provide both Alerting and On-Demand decision support. Users are free to negate the advise provided by the decision support system. The trial will have a cluster randomized structure.</detailed_description>
