	<brief_summary>This trial is conducted in Europe. The aim of this research study is to compare the efficacy of adding inhaled preprandial insulin to metformin compared to adding rosiglitazone to metformin for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and to verify its safety (hypoglycaemia, pulmonary function, body weight, insulin antibodies and side effects).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of Inhaled Pre-prandial Human Insulin in Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The decision to discontinue the development of AERxÂ® is not due to any safety concerns. An analysis concluded that fast-acting inhaled insulin in the form it is known today, is unlikely to offer significant clinical or convenience benefits over injections of modern insulin with pen devices.</detailed_description>
