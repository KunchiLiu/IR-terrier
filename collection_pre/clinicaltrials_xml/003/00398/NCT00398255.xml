	<brief_summary>Individuals with with arthritic conditions (rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, or fibromyalgia) and internet and email access were randomized to receive an internet-based arthritis self-management program (treatment group) or to continue with usual care (control group). Questionnaires measuring health indicators, health behaviors, self efficacy and health care utilization were administered at baseline, six months and one year after the course. It was hypothesized that those participating in the course would have better outcomes than the control group at six months and one year.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>An internet-based arthritis self-management program was developed based on the widely used small-group arthritis self-management program. Individuals with arthritis were recruited via established websites, on-line newsletters, discussion groups, calendar announcements and articles in newspapers, and asked to go to the project website. Subjects who filled out an informed consent and met all of the following criteria were invited to enroll: 1. At least 18 years of age 2. A physician's diagnosis of osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis or fibromyalgia. 3. Not have been in active treatment for cancer for one year. 4. Not participated in the small group Arthritis Self-Management or Chronic Disease Self-Management Program Those eligible and wishing to continue were randomized to receive the internet-based arthritis self-management program (treatment group) or to continue with usual care (control group). On-line questionnaires were administered at baseline, six months and twelve months after the program. Measures included health indicators, health behaviors, self efficacy and health care utilization. It is hypothesized that course participants, compared to the usual-care control group, will show statistically significant improvements (using Analyses of Covariance and Logistic Regressions) in outcome variables and that the improvements will be associated with increased self-efficacy for management of arthritis.</detailed_description>
