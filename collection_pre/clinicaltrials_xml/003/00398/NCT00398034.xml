	<brief_title>Analgesic Efficacy of Testosterone Replacement in Hypogonadal Opioid-Treated Chronic Pain Patients: A Pilot Study.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Opioids are increasingly used for the treatment of non-malignant chronic pain with as many as five to ten million patients treated at the time of the most recent estimate in 2002. The side effects of opioids such as fatigue, loss of libido, Impaired cognition and sexual dysfunction have long been recognize and strikingly, resemble symptoms of hypogonadism in men. Many studies have demonstrated a high prevalence of hypogonadism in male subjects who are long-term users of opioids. The aims of this pilot study are, in hypogonadal men being treated with opioids for chronic pain, to: 1) determine the effect of TRT on pain; 2) determine effects of TRT on fatigue; 3) determine the effect of TRT on mood; 4) determine effects of TRT on cognition and 5) characterize the effects of TRT on sexual dysfunction. This study is a randomized, placebo-controlled, 6-week pilot study.</detailed_description>
