	<detailed_description>All patients will receive phototherapy, with narrowband UVB, three times a week for six months, or a total of 78 treatments. 6mm punch skin biopsies (2) will be done prior to starting therapy, once during treatment (2) and at the completion of the study (2). Clinical assessments and photography will be done parallel to the skin biopsies. Results (clinically and histologically) will be analyzed.</detailed_description>
