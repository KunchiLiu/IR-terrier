	<brief_title>Impact of a Computerized Guidelines on the Management of Hypertension and Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Existing computer-based ordering systems for physicians provide drug-centred checks but offer little assistance for optimizing the overall patient-centred treatment strategy. The ASTI project aims : 1. to design a guideline-based decision support system for diabetic and/or hypertensive patients, to help general practitioners : 1. to carry out procedures (clinical and biological tests) according to guidelines (the recommended procedure at the recommended moment), and to get a synthetic view of all the elements they need to follow-up the patient 2. to avoid prescription errors and to improve compliance with therapeutic guidelines. The " critic mode " operates as a background process and corrects the physician's prescription on the basis of automatically triggered elementary rules that account for isolated guideline recommendations. The " guided mode " directs the physician to the best treatment by browsing a comprehensive guideline knowledge base represented as a decision tree. 2. To measure the impact of ASTI when it is implemented with an electronic medical record system. We adopt a randomized design, with the practice as the unit of randomization.</detailed_description>
