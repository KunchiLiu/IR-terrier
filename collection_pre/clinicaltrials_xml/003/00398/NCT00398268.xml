	<brief_summary>We create a follow-up study of Kirschner wire fixation of a unstable dislocated distal both-bone forearm fracture.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dislocated Unstable Distal Both-Bone Forearm Fractures in Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>children who arrive at the emergency unit with a dislocated both-bone distal forearm fracture will be asked to join the trial. After an unstable reposition, the fracture will be fixated with 2 Kirschner-wires. The arm will be immobilised in above elbow cast during 4 weeks. Outpatient clinic visits till a follow-up of 6 months. During these visits we will investigate: consolidation and dislocation on X-ray, function of both arms, complains in daily living and complications.</detailed_description>
