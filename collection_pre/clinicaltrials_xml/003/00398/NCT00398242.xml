	<brief_title>Treatment of Stable Both-Bone Midshaft Forearm Fractures in Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>children who arrive at the emergency unit with a stable both-bone midshaft forearm fracture will be asked to join the trial. If the fracture will be stable during reposition in the operating room, a randomization between 2 kinds of plaster treatment will be done. Outpatient clinic visits till a follow-up of 6 months. During these visits we will investigate: consolidation and dislocation on X-ray, function of both arms, complains in daily living and complications.</detailed_description>
