	<brief_summary>The combination of capecitabine and oxaliplatin as 'backbone' regimen, adding a newer biologic agent, cetuximab, is a reasonable strategy of further chemotherapy development in advanced gastric cancer, which is the investigators study rationale.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of XELOX With Cetuximab in Advanced Gastric Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There is presently no chemotherapy regimen considered to be the global standard of care for patients with AGC, and there is still a need for new agents and/or regimens to improve the efficacy and safety of chemotherapy in advanced stomach cancers. The combination of 5-fluorouracil plus cisplatin (FP) has been widely used for the first-line treatment of advanced gastric cancer in many countries. Randomized phase III trial investigating capecitabine plus cisplatin(XP) versus FP showed XP is at least as good as FP with improved patients' preference. A Phase II study of capecitabine plus oxaliplatin (XELOX) was conducted in our study group.</detailed_description>
