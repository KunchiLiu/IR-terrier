	<brief_summary>The combination of testosterone and dutasteride is intended for use in hypogonadal men. This study will evaluate the effect of 28-day repeat dosing of this combination with varying BID doses of testosterone (T), in combination with a fixed BID dose of dutasteride (D), as well as a testosterone alone arm, on T and D levels in the blood. The rationale is to look for the effects of each compound on the other, and to look for any safety problems that may result when the 2 drugs are given together.</brief_summary>
