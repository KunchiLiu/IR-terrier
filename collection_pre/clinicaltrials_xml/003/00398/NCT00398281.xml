	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Diagnostic procedures, such as ultrasound-guided biopsy, may help find prostate cancer. Dutasteride may improve the ability of ultrasound-guided biopsy to find prostate cancer. It is not yet known whether dutasteride followed by ultrasound-guided biopsy is more effective than a placebo followed by ultrasound-guided biopsy in finding prostate cancer. PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying dutasteride and ultrasound-guided biopsy to see how well they find prostate cancer compared with a placebo and ultrasound-guided biopsy.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the efficacy of dutasteride followed by contrast-enhanced, ultrasound-guided targeted biopsy in detecting prostate cancer. - Determine the detection rate of prostate cancer with targeted biopsy using contrast-enhanced ultrasound combined with dutasteride. - Determine the efficacy of targeted biopsy using contrast-enhanced ultrasound vs systematic biopsy in diagnosing clinically significant prostate cancer. - Determine the reduction in post-biopsy bleeding after dutasteride in these patients. - Determine the cost effectiveness of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms. - Arm I: Patients receive oral dutasteride once daily on days 1-14. - Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo once daily on days 1-14. On day 14, patients in both arms undergo blood collection and contrast-enhanced (perflutren protein-type A microspheres) transrectal ultrasound. Conventional gray-scale imaging, color Doppler imaging, and power Doppler imaging are performed. Biopsies are then performed; first up to 6 targeted ultrasound-guided biopsies and then up to 12 systematic biopsies. After completion of study procedures, patients are followed at 1 day. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 450 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
