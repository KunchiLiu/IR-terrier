	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: Type of Subject: Outpatient Age: 12 years of age or older at Visit 1 (or ³18 years of age or older if local regulations or the regulatory status of study medication permit enrollment of adults only). Gender: Male or eligible female Females are eligible to participate only if they are currently nonpregnant and nonlactating. To be eligible for entry into the study, females of childbearing potential must commit to consistent and correct use of an acceptable method of birth control, as defined by the following: Male partner who is sterile prior to the female subject's entry into the study and is the sole sexual partner for that female subject, Implants of levonorgestrel, Injectable progestogen, Oral contraceptive (either combined estrogen/progestin or progestin only), Any intrauterine device (IUD) with a documented failure rate of less than 1% per year, Doublebarrier method spermicide plus a mechanical barrier (e.g., spermicide plus a male condom or a spermicide and female diaphragm), The contraceptive transdermal patch, Ortho Evra (if the subject is less than 198 pounds), Female subjects should not be enrolled if they plan to become pregnant during the time of study participation. A urine pregnancy test is required for all subjects at all visits, Female subjects should not be enrolled if they plan to become pregnant during the time of study participation. A urine pregnancy test is required for all subjects at all visits, Female subjects should not be enrolled if they plan to become pregnant during the time of study participation. A urine pregnancy test is required for all subjects at all visits, Females of childbearing potential who are not sexually active must commit to complete abstinence from intercourse throughout the clinical trial, and for a period after the trial to account for elimination of the drug (minimum of six days), Asthma Diagnosis: Asthma as defined by the National Institutes of Health [National Institutes of Health, 2002; GINA, 2005]. Severity of Disease: A best AM FEV1 of 50% to 80% of the predicted value during Visit 1 based on the "Standardization of Lung Function Tests" [European Respiratory Society, 1993] standards for 18 years and older or Polgar [Polgar, 1971] standards for 12 to 17 years and race adjusted for AfricanAmericans [American Thoracic Society, 1991]. Reversibility of Disease: Demonstrated ³12% and 200mL reversibility of FEV1 within 30 minutes following 200 to 400mcg of albuterol/salbutamol inhalation aerosol (or one nebulized albuterol/salbutamol treatment) at Visit 1. If a subject fails to demonstrate an increase in FEV1 of ³12% and 200mL, the subject is not eligible for the study and will not be allowed to rescreen. Concurrent AntiAsthma Therapy: Subjects must be using an inhaled corticosteroid for at least 3 months prior to Visit 1 and be maintained on a stable dose for four weeks prior to Visit 1 at one of the following doses: AntiAsthma Therapy Maximum Daily Dose (mcg/day) Fluticasone propionate MDI CFC/HFA ≤220mcg1/≥250mcg2 Fluticasone propionate DPI 200mcg Beclomethasone dipropionate 420mcg1/500mcg2 Beclomethasone dipropionate HFA 160mcg1/200mcg2 Budesonide DPI 400mcg Flunisolide 1000mcg Triamcinolone acetonide 1000mcg Mometasone furoate 200mcg Ciclesonide 160mcg1/200mcg2 1. Exactuator dose: dose delivered to the lungs 2. Exvalve dose: dose expressed from the valve ShortActing Beta2Agonist: All subjects must be able to replace shortacting beta2agonists with albuterol/salbutamol inhalation aerosol at Visit 1 for use asneeded for the duration of the study. Subjects must be able to withhold all inhaled shortacting betasympathomimetic bronchodilators for at least 6 hours prior to study visits.Note: Nebulized albuterol/salbutamol will not be allowed during the study with the exception of its use during reversibility testing at Visit 1. The use of albuterol/salbutamol through the DISKUS/ACCUHALER device will not be allowed during the study. Informed Consent: All subjects must be able and willing to give written informed consent to take part in the study. Compliance: Subjects must be able to comply with all the study requirements. Exclusion criteria: History of LifeThreatening Asthma: History of lifethreatening asthma, defined as an asthma episode that required intubation and/or was associated with hypercapnia, respiratory arrest or hypoxic seizures. AntiAsthma Medications: Asthma medications listed below must not have been used prior to Visit 1 for the required interval listed below, and not taken during the study: Within 24 hours of Visit 1: Oral shortacting beta2agonists: Within 2 weeks of Visit 1:Combination therapy containing inhaled beta2agonists and ICS for asthma (e.g., fluticasone propionate/salmeterol combination, budesonide/formoterol combination);Slowrelease bronchodilators (e.g., aminophylline, theophylline);Anticholinergics; Longacting beta2agonists (e.g., salmeterol); Ketotifen; Nedocromil sodium; Sodium cromoglycate; Oral longacting beta2agonists. Within 4 weeks of Visit 1: Antileukotrienes including suppressors of leukotriene production and antagonists. Within 12 weeks of Visit 1: Systemic, oral, parenteral, or depot corticosteroids; AntiIgE (e.g., omalizumab). Other Medications: The medications listed below must not have been used prior to Visit 1 for the required interval indicated below, and not taken during the study: Within 4 weeks of Visit 1: Known potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ritonavir, ketoconazole) Respiratory Infection: History of a respiratory tract infection within 4 weeks of Visit 1. In addition, the subject must be excluded, if such infection occurs between Visits 1 and 2. Asthma Exacerbation: History of a an asthma exacerbation within 4 weeks of Visit 1, any asthma exacerbation requiring oral corticosteroids within 3 months of Visit 1, or any hospitalization due to asthma exacerbation within 6 months of Visit 1. Investigational Medications: A subject must not have used any investigational drug within 30 days prior to Visit 1 or within ten halflives (t1/2) of the prior investigational study (which ever is longer of the two) or concurrently during the study. Concurrent Diseases/Abnormalities: Historical or current evidence of clinically significant uncontrolled disease including, but not limited to: cardiovascular disease, malignancy, hepatic disease, renal disease, hematological disease, neurological disease, or pulmonary disease (including, but not confined to chronic bronchitis, emphysema, bronchiectasis with the need of treatment, cystic fibrosis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). Significant is defined as any disease that, in the opinion of the investigator, would put the safety of the subject at risk through participation, or which would affect the efficacy or safety analysis if the disease/condition exacerbated during the study. Oropharyngeal Examination: A subject will not be eligible for the runin if he/she has evidence of oropharyngeal candidiasis at Visit 1. Drug Allergy: Any adverse reaction including immediate or delayed hypersensitivity to any beta2agonist, sympathomimetic drug, or any intranasal, inhaled, or systemic corticosteroid therapy. Milk Protein Allergy: History of severe milk protein allergy. Immunosuppressive Medications: A subject must not be using, or require use of, immunosuppressive medications during the study. Note: Immunotherapy for the treatment of allergies is allowed during the study provided that it was initiated prior to Visit 1 and the subject is maintained on a stable daily dose throughout the study period. Attendance: A subject will not be eligible if he/she or his/her parent or legal guardian has any infirmity, disability, or geographical location which seems likely (in the opinion of the Investigator) to impair compliance with any aspect of this study protocol or scheduled visits to the study center and compliance with study medication or procedures (e.g., completion of daily diary). Neurological or psychiatric disease or history of drug or alcohol abuse which would interfere with the subject's proper completion of the protocol requirements excludes study participation. Tobacco Use: A subject may not have used tobacco products within the past one year (i.e., cigarettes, cigars, or pipe tobacco) and must not have historical use of &gt;10 pack years (e.g., 20 cigarettes/day for 10 years).
