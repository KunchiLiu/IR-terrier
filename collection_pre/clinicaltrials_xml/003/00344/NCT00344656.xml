	<brief_title>Appetite-Related Brain Activity in Women With Anorexia Nervosa</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a serious eating disorder that is characterized by an extreme loss of appetite. People with AN view themselves as overweight and cannot bring themselves to eat, even though most are dangerously thin. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a technique that can be used to determine which parts of the brain are activated by physical stimuli. When a certain stimulus is introduced, blood flow to the corresponding area of the brain increases. This increase in blood flow is depicted on the fMRI scan. A person with AN may have different responses to food when evaluated prior to treatment versus after treatment. This study will use fMRI to compare appetite-related brain activity in women with AN before and after receiving treatment for the disorder. Participants in this study will undergo two fMRI scans. Participants with AN will have one scan before entering the "weight gain phase" of treatment for AN and another scan upon completion of treatment. Healthy volunteers will undergo scans during a similar time frame. Participants will not be allowed to eat from midnight on the night before the scan until after the fMRI procedure, but they may drink water. During the scan, participants will be shown various objects and real foods; they will also be asked to touch the objects and food with their eyes closed. Each visit will last approximately 45 minutes. Ear protectors will be provided to reduce scanner noise.</detailed_description>
