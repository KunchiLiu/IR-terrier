	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of GSK Biologicals' pneumococcal conjugate vaccine compared to Prevenar™ when co-administered with DTPw-HBV/Hib and OPV or IPV vaccines, according to 2 different schedules: 6-10-14 weeks or 2-4-6 months of age. The study has 2 groups. - One group of subjects will receive a 3-dose primary vaccination with the GSK Biologicals' pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (three different lots will be used and randomly allocated). - The 2nd group of subjects will receive a 3-dose primary vaccination with Prevenar™. All children will receive concomitantly DTPw-HBV/Hib and OPV or IPV vaccines. This protocol posting deals with objectives &amp; outcome measures of the primary study. The objectives &amp; outcome measures of the Booster study are presented in a separate protocol posting (NCT number =00547248).</brief_summary>
