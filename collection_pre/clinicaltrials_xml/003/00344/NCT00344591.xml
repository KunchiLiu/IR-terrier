	<brief_title>Effectiveness of Structured Ecosystems Therapy for Reducing HIV Risk Behaviors and Improving Treatment Adherence in HIV Infected Men Released From Prison</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Individuals in prison are four times more likely to have HIV or AIDS as compared to non-incarcerated people. Once HIV infected individuals are released from prison, they have a high risk of transmitting HIV to their sexual or needle-sharing partners. Therefore, it is important to encourage HIV risk reduction behavior among such inmates who are nearing release from prison. SET is a therapy program that mobilizes family and caregivers as a way to support and encourage behavior change within an individual. This study will use a tailored SET program to meet the specific needs of prisoners who are infected with HIV. The purpose of the study is to compare the effectiveness of the tailored SET program versus an individually focused therapy program at reducing sexual and drug-related HIV transmission risk factors and increasing HIV treatment adherence in HIV infected men who have recently been released from prison. This 12-month study will enroll HIV infected men who are being released from the California Medical Facility Prison in Vacaville, California or the San Quentin State Prison in Marin County, California. Participants will meet with study recruiters while in prison and complete questionnaires to assess sexual and drug-related HIV transmission risk behaviors and treatment adherence; they will also participate in a health education session. Participants will then be randomly assigned to either a 4-month tailored SET program or a 4-month individually focused therapy program. All participants will meet with study counselors twice while still in prison, and then weekly during the first 4 months following release from prison. Participants in the SET program will work with study counselors to tailor the program to meet their individual needs. Therapy sessions will be designed to restructure interactions and communication patterns between the participant and his support network; main goals will include reducing sexual and drug-related risk behaviors and improving HIV treatment adherence. Participants in the individually focused therapy program will focus on harm reduction, goal setting, and motivational enhancement. HIV transmission risk behaviors and treatment adherence will be assessed with surveys administered at Months 4, 8, and 12 for all participants.</detailed_description>
