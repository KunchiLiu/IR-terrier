	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate the Shedding and Safety of Trivalent Influenza Virus Vaccine Live, Intranasal in Infants and Young Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This was a Phase 2, open-label, single-arm, multicenter study designed to evaluate vaccine virus shedding and safety of trivalent influenza virus vaccine live, intranasal in children 6 to &lt; 60 months of age. Enrollment of approximately 200 subjects was stratified by age, with 100 subjects 6 to &lt; 24 months of age (who reached their sixth month but not their second year birthday) and 100 subjects 24 to &lt; 60 months of age (who reached their second year but not their fifth year birthday).
