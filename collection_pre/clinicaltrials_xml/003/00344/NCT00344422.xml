	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine how well newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients respond to an experimental regimen of Vincristine, DOXIL (doxorubicin HCl liposome injection) and Dexamethasone (VDD) versus the standard treatment of Vincristine, Doxorubicin and Dexamethasone (VAD).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vincristine, DOXIL (Doxorubicin HCl Liposome Injection) and Dexamethasone vs. Vincristine, Doxorubicin, and Dexamethasone in Patients With Newly Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized, open label study comparing the efficacy, clinical benefit, toxicity and safety of the combination of Vincristine, DOXIL® (doxorubicin HCl liposome injection), and Dexamethasone (VDD) to the standard regimen of Vincristine, Doxorubicin and Dexamethasone (VAD) in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. Approximately 200 patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma will be randomized to receive either VDD or VAD. This study will determine and compare the objective response rate (the percentage of patients who attain an Objective Status of Complete Remission, Remission or Partial Remission) for patients receiving VDD vs. VAD. This study will also evaluate and compare the clinical benefit of VDD vs. VAD for the following measures: Hospitalization; Documented sepsis; Antibiotic use; Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia or neutropenic fever. VDD: Vincristine 1.4 mg/m2 IV on Day 1; Doxil® 40 mg/m2 IV on Day 1; Dexamethasone 40 mg/day oral Days 1-4; VAD: Vincristine 0.4 mg/day continuous infusion Days 1-4; Doxorubicin 9.0 mg/m2/day continuous infusion Days 1-4; Dexamethasone 40 mg/day orally on Days 1-4; Every 28 days for 4 cycles</detailed_description>
