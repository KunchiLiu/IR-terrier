	<brief_summary>Patients who are diagnosed with choroidal melanoma and undergo I-125 plaque or enucleation surgery consent to participate in the study. A tumor sample taken during surgery is studied in the lab for genetic features. These features and features of subjects' clinical course are recorded. Analysis of the data may identify genetic features that are indicative of prognostic factors including risk of metastasis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cytogenetic Study of Ocular Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Jules Stein Eye Institute Ocular Melanoma Research Group is conducting cytogenetic studies of choroidal melanoma to improve the screening of biopsy samples of choroidal melanoma through cytogenetic analysis. Our goal is to identify molecular probes that specifically target regions of chromosomes that undergo changes characteristic of metastatic choroidal melanoma.</detailed_description>
