	<brief_title>Clinical Outcomes After AcrySof® ReStor IOL Surgery in Faculty Practice at UTSW Medical Center at Dallas: A Retrospective Review</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The AcrySof® ReSTOR® intraocular lens (IOL) is the latest advance in vision surgery. This IOL has been uniquely designed to improve vision throughout the entire visual spectrum, up close, far away and everything in-between. Thus, giving cataract patients their best chance ever to function free of glasses. The pre-operative and post-operative data from ReSTOR® IOL implant cataract surgeries will be analyzed to determine whether the desired outcome was achieved, i.e. excellent vision with no correction. Variables to be studied include patient age, gender, number of ReSTOR® IOL implants, ocular comorbidities, preoperative and postoperative corrected and uncorrected visual acuities, keratometry readings, and corneal topography readings. A patient survey will also be sent to patients having undergone the surgery to measure their level of satisfaction. Project Goals: The ultimate outcome of this project is to learn more insight on the following: 1. Visual acuity with and without correction of distance and near at 3-6 months 2. Percent of patients requiring keratorefractive surgery 3. Ocular comorbidity subgroup analysis 4. Monocular implantation subanalysis (prior to LASIK) 5. Comparison of post-op spherical equivalent to target refraction 6. Posterior capsule opacity that may be treated with laser procedure known as a YAG laser capsulotomy? 7. Subjective patient satisfaction 8. Validated questionnaire assessing visual function and quality of life</detailed_description>
