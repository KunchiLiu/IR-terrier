	<brief_title>Cognitive Behavioral Social Skills Training for Improving Social Functioning in People With Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Schizophrenia is a chronic, severe, and disabling brain disorder. People with schizophrenia sometimes hear voices others don't hear, believe that others are broadcasting their thoughts to the world, or become convinced that others are plotting to harm them. These symptoms make it difficult for people with schizophrenia to interact normally and establish healthy social relationships with others. Cognitive Behavioral Social Skills Training (CBSST) is a group behavioral therapy intervention that focuses on improving cognitive and metacognitive impairments and social skills deficits that interfere with normal functioning in people with schizophrenia. Goal-focused supportive contact (GFSC) is a group therapy intervention that focuses on helping people with schizophrenia to verbalize their problems or worries and to seek advice from fellow group members. This study evaluated the effectiveness of CBSST versus GFSC in improving social functioning in people with schizophrenia. The study will assessed changes in cognition, psychotic symptoms, and use of psychiatric healthcare services. Participants in this open label study were randomly assigned to one of the following treatment groups: treatment as usual (TAU) plus CBSST or TAU plus GFSC. Both interventions consist of 2-hour therapy sessions weekly for 36 weeks. Groups receiving each intervention do not exceed ten people. CBSST integrates cognitive therapy, social skills training, and neurocognitive compensatory aids. Cognitive therapy helps participants challenge unhelpful thoughts and build communication and problem-solving skills. Participants receive workbooks that describe the skills and contain homework assignments. GFSC focuses on empowering participants to share problems, worries, or concerns with others who face similar issues. Participants share advice with each other, but therapists do not teach skills. Outcomes were be assessed at Months 4.5, 9, 15, and 21 for all participants.</detailed_description>
