	<brief_summary>Tuberculous pleurisy is associated with inflammation and fibrosis. Adjunctive corticosteroids are used for tuberculous pleurisy because their anti-inflammatory effect is thought to minimise pleural reactivity and thereby reduce residual pleural thickening. The purpose is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral prednisolone for treatment of adult patients with tuberculous pleurisy.</brief_summary>
