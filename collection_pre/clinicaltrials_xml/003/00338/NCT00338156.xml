	<brief_title>Observational Study of the Remodelling Process Following Myocardial Infarct</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A multinational trial compared losartan vs. captopril in 5477 postinfarction patients with symptoms of heart failure and/or evidence of left ventricular dysfunction. The trial was terminated in 2002 and the results of the main trial have been published. In this trial, a collagen and neurohumoral substudy was performed to assess the importance of collagen turnover in this population. A total of 235 patients were included from 18 centres. Blood was taken at randomisation, 1 month, 1 year and 2 years. The present study will recruit surviving patients among the 119 individuals that were randomised to the neurohumoral substudy at the Stavanger University Hospital. The study will assess the relationship between collagen turnover, neurohormonal activation, scarring and left ventricle remodelling in these patients about 3 years following the index myocardial infarction. The data collected at the 3-year follow-up visit will be compared to data from the initial study.</detailed_description>
