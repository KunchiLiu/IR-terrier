	<brief_summary>The LIFE study was conducted from 1995-2001. This study was conducted in 9193 patients with high blood pressure and thickening of the main pumping chamber of the heart. The results showed that after an average treatment time of 4.8 years, treatment that was based on losartan was better than treatment based on atenolol for reducing the risk of having a stroke. The main study results were published in Dahlof et al. Lancet 2002;359:995-1003.</brief_summary>
