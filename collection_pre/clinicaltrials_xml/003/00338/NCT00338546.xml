	<brief_title>Study to Improve Scientific Understanding of the Cardiovascular Actions of Cocaine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cocaine abuse has emerged as a major cause of life-threatening cardiovascular emergencies but our understanding of the underlying mechanisms mediating the adverse effects of cocaine is far from complete. Our previous studies in cocaine-naive human subjects have demonstrated that intranasal cocaine acutely stimulates the human cardiovascular system by a novel central mechanism of action.We are currently investigating a central sympatholytic drug,dexmedetomidine, in reversing the sympathomimetic effects (increase in blood pressure, heart rate and coronary vasoconstriction) of intranasal cocaine.This drug may be a new pharmacologic agent in the treatment of acute cocaine intoxication in humans.</detailed_description>
