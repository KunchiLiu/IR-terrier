	<brief_title>EPO-BUL-01 - Study of the Optimization of Anemia Management of EPREX (Epoetin Alfa) in Predialysis Patients With Chronic Renal Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Open-label, non-randomized, multicenter study for anemic patients with hemoglobin &lt;or=11 g/dl. The dose of epoetin alfa is the routine dosage regimen and is in accordance of the approved SmPC. That's why the study had in general two phases - first period: subcutaneous administration and second period:intravenous administration. The evaluation is made in 4 visits:baseline, 2 month (Visit 1), 4 month (Visit 2), 6 month (Visit 3), 9 month (Visit 4). Echographic evaluation - on baseline visit, Visit 3 and Visit 4.Baseline visit - weight, arterial pressure, Hemoglobin, Hematocrit, Erythrocytes, Middle Cells Volume, Middle Cells Hemoglobin, Middle Cells Hemoglobin Concentration, Transferrin, Creatinine, Clerans, Visit1, Visit 2, Visit 3, Visit 4 - Hemoglobin, Hematocrit, Erythrocytes, Middle Cells Volume, Middle Cells Hemoglobin, Middle Cells Hemoglobin Concentration. The dosage is in routine dosing regimen, the starting dose of epoetin alfa is 50 Units/kg body weight. The maintaining dose depends on hematological results. Administration - subcutaneous (during the first period), intravenous (second period). Duration of the study - 9 months.</detailed_description>
