	<brief_summary>The study aims to ascertain whether the sole replacement of tenofovir with abacavir once a day improves the immunological response obtained with tenofovir + ddI or whether it is better to perform a double replacement of tenofovir and ddI with abacavir + lamivudine (joint formulation) in a single daily dose to achieve these objectives.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study to Evaluate Changes in CD4 on Replacing TDF With ABC or DDI+TDF With ABC+3TC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Different works have shown a high rate of virological failure among patients on abacavir + lamivudine + tenofovir or ddI + 3TC + tenofovir, thus rendering the use of these combinations actively unadvisable. Furthermore, recent studies have also shown that ABC+3TC are associated with a significantly higher increase in CD4 than the current treatment standard formed by AZT+3TC. This provides us with grounds to suppose that patients with TDF+ddI may recover their CD4 with ABC+3HT. Similarly, and recently, the existence of pharmacokinetic interactions between tenofovir + abacavir has begun to be questioned. Finally, the replacement of tenofovir with abacavir or tenofovir + ddI with abacavir + lamivudine does not detract from the potency of HAART, the toxicity profile is different and their behaviour at mitochondrial level is similar. This study aims to ascertain whether the sole replacement of tenofovir with abacavir once a day improves the immunological response obtained with tenofovir + ddI or whether it is better to perform a double replacement of tenofovir and ddI with abacavir + lamivudine (joint formulation) in a single daily dose to achieve these objectives.</detailed_description>
