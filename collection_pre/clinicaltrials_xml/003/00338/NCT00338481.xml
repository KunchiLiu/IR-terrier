	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to test whether "red morphine drops" applied in the mouth are superior to an equivalent amount of morphine applied as subcutaneous injection for the relief of breathlessness in terminal patients suffering from primary lung cancer or lung metastases.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>"Red Morphine Drops" for Symptomatic Treatment of Dyspnoea in Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Breathlessness or dyspnea in terminal cancer patients with lung cancer is common and opioids such as morphine is the mainstay of symptomatic treatment. Subcutaneous administration of morphine provides fast symptomatic relief, but it has been the impression in our institution that "red morphine drops" applied orally may have equal or better efficacy and faster onset time. Comparison: Patients with lung cancer or lung metastases with moderate to severe dyspnea at rest are treated with either orally applied "red morphine drops" or an equivalent amount of morphine applied subcutaneously.</detailed_description>
