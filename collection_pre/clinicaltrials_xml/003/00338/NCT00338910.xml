	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetic Interaction Study Between Budesonide and Metronidazole in Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective of this study is to describe a possible effect of metronidazole on PK of budesonide in healthy volunteers. Secondary objectives: 1. Effect of budesonide on metronidazole steady-state PK (primarily described as area under the concentration-time-curve). 2. Urinary 6β-hydroxycortisol (being a marker of CYP3A activity) and cortisol excretion before and during metronidazole multiple-dose co-administration. 3. Safety parameters.</detailed_description>
