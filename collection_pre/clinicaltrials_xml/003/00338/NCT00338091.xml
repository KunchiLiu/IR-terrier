	<brief_summary>The primary goal of the trial was to evaluate whether the optimal antiproteinuric doses of benazepril (an ACE inhibitor) or losartan (an ARB), as compared with their conventional doses, can safely improve the long-term renal outcome in nondiabetic patients with proteinuria and chronic renal insufficiency. The second aim was to compare the long-term renal protection between benazepril and losartan at similar clinical setting.</brief_summary>
