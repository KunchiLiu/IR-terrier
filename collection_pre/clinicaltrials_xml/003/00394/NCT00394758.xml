	<brief_title>A Randomized Trial of Surgical Treatments for Vulvar and Vaginal Dysplasia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>First line of treatment for vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN) and vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia (VAIN) is not well defined. Laser vaporization and ultrasonic surgical aspiration are both accepted surgical modalities used in the treatment of vulvar and vaginal dysplasias, however no prospective study has been done to compare the two procedures. The specific aims of this research study include: 1. To compare the recurrence rate between the use of laser vaporization and ultrasonic surgical aspiration in the treatment of vulvar and vaginal dysplasias in a prospective, multi-institutional, randomized clinical trial. 2. To compare healing related complications, post-operative pain, and scarring between the two procedures.</detailed_description>

Patients with dysplasias of grade 3 / CIS will be included at the discretion of the treating surgeon and will have had invasion confidently excluded by clinical exam and biopsy. Patients under the age of eighteen or who are pregnant will be excluded</criteria>
