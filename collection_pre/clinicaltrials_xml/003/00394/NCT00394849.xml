	<brief_title>Effect of Tonsillar Pillar Closure on Postoperative Pain and Bleeding Risk After Tonsillectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After induction of appropriate general anesthesia, a tonsillectomy was performed and control of bleeding was achieved as is routine for the individual Otolaryngologist performing the procedure. Next the surgeon used 3-0 chromic (absorbable) sutures on tapered needles to close one tonsillar fossa but leave the tonsillar fossa on the other side open. The side chosen was determined by a computer generated schedule. Routine postoperative care was given.</detailed_description>
