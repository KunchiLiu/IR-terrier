	<brief_title>Pemetrexed and Gemcitabine in Patients With Advanced Head and Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study is being done because we have not yet been able to find the best treatment for recurrent or advanced head and neck cancer (SCCHN). Pemetrexed and gemcitabine have helped fight against SCCHN when each was given by itself. This study is different from others because it tests these two drugs together, which has not been tried before in patients with SCCHN. We will see how well these drugs can work to help to control or shrink your cancer. We also want to find out what effects (good and bad) gemcitabine and pemetrexed have on you and your head and neck cancer. We do not know if these drugs will help you. Your cancer might get better or it might get worse. It might not have any effect on your condition. We can use what we learn from this research study to help other people with the same cancer.</detailed_description>
