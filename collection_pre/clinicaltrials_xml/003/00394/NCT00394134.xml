	<brief_summary>In this study, the researchers will conduct interviews with melanoma patients to describe the sun exposure and sun protection practices of patients and their children. The researchers will use the findings of this interview study to develop a salient intervention targeted to the needs of melanoma patients and their children. The researchers will evaluate the intervention in a randomized, controlled trial. The specific aims of this study are: - To interview 210 melanoma patients with children 12 years of age or younger to describe patients' socio-cognitive and psychological factors, describe patients' and children's sun exposure and sun protection practices, and identify determinants of patients' and children's sun exposure and protective practices. - To develop a targeted behavioral intervention that is designed to increase patients' protective practices to reduce their children's sun exposure, increase patients' self-protective practices, decrease the sun exposure levels of patients and their children, and positively influence socio-cognitive and psychological determinants of child-centered and self-protective practices. - To conduct a randomized, controlled trial in a sample of 360 melanoma patients with children 12 years of age or younger to evaluate the targeted behavioral intervention consisting of print and video materials. The intervention will be assessed for its effects on: 1) child sun exposure and sun protection; 2) patients' protective practices to reduce their children's sun exposure; 3) patients' sun exposure and self-protective practices; and 4) patients' socio-cognitive and psychological factors that facilitate behavior change.</brief_summary>
