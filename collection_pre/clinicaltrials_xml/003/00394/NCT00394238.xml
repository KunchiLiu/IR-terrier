	<brief_summary>Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic inflammatory systemic disease. It has a worldwide distribution and can affect all age group. The peak incidence is between fourth and sixth decade. It is more prevalent in women, and itâ€™s prevalence in the general population in North America is between 0.2-1.5%. The etiology of RA is unknown, although clusters of the disease in families and high concordance in mono-zydotic twins support genetic predisposition. The prevalence of fatty liver disease in patients with rheumatoid arthritis is currently unknown. We wish to study the link between the two conditions by performing a son graphic imaging of the liver in a cohort of RA patients. If indeed a high prevalence of NAFLD will be found in the RA patients, further support will be landed for the link between inflammation and fatty liver disease. These findings may also have implications regarding the management and follow up of RA patients. The validity of sonographic imaging for detection of fatty liver diseases is currently accepted: On ultrasonographic, fatty infiltration of the liver produces a diffuse increase in echogenicity as compared with that of the kidneys. Ultrasonography has a sensitivity of 89% and a specificity of 93% in detecting steatosis and sensitivity and specificity of 77% and 89% respectively in detecting increase fibrosis. In view of all the above data, we expected to find higher prevalence of fatty liver in the patients with higher inflammation markers compare with patients with lower markers.</brief_summary>
