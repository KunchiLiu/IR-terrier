	<brief_summary>Passing a bronchoscope through the airways frequently causes a stress response even though patients are sedated. This stress response is usually an increase in pulse and blood pressure, which may have undesirable effects on the heart and circulation. We plan to give patients labetalol (a beta blocker which reduces pulse and blood pressure) in addition to normal sedation, to patients undergoing bronchoscopy in our department.</brief_summary>
