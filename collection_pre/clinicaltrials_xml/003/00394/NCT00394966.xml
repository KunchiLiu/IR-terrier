	<brief_summary>This is a Phase 2, randomized, multicenter, parallel-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of various doses of SCH 619734 in subjects receiving cisplatin-based chemotherapy. Ondansetron and dexamethasone will be concurrently administered with SCH 619734 before initiation of chemotherapy on Day 1. Subjects will record nausea and vomiting in the SPNV Subject Diary through Day 6. The quality of life assessment as measured by the Functional Living Index-Emesis Questionnaire (FLIE) will be used to measure the effect of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) on daily life. Blood samples for SCH 619734 pharmacokinetic assessments will be collected. The study is to be conducted in conformance with Good Clinical Practice.</brief_summary>

Subject has a Karnofsky performance score of &gt;=60. Subject has a predicted life expectancy of &gt;=3 months. Subject has adequate bone marrow, kidney, and liver function as evidenced by: Absolute neutrophil count &gt;=1,500/mm3 and white blood cell count &gt;=3,000/mm3. Platelet count &gt;=100,000/mm3. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &lt;=2.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) range. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &lt;=2.5 x ULN. Bilirubin &lt;=1.5 x ULN, except for subjects with Gilbert's syndrome. Creatinine &lt;=1.5 x ULN. Subject is able to read, understand, and complete the questionnaires. Any current treatment or medical history (eg, subject is mentally incapacitated or has a psychiatric disorder) that, in the opinion of the investigator, would confound the results of the study or pose any unwarranted risk in administering study drug to the subject. Subject has contraindication to the administration of cisplatin, ondansetron, or dexamethasone including, but not limited to, a history of hypersensitivity to the drugs or their components, severe renal impairment, severe bone marrow suppression, hearing impairment, or systemic fungal infection. Subject is scheduled to receive any other chemotherapeutic agent with an emetogenicity level of 3 or above (Hesketh Scale) from Day 2 through Day 6. Subject is scheduled to receive any radiation therapy to the abdomen or pelvis within 5 days prior to and/or during Days 1 through 5 following cisplatin infusion. Subject has symptomatic primary or metastatic central nervous system (CNS) disease. Subject has ongoing vomiting caused by any etiology or has a history of anticipatory nausea and vomiting.</criteria>
