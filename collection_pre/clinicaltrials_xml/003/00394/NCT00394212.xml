	<brief_summary>It is estimated that up to 20% of patients who have Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB) surgery will not meet their weight loss goal, or may even regain some of the weight they initially lost. One possible explanation is that the opening between the stomach pouch and the intestine becomes stretched. If this opening becomes too wide, food may be able to pass from the stomach to the intestine too quickly - causing patients to feel less full after eating. For some patients, doctors may recommend additional invasive surgery to tighten the opening between the stomach pouch and the small intestine. Although this may help patients resume their weight loss, the risk of complications during a second surgical procedure is significantly higher than the risk during the original gastric bypass. The purpose of this study is to evaluate an incisionless procedure for patients who have either had inadequate weight loss or have regained weight following gastric bypass. The procedure is designed to tighten the opening between the stomach pouch and the small intestine, which may slow down the passage of food to help patients feel full longer after eating.</brief_summary>
