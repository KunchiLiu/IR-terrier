	<brief_summary>Itopride is a new compound that is already marketed in Japan and in some countries of Eastern Europe under the name of Ganaton. It is used to treat symptoms associated with gastroparesis. Due to inadequate gastric emptying, these patients often have symptoms of bloating, nausea and vomiting following ingestion of a meal. The goal of this study is to evaluate the effects of Itopride on gastric motor function and glycemia in patients with diabetes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Itopride Hydrochloride in Diabetes: Effects on Gastric Emptying and Glycemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a mechanistic study evaluating in a cross-over design the effects of Itopride hydrochloride. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the acute effects of itopride hydrochloride (200 mg three times daily) on gastric emptying of solid and liquid meal components in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Secondary objectives are to evaluate the effects of itopride hydrochloride on the glycaemic response to a meal, "meal-related" upper gastrointestinal symptoms and intragastric meal distribution.</detailed_description>
