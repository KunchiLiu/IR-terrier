	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of a booster dose of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, co-admin with a 1st dose or a 2nd dose of MMRV vaccine at 12-14 or respectively 14-16 months of age in children primed with the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in study 105553. Antibody persistence will be evaluated at 8-10 months after completion of the 3-dose immunization course in study 105553. The immunogenicity, safety and reactogenicity of the 1st and 2nd dose of MMRV vaccine will also be evaluated when co-admin with the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine between 12-16 months of age. The study has 3 groups. - The 1st group will receive the booster dose of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine + 1st dose of MMRV vaccine at 12-14 mo of age and the booster dose of Infanrix hexa™+ 2nd dose of MMRV vaccine at 14-16 mo of age. - The 2nd group will receive the booster dose of Infanrix hexa™ + 1st dose of MMRV vaccine at 12-14 mo of age and the booster dose of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine + 2nd dose of MMRV vaccine at 14-16 mo of age. - The 3rd group will receive the booster dose of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine + the booster dose of Infanrix hexa™ at 12-14 mo. Subjects will be offered one dose of Priorix™ and Varilrix™ at 14-16 mo of age, outside the study.</brief_summary>
