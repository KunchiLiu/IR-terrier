	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether intraocular injection of triamcinolone is effective in the treatment of macular edema in acute branch retinal vein occlusion.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intravitreal Triamcinolone for Acute Branch Retinal Vein Occlusion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Intravitreal triamcinolone has recently been shown to have beneficial effect on chronic macular edema due to vein occlusion and preventive effect on neovascularization. Hypothetically, prevention of macular derangement by reducing the amount of edema from early phase after occlusion until restoration of collaterals seems to be helpful in these eyes. To our knowledge, no prospective randomized clinical trial, considering both macular changes and preventive effect on neovascularization has been published for intravitreal triamcinolone in acute branch retinal vein occlusion.</detailed_description>
