	<brief_summary>Patients affected by non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) will be treated in pemetrexed monochemotherapy regimen for a maximum of 8 cycles. Pemetrexed is an enhancer of some biomolecules involved in the gemcitabine mechanism of action. Purpose of the trial is to monitor the blood values of these biomolecules at different time intervals, to optimize the synergism between pemetrexed and gemcitabine.</brief_summary>
