	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether the insulin sensitizing effects of rosiglitazone were accompanied by changes in 11ß-HSD1 expression and activity in different tissues.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>11ß-HSD1 and Metabolic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The PPARgamma agonist rosiglitazone (R) increases insulin sensitivity, which is comparable to the effects of a reduction in 11ß-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11β-HSD1) activity in animal models. We therefore aimed to investigate whether rosiglitazone-induced insulin sensitivity is associated with changes in 11β-HSD1 activity in different tissues in subjects suffering from impaired glucose tolerance.</detailed_description>
