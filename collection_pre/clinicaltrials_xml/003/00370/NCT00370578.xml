	<brief_summary>Early promising data are published focusing on the role of manual thrombus aspiration devices in patients with ST segment elevation (STEMI). The aim of our single center randomized study is to evaluate the early and late effect of thrombus aspiration device (AD) after every stage during Primary PCI in the set-up of STEMI population. Our hypothysis is that preforming thrombus aspiration after every stage of primary PCI may give early and late advantages compared to the standard primary PCI technique.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Aspiration Device in Myocardial Infarction Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ADMIT-Randomized Single Center Study with two arms: Standard PCI versus Primary PCI, using thrombus aspiration device after ever step of the procedure. Issues to be examined are: 1. Immediate angiographic differences between the study arms. By evaluation of: TIMI FLOW GRADE,TIMI FRAME COUNT,MYOCARDIAL BLUSH GRADE. No reflow phenomenae, 2. Infarc size evaluated by serum markers and non invasive parameters 3. In hospital major adverse cardiac events 4. Major adverse cardiac events during 30&amp; 180 days of follow up</detailed_description>
