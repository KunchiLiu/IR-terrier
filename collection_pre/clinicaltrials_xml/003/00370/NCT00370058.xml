	<brief_summary>Elevated homocysteine levels are associated with depression and cognitive impairment. When depression ameliorates due to treatment, homocysteine serum levels often normalize. Aim of the present study is to investigate, whether repeated ECT treatment leads to changes in homocysteine levels and if these changes are associated with the occurrence of cognitive impairment after ECS. 10 patients suffering from therapy-resistant depression shall be enrolled. Patients are treated with repeated ECT (three times the week). Before, directly after and one day after ECT treatment, blood samples are drawn and patients receive cognitive testing. Depressive symptomatology is checked with different rating scales.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study on the Influence of Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT) on Homocysteine Levels</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND: Elevated homocysteine levels have been found in depressive disorders. The modulating effects of homocysteine on glutamatergic neurotransmission have been discussed to be an underlying cause of depression and can also lead to cognitive impairment and may facilitate seizures. Electroconvulsive therapy is the most effective treatment for depression, but often leads to cognitive impairments. HYPOTHESIS: Homocysteine levels normalize during rECT. This normalization is associated with the clinical improvement of depression. Short term changes in homocysteine levels (i.e. increase directly after ECT) may explain the cognitive impairments of the patients. METHOD: 10 patients with therapy-resistant depressive disorder are to be enrolled into the trial. Patients are treated with rECT, two to three times a week. Blood withdrawal and psychometric analysis will be performed before, directly after and one day after ECT treatment 1,4,7,10,(13). Necessity of further treatment will be checked after the first 6 ECTs.</detailed_description>
