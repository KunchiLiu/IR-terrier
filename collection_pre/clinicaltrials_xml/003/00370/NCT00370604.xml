	<brief_title>Effect of Small Versus Large Epidural Needles on Postdural Puncture Headache Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A headache is the most significant complication of dural puncture during epidural placement. This complication leads to longer hospital stays and many repeated visits to hospital for management. Women suffering from severe postdural puncture headache (PDPH) are often bedridden and unable to care for themselves or their babies.The efficacy of epidural blood patch as a "gold standard" therapy is over-estimated by the earlier, poor quality studies. The prevalence of dural puncture during epidural anesthesia using current techniques ranges from 0.03 to 6% in the literature. Of these patients, 70 to 80% will suffer from moderate to severe PDPH. Avoidance of dural puncture is always the goal. However, complete avoidance is unlikely using current techniques of needle placement. This study proposes another method of prevention (i.e., reducing the gauge of the epidural needles if it is shown to be suitable for continuous infusion in adults). Most of the risk factors for developing PDPH cannot be changed (e.g., younger age, female sex, low body mass index, history of migraines). However, epidural needle gauge is a modifiable risk factor. Evidence suggests that the use of smaller gauge epidural needles, like spinal needles, have the potential to reduce the incidence and severity of PDPH.</detailed_description>
