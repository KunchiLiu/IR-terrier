	<brief_summary>Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is associated with an increased risk for the development of type 2 diabetes and HCV infection itself may promote insulin resistance, irrespective of the severity of liver disease. Insulin resistance seems to be genotype specific and may play a role in fibrogenesis in chronic hepatitis C. In an “in vitro” model, increased levels of insulin may promote increased HCV replication. RATIONALE Decreased insulin resistance and reduced hyperinsulinemia may facilitate the efficacy of anti-viral drugs on HCV replication.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is associated with an increased risk for the development of type 2 diabetes and HCV infection itself may promote insulin resistance, irrespective of the severity of liver disease. - In patients with HCV infection, an increase in fasting insulin levels is associated with the presence of serum HCV core, the severity of hepatic fibrosis and a decrease in expression of insulin receptor substrate (IRS) 1 and IRS2, central molecules of the insulin-signaling cascade. Down-regulation of IRS1 and IRS2 has also been observed in HCV core-transgenic mice livers and HCV core-transfected human hepatoma cells. - High levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, which acts by disturbing tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1, may be associated with insulin resistance both in animal models and in HCV patients. Insulin resistance seems to be genotype specific and may play a role in fibrogenesis in chronic hepatitis C. - In patients infected with genotype non-3, insulin resistance is associated with the degree of fibrosis, the rate of fibrosis progression and previous failed antiviral treatment. - Insulin resistance, fibrosis, and genotype are independent predictors of the response to antiviral therapy in chronic hepatitis C patients treated with peginterferon plus ribavirin. A sustained virological response is achieved in 33% of patients with genotype 1 and insulin resistance compared with 60% of genotype 1 patients without insulin resistance. - Insulin resistance is associated with a 3-fold risk of failure to antiviral treatment in patients with genotype 1 In an “in vitro” model, increased levels of insulin may promote increased HCV replication. RATIONALE Decreased insulin resistance and reduced hyperinsulinemia may facilitate the efficacy of anti-viral drugs on HCV replication. INDICATION Genotype 1 Chronic HCV hepatitis (CHC) associated with insulin resistance (IR). OBJECTIVES To compare the efficacy and safety of Pegylated-Interferon and Ribavirin plus metformin to Pegylated-Interferon and Ribavirin for treatment of naïve patients with Genotype 1 Chronic HCV infection and insulin resistance.</detailed_description>
