	<brief_title>A Trial of Adjuvant Chemotherapy in Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Patients With Residual Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) DNA Following Radiotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- The standard treatment for nasopharynx cancer is a course of radiotherapy with or without concurrent chemotherapy. This will cure about 80% of patients. For the 20% who developed recurrence or metastases, the prognosis is poor. - Elevated EBV-DNA in plasma at end of radiotherapy has been shown to predict disease recurrence and may be a marker of subclinical residual disease. - This study aims to test whether adjuvant treatment with 6 cycles of a modern chemotherapy regimen (gemcitabine and cisplatin combination) can improve the survival of these high risk patients of nasopharynx cancer who have elevated EBV-DNA after completion of their radiotherapy.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Have given written informed consent, prior to prestudy screening, with the understanding that consent may be withdrawn at any time without prejudice. 2. A histological diagnosis of nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC) must have been established at some time and the investigator must review and confirm the diagnosis prior to randomization. 3. Locoregional advanced NPC UICC/AJCC Stages IIB, III, IVA or IVB. 4. No evidence of distant metastases in the staging work up at diagnosis. 5. Must have detectable plasma EBVDNA (&gt; 0 copies/ml) at 68 weeks after completion of primary RT or chemoRT 6. No clinical evidence of persistent locoregional disease after primary treatment 7. Performance status of ECOG grade 0 or 1. 8. Patients must have adequate organ and marrow function as defined below: leukocytes &gt;3,000/L; absolute neutrophil count &gt;1,500/L; platelets &gt;100,000/L; total bilirubin &lt;1.5 X institutional upper limit of normal; AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) &lt;2.5 X institutional upper limit of normal; Creatinine clearance &gt; 50 ml/min 9. At least 18 years of age, of either sex. 10. If female, must be either (i) postmenopausal or surgically sterilized, or (ii) use a hormonal contraceptive, intrauterine device, diaphragm with spermicide for the duration of the study and must be neither pregnant nor breastfeeding. 1. Hypercalcaemia: calcium &gt;= 2.7 mmol/L (10.8 mg/dL). 2. Second primary malignancy (except in situ carcinoma of the cervix or adequately treated basal cell carcinoma of the skin). 3. More that 12 weeks after completion of primary radiotherapy. 4. Had received prior adjuvant chemotherapy. 5. Other serious concomitant systemic disorders incompatible with the study (at the discretion of the investigator). 6. Have serious active infection. 7. Patients with peripheral or ototoxicity with a grade of greater than 2. 8. Pregnant or lactating female subjects and subjects with reproductive potential not implementing adequate contraceptive measures.</criteria>
