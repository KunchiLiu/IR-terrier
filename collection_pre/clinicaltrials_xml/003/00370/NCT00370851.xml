	<brief_title>Intravitreal Bevasizumab VS Sham Treatment in Acute BRVO: A Randomized Clinical Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After diabetic retinopathy, vein occlusion is the second most common retinovascular disease. According to BVO study the only effective management of it is macular photocoagulation for macular thickening that persist after 3 months.But we may miss a golden time which resulted to photoreceptor degeneration due to macular edema during this period. VEGF inhibitors newly have been shown that may be effective on a wide range of retinovascular diseases that resulted to macular edema or new vessels formation. In this study we aim to show the outcomes of one of this VEGF inhibitors (bevacizumab) on complications of BRVO in a sham controlled clinical trial.</detailed_description>
