	<brief_summary>The primary purpose of the study is to determine if a therapeutic difference exists between central venous catheters impregnated with minocycline and rifampin and conventional catheters not impregnated with antibiotics when used in children at high risk for bloodstream infections (CABSI) after cardiac surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Catheter-related Infections Using Antibiotic-coated Versus Conventional Catheters in Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The standard central venous catheter (CVC) is now commonly used for infants, children, and adults. The antibiotic-coated CVC is a newer CVC gaining popularity for use in adults. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Center for Disease Control (CDC) support use of the antibiotic-coated CVC for adult patients. But the FDA and CDC have not yet endorsed use of the antibiotic-coated CVC for infants and children due to lack of research on this CVC in infants and children.</detailed_description>
