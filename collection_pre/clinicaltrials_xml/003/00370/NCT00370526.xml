	<brief_summary>The literature shows that approximately 40% of individuals who receive a cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) device for symptomatic congestive heart failure (CHF) do not have a clinical benefit from the device. The HEAL-HF protocol will compare the outcomes of conventionally placed CRT devices with magnetically placed CRT devices by assessing hemodynamic parameters during the magnetic placement of the left ventricular (LV) lead.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>HEAL-HF: A Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT) Outcomes Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Baseline information will be obtained including QoL, 6-minute walk, and echo measurements. The patient will be randomized to receive a conventionally-placed LV lead or randomized to receive a magnetically-placed LV lead. The magnetic group will have acute hemodynamics assessed during the procedure to evaluate the best response of the left ventricle during pacing. Patients will be followed for 6 months with a re-evaluation of the baseline tests to assess the change in HF symptoms. Adverse events will also be recorded during the follow-up period.</detailed_description>
