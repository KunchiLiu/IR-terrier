	<brief_summary>Clinically significant improvements in the percutaneous adhesiolysis patients with hypertonic neurolysis compared to those patients randomized to the control group who did not receive adhesiolysis and hypertonic saline neurolysis. Improvement will be assessed in relation to the clinical outcome measures of pain and function. Improvements among patients with adhesiolysis and hypertonic saline neurolysis and compare to control group. Compare adverse event profile in both groups</brief_summary>
