	<brief_title>Safety Study of Conventional Versus Micropulse Transscleral Cyclophotocoagulation in Treating End-Stage Glaucoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>End-stage glaucoma is difficult to treat, and it may sometimes be unresponsive to surgery or medications. A common treatment is the conventional transscleral cyclophotocoagulaion, but it has various side effects. This study specifically aims to compare the intraocular pressure (IOP) lowering effects and the incidence of complications such as hypotony, phthisis, sympathetic ophthalmia, surface conjunctival burns, bulbar conjunctival swelling, decompensation of corneal grafts, hyphema and vitreous hemorrhage, in conventional and the newer micropulse transscleral cyclophotocoagulation.The hypothesis is that the micropulse transscleral cyclophotocoagulation will be as good or better than the conventional transscleral cyclophotocoagulation, with less complications.</detailed_description>
