	<brief_summary>Acute dacryocystitis in adults can be a very painful disease and may not respond well to medical therapy. The purpose of this prospective non-randomised study is to determine the microorganisms causing acute dacryocystitis and the antibiotic sensitivities of these organisms. The study also aims to correlate the microbiological findings to the severity of clinical manifestations and evaluate the effectiveness of our current practice of aspiration and empiric systemic antibiotic therapy in treating patients with acute dacryocystitis and hence review whether there is a need to alter current management strategy.</brief_summary>
