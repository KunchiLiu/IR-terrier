	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare first-line erlotinib followed at progression by second-line chemotherapy vs. first-line chemotherapy followed at progression by second-line erlotinib in the treatment of Advanced Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>TORCH: A Study of Tarceva or Chemotherapy for the Treatment of Advanced Non Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chemotherapy for patients affected by advanced NSCLC has demonstrated only modest improvement in survival rates over best supportive care: the prognosis of patients remains poor and the side effects are considerable. Therefore, novel agents are urgently needed for this disease. One way to improve effectiveness of therapies is to use non-chemotherapeutic agents that act on biological targets and cause fewer systemic side effects. Erlotinib(Tarceva)is a biological therapy that in recent clinical trials has shown promise in first- and second-line treatment of advanced NSCLC. In this trial, patients will be randomized to one of two treatment strategies: - erlotinib taken by mouth daily; and, if disease progression occurs, to be followed by chemotherapy with cisplatin and gemcitabine at standard doses for 6 cycles OR - chemotherapy with cisplatin and gemcitabine given intravenously at standard doses for 6 cycles; and if disease progression occurs to be followed by erlotinib taken by mouth daily The study is conducted with the partial support of Roche, S.p.A.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Diagnosis of cytologically or histologically confirmed nonsmall cell lung cancer Metastatic (stage IV) or locally advanced (stage IIIB, with metastasis to supraclavicular nodes or with pleural effusion). Both patients at first diagnosis or those with disease recurrence after former surgery are eligible. At least one target or nontarget lesion according to RECIST criteria Male or female &gt; 18 years of age (Italy upper age limit 70 years) ECOG PS 0 or 1 Life expectancy of &gt; 3 months Neutrophils &gt; 1,500 mm3, platelets &gt; 100,000 mm3, and hemoglobin &gt; 9 g/dL Bilirubin level either normal or &lt; 1.5 x ULN AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) &lt; 2.5 x ULN (&lt; 5 x ULN if liver metastasis are present) Serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 x ULN Effective contraception for both, male and female patients if the risk of conception exists Signed written informed consent Prior exposure to agents directed at the HER axis (e.g. gefitinib, cetuximab, trastuzumab). Prior chemotherapy or therapy with systemic antineoplastic therapy (e.g., monoclonal antibody therapy) for advanced disease. Prior surgery and/or localised irradiation is permitted. Prior neoadjuvant chemotherapy for operable disease or adjuvant chemotherapy is permitted if it did not contain gemcitabine and if at least 1 year elapsed from the end of chemotherapy and the date of relapse. Any unstable systemic disease (including active infections, significant cardiovascular disease or myocardial infarction within the previous year, any significant hepatic, renal or metabolic disease), metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding, or clinical laboratory finding that contraindicates the use of study medications or render the patient at high risk from treatment complications. Any other malignancies within past 5 years (except for adequately treated carcinoma in situ of the cervix or basal or squamous cell skin cancer or surgically resected prostate cancer with normal PSA). Patients are excluded if they have brain metastasis or spinal cord compression that has not yet been definitively treated with surgery and/or radiation; previously diagnosed and treated CNS metastases or spinal cord compression without evidence of stable disease (clinically stable imaging) for at least 2 months will also cause patients to be excluded. Patients with asymptomatic CNS metastases and not requiring steroids to control symptoms can be included, even if on antiseizure medications. HIV positive patients Any inflammatory changes of the surface of the eye at baseline Patients who cannot take oral medication, who require intravenous alimentation, have had prior surgical procedures affecting absorption, or have active peptic ulcer disease. Nursing and/or pregnant females Known or suspected hypersensitivity to any of the study drugs.</criteria>
