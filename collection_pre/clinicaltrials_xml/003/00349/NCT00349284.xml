	<brief_summary>Type IIb dyslipidemia is characterized by elevated triglycerides (TG ³ 150 mg/dL), and elevated LDL-C levels (³160 mg/dL). When in addition, HDL-C is low, the presence of the lipid triad, elevated TG and LDL-C and low levels of HDL-C, seems to confer additional CHD risk in this type of patient, compared to elevated LDL-C alone.Coadministration of fenofibrate and ezetimibe could provide a complementary efficacy therapy and improve the atherogenic profile of this patient population.</brief_summary>
