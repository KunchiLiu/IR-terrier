	<detailed_description>This protocol describes a double-blind placebo controlled randomized clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of bone marrow derived stem cell implants in 300 bazillion patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure in class III or IV of the New York Heart Association. The primary endpoint of this study is to evaluate the effect of the autologous bone marrow stem cell implant in the increase of the ejection fraction of the left ventricle in comparison with a control group, under optimized therapy for dilated cardiomyopathy. Secondary endpoints will evaluate the alteration in NYHA functional class, mortality rate, physical capacity (by ergoespirometry), life quality (Minnesota questionnaire) and pulmonary congestion in dilated cardiomyopathy patients the received the autologous bone-marrow stem cell implant.</detailed_description>
