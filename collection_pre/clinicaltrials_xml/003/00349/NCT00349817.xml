	<detailed_description>An educational module will be prepared by the investigators outlining important genetic fundamentals and hereditary colorectal cancer. Sixty four family medicine resident participants will take part in this study. Participants will be divided into 4 groups. Group 1 will be the control and receive no education. Group 2 will be given access to the self-study web-based educational module to do on their own time. Group 3 will be given a lecture on the material using the educational module, followed by a discussion. Group 4 will also be given this lecture and discussion, followed by an interactive standardized patient role-play experience. Three months later, all participants will complete an simulated oral examination, an written knowledge test and an attitude survey. By comparing the results between the 4 groups, the best way to teach genetics will be determined. This template can then be used to develop a curriculum for teaching clinical genetics to family medicine residents.</detailed_description>
