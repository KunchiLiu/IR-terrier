	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as PR-104, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of PR-104 in treating patients with advanced solid tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PR-104 in Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Evaluate the safety and tolerability of PR-104 in patients with advanced solid tumors. - Determine the maximum tolerated dose of PR-104 in these patients. Secondary - Characterize the pharmacokinetics of PR-104 and its alcohol metabolite in these patients. - Assess evidence of antitumor activity of this drug in these patients. Tertiary - Examine metabolic changes in tumors of these patients using fludeoxyglucose F 18 positron emission tomography scanning. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, open-label, prospective, uncontrolled, dose-escalation study. Patients receive PR-104 IV over 60 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of PR-104 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Blood is collected at baseline and then periodically during study treatment for pharmacokinetic and tumor marker studies. Patients undergo fludeoxyglucose F 18 positron emission tomography scanning before beginning study treatment and after completion of course 2 to assess metabolic activity of the tumor. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 30 days. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
