	<brief_summary>Intra-coronary thrombosis and thromboembolism continues to be a challenge for percutaneous coronary and other vascular interventional techniques. The Xtract™ Aspiration Catheter is a single use device designed to remove fresh, soft emboli and thrombi from the arterial system using standard catheter techniques, compatible with 6 Fr guide catheters and 0.014 guidewires. The purpose of this registry study is to validate the design and demonstrate the performance of the Xtract Aspiration Catheter as a thrombectomy catheter during percutaneous intervention of vessels in the arterial system. Subjects will be enrolled during percutaneous intervention when the Interventional Physician decides a thrombectomy catheter is needed to remove thrombus during the procedure.</brief_summary>
