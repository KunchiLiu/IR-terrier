	<detailed_description>The purpose of the study is to evaluate the fit and performance of an investigational soft contact lens in comparison with a currently marketed lens. Both lenses will be worn on a continuous wear basis, which means the lenses will be worn while sleeping. Physiological changes will be monitored and subjective ratings collected.</detailed_description>
