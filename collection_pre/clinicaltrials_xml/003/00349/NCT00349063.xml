	<criteria>1. Has had an oculovisual examination in the last two years. 2. Is at least 18 years old and has full legal capacity to volunteer or is at least 16 years old, has a parent or guardian’s permission to participate in the study and has read the Information and Consent Letter for adolescents. 4. Has read and understood the Information Consent Letter (Appendix II). 5. Is willing and able to follow participant instructions for product usage and meet the protocolspecified schedule of followup visits. 6. Has a refractive error that is correctable with the prescription of the available study lenses. 7. Has a refractive error that is correctable to at least 20/25 distance visual acuity with contact lenses in each eye. 8. Has acceptable fit with the study lenses. 9. Has clear corneas, and ocular clinical findings are considered “normal”. 1. Has any systemic disease that may affect ocular health. 2. Is using any systemic or topical medications that may affect ocular health. 3. Has any ocular pathology or severe insufficiency of lacrimal secretion (dry eyes) that may affect the wearing of contact lenses. 4. Has any clinically significant lid or conjunctival abnormalities, meibomian gland dysfunction, neovascularization, corneal scars or corneal opacities. 5. Has limbal injection, bulbar injection or corneal staining that, in the investigator's opinion, is clinically significant. 6. Has pinguecula and/or pterygium that, in the investigator's judgement, makes contact lens wear inadvisable. 7. Has refractive astigmatism of more than 0.75 D. 8. Has corneal distortion resulting from rigid lens wear. 9. Is aphakic. 10. Has undergone corneal refractive surgery. 11. Is participating in any other type of clinical or research study. 12. Is pregnant or lactating.</criteria>
