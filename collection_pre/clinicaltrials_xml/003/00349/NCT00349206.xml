	<brief_summary>This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of temsirolimus when given together with sorafenib and to see how well they work in treating patients with metastatic, recurrent, or unresectable melanoma. Sorafenib and temsirolimus may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Sorafenib may also stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Giving sorafenib together with temosirolimus may kill more tumor cells.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sorafenib and Temsirolimus in Treating Patients With Metastatic, Recurrent, or Unresectable Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose of temsirolimus when administered with sorafenib in patients with metastatic, recurrent, or unresectable melanoma. II. To determine the safety and toxicity of this regimen in these patients. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To Determine the population pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients. II. To correlate tumor and blood biomarkers with clinical outcome in patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, phase I, dose-escalation study followed by a phase II, open-label study (2005-0215). Patients receive temsirolimus IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 and oral sorafenib once or twice daily on days 1-28. Treatment course repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3-6 months.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Criteria: Histologically or cytologically confirmed melanoma, meeting 1 of the following criteria: recurrent or unresectable stage III disease, stage IV disease, nonchoroidal origin. Tumor must be accessible to biopsy unless appropriate tumor sample collection has occurred within the past 3 months and patient agrees to provide these samples for this study. ECOG performance status 01. Bilirubin normal Creatinine normal or creatinine clearance ≥ 60 mL/min Not pregnant or nursing Negative pregnancy test Fertile patients must use effective contraception during and for 30 days after completion of study treatment.

No evidence of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy. No condition that would impair the ability to swallow pills (e.g., gastrointestinal tract disease resulting in an inability to take oral medication; requirement for IV alimentation; or active peptic ulcer disease). No uncontrolled illness including, but not limited to, any of the following: ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia or psychiatric illness or social situations that would limit study compliance.

At least 3 weeks since prior major surgery. At least 4 weeks since prior chemotherapy (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) for melanoma and recovered. At least 4 weeks since prior radiotherapy and recovered. Prior biologic or immunotherapeutic regimens allowed. Prior regional chemotherapy regimens (e.g., isolated limb perfusion) allowed but only 1 prior regional chemotherapy regimen allowed if all target lesions are within the prior regional treatment field. No concurrent enzymeinducing antiepileptic drugs including, but not limited to, any of the following: phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, rifampin or Hypericum perforatum (St. John's wort). No concurrent prophylactic hematopoietic colonystimulating factors. No other concurrent investigational agents. No other concurrent anticancer agents or therapies for this cancer. No concurrent fulldose anticoagulation (i.e., warfarin, IV heparin, or lowmolecular weight heparin). No concurrent grapefruit or grapefruit juice. No concurrent combination antiretroviral therapy for HIVpositive patients. Concurrent prophylactic anticoagulation therapy (e.g., lowdose warfarin) allowed provided PT INR &lt; 1.1 times ULN. Unidimensionally measurable disease &gt;= 20 mm by conventional techniques or &gt;= 10 mm by spiral CT scan (longest diameter to be recorded) and margins of visible cutaneous metastatic lesions should be clearly defined and measured in at least one dimension as &gt;= 10 mm. No known brain metastases unless the following criteria are met: no radiographical evidence of recurrences in the brain &gt;= 3 months after complete resection of the brain metastases, asymptomatic brain metastases stable for &gt;= 3 months since wholebrain radiation therapy and/or stereotactic radiosurgery and must not require steroid for brain metastases.
