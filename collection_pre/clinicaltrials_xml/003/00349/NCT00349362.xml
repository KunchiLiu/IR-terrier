	<brief_title>Testosterone for Men With Insulin Treated Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There is epidemiological data linking low serum testosterone levels in men with the development of diabetes. Clinical trials have indicated a potential benefit of testosterone treatment in improving diabetic control and insulin resistance. Type 2 diabetes is also associated with changes in arterial stiffness and IMT which are known to be linked to the presence of cardiovascular disease. Artificially induced hypogonadism results in increasing arterial stiffness whilst testosterone is known to improve risk factors for vascular disease and act as a vasodilator. The purpose of this pilot study is to test the effect of six months of testosterone replacement, given as testosterone esters 200mg from Sustanon 250 IM injection, on diabetes control in hypogonadal men with type 2 diabetes treated with insulin.</detailed_description>
