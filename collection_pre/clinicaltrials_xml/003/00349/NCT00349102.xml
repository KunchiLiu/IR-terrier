	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the interest of breath holding for the prevention of radiation pneumonitis following conformal radiation therapy. Eligible patients will be randomly assigned in a 2-arm trial to free breathing or breath holding during conformal radiation. The primary objective of the study is to establish the efficacy of breath holding, compared to free breathing, in the prevention of early pulmonary toxicity following conformal radiation. Several departments of radiotherapy, many pneumology units and two basic and applied research laboratories take part in this multicentric study. The number of patients required to demonstrate a reduction in radiation pneumonitis from 45 % to 22.5 %, assuming an alpha risk of 5% in a two-sided test and 95% power, is 240 (120 per arm). With a planned accrual of 7 patients per month, it is estimated that the inclusion period should be approximately 3 years.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The secondary objectives are: - Validation of the Lent-Soma toxicity scale by comparison to the RTOG scale, - Response rate at different times: week 6-8, 1 year and 2 years after the end of irradiation, - Progression-free survival rate at 1 year and 2 years after the end of irradiation - Confirmation of the predictive value of serum cytokine levels (IL-6 and IL-10) during irradiation for the occurrence of early radiation toxicity, and analysis of the correlation between these serum levels at inclusion and the expression polymorphism of candidate genes.</detailed_description>
