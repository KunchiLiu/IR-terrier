	<brief_summary>Standard treatment for locally advanced cancer of the rectum is preoperative chemoradiotherapy with 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) plus 4 cycles of postoperative chemotherapy with 5-FU. According to our previous study (CAO/ARO/AIO-94, published in the New England Journal of Medicine 2004; 351:1731-40) this treatment results in only 6% of local failures, yet, still 36% of all patients develop distant metastasis. Therefore, our new study (CAO/ARO/AIO-04) incorporates new drugs, i.e. 5-FU + oxaliplatin, in an effort to improve the control of distant metastases. It is our hypothesis that the rate of disease free survival will improve by 5 to 8% after 3 years of follow-up.</brief_summary>
