	<brief_summary>The purpose of this randomized phase II trial is to determine the clinical feasibility - in terms of patients without dose limiting toxicities or premature treatment withdrawal or death - of the combination of Cisplatin and Pemetrexed and of the combination of Cisplatin and Vinorelbine. The combination of Cisplatin / Pemetrexed is assumed to be distinctly less toxic than Vinorelbine / Cisplatin.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial on Refinement of Early Stage Lung Cancer Adjuvant Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Derived from recent large randomized clinical trials, there is clear evidence for adjuvant chemotherapy in stage IB-IIB (incidental IIIA) non-small cell lung cancer (Arriagada et al., 2004; Winton et al., 2005, Strauss et al., 2004, Douillard et al., 2005). The majority of patients in the adjuvant treatment setting received a combination of Cisplatin and Vinorelbine (Aragiada et al., 2004; Winton et al., 2005; Douillard et al., 2005). This combination improved 5 year-survival rates up to 15% (54% to 69%) (Winton et al., 2005). However, the combination of Cisplatin and Vinorelbine resulted in rates of grade 3/4 neutropenia of around 75%, rates of febrile neutropenia of up to 12.5% and rates of treatment related death of 1-2%. Up to 77% of the patients had at least one dose reduction or omission and 55% required one dose delay or more, most related to neutropenia. Only about 50 % of patients randomized on the combination of cisplatin and vinorelbine received the intended dose of Vinorelbine (dose reduction mainly due to toxicity) and only 50% of patients completed all four cycles of chemotherapy (Winton et al., 2005, Douillard et al., 2005, Alam et al., 2005). Therefore it seems reasonable to test a less toxic regimen also in early stages after R0 resection of the tumor, where reduced toxicities might improve the feasibility of drug delivery, compliance and the convenience of treatment for the patient and hence perhaps survival. Pemetrexed, a folate antimetabolite, shows clear activity in non-small cell lung cancer with several Phase II studies of Pemetrexed in combination with Cisplatin, Oxaliplatin, or Carboplatin showing efficacy similar to other standard platinum doublets, with response rates of 27% to 45% and median survival of 8.9 to 10.9 months (Scagliotti et al., 2005; Clarke et al., 2002; Rusthoven et al., 1999; Manegold et al., 2000; Shepherd et al., 2001). The combination of platin and Pemetrexed can be easily delivered and is well tolerated. Furthermore, it only results in a 25% rate of grade 3/4 neutropenia and in vitamin supplemented patients the incidence of febrile neutropenia was &lt; 1%. Dose reductions occur only in 2-4% of the patients and dose delivery of the intended Pemetrexed and platin dose is excellent with dose deliveries of Pemetrexed up to 95% (Hanna et al., 2004; Vogelzang et al., 2003, Scagliotti et al., 2005). In this randomized phase II trial, the clinical feasibility of the combination of Cisplatin and Pemetrexed as well as of the combination of Cisplatin and Vinorelbine will be assessed. Treatment is considered to have clinical feasibility if dose limiting toxicity will not be observed, and no non-acceptance by the patient leading to premature withdrawal, and no death due to cancer or cancer therapy will occur. Patients will be randomized according to center, lobectomy vs. pneumonectomy and N0 vs. N1 to 4 cycles (arm A) of 500 mg/m2 pemetrexed d1, and Cisplatin 75 mg/m2 d1, q d22 versus (arm B) 25 mg/m2 Vinorelbine d1, 8, 15, 22, and Cisplatin 50 mg/m2 d1+8; q d29. Radiotherapy or maintenance therapy are not intended. Study drug administration will begin on d28 to d42 after R0 resection of the tumor and within 14 days after randomization. In an initial study phase 36 patients (i.e. 18 in each treatment arm) will be accrued to confirm feasibility. In the second step, further patients will be recruited up to a total number of 134 (i.e. 67 cases per treatment arm). Patients will be followed-up in 3 monthly intervals for the first 2 years starting 30 days after end of the last cycle and in the 3rd year patients will be followed-up in 6 monthly intervals.</detailed_description>

Complete tumor resection without detectable residual tumor including negative margins (R0) and systematic intraoperative dissection of mediastinal lymph nodes of course lymph node dissection has to comprise all lymph node levels to be removed with standard right or left sided resection. The dissection has to assure the removal of mediastinal lymph nodes more than 1,5 cm on the preoperative CT scan. Study drug administration should only be administered to patients with full recovery after surgery and is to begin on d28 to d42 postoperatively The following histological tumor types are eligible: Squamous Cell Carcinoma Adenocarcinoma (including adenocarcinomas with bronchioloalveolar differentiation) Large Cell Carcinoma (excluding tumors with slight areas of small cell carcinoma) Mixed Cell Carcinoma without small cell fraction Provision of informed consent according to local regulatory requirements for participation in the study Age ≥ 18 years; &lt; 75 Years Karnofsky Performance Status 80% or ECOG 1 Adequate hematological laboratory parameters Hemoglobin 10 g/dl ANC 1500/µl Platelets 100000/µl Adequate hepatic laboratory parameters Bilirubin 1.5 x UNL (UNL=Upper Normal Limit ) ASAT/ALAT 2 x UNL Adequate renal laboratory parameters Creatinine 1,5 mg/dl and Calculated Creatinine Clearance 60 ml/min Cardiac function allowing cisplatin chemotherapy (in case of doubt echocardiography is mandatory documenting LVEF &gt;49%) Electrocardiogram without significant cardiac arrhythmia FEV1 1.2 l postoperatively Respiratory function not impeding Cisplatinbased chemotherapy assessed by either absolute DLCO or capillary / arterial BGA in resting condition (absolute DLCO &gt; 40 % or pO2 &gt;60 mmHg in resting condition) Agreement by the patient to use an effective method of contraception Negative pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential unless they are postmenopausal at baseline.
