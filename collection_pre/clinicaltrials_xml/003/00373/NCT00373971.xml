	<detailed_description>Malnutrition of elder orthopaedic patients leads to weight loss and loss of fat free mass. Changes in the individual’s nutritional status and body composition may adversely affect the patient’s postoperative level of activity. Aim. Thus, the purpose of the present study is to report changes in postoperative weight, FFM and functions vital to daily living in a group of elder orthopaedic patients that were actively involved in their nutritional care during the hospital stay. Method. The study comprises 253 patients aged 65+ and admitted either for hip- or knee replacement or with a fractured hip. Following a quasi-experimental design, 142 patients were allocated to the control group and 109 patients to the intervention group. The intervention programme focused on patients’ involvement in their nutritional care. Body composition by bio impedance and functional status by a standard chart were assessed at admission and four months postoperatively.</detailed_description>
