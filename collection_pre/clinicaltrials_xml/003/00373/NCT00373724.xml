	<brief_title>A Placebo-Controlled Study Assessing Lateral Branch Radiofrequency Denervation for Sacroiliac (SI) Joint Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>30 subjects with SI joint pain confirmed by SI joint injections will be randomized to receive either L4 and L5 primary dorsal rami and S1-3 lateral branch radiofrequency denervation or sham denervation. To facilitate patient blinding, in both groups 1 ml of lidocaine will be injected before true (or sham) denervation so patients cannot feel heating. The stimulation will be the same for both groups and blinding assessed after the procedure. Follow-up visits will be at 1,3 and 6-months postprocedure.</detailed_description>
