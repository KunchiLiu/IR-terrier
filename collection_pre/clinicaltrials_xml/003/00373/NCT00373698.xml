	<brief_summary>The study is an evaluation of a systemic intervention to enhance the delivery of care according to practice guidelines for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The immediate objectives are to (1) implement three component model (3CM) in VA primary care clinics; and (2) evaluate the effects of 3CM on clinician behavior and patient outcomes. The long-term objectives are to generate information to support implementation research on the RESPECT model for treating PTSD in primary care and ultimately, the implementation of the model in VHA to provide care to veterans with PTSD.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>3CM consists of (1) a prepared practice, (2) care management, and (3) enhanced mental health support. A prepared practice refers to education for primary care clinicians and office staff about practice guidelines and evidence-based care, the skills needed for use of assessment measures, and the use of communication forms and routines. The education plan consists of predisposing activities, including active teaching and learning, and enabling and reinforcing activities in order to help clinicians use newly acquired skills and to reinforce the continued use of these skills in practice. Care management is accomplished by telephone, usually by a centrally located care manager during acute phase treatment and follow up to answer patient questions, promote adherence to the clinician's management plan, and help patients overcome barriers to adherence. Enhanced mental health support is provided by a psychiatrist who supervises care managers by telephone, provides informal consultation to primary care clinicians, and helps to increase the quantity or quality of mental health referral resources.</detailed_description>
