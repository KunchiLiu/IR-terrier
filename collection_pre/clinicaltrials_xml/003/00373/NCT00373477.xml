	<brief_summary>This project will enable the investigators to conduct a randomized clinical trial to demonstrate the value of generalist care managers in the treatment of depression in Medicaid patients seen in primary health care practices. Depressed patients will be recruited at two primary care practices in Western North Carolina and randomly assigned to either generalist care management or usual care. Patients in each condition will be assessed at baseline and six months follow-up. Outcomes will include depressive symptoms, level of functioning, and cost-effectiveness measures.</brief_summary>
