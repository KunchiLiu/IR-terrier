	<brief_summary>This study will assess the pharmacokinetics and tolerability of a single dose of GW406381 in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment in comparison to matched healthy volunteers. The hepatically impaired and healthy groups will be given a single 20 mg oral dose of GW406381. Blood samples for PK analysis will be collected pre-dose and over the 72 hours post dosing. Subjects will be housed from the evening before dosing until 24 hours after dosing. A follow-up visit will be conducted between 7 to 10 days from the last dose of study drug.</brief_summary>
