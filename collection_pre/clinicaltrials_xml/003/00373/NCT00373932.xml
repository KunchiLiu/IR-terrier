	<brief_summary>The purpose of this exploratory study is to determine the feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy of an exercise persistence intervention for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) following pulmonary rehabilitation (PR).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Real-Time Support for Exercise Persistence in COPD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Exercise, a cornerstone of PR, is effective in improving dyspnea, functioning, and health related quality of life (HRQL) in patients with COPD. However, these improvements gradually dissipate following program completion. There are currently few successful interventions that support patients' persistence with community-based exercise after PR and that have closely monitored the potentially negative impact that COPD exacerbations have on exercise behaviors. Emerging technologies such as wirelessly enabled personal digital assistants (PDA) may provide an innovative means to support exercise persistence through real-time collaborative monitoring of exercise and signs and symptoms of COPD exacerbations and reinforcement to enhance exercise self-efficacy. Patient graduates of two PR programs who have COPD (n=20) will first undergo a 2-week run-in prior to being randomized to either the MOBILE (Mobilizing Support for Long-term Exercise) intervention or attention control for 6 months.</detailed_description>
