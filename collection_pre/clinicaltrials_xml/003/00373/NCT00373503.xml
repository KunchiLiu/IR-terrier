	<brief_title>Effect of Lofexidine and Oral THC on Marijuana Withdrawal and Relapse</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Only a small percentage of dependent-marijuana smokers who are seeking treatment for their marijuana use is able to achieve sustained abstinence. The objective of this study is to investigate the interaction between marijuana and two potential treatment medications: lofexidine and oral THC, with the direct goal of using this information to improve marijuana treatment outcome. In mice, the α2-receptor agonist, clonidine, reversed symptoms of cannabinoid withdrawal (Lichtman et al., 2001). The purpose of this study is to determine if lofexidine, an α2-receptor agonist with a more favorable side-effect profile than clonidine, decreases symptoms of marijuana withdrawal and thus decreases marijuana relapse, as compared to placebo. Oral THC is FDA-approved for appetite enhancement. Lofexidine, which is currently not FDA-approved, is used in Europe to treat symptoms of heroin withdrawal, and to treat hypertension. For the purposes of this model, relapse is defined to a return to marijuana use after a period of abstinence. We have shown that oral THC reduces symptoms of marijuana withdrawal at doses that produce minimal intoxication (Haney et al., 2004). Thus, the effects of oral THC alone and in combination with lofexidine will be determined. The study will utilize an inpatient/outpatient, counter-balanced design, with each participant maintained on each of four medication conditions for 8 days each: placebo, lofexidine, oral THC, and oral THC combined with lofexidine. During the inpatient study phases, participants will have the opportunity to self-administer placebo or active marijuana 6 times per day. Outpatient phases are for medication clearance so no medications will be administered. This study will provide important information of the effect of these potential treatment medications on both marijuana withdrawal symptoms, and on subsequent marijuana self-administration.</detailed_description>
