	<brief_title>Refractory Urge Incontinence and Botox Injections</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Women who suffer with urge incontinence may not get relief with usual medical treatment (such as medications or behavioral techniques). We plan to enroll women with refractory urge incontinence in centers across the US. Study participants will undergo cystoscopy (telescope look into the bladder) and injection of either Botox A or placebo. If symptoms are not adequately relieved, subjects participants will receive a second injection that is Botox A. Participants are interviewed monthly by study personnel to determine symptoms and health status.</detailed_description>
