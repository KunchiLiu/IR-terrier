	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if the addition of motexafin gadolinium (study drug) to standard treatment with docetaxel will improve the response rate in patients with non-small cell lung cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of the Effect on Non-small Cell Lung Cancer of the Investigational Drug Motexafin Gadolinium When Used in Combination With Docetaxel (Taxotere)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Preclinical and clinical data suggest that MGd has activity in NSCLC and that the combination of MGd and docetaxel may be more effective that docetaxel alone. In this trial, patients will receive 10 mg/kg MGd followed by 75 mg/m2 once every 3 weeks. This dosing regimen was well tolerated in the Phase I dose escalation trial. A Simon 2-stage trial design will be used; if at least 4 out of 39 evaluable patients in the first stage of the trial demonstrate objective clinical response, the study will proceed to Stage 2, where an additional 22 evaluable patients will be enrolled following the same treatment regimen and assessment schedule as in Stage 1. Patients with stable disease, CR, or PR will continue dosing up to 12 cycles and will be followed for response every 6 weeks until PD, death, or end of study.</detailed_description>
