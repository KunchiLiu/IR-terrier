	<brief_title>A Study Of SU011248 Plus Paclitaxel Versus Bevacizumab Plus Paclitaxel In Patients With Advanced Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>On May 27, 2009, the independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) reviewed the progress of Study A6181094. The DMC determined Study A6181094 had met pre-specified futility criteria and was unlikely to meet its primary endpoint to demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) in patients treated with sunitinib plus paclitaxel versus bevacizumab plus paclitaxel. Pfizer notified clinical trial investigators involved in the study and regulatory agencies of these findings. Enrollment in this study has been stopped.</detailed_description>
