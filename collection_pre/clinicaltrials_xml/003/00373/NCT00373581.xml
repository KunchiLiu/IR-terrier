	<brief_title>Effects of Vigabatrin on Cocaine Self-Administration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Two recent open label clinical trials have reported that the anticonvulsant, gamma vinyl-GABA (GVG; vigabatrin), decreases relapse to cocaine use (Brodie et al., 2003, 2005). Vigabatrin increases neural GABA levels by irreversibly inhibiting the primary GABA degradation enzyme, GABA-transaminase; the hypothesized mechanism by which vigabatrin decreases cocaine relapse is by increasing GABA levels, thereby decreasing the effects of cocaine and cocaine-associated environmental cues on extracellular dopamine concentrations in the mesolimbic dopaminergic pathway (Morgan and Dewey, 1998). We are proposing to use our model of repeated dose cocaine self-administration to assess the interaction between vigabatrin and smoked cocaine under controlled laboratory conditions. This 57-day outpatient/inpatient /outpatient/inpatient protocol will evaluate the effects of vigabatrin maintenance (0, 3 g/day) on cocaine craving, subjective effects, and self-administration using a within-subjects design. Non-treatment seeking cocaine-dependent volunteers will be maintained outpatient for 14 days of vigabatrin maintenance prior to beginning each inpatient study phase. During the inpatient phases, volunteers will live on a hospital clinical research unit and will participate in laboratory sessions in which they will have the opportunity to purchase doses of smoked cocaine (0, 12, 25, 50 mg; $5/administration). In addition to measuring cocaine self-administration, we will measure the cardiovascular and subjective effects of repeated cocaine administration and cocaine craving under each vigabatrin maintenance condition. Determining vigabatrin's effects on a range of smoked cocaine doses will provide essential data on the mechanism of the vigabatrin-cocaine interaction.</detailed_description>
