	<brief_title>Microarray Analysis of Gene Expression in Liver Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this research is to study of the biologic features of liver tissue (by studying their gene expression profiles), so that we can increase our understanding of the processes involved in liver cancer development and growth. This may allow us to identify more effective ways of diagnosing, treating, and predicting the outcome of patients with liver cancer.</detailed_description>
