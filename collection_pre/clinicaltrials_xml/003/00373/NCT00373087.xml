	<brief_summary>Entacapone is an antiparkinsonian drug which block L-dopa metabolism, inhibiting the C-O-methyltransferase (COMT) enzyme. There is an individual variability of the COMT activity determined by a genetic polymorphism. The aim of this study is to investigate whether the genetic variability influences entacapone efficacy in Parkinson's disease.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>COMT Polymorphism and Entacapone Efficacy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>COMT protein is dependent of a single autosomal locus with two co-dominant alleles with a high activity (allele H) and a low activity (allele L) form of the enzyme. L and H allele frequency in the Caucasian population is around 50%. This is a monocentric randomized blinded cross-over study comparing acute challenge of L-dopa + placebo versus L-dopa + 200 mg entacapone, in Parkinson's disease patients with HH and LL genotypes.</detailed_description>
