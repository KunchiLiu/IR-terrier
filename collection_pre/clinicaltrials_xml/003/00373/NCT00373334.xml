Parents/guardians are competent and willing to provide consent and sign and date the institutional review board (IRB) approved consent form. Parents/guardians are willing to adhere to study requirements, including applying the conservative GERD management methods.

Infants with prior neonatal intensive care unit admission for any reason. Hematemesis or apparent lifethreatening events (ALTE). Concurrent treatment with any chronic medication except by permission of the study sponsor. Treatment with a histamine 2 receptor antagonist (H2RA), antacid, sucralfate, prostaglandin, or motility agent within 3 days before Visit 1; treatment with a proton pump inhibitor within 7 days before Visit 1. Requirement or likely requirement for a medical procedure or surgery during the study. Known hypersensitivity to an H2RA including nizatidine. Receipt of any investigational agent within the previous 30 days before randomization. Poor medical or psychiatric risks for therapy with an investigational drug, in the opinion of the investigator.
