	<brief_summary>The purpose of this 8-week study is to compare the effects of switching from therapy with epoprostenol or Flolan to IV Remodulin. This study will also assess the effect that changing to Remodulin will have on patient satisfaction with their treatment and impact on quality of life.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety, Efficacy and Treatment Satisfaction in Patients With PAH Rapidly Switched From Epoprostenol to Remodulin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), which is defined as an elevation in pulmonary arterial pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance, is a severe hemodynamic abnormality common to a variety of diseases and syndromes. Elevation in pulmonary arterial pressure causes an increase in right ventricular afterload, impairing right ventricular function and ultimately leading to inactivity and death. The goal of PAH treatment is to lengthen survival time, to ameliorate symptoms of PAH and to improve health related quality of life (HRQOL). RemodulinÂ® (treprostinil sodium), a stable analogue of prostacyclin, possesses potent pulmonary and systemic vasodilatory and platelet anti-aggregatory actions in vitro and in vivo. Recently, Remodulin received FDA approval for intravenous therapy based upon bioequivalence of the IV and SC routes of administration. Remodulin is more chemically stable than epoprostenol and may offer potential safety and convenience advantages compared to intravenous epoprostenol that may impact Health Related Quality of Life (HRQOL) and/or patient satisfaction. Unlike epoprostenol, Remodulin does not need to be mixed daily and is stable at room temperature eliminating the need for ice packs. Furthermore, since Remodulin remains in the body longer than epoprostenol (4 hrs instead of less than 5 minutes) there is less risk of cardiovascular collapse from a sudden interruption of infusion, such as a line clog. In an open-label study in Europe, patients who were using a type of portable medication pump called the CADD Legacy pump were rapidly switched from Flolan to Remodulin with no serious side effects. This study will examine effects of switching from therapy with epoprostenol or Flolan to IV Remodulin and compare changes in HRQOL and treatment satisfaction before and after rapid switch from epoprostenol to Remodulin in patients with pulmonary hypertension using the CADD legacy pump. Participation in this study will last approximately 10 weeks. Study procedures include routine blood tests, medical history, physical exams, disease evaluation, exercise tests and patient questionnaires. Participants will have 4 visits during the study and will spend at least 1 night in the hospital.</detailed_description>
