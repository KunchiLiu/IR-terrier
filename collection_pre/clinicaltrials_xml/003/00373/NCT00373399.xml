	<brief_title>Effects of Smoked Marijuana on Risk Taking and Decision Making Tasks</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cannabis abuse and dependence are the most prevalent drug use disorders in the United States (Compton et al., 2004), yet little is known about the factors contributing to successful marijuana treatment. Previously, we have shown that cognitive impairments in patients treated for substance disorders are associated with premature treatment dropout. However, little is known about whether such impairments are the result of drug use per se. The objective of this within-subject study is to determine whether decision-making and risk-taking are affected by acute cannabis intoxication. The Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART; Lejuez et al. 2002) assesses decision making in a context of increasing risk, and the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT; Bechara et al. 1994) tests the ability to balance immediate rewards against long-term negative consequences; both tasks have strong face validity for evaluating cognitive deficits that may contribute to poor treatment outcome. Research volunteers will be current marijuana smokers. Each will participate in three, 4-hour outpatient sessions in the Substance Use Research Center (SURC) in the Division of Substance Abuse at NYSPI. They will smoke a different strength marijuana cigarette (0.0, 1.98, 3.56% THC) in each session in counter-balanced order. After baseline data have been collected (risk taking and decision making behaviors, heart rate, blood pressure, mood scales, exhaled carbon monoxide), participants will take 3-6 puffs, 5 seconds in duration, from a National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) marijuana cigarette. After smoking, we will repeatedly re-assess risk taking and decision making abilities with the BART and IGT. We will also measure subjective mood ratings, heart rate and blood pressure repeatedly for 180 minutes following smoking. This study is the first controlled investigation of the effects of smoked marijuana on both risk taking and decision making tasks. The data obtained will be used to guide treatment development for marijuana use disorders.</detailed_description>
