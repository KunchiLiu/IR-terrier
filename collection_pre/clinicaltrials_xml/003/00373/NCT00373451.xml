	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine which of these anti-clotting medications, abciximab plus unfractionated heparin or bivalirudin, is more effective to prevent thrombotic and bleeding complications in patients suffering from a heart attack and undergoing coronary intervention.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomized Comparison of Abciximab Plus Heparin With Bivalirudin in Acute Coronary Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) is associated with an increased risk of death and is a major reason for hospital admissions. Most frequently, the sequence of events that leads to NSTEMI is characterized by a disrupted atherosclerotic plaque, platelet activation and aggregation, thrombus formation and microembolizations. Patients with NSTEMI are treated with an early invasive strategy and there is intensive work in progress to define the optimal antithrombotic therapy to be used in adjunct to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in these patients. Bivalirudin, a direct thrombin inhibitor, and the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor (GPI) abciximab have been in the focus of recent trials in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). In a recent randomized, open-label trial (ACUITY trial), patients with the suspicion of ACS on the basis of the type of anginal symptoms, ST-segment displacement, elevated biomarkers or several risk indicators were randomized to receive bivalirudin alone with bail-out GPIs, bivalirudin plus GPIs, or heparin/low-molecular weight heparin plus a GPI. The GPIs most frequently used were eptifibatide and tirofiban. Abciximab was given in only &lt; 9% of the cases. In another randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (ISAR-REACT-2) including ACS patients undergoing PCI, abciximab was administered in cath lab and was associated with a significant reduction of ischemic events in patients with NSTEMI, and did not lead to a measurable increase in major bleeding complications. However, it is not known whether abciximab is also superior to bivalirudin in patients with NSTEMI. We designed this study to assess whether abciximab added to unfractionated heparin is superior to bivalirudin in patients with NSTEMI.</detailed_description>
