	<brief_summary>Diaphragmatic hernia detected in fetal life carries a high risk for postnatal demise due to lung underdevelopment. Clinical experience from prospective controlled non-randomized case series with fetoscopic tracheal balloon occlusion has seen improved survival rates in contrast to untreated controls. Therefore, the purpose of this randomized clinical trial is to provide further evidence about the efficacy and safety of the prenatal interventional approach. Primary outcome measure is postnatal survival to discharge from hospital treatment.</brief_summary>
