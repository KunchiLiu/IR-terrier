	<brief_summary>The present protocol is a dose-finding and toxicity study in preparation of a randomised study comparing current standard treatment CSA/prednisolone with the new combination CSA/prednisolone/everolimus.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Everolimus in Combination With Cyclosporine A and Prednisolone for the Treatment of Graft Versus Host Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective of the present study is to evaluate the feasibility of treatment with everolimus in combination with CSA/prednisolone in patients with aGVHD after allogeneic HSCT. This evaluation takes into account the following parameters: - Feasibility of oral application everolimus - Daily dose needed to reach the targeted plasma level everolimus - Time to reach the targeted plasma level of everolimusSecondary objectivesThe study will evaluate the toxicity and safety of the treatment with ever-olimus/CSA/prednisolone with regard to - Incidence and severity of treatment induced toxic events - Incidence, severity and seriousness of adverse events - Treatment induced morbidity - Treatment induced 1-year-mortality Furthermore the study will collect data about - Efficacy of everolimus/CSA/prednisolone on aGVHD - Drug interactions between everolimus and CSA</detailed_description>
