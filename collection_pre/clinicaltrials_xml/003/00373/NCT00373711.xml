	<brief_summary>The management of thyroid cancer patients with suspicion of recurrent disease based on rising/detectable levels of thyroglobulin (Tg) involves imaging with iodine-123 whole body scintigraphy (I-123 WBS) and F-18 FDG PET/CT. However, the disease is not always detected. The use of another iodine isotope (I-124) with positron emitting characteristics for PET/CT may allow better identification of recurrent disease, thus allowing for more patients to be treated with I-131 as a curative attempt.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The management of thyroid cancer patients with suspicion of recurrent disease based on rising/detectable levels of thyroglobulin (Tg) involves imaging with iodine-123 whole body scintigraphy (I-123 WBS) and F-18 FDG PET/CT. However, the disease is not always detected. The use of another iodine isotope (I-124) with positron emitting characteristics for PET/CT may allow better identification of recurrent disease, thus allowing for more patients to be treated with I-131 as a curative attempt. Conducting this study we hope to find whether I-124 PET/CT allows for detection of more lesions in patients with suspected recurrent thyroid cancer than the current standard of care represented by I-123 WBS and F-18 FDG PET/CT.</detailed_description>
