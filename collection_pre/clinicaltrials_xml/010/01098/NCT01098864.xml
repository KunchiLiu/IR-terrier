	<brief_summary>The main objective of this study is to examine the effects of magnetic stimulation on the prefrontal cortex. We plan to use low frequency, repeated transcranial magnetic stimulation (1 Hz rTMS) to temporarily inhibit activity in the prefrontal cortex and measure the resulting effect on two decision-making tasks. The prefrontal cortex is thought to mediate or control cognitive functions like decision-making, planning, memory, and inhibit impulsive behavior.Previous research has indicated that rTMS over the right dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex will lead to preferences for riskier alternatives. Our hypothesis is that rTMS over the right DLPFC will lead to greater preference for the riskier alternative and greater temporal discounting.</brief_summary>
