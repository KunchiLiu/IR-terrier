	<brief_summary>Given the observations in animal models and the available data in the human our hypothesis is that peritoneal cavity conditioning (carbon dioxide with 4% of oxygen and 10% of N2O, 100% humidification at 32°C,) during open surgery, will result in an important decrease in postoperative peritoneal inflammation, postoperative pain, and will restore bowel transit faster.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Peritoneal Cavity Conditioning During Open Surgery.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aim of the Trial : RCT demonstrating that peritoneal cavity conditioning during open surgery will result in a less postoperative inflammation, less postoperative pain, and shorter time to flatus and transit.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Inclusion criteria : patients will be stratified and randomised according to the type of surgery total laparoscopic hysterectomy, promontofixation cholecystectomy Exclusion criteria : Any preexisting condition increasing the risk of surgery such as age, preexisting conditions as clotting disorders, heart or lung impairment etc. Not signed informed consent known allergic reaction to Sprayshield, Intercoat of hyalobarrier gel ® or any bowel lesion requiring a single or double layer suture. (given that for none of the any antiadhesion barriers safety has been proven following bowel lesions and suture) Any condition that might interfere with inflammatory parameters or preexisting such as ,pregnancy, immunodeficiency, chronic inflammatory disease as Crohn's disease, chronic pain conditions as (peripheral neuropathy, pathology of the vertebral column and osteoarticular disease, any condition causing acute pain e.g. trauma.</criteria>
