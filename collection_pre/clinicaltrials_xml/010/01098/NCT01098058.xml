	<brief_title>Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy (CBT) for Adult Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 50% of individuals with adult ADHD are not able to tolerate, do not respond to, or fail to reach optimal outcomes on medication alone (Spencer, Biederman and Wilens 2000). The NICE guidelines for adult ADHD, released in September 2008, emphasise the need for further such research into psychological approaches to treatment of the condition. There is promising preliminary evidence that suggests that psychological approaches to treatment are effective in individuals with Adult ADHD (see Weiss et al 2008 for a review). So far, however, only one randomised controlled trial of CBT has been carried out (Safren, Otto et al 2005). Thirty-one participants were randomised to receive either CBT and medication as usual or medication alone. Those randomised to CBT (n=16) had significantly lower ADHD symptoms (as rated by an independent investigator), global severity and self-rated symptoms than those on medication only (ps range &lt;0.01 to &lt;0.002). Those in the CBT group also had significantly lower scores on independently- and self-rated measures of mood (ps range &lt;0.01 to 0.04). There is a need for more randomised controlled trials to be carried out in order to replicate Safren et al's result in a different site, to further investigate the feasibility of CBT in this population and to further develop CBT approaches to this condition. Studies carried out so far have tended to be skills-based (i.e. sessions focused on teaching specific skills such as time management), rather than formulation-driven (a formulation is essentially a shared hypothesis as to the relationships between the individual's experience, beliefs, behaviour and emotions). The current study aims to evaluate a formulation-driven approach to CBT for adults with ADHD. A group of individuals (n = 30) receiving CBT combined with treatment as usual for adults with ADHD will be compared with a group receiving treatment as usual only (n= 30), employing a randomized design.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>A diagnosis of adult ADHD according to NICE guidelines i.e. if there was evidence from both the participant and the informant (where available) that 1) the participant met DSMIV criteria for Adult ADHD both in childhood and adulthood 2) that they experienced at least moderate psychological, social and/or educational or occupational impairment in multiple settings and 3) symptoms occurred in two or more settings including social, familial, educational and/or occupational settings. Participants will have received a diagnosis either from the Adult ADHD Service, Maudsley Hospital, London, UK or another specialist/secondary care service (in this case a copy of the diagnostic report will be required). Participants will either already be attending followup clinics, including psychoeducation workshops, or will have been recently referred to the service for medication followup or psychological treatment. Currently score 6 or more on the inattentive or hyperactive/impulsive subscale of the Adult Barkley Current Behaviour Scale Clinical severity of at least a moderate level (Clinical Global Impression score of 4 or above) Able to attend the clinic regularly and reliably Clinically significant anxiety disorder Current episode major depression, current suicidality or selfharm (score of moderate or high suicidality on the M.I.N.I.) Acquired brain injury Primary diagnosis of psychosis or bipolar disorder Pervasive developmental disorder(score of &lt;= 32 on Autism Spectrum Quotient although if the assessor judges that items that confound with ADHD have caused the score to be elevated, people with scores &gt;=32 can still enter the trial) Diagnosis of personality disorder Active substance misuse/dependence in last three months Verbal IQ &lt;80 Not able to comply with the requirements of a randomised controlled trial If the assessor does not perceive ADHD to be the primary problem</criteria>
