	<brief_title>NGR015: Study in Second Line for Patient With Advanced Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma Pretreated With Pemetrexed</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently, there are no regulatory-approved or widely accepted treatment options for patients failing a standard pemetrexed-based chemotherapy regimen. For this reason, the best supportive care (BSC) alone might be considered as a standard reference for a randomized phase III trial in this setting. However, single-agent chemotherapeutic agents (such as doxorubicin,gemcitabine, or vinorelbine) with a well-documented safety profile and antitumor activity are also used in clinical practice. Therefore, the best investigator's choice (BIC) between either best supportive care alone or combined with a few selected single-agent chemotherapy (including doxorubicin, gemcitabine, or vinorelbine) might be considered as an acceptable reference arm as well in this setting. The current phase III study aims to show a superior efficacy in terms of overall survival duration of NGR-hTNF 0.8 µg/mq weekly plus BIC versus placebo plus BIC in advanced MPM patients progressing after a standard pemetrexed-based chemotherapy.</detailed_description>
