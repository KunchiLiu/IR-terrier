	<brief_summary>We propose a study which will combine multiple modalities in evaluating the treatment response of children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) to acetyl-choline esterase (AChE) inhibitors and choline supplements. The primary objective of the study is to examine the efficacy of this treatment in improving core autistic symptoms. The Secondary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the treatment protocol in ASD children. Exploratory objectives include evaluation of the influence of the treatment on linguistic performance, comorbid behaviors, adaptive functioning and executive functions.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are a group of developmental disorders of brain function resulting in a distinct phenotype, most probably related to many specific causes. Individuals with a disorder in the autism spectrum are a heterogeneous group of patients with early childhood onset of deficits in social interaction, communication and language, and repetitive and stereotypic behaviors. ASD has become increasingly prevalent during the last few decades (Wiznitzer, 2005). The neuro-anatomical substrate of ASD has been the subject of intense investigation, but current findings are inconclusive, limited and sometimes even contradictory. Medical treatment of autism is still a matter of dispute. Medications used are mainly aimed to treat the comorbid symptoms, such as epilepsy, tics, obsessive-compulsive or hyperactive behaviors (Wiznitzer, 2005). Although many efforts were invested in establishing a model of autistic pathophysiology, no such model is currently accepted, and there is no evidence for an efficient treatment of the core autistic symptoms (Wiznitzer, 2005). Previous studies indicate that many brain systems are involved in the expression of autism. Specifically, it has been suggested that autism involves neurotransmitter dysregulations (Lam et al, 2006). A recent investigation of the cholinergic system in autism, detailed below, has provided promising findings. Our study aims to assess the clinical outcomes associated with cholinergic manipulations using pharmacological agents and nutritional supplements. The study approved by the Helsinki committee for clinical research.</detailed_description>
