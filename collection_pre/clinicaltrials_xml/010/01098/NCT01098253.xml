	<brief_summary>The goal of this proposal is to integrate depression services into improving adherence for oral hypoglycemic agents so that a single program can assist patients. The investigators hypothesized that patients in the intervention would demonstrate improved adherence to patients' oral hypoglycemic agents and antidepressants as well as improved clinical outcomes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Integrating Depression Services Into DM Management</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Many older patients do not take their medications for Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) as prescribed by their physician. Depression is common among patients with Type 2 DM and may be the reason why patients do not take their medications as prescribed. A program in which Type 2 DM and depression are treated together in primary care would improve the health of older patients with both Type 2 diabetes and depression and would be practical in real world practices with competing demands for limited resources. There is an urgent need for research that can bring potentially life-extending strategies to older patients with both diabetes and depression. People can better control their Type 2 DM if they treat their depression and the same strategies can be used to help patients take their medications for both conditions. In this program patients were involved in identifying problems with taking their medicines and working on solutions. The aims of this program were to improve how patients take their medications for Type 2 DM and depression as well as blood glucose control and symptoms of depression over 3 months. To see whether this program works the investigators compared the results of patients receiving this program to those who do not receive the program. Findings may lead to the development of other programs in which depression and chronic medical conditions are treated together.</detailed_description>
