	<brief_summary>This purpose of the study is to assess the safety and immunogenicity of a GSK Biologicals' candidate tuberculosis vaccine (692342) when administered concomitantly with or after the Expanded Programme of Immunisation vaccines regimen to healthy infants aged between and including 2 and 7 months, living in a tuberculosis endemic region.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Male and female subjects who the investigator believes that their parent(s)/ Legally Acceptable Representative (LAR(s)) can and will comply with the requirements of the protocol. Written or oral, signed or thumbprinted and witnessed informed consent obtained from the subject's parent(s)/LAR(s). Subjects who received their birth dose of Bacille Calmette Guerrin. Healthy subjects as established by medical history and clinical examination before entering into the study. For the 'Outside Expanded Programme on Immunisation' cohort: Must have documented evidence that he/she has completed the primary Expanded Programme on Immunisation regimen at least 1 month prior to planned vaccination with investigational vaccination regimen. Aged between 5 and 7 months at the time of the first study vaccination. For the 'Within EPI' cohort: Must have received the birth dose of Bacille Calmette Guerrin, oral polio vaccine and Hepatitis B vaccine but NO further Expanded Programme on Immunisation vaccines. Aged between 2 and 4 months at the time of the first study vaccination with diphtheria, tetanus, whole cell pertussis/ Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine + pneumococcal conjugate vaccine + oral polio vaccine. Child in care Acute or chronic, clinically significant pulmonary, cardiovascular, hepatic or renal abnormality, as determined by physical examination and/or laboratory screening tests. Laboratory screening tests out of range, which in the investigator's opinion affects the ability of the child to take part in the study. Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, based on medical history and physical examination. A family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency. Major congenital defects. History of any neurological disorders or seizures. Any condition or illness or medication, which in the opinion of the investigator might interfere with the evaluation of the safety or immunogenicity of the study vaccine. Any other findings that the investigator feels would increase the risk of having an adverse outcome from participation in the trial. Acute disease and/or fever at the time of enrolment. Use of any investigational or nonregistered product other than the study vaccines within 30 days preceding the first dose of study vaccine, or planned use during the study period. For the 'Within Expanded Programme on Immunisation' Cohort only: Previous vaccination with diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, Haemophilus influenzae type b and pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. History of previous administration of experimental Mycobacterium tuberculosis vaccines. Administration of immunoglobulins, blood transfusions and/or other blood products since birth to the first dose of study vaccine or planned administration during the study period. Chronic administration of immunosuppressants or other immunemodifying drugs within six months prior to the first vaccine dose. Planned participation or concurrently participating in another clinical study at any time during the study period, in which the subject has been or will be exposed to an investigational or a noninvestigational product. Any chronic drug therapy to be continued during the study period, with the exception of vitamins and/or dietary supplements History of allergic reactions or anaphylaxis to any vaccine. History of any reaction or hypersensitivity likely to be exacerbated by any component of the study vaccines. Severe malnutrition at screening defined as weightforage Zscore &lt; 3 standard deviation. Children will not be enrolled if any maternal, obstetrical or neonatal event that has occurred might, in the judgment of the investigator, result in increased neonatal/infant morbidity.</criteria>
