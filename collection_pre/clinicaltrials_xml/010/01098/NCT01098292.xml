	<brief_summary>The Control Study for the Multidisciplinary Approach to the Study of Chronic Pelvic Pain (MAPP) Research Network has been established to focus on a broader approach to the study of Interstitial Cystitis (IC)/Painful Bladder Syndrome (PBS) in men and women, and Chronic Prostatitis (CP)/Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndrome (CPPS) in men, than previously undertaken. Participants with no Urologic Pelvic Pain Syndromes as well as participants with specific conditions (Fibromyalgia (FM), Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS), Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS)) are being recruited for the Trans-MAPP Control Study. These participants will act as a reference/control group for the Trans-MAPP Epidemiology &amp; Phenotyping (EP) Study. As with many chronic pain disorders, IC and CP are poorly understood, and treatment is often not helpful. The goal of this study is to better understand how pain is felt in people with IC or CP. The MAPP Control Study is an observational study that will enroll participants from 6 Discovery Sites and 3 Satellite Sites across the U.S. The investigators will ask questions and gather information about the health and life of the participants for research purposes. The investigators hope that this study will lead to improvement in the treatment of IC and CP.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Observational Study of Control Participants for the MAPP Research Network</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Trans-MAPP Control participants will only need to complete one study visit to collect baseline data and biospecimens. Potential participants will be scheduled for an eligibility screening session. Following screening, potentially eligible participants will complete a baseline phenotyping session, and biospecimen collections, which together are expected to take approximately 2.5 hours to complete. Participants will be provided with breaks as needed during the clinic visit.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The eligibility criteria for both healthy controls and positive controls are based on the same set of criteria for the Urologic Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndrome (UCPPS) participants in the TransMAPP EP Study, with exception of additional criteria to exclude chronic pelvic pain symptoms and criteria to identify the comorbid syndromes for the positive controls. All entry criteria are shown below; those specific to either healthy or positive control participants are so indicated. Participants are eligible for the TransMAPP Control Protocol if they meet the following general and genderspecific criteria listed below: 1. Participant has signed and dated the appropriate Informed Consent document. 2. Agreed to participate in TransMAPP Control Study procedures; Inclusion Criteria for Healthy Controls only 1. Participant reports a response of "0" (zero) on the pain, pressure or discomfort scale. 2. Participant reports no chronic pain in the pelvic or bladder region, and reports chronic pain in no more than one other body region. 3. Participant reports no urological symptoms that have been evaluated, but are still present. Inclusion Criteria for Positive Controls only: 1. Participant meets the validated criteria for one or more of the following conditions 1. Fibromyalgia (FM) 2. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) 3. Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) Individuals will not be eligible for enrollment in the TransMAPP Control Study if they meet any of the criteria: 1. Participant has an ongoing symptomatic urethral stricture. 2. Participant has an ongoing neurological disease or disorder affecting the bladder or bowel fistula. 3. Participant has a history of cystitis caused by tuberculosis or radiation therapy or Cytoxan/cyclophosphamide therapy. 4. Participant has augmentation cystoplasty or cystectomy. 5. Participant has a systemic autoimmune disorder (such as Crohn's Disease, Ulcerative Colitis, Lupus, Rheumatoid Arthritis, or Multiple Sclerosis). 6. Participant has a history of cancer (with the exception of skin cancer). 7. Participant has current major psychiatric disorder or other psychiatric or medical issues that would interfere with study participation (e.g. dementia, psychosis, upcoming major surgery, etc). 8. Participant has severe cardiac, pulmonary, renal, or hepatic disease that in the judgment of the study physician would preclude participation in this study. Exclusion Criteria for Males Only 1. Male participant diagnosed with unilateral orchialgia, without pelvic symptoms. 2. Male participant has a history of transurethral microwave thermotherapy (TUMT), transurethral needle ablation (TUNA), balloon dilation, or prostate cryosurgery or laser procedure. Exclusion Criteria for Females Only: 1) Female participant has a history of HighGrade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion (HGSIL) / highgrade cervical dysplasia.</criteria>
