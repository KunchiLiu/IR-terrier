	<brief_title>ALK33-101: A Study of RDC-0313 (ALKS 33) in Adults With Binge Eating Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Following screening, eligible subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to RDC-0313 (ALKS 33) or matching placebo. Once-daily at-home dosing will begin at randomization and will continue for 6 weeks. There will be 8 study visits over a 12-week study period. On an ongoing basis, subjects will complete a take-home binge diary designed to record the number of binge-eating episodes (binge episodes) and binge-eating days (binge days, days during which at least 1 binge occurred), as well as snacks and meals consumed daily over each 7-day period.</detailed_description>
