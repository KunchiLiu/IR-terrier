	<criteria>Minimum 18 years of age Cataract for which phacoemulsification extraction and posterior chamber IOL implantation has been planned for both eyes Preoperative best corrected distance visual acuity (BCDVA)of 20/40 or worse (Snellen), with or without glare, for each eye BCDVA projected to be better than 20/30 following cataract removal and IOL implantation for each eye Preoperative keratometric cylinder of 0.75 diopters to 3.62 diopters for each eye (with exception of second eyes with 0.00.75 diopters planned to receive nontoric IOL) Clear intraocular media other than cataract in both eyes Availability, willingness, ability and sufficient cognitive awareness to comply with examination procedures and study visits Signed informed consent and HIPAA authorization Requiring IOLs outside spherical power range of +15.0 to +28.0 diopters Dilated pupil size less than 5.5 mm or the presence of any pupil abnormalities (nonreactive, fixed pupils, or abnormally shaped pupils)in either eye Previous corneal or intraocular surgery in either eye Irregular corneal astigmatism in either eye Corneal pathology/abnormality potentially affecting topography in either eye Corneal abnormalities such as stromal, epithelial or endothelial dystrophies in either eye Inability to achieve keratometric stability in either eye for contact lens wearers Subjects with diagnosed degenerative visual disorders in either eye(eg., macular degeneration or other retinal disorders) that are predicted to cause future acuity losses to a level of 20/30 or worse Subjects with conditions associated with increased risk of zonular rupture, including capsular or zonular abnormalities that may lead to IOL decentration, including pseudoexfoliation, trauma, or posterior capsule defects An eccentric anterior capsulorhexis, zonular damage/rupture or capsular tear/rupture during the cataract extraction procedure Use of systemic or ocular medications that may affect vision Prior, current, or anticipated use during the course of the nine month study of tamsulosin or silodosin (e.g., Flomax, Flomaxtra, Rapaflo)likely to affect dilation or iris structure Poorlycontrolled diabetes Acute, chronic, or uncontrolled systemic disease or illness that would, in the opinion of the investigator, increase the operative risk or confound the outcome(s) of the study (e.g., immunocompromised, connective tissue disease, etc.) Uncontrolled ocular hypertension or glaucomatous changes in the retina or visual field in either eye Known ocular disease or pathology that may affect visual acuity or that may require surgical intervention during the course of the study (macular degeneration, cystoid macular edema, diabetic retinopathy, etc.) Patient is pregnant, plans to become pregnant, is lactating or has another condition associated with the fluctuation of hormones that could lead to refractive changes Concurrent participation or participation during 30 days prior to preoperative visit in any other clinical trial</criteria>
