	<brief_title>Floseal Treatment for Posterior Epistaxis Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Floseal, a hemostatic agent, is an effective treatment for anterior epistaxis as well as numerous other acute bleeding conditions throughout the body. The investigators hypothesize that Floseal is an effective treatment for posterior epistaxis. If so, then this will also lead to significant cost savings in comparison to any other method of treatment of posterior epistaxis. The investigators have planned a prospective, nonblinded, nonrandomised study with a total of 40 subjects with posterior epistaxis to be included in this study.</detailed_description>
