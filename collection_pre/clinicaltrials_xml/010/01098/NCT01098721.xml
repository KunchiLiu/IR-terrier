	<brief_summary>Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder that is characterized by hyperproliferation of the keratinocytes and inflammation of the epidermal and dermal layers of the skin. This study, in patients with mild to moderate plaque psoriasis, is designed to further determine the efficacy, safety and tolerability of the novel, topically applied, non-steroid, anti-inflammatory WBI-1001 cream over a period of 12 weeks.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Safety/Efficacy Study of a Non-steroid, Topical Cream Treatment of Psoriasis Over 12-weeks</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A double-blinded, placebo-controlled study. Following screening, eligible patients will be randomized on Day 0 into one of two treatment groups in a 1:2 ratio: Group 1: placebo (vehicle) cream, twice daily (BID). Group 2: 1.0% WBI-1001 cream, BID. Patients will be randomized to treat all treatable lesion areas except for the face, scalp, groin and genital areas, and will be instructed to apply the cream twice daily for 84 days, at the same time each day, once in the morning and once in the evening. During the study patients will visit the study centre for assessment of efficacy, safety and tolerability at 0, 14, 28, 56 and 84 days after initiation, and patients will be phoned at Day 112 for a follow-up safety assessment. Patients that withdraw from the study before Day 56 due to reasons other than adverse events will be replaced as necessary to ensure that there are at least 16 patients from the placebo and 32 from the active cream treated groups remaining in the study at Day 56.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>A clinical diagnosis of stable plaque psoriasis for at least 6 months representing a maximum of 10% of BSA with a minimum of 1% BSA excluding the face, groin ,scalp and genital regions and with a minimum of one target plaque that is at least 2 x 2 cm in size at Day 0. PGA of 2 to 4 at Day 0. In good general health and free of any disease state or physical condition that might impair the evaluation of plaque psoriasis. Women of child bearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative serum betahuman chorionic gonadotrophin (bhCG) pregnancy test before randomization. WOBCP who are not abstinent from sex with male partners may be entered into the study if they are willing to continue to use adequate contraceptive precautions for the duration of the study. Male patients with female sexual partners who are able to become pregnant must ensure that an acceptable method of birth control is used while they are in the study. Women who are lactating will not be eligible for the study. Willing and able to comply with the protocol and likely to attend all study visits. Provide written, informed consent prior to the initiation of any studyrelated procedures. Spontaneously improving or rapidly deteriorating plaque psoriasis. Any other skin diseases that might interfere with the clinical assessment of plaque psoriasis and/or put the patient at risk. Pustular, erythrodermic or other nonplaque forms pf psoriasis. Guttate psoriasis as the dominant form of psoriasis. Other concomitant, serious illness or medical condition (eg., human immunodeficiency virus, renal insufficiency, clinically significant abnormal laboratory values) that could put the patient at risk during the study. History of neurological/psychiatric disorders, including psychotic disorders or dementia, or any other reason that would interfere with the patient's participation in the trial. Systemic immunomodulatory therapy known to affect psoriasis and decreases immune cell populations (eg., alefacept) within 24 weeks of the baseline visit. Systemic immunomodulatory therapy known to affect psoriasis and that does not typically decrease immune cell populations (eg., etanercept) within 12 weeks prior to the baseline visit. Any phototherapy (including laser for the treatment of psoriasis), photochemotherapy,or systemic psoriasis therapy (such as systemic corticosteroids, methotrexate, retinoids or cyclosporine) within 4 weeks prior to the baseline visit. Prolonged exposure to artificial or natural sources of ultraviolet radiation within 4 weeks prior to the baseline visit or intention to have such exposure during the study, thought by the investigator likely to modify the patient's psoriasis. Topical antipsoriatic therapy (including topical retinoids and vitamin D analogs) on the areas to be treated within 2 weeks prior to the baseline visit. Alcohol abuse during the last 2 years as defined by the consumption of &gt;14 standard drinks of alcohol per week. Use of lithium within 2 weeks prior to the screening visit. Use of beta blockers (eg., propranolol) within 2 weeks prior to the screening visit unless on a stable dose for &gt;3 months. Known or suspected hypersensitivity to any of the constituents of the investigational product. Treatment with an investigational drug within 1 month of Day 0 or current participation in another clinical trial.</criteria>
