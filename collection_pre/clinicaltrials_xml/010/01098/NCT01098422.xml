	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of radioactive microsphere infusion as a treatment for liver metastases from colon or rectal cancer. The investigators hypothesis is that the administration of microspheres between first and second line chemotherapy will increase progression-free survival time by about 2.5 months and may also improve tumor response rates to subsequent second line chemotherapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of Yttrium-90 Radioactive Resin Microspheres to Treat Colorectal Adenocarcinoma Metastatic to the Liver</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a phase II, single-arm study of Yttrium-90 (Y-90) radioactive resin microspheres in the treatment of colorectal adenocarcinoma metastatic to the liver in patients who have had progressive disease through first line combination chemotherapy or have otherwise failed first line chemotherapy due to toxicity. Expected enrollment at University of California, San Diego (UCSD) is approximately 34 subjects. The dose of Yttrium-90 radioactive resin microspheres is calculated based on body surface area (to estimate normal liver volume), percentage of total liver represented by the targeted lobe, and percentage of the lobe that is occupied by tumor, corrected for percentage lung shunt. The prescribed dose, calculated by the nuclear medicine physician, will be delivered by the interventional radiologist using the standard delivery system with frequent fluoroscopic monitoring to assure ante grade blood flow immediately after treatment. Additional current standard practice includes obtaining a nuclear medicine scan of the patient immediately after each therapeutic Yttrium-90 microspheres administration to prove delivery of the agent to the targeted portion of the liver and absence of either extra-hepatic Yttrium-90 delivery or free Yttrium-90. Blood samples will be obtained one week after the first treatment with microspheres. If the patient has bi-lobar disease and the results of lab tests meet protocol specified criteria, the dose will be repeated in the initially-untreated lobe. If the lab tests do not meet protocol specified criteria (i.e. study inclusion/exclusion criteria), the treatment will be deferred for fourteen days and labs repeated. If they are then within parameters, the patient will receive the second dose. If they are not within parameters, the patient will proceed to chemotherapy. Patients will remain off chemotherapy after their final microspheres treatment for a minimum of three weeks. Second line treatment options include FDA approved anti-neoplastic agents used in colorectal cancer metastatic to the liver with the exception of bevacizumab and capecitabine, which has been less rigorously studied with relation to Yttrium-90 radioactive microspheres and therefore will not be used. When patients are found to have progressive disease while receiving second line chemotherapy, they will then undergo a comprehensive clinical, laboratory, and imaging assessment and enter the follow-up phase in which they are assessed every five to seven months until death or withdrawal of consent. A contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) will be performed pre microsphere treatment (within 14 days), post microsphere treatment (2 weeks, 4 weeks, 8 weeks and 12 weeks post the microsphere treatment). If patients require two treatments with microspheres, they will be evaluated 2, 4, 8 and 12 weeks post the second treatment.</detailed_description>
