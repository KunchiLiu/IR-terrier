Subject is indicated for DBS for treating a disorder other than Parkinson's disease. Subject has any medical contraindications to undergoing DBS surgery, (eg, infection, coagulopathy, or significant cardiac or other medical risk factors for surgery). Subject has a history of hemorrhagic stroke. Subject has a history of a neurosurgical ablation procedure. Subject is currently enrolled in or plans to enroll in any concurrent study that may confound the results of this study, as determined by the investigator or Medtronic. Subject has a diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction or cardiac arrest less than or equal to 6 months prior to the screening testing.
