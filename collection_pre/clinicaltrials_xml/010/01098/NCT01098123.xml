	<brief_summary>The aim of this study was to assess the relevance of NRI or athletes' NRI (ANRI) utilization to detect nutrition-related risks of failure in competition in the particular population of rowers. In the morning, 60 to 90 minutes before the first race of a national level multi-races competition (three races for each subjects), body weight were measured and blood samples were collected with subjects at rest and in post-absorptive condition (last meal at least 2.5 hours before blood collection). Body weight was also recorded in the same conditions six weeks before the competition to calculate weight state (actual weight /usual weight Â´ 100) and subjects were asked to identify the date of diet beginning. Body weight was measured using a floor scale (Mettler-Toledo floor scale, France), body mass index (BMI) was calculated from the ratio of weight (in kg) by height squared (in meters) and training volume (total duration of training in a week) was determined after discussion with athletes and coaches.</brief_summary>
