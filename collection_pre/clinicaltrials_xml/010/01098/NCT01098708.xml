	<brief_summary>Many therapeutic trials in DMD exclude non-ambulatory boys and men. Rate of progression in these non-ambulatory patients has been studied but consensus has not been reached for what measures are most reliable and reproducible. Furthermore, any treatment trial would be expected to demonstrate improved function and improvement in quality of life. Therefore, function, strength, and quality of life must be understood and standardized. While the goal of this proposal is to standardize clinical outcomes for therapeutic trials, careful understanding of the progression of DMD in non ambulatory boys may also lead to better medical treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>This is a Study to Get More Information About Non Ambulatory Boys &amp; Men With Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For Non-ambulatory study, boys must be unable to walk without assistive devices for greater than or equal to one year. Age at onset of study for non-ambulatory boys and men: greater than or equal to 7 years through age 22 years. Genetic or biopsy confirmation of dystrophinopathy or clinical diagnosis of DMD with biopsy/genetic confirmation in a primary relative.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. For Nonambulatory study, boys must be unable to walk without assistive devices for greater than or equal to one year. 2. Age at onset of study for nonambulatory boys and men: greater than or equal to 7 years through age 22 years. 3. Genetic or biopsy confirmation of dystrophinopathy or clinical diagnosis of DMD with biopsy/genetic confirmation in a primary relative. 1. For Nonambulatory study, the inability to understand and cooperate with the testing would exclude a subject.</criteria>
