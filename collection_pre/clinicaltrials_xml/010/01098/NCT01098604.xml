	<brief_summary>It has been postulated that use of a larger femoral head could reduce the risk of dislocation after total hip arthroplasty, but only limited clinical data have been presented in third generation alumina bearings. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of femoral head size for total hip arthroplasty using third generation alumina bearings on the joint stability and clinical results. The investigators hypothesized that larger ceramic head group has a similar rate of dislocation and clinical results in smaller ceramic head group.</brief_summary>
