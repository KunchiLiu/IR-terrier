	<brief_title>Drug-Eluting Stent Implantation Versus Optimal Medical Treatment in Patients With Chronic Total Occlusion (DECISION-CTO)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prospective, two arms, randomized multi-center trial in Asian-pacific region. Following angiography, patients with chronic total occlusion (more than 3 months) have documented myocardial ischemia or symptoms of angina, and eligible for stenting without any exclusion criteria will be randomized 1:1 to: a) drug-eluting stent vs. b) optimal medical treatment. All patients will be followed for at least 3 year.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Clinical 1. Patients with angina or silent ischemia and documented ischemia 2. Patients who are eligible for intracoronary stenting 3. Age &gt; 18 years Angiographic 1. De novo lesion CTO 2. Reference vessel size 2.5 mm by visual estimation 3. At least one CTO lesions located in proximal or mid epicardial coronary artery. (If the patient has two CTO lesions, one CTO lesion should be located in proximal or mid epicardial coronary artery) CTO definition: TIMI flow 0 and estimated duration over 3 months The duration of the occlusion was determined by the interval from the last episode of acute coronary syndrome, or In patients without a history of acute coronary syndrome, from the first episode of effort angina consistent with the location of the occlusion 1. Angiographically defined total occlusion over 3 months 2. If no definite symptom with total occlusion, two experienced operators decide CTO in consideration of angiographical morphology (degree of calcification, bridging collaterals, nontapered stump, angiographic filling from collaterals) 1. History of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy 2. Pregnant state 3. Three vessel CTO 4. Known hypersensitivity or contraindication to contrast agent and heparin 5. STelevation acute myocardial infarction requiring primary stenting 6. Characteristics of lesion 1) Left main disease 2) Instent restenosis 3) Graft vessels 4) Distal epicardial coronary artery CTO lesions 7. Hematological disease 8. Hepatic dysfunction, liver enzyme (ALT and AST) elevation 3 times normal 9. Renal dysfunction, creatinine more than 2.0 10. Contraindication to aspirin, clopidogrel or other commercial antiplatelet agent 11. Left ventricular ejection fraction 12. Patients who are actively participating in another drug or device investigational study, which have not completed the primary endpoint followup period. 13. Noncardiac comorbid conditions are present with limited life expectancy or that may result in protocol noncompliance (per site investigator's medical judgment).</criteria>
