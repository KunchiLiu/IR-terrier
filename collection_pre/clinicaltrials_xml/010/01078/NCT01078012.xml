	<detailed_description>The present pilot study focuses on testing the logistics and the methodology of short intervention on a pilot group of GPs and their patients. Due to low recruitment and the pilot study focus on logistics and methodology, the study was changed to not include a control (business as usual) arm. The outcomes were evaluated as "before - after" data and qualitative comments on acceptability and utility of the method. Primary outcomes were changed to be the acceptability and utility (previously listed as secondary outcomes) while secondary outcomes were headache days and medication days (previously listed as primary).</detailed_description>
