	<brief_summary>The purpose of this phase IIa trial is to evaluate the immunogenicity of a single dose of GHB11L1 administered by liquid nasal spray for vaccination against influenza A (H1N1) virus. This study is also performed to assess safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (shedding) of a single dose of GHB11L1 administered by liquid nasal spray.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dose Finding Study of Single Dose GHB11L1 in Healthy Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>GHB11L1 intends to provide a novel vaccination for influenza virus infection. 48 healthy volunteers will be included in this phase IIa study investigating three dose levels. 16 subjects will be randomised at a ratio of 3:1 for GHB11L1 or placebo. Healthy male volunteers, 18-50 years of age and seronegative with respect to the applied virus antigens (antibody titers &lt;1:10 detected) will be randomised. GHB11L1 will be administered once on day 1. Follow-up visits will be performed on days 2, 8 and 29.</detailed_description>
