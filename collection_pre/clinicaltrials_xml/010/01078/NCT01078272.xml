	<brief_summary>This study tests the hypothesis that repeated inflation of a blood pressure cuff on the arm will improve results of coronary stent implantation by: - reducing chest pain and electrocardiogram changes during balloon inflation to place the stent - reducing leakage of heart muscle protein(troponin) into the blood stream after stent placement, indicated reduced damage to heart muscle during stent implantation - increases in molecules in the blood that promote dilation of arteries - reduced evidence of heart muscle damage on MRI immediately after stenting - improved patient outcomes over six months with fewer adverse cardiovascular events(heart attack, acute coronary syndrome,renarrowing of the stented artery, heart failure, death, stroke, transient ischemic attack) - improved heart structure and function at 6 months after stenting</brief_summary>
