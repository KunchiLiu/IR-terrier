	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the safety profile and the maximum dose of Debio 1143 (AT-406) that can be given to humans. This study is also designed to measure how much Debio 1143 (AT-406) gets into the blood stream (pharmacokinetics), and how Debio 1143 (AT-406) interacts with proteins related to cancer that the drug is targeted to affect (pharmacodynamics).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dose Escalation Study of Safety and Tolerability of AT-406 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors and Lymphomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ascenta Therapeutics, Inc. is conducting a clinical trial of the compound Debio 1143 (AT-406), a small molecule second mitochondria-derived activator of caspase C (Smac) mimetic. In vivo and in vitro studies have demonstrated that Debio 1143 (AT-406) induces cell death in several tumor models by inhibiting XIAP (X linked IAP), cIAP-1 (cellular IAP-1) and cIAP-2 (cellular IAP-2), thus releasing initiator and effector caspases to promote apoptosis. This protocol is a Phase I, dose-escalation, open-label, multi-center study conducted in patients with advanced solid tumors and lymphomas to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacology of Debio 1143 (AT-406) in humans when administered orally.</detailed_description>
