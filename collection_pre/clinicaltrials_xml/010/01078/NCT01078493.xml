	<brief_summary>Wrinkles result from imperfect repair of the dermal layer resulting in loss of collagen commonly due to ageing, smoking and sun exposure. Platelet rich plasma (PRP) contains a host of growth factors, which have been used in other clinical trials for various medical conditions such as tendonitis, and also in surgery such as the surgical repair of facial defects. Results from these clinical trials suggest that PRP helps in collagen formation and organisation to promote healing of tissues. This study attempts to document the clinical effects of intradermal injection of PRP on wrinkles.</brief_summary>
