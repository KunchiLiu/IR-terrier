	<brief_summary>Some studies indicated that the diabetic corneal endothelium is morphologically abnormal and may be at risk in any intraocular surgical procedure, while others showed no significant differences between diabetic and non-diabetic corneal endothelium.The purpose of this study is to investigate the differences in corneal endothelial cell density and morphology in diabetic patients and normal patients after phacoemulsification with intraocular lens implantation.To investigate if haemoglobin A1c can be used as a predictor of corneal endothelial cell changes after phacoemulsification.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Some studies indicated that the diabetic corneal endothelium is morphologically abnormal and may be at risk in any intraocular surgical procedure, while others showed no significant differences between diabetic and non-diabetic corneal endothelium.The purpose of this study is to investigate the differences in corneal endothelial cell density and morphology in diabetic patients and normal patients after phacoemulsification with intraocular lens implantation.To investigate if haemoglobin A1c can be used as a predictor of corneal endothelial cell changes after phacoemulsification. Specular microscopy photos will be taken pre-. and 3 month postoperatively. Cellular parameters will be compared between the two groups prior and post surgery. Clinical significant difference is defined as 1 SD (300 cell/mm2)</detailed_description>
