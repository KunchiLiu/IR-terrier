	<brief_summary>Transvaginal hybrid procedures are of interest as an available NOTES procedure for the clinical routine. The gynaecologists` experiences and the available studies report on low morbidity related to the transvaginal access. However, little is known about the vaginal and intraabdominal microbial contamination due to the transvaginal approach. The aim of this cohort study is to evaluate the microbial colonisation and contamination in patients with transvaginal hybrid and conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Therefore, pre- and intraoperative microbiological evaluations will be performed in patients with transvaginal hybrid cholecystectomy and laparoscopic cholecystectomy.</brief_summary>
