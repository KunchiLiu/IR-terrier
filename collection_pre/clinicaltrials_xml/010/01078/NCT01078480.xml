	<brief_summary>This study will compare non-operative treatment of displaced midshaft collarbone fractures with operative treatment using a precontoured titanium plate and screws. The study hypothesis is that operation will provide better pain relief, faster return to activities, better function of the involved upper limb, and lower the risk of a non healing fracture (non union).</brief_summary>
