	<brief_summary>Despite extensive reports of the benefits of statins in reducing serious cardiovascular events such as stroke and heart disease in patients with elevated LDL-cholesterol, patients do not take their medicines regularly as prescribed. Reasons include forgetfulness, lack of understanding of the seriousness of the disease, and fear of side effects. An intervention strategy comprising 3-5 minutes of counseling, emotional support and cost-sharing may be motivational and improve adherence to treatment.</brief_summary>
