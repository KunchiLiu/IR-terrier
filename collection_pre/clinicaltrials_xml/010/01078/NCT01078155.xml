	<brief_summary>This post marketing observational study will be conducted in a prospective, single country, multicenter format to assess the prevention of generalized bone loss in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treated with adalimumab (Humira®) in pragmatic prescribing situations. The investigational sites will be centers with experience in the treatment of RA patients and anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a) therapy. The investigators will be rheumatologists authorized by the Czech Rheumatologic Society for prescribing biological treatment.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients with active early and longstanding RA according to American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 1987 revised criteria. Patients with high disease activity DAS28 ≥ 5.1 according to the Czech Rheumatological Society criteria. Patients must fulfill national guidelines for use of antiTNF: inadequate clinical response to at least one diseasemodifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD; methotrexate, sulphasalazine, leflunomide, hydroxychloroquine, or combinations) and oral glucocorticoids (equivalent to ≥ 5 mg prednisolone per day), (for Romania except glucocorticoids); chest Xray, purified protein derivative (PPD)skin test, Quantiferon/tuberculosis (TB) Gold test (if available) negative for TB. Patients who have had a history of TNF blocking or rituximab therapy. Patients who are being treated or will be treated with drug at risk of interaction with adalimumab (Humira). Pregnant females and/or females without adequate method of contraception. Patients who didn't receive prior DMARD therapy. Patients participating in another study or clinical trial. Patients with severe osteoporosis (Tscore [number that indicates whether or not bone loss has occurred] of ≤ 2.5 and/or prior vertebral fracture/s). Patients with a history of total hip replacement of both extremities. Patients who currently receive and/or received bone metabolism modulating agents including Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators (SERMs), bisphosphonates, parathyroid hormone or antireceptor activator of nuclear factorkappaB ligand (RANKL) therapy. Subjects who are not eligible for TNFblocking therapy according to the Czech National Registry (ATTRA).</criteria>
