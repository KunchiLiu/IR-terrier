	<brief_summary>Fifty patients will get probiotics (109 bacteria [L. acidophilus, B. bifidum, S. thermophilus, L. rhamnosus, L. casei] in 2 capsules) and half will get placebo (2 capsules that look the same like the probiotic capsules and will contain microcrystalline cellulose, artificial brown color, magnesium strearate, and silica dioxide). The patients and the staff will be blinded to the identity of the study medications. Each patient and volunteer will get the study medication for 6 weeks and will be evaluated twice - before enrollment and after 6 weeks of treatment. Routine clinical management will continue - with regular treatment as needed. Each individual will be studied for changes in biochemical inflammatory and immunological markers and changes in flow medicated diameter that will be measured by the brachial artery method (that is evaluating endothelial function). Every patient will be evaluated for his/her ability to produce endothelial progenitor stem cells (EPCs).</brief_summary>
