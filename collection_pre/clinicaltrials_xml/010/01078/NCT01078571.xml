Among the tumor necrosis factor antagonists safety studies, adalimumab safety has been the less investigated in the common clinical practice because of, as a result of its recent marketing, it was not included in the BIOBADASER (Data Base for Biological Products in Spain, Rheumatology Spanish Society), Biologic Products Database of the Spanish Society of Rheumatology ) in which was determined an association between infliximab therapy and the risk of developing active tuberculosis. To ensure the maintaining of the strict common physician practice (no prescription induction), and following the recommendations of the SER (Sociedad Española de Reumatología, Spanish Society of Rheumatology) consensus documents, it will be selected only those patients that were already in treatment with adalimumab (HUMIRA),(except patients involved in clinical studies with Adalimumab), and had shown good response, or those that fulfilled treatment indication in accordance with the SER recommendations and following the Summary of Products Characteristics of adalimumab (HUMIRA).</brief_summary>
