	<brief_summary>Pomalidomide is a newly discovered drug that may stop cancer cells from growing abnormally. Pomalidomide may also stimulate the immune system to fight the cancer cells and possibly improve the effectiveness of dexamethasone and rituximab to fight the Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia (WM) cancer cells. This drug have been used in multiple myeloma and information from these other research studies suggests that Pomalidomide may help to reduce or prevent the growth of cancer cells.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pomalidomide, Dexamethasone and Rituximab in Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Participants will be given a study drug-dosing calendar for each treatment cycle. Each treatment cycle lasts 28 days during which time participants will take Pomalidomide orally once a day. Dexamethasone and rituximab will be administered intravenously on weeks 1, 2, 3, 4 and on weeks 12, 13, 14, 15. - Since we are looking for the highest dose of Pomalidomide in combination with dexamethasone and rituximab which can be administered safely without severe or unmanageable side effects, not everyone who participates will receive the same dose of the study drug. The dose participants will get will depend on the number of participants who have been enrolled in the study and how well they have tolerated their doses. - As long as there is no evidence that the participant's Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia has progressed, they can continue to receive Pomalidomide for up to 52 weeks. Participants will be asked to return to the clinic for follow-up tests at least every three months for four years.</detailed_description>
