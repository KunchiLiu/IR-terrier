	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of memantine and buprenorphine on opioid abusing behavior, to determine the effect of memantine and buprenorphine on early relapse and to evaluate the tolerability of memantine co-administrated with buprenorphine. The study seeks to determine if combined treatment of memantine and buprenorphine may provide shorter-term treatment for opioid dependence.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Memantine-enhanced Buprenorphine Treatment for Opioid-dependent Young Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Opiate dependence is an increasing problem among young adults (18-25 years old) whose rates of current use of illicit drugs are generally high (19.7 %)according to data from the 2007 National Survey on Drug Use &amp; Health (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration 2008). Young adults start using heroin around this age range, and more recently have had increasing rates of prescription-type drug use. Given that young adults with opiate dependence who are seeking treatment are relatively treatment na√Øve, have a shorter period of addiction, and are more likely to choose buprenorphine over methadone, developing short-term buprenorphine treatment alternatives to long-term methadone agonist treatment is needed.</detailed_description>
