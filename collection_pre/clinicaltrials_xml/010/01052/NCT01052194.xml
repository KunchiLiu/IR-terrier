	<brief_summary>This study is designed to evaluate safety and assess initial efficacy of VX-509, a JAK3 inhibitor, for treatment of subjects with active RA. This study will assess the clinical response of 4 doses of VX-509 compared to placebo when administered for 12 weeks to patients with active RA. The study will also evaluate the safety and tolerability of VX-509 compared to placebo when administered for 12 weeks to subjects with active RA.</brief_summary>

History or evidence of a clinically significant disorder other than RA (including but not limited to cardiopulmonary, oncologic, renal, metabolic, hematologic or psychiatric disorders), condition or disease that, in the opinion of the investigator and medical monitor, would pose a risk to subject safety or interfere with the study evaluation, procedures, or completion. Subjects with clinically important abnormalities in screening physical examination or in screening laboratory test results (including the presence of either hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C virus antibody, or HIV types 1 Subjects with elevation in alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase above the upper limit of normal. History of hematologic disorders including neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. Subjects with an acute or chronic active infection requiring systemic antimicrobial treatment, or subjects who are at high risk of developing an infection due to a compromised immune system. Antifungals for onychomycosis or lowdose antibiotics for rosacea, that are not inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A, will be allowed. Subjects who require concomitant use of any inhibitors or inducers of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A.
