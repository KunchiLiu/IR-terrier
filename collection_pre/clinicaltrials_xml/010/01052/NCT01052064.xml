	<brief_title>Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation in Children With Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). A Safety Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder is a common disorder in the infancy; the majority of ADHD have good clinical response to amphetamines alone or in association with antiepileptic drugs. It is described that some patients(10-30%) with ADHD do not respond to conventional pharmacological and psycho- pedagogical treatment; in those patients non invasive brain stimulation methods could be a supplementary option for symptomatic control. There are not many published papers describing the effects of rTMS in persons younger than 18 years; so the first step to extent its use in pediatric population should be to obtain evidences about its tolerance and safety.</detailed_description>
