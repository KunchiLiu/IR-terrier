It can be used for conscious sedation during awake nasotracheal fiberoptic intubation. Target-controlled infusion is more reliable technique for maintaining optimal infusion rate than manual controlled infusion. The aim of this study is to determine the effect site concentration of remifentanil for successful conscious sedation during awake nasotracheal fiberoptic intubation.</brief_summary>
