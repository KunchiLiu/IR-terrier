	<brief_summary>There are evidence that there is an association between insulin resistance and prolonged hyperinsulinemia or hyperglycemia in Type 2 diabetic patients. This will trigger oxidative stress system via reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lead to a high level of Nitric oxide. This can contribute to a significant change in blood vessel and could end up with the complications from cardiovascular disease and increased mortality rate of type 2 diabetic patients. The purpose of the present study was to examine the effectiveness of the curcumin in type 2 diabetic patients on the reduction of atherosclerosis events by examining pulse-wave velocity (PWV) and plasma high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP) test and on blood sugar lowering, glycosylated hemoglobin (HBA1c), lipid profile, and insulin resistance.</brief_summary>
