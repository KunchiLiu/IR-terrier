	<brief_summary>Emphasizing the growing popularity of motion metrics are the majority of available virtual reality simulators and some newer hybrid models that offer motion tracking for performance assessment. A popular hybrid model (PROMIS) allows training with regular laparoscopic instruments in a box-trainer while automatically recording task duration and movement efficiency (pathlength and smoothness) that are immediately offered as feedback to trainees. Despite the increasing availability of simulators that track motion, our knowledge of the impact those metrics have on trainee learning is severely limited. We do not know if it is more important to use speed, accuracy, motion efficiency or a combination thereof for performance assessment and how these metrics impact skill transfer to the OR. Based on sound educational principles we have developed a proficiency-based laparoscopic suturing simulator curriculum. This curriculum focuses on deliberate and distributed practice, provides trainees with augmented feedback and sets expert-derived performance goals based on time and errors. We have previously demonstrated that this curriculum leads to improved operative performance of trainees compared to controls. To measure operative performance and determine transferability, we will use a live porcine Nissen fundoplication model. Instead of placing actual patients at risk, the porcine model is preferable for this purpose as it offers objective metrics (targets are established, distances measured, knots are disrupted for slippage scoring), complete standardization, and allows multiple individuals to be tested on the same day. We hypothesize that proficiency-based simulator training in laparoscopic suturing to expert-derived levels of speed and motion will result in better operative performance compared to participants training to levels of speed or motion alone. The study is powered to detect an at least 10% performance difference between the groups. Specific Aims 1. Compare whether any performance differences between the groups persist long-term 2. Assess whether the groups demonstrate differences in safety in the operating room by comparing the inadvertent injuries in the animal OR between the groups 3. Identify the training duration required by novices to reach proficiency in laparoscopic suturing based on speed, motion efficiency, or a combination of these metrics 4. Identify any baseline participant characteristics that may predict individual metric-specific performance</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVE:: We hypothesized that training to expert-derived levels of speed and motion will lead to improved learning and will translate to better operating room (OR) performance of novices than training to goals of speed or motion alone. BACKGROUND:: Motion tracking has been suggested to be a more sensitive performance metric than time and errors for the assessment of surgical performance. METHODS:: An institutional review board-approved, single blinded, randomized controlled trial was conducted at our level-I American College of Surgeons accredited Education Institute. Forty-two novices trained to proficiency in laparoscopic suturing after being randomized into 3 groups: The speed group (n = 14) had to achieve expert levels of speed, the motion group (n = 15) expert levels of motion (path length and smoothness), and the speed and motion group (n = 13) both levels. To achieve proficiency, all groups also had to demonstrate error-free performance. The FLS suture module (task 5) was used for training inside the ProMIS simulator that tracks instrument motion. All groups participated in transfer and retention tests in the OR. OR performance was assessed by a blinded expert rater using Global Operative Assessment of Laparoscopic Skills, speed, accuracy, and inadvertent injuries.</detailed_description>
