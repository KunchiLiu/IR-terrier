	<brief_summary>Previous studies of finasteride treatment in women with hair loss have failed to show positive results, yet, some women have responded anecdotally. Given that polymorphisms of the androgen receptor gene which confer androgen sensitivity impact male response to finasteride therapy, it was hypothesized that the same polymorphism in women may identify the group that will respond. This study is designed to test the impact of finasteride therapy on hair loss in postmenopausal women.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Association of Polymorphisms in the Androgen Receptor Gene and Finasteride Response in Women With Androgenetic Alopecia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Androgen sensitivity in the cell is determined by the number of Cytosine-Adenine-Guanine repeats in the Androgen Receptor gene. Lower CAG repeats have been associated in previous studies with androgenic conditions such as acne, hirsutism and hair loss in men and women. Keeping this in mind, we tested women with hair loss in the frontal or vertex area, for their AR genotype. Patients were randomized to placebo or 1 mg finasteride therapy for 6 months. Global photographs and 2 tatooed areas of 1cm2 each were measured monthly to assess global appearance and hair counts for medication impact.</detailed_description>
