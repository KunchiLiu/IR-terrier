	<brief_summary>This is a research study testing SABER™-Bupivacaine (an experimental pain-relieving medication). SABER™-Bupivacaine is designed to continuously deliver bupivacaine, a common local anesthetic, for a few days in order to treat local post-surgical pain. The purpose of this study is to investigate safety (side effects) associated with the use of SABER™-Bupivacaine and how well it works in reducing pain and opioid-related side effects following various kinds of abdominal surgeries.</brief_summary>
