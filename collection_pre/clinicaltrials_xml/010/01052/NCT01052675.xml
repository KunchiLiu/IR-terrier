	<brief_summary>In France, the Afssaps is the body in charge of the evaluation of pharmacodependance. In order to fulfil its mission, the Afssaps has created a network of 11 Centres for Evaluation and Information on Pharmacodependance (CEIP), coordinated by the Drugs and Psychotropics Unit. Pharmacodependence notifications issued by professionals are collected by each Centre which evaluates them. Nantes' CEIP created an original tool to harmonize case reporting and make it possible to homogeneously evaluate the seriousness of pharmacodependence cases as each CEIP had his own way of analysing his cases. The aim of this study is to assess this tool.</brief_summary>
