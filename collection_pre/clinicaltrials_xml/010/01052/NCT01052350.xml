	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to use a brain imaging method called PIB PET to determine dementia subtypes in patients with Parkinson's disease. The ultimate goal of this project is to be able to identify individuals with PD who are at risk of developing dementia, and to distinguish the underlying cause of dementia. We will be including both PD and normal subjects in this study. This a long term study and we are considering including a total of 320 participants in this protocol.</detailed_description>
