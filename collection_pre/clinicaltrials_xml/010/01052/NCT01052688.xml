	<brief_summary>To collect samples for the purpose of developing and optimizing an in vitro noninvasive prenatal diagnostic (NIPD) test. The NIPD test employs circulating cell free (ccff) DNA extracted from whole blood samples collected from women who are pregnant with a fetus previously determined to have a chromosomal abnormality. The NIPD result will be compared to the standard test results obtained from other test methods such as karyotype, FISH, QF-PCR, and/or any commercially available NIPD test.</brief_summary>
