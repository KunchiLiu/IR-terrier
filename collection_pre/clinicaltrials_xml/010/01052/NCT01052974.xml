	<brief_summary>Therapeutic essay of phase IV, monocentric, prospective, randomized, in double-blind during 48 hours(then simple-blind),controlled by placebo. Abstract: The increasing incidence of the number of femoral neck fractures and the poor prognosis of this traumatological pathology involves an optimization of the diagnostic, therapeutic and analgesic care. A widespread collectively practice for the analgesia in prehospital or preoperative period is the single injection ("single shot") of local anesthetic with the technique of the femoral or iliofascial block. Nevertheless the single injection of a dose of local anesthetic associated or not with analgesic adjuvants, due to their pharmacological properties, can't prolong the efficiency of the loco-regional analgesia more than 12 hours. The aim of our study is to evaluate, in the patients admitted in emergencies for suspicion of femoral neck fractures, the perioperative efficiency of an analgesic treatment using a femoral perineural catheter (inserted from the hospital admission) with continuous infusion of ropivaca√Øne controlled by placebo (physiological serum).</brief_summary>
