Such treatment includes, but is not limited to, systemic or high dose inhaled corticosteroids, radiation treatment or other immunosuppressive or cytotoxic drugs. History of severe allergic reactions or anaphylaxis Rash, dermatological condition or tattoos which may interfere with injection site reaction rating Subjects who have received a blood transfusion or immunoglobulins within 90 days prior to study entry Subjects who have received any live vaccine within 4 weeks or inactivated vaccine within 2 weeks prior to vaccination in this study Functional or surgical asplenia Subjects with a known or suspected problem with alcohol or drug abuse Subjects who were administered an investigational drug within six weeks prior to study entry or are concurrently participating in a clinical study that includes the administration of an investigational product Dependent relationship with the study site personnel.
