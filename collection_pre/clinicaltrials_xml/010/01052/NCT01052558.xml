	<brief_title>GTS400 Stent Implantation in Conjunction With Cataract Surgery in Subjects With Open-angle Glaucoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Glaucoma is a collection of disorders characterized by progressive loss of visual field due to optic nerve damage. It is a leading cause of blindness in the United States, affecting 1-2% of individuals aged 60 and over. Management of glaucoma requires chronic, life-long treatment with a spectrum of therapeutic options including medications, laser treatment and surgical implants. The common goal among the various therapies is to lower intraocular pressure to target levels in order to prevent loss of visual fields from excessive pressure on the optic nerve.</detailed_description>
