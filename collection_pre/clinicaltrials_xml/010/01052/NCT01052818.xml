	<brief_title>Therapeutic and Prognostic Impact of Circulating Tumor Cells in Peripheral Blood in Patients With Non Small-cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In spite of technological advantages in diagnosis and treatment, lung cancer remains one of the most deadly malignant neoplasias. Moreover, there are no markers for monitoring response to treatment. The objective of the study is to associate the number of circulating tumor cells (CTC) before and after treatment and correlate it with tumor response rate, progression-free survival and overall survival.</detailed_description>
