	<brief_summary>Chorionic gonadotrophins (hCG) play an important role in implantation. The aim of the study is to evaluate the effect of intrauterine injection of hCG before embryo transfer in IVF/ICSI on the implantation and pregnancy rates. The rational is that intrauterine hCG injection will attract regulatory T cells and improve implantation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intra-uterine Injection of Human Chorionic Gonadotrophin (hCG) Before Embryo Transfer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Human chorionic gonadotrophin ( hCG) was found to secreted immediately after fertilization by the embryo. It plays an important role in implantation and in attracting regulatory T cells to the endometrium. Rational : Intrauterine injection of hCG before embryo transfer in IVF/ICSI may increase endometrial regulatory T cells ( Treg ) and improve the implantation and pregnancy rates. Aim of the work : To study the effect of intrauterine injection of hCG before embryo transfer on the implantation and pregnancy rates after IVF/ICSI. Subjects : Infertile patients undergoing ICSI. Inclusion criteria : - Female age less than 40 years - Male factor infertility - Normal female hormonal profile and uterine cavity Exclusion criteria : - Previous ICSI failure - Azoospermia - Endometriosis Study group: Intrauterine injection of 100 iu of hCG (group 1)or 200 iu of hCG ( group 2) will be done during the dummy embryo transfer which is done 10-15 minutes before the actual embryo transfer. Control group: The embryo transfer will be done without prior intrauterine injection of hCG Main outcome measures : Implantation and pregnancy rates Secondary outcome measures : miscarriage and delivery rates</detailed_description>
