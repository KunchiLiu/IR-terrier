	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the blood pressure lowering efficacy of a treatment regimen based on a dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker combined with an angiotensin II type-1 receptor blocker with the recommended treatment regimen based on a low-dose thiazide diuretic combined with a beta-blocker.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Primary objective: Sitting systolic blood pressure (average of three readings) will be the primary outcome variable. Secondary 1. To compare the time interval between the two treatment groups, which after randomisation will be required, to reach and maintain the target defined as a blood pressure below 140 mm Hg systolic and 90 mm Hg diastolic; 2. To compare the duration of follow-up, during which a steady blood pressure control will be achieved; 3. To evaluate the incidence of adverse events, symptoms, biochemical abnormalities and ECG changes in the two treatment groups; 4. To assess the adherence to antihypertensive treatment as well as the rate of drop-outs in both treatment arms during a six-month period.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Women or men within an age range from 30 to 69 years with uncomplicated hypertension. Blood pressure measured in the sitting position after at least 5 minutes rest (average of three readings at the last runinvisit) should range from 140 to 179 mm Hg systolic or from 90 to 109 mm Hg diastolic (grades 1 or 2 of hypertension). Patients must have uncomplicated hypertension with a maximum of two additional risk factors, as defined in the 2007 guidelines of the European Societies of Hypertension and Cardiology. Systolic blood pressure in the upright position must be at least 110 mm Hg (mean of three readings obtained immediately after the patient has assumed a standing position). Patients who have never been treated for hypertension or in whom previous antihypertensive drug treatment has been discontinued for at least four weeks before the last runin visit can be randomised. If two weeks after discontinuation of previous antihypertensive treatment the blood pressure is higher than 160 mm Hg systolic or higher than 100 mm Hg diastolic and if the patient has complaints, the patient can be randomised immediately to active blood pressure lowering treatment with either the newer or older antihypertensive drugs. The patient must provide informed written consent. Premenopausal women not applying anticonception. A history of cardiovascular disease. Secondary hypertension. Electrocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy. More than two cardiovascular risk factors in addition to hypertension. Diabetes mellitus. Renal dysfunction. Recent treatment with two or more antihypertensive drugs or a contraindication to discontinue blood pressure lowering agents for 4 weeks. Severe noncardiovascular disease. Known contra indications for the firstline study medications.</criteria>
