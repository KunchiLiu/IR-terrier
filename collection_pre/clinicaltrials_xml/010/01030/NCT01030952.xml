	<brief_summary>A 3-week, multi-center, open-label, randomized, active-control, parallel-group study to compare effects of Nateglinide and Acarbose on postprandial glucose fluctuation in Chinese drug-naive patients type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In this study, participants in different groups took Nateglinide at a dose of 120 mg orally three times daily for up to 3 weeks or Acarbose at a dose of 50 mg three times daily for up to 3 weeks, respectively.</brief_summary>
