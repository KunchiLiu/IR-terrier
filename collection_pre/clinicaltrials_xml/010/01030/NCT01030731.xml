	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to characterize the pharmacokinetics (how drugs are absorbed in the body, how they are distributed within the body and how they are removed from the body over time) of ceftobiprole after a single 250-mg intravenous (IV) infusion (given directly into the vein) for 2 hours, before and after dialysis to patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring hemodialysis or healthy volunteers.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to characterize the pharmacokinetics (how drugs are absorbed in the body, how they are distributed within the body and how they are removed from the body over time) of ceftobiprole after a single 250-mg intravenous (IV) infusion (given directly into the vein) for 2 hours, before and after dialysis to patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring hemodialysis or healthy volunteers. This is a Phase 1, open label study (all patients involved know the identity of the drug). Healthy volunteers will be given a single 2-hour infusion of 250 mg ceftobiprole; patients with ESRD on hemodialysis will be given a 2-hour infusion of 250 mg ceftobiprole 3 hours either before dialysis or immediately after dialysis. Plasma and urine samples will be assayed for ceftobiprole. Samples will be collected over a 48 hour period of time. Safety evaluations will include monitoring of adverse events, clinical laboratory tests (hematology and serum chemistry in all patients/volunteers, and urinalysis in healthy volunteers subjects), pregnancy testing, vital signs, physical examination, and recording of concomitant medications. Healthy volunteers will be given a single 2-hour infusion of 250 mg ceftobiprole; patients with ESRD on hemodialysis will be given a 2-hour infusion of 250 mg ceftobiprole 3 hours either before dialysis or immediately after dialysis.</detailed_description>
