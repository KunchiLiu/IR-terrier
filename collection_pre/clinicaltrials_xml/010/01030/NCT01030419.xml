	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to test the effectiveness of a DVD-delivered, home-based, six-month physical activity intervention for older adults. A comparative effectiveness study of the FlexToBa DVD exercise program will be conducted in 2014.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Activity, Gait, and Efficacy (AGE II): Functional Limitations and Quality of Life</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This program compares progressive strength, flexibility, toning and balance (FlexToBa) activities delivered via home-based DVD intervention compared to an attention control group to determine the program's effects on functional limitations, functional performance in everyday activities, balance, and quality of life (QOL) in sedentary older adults over 65 years of age. The principals of REAIM (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance) will be implemented into the design and evaluation of the program in order to determine the generalizable cost-effectiveness and potential public health impact of delivering physical activity to older adults via DVD media. Measurements assessed at baseline, six months, and 12 months include: functional performance and functional limitations, self-efficacy, physical activity, and measures of health status and well-being. We propose to recruit and randomly assign 250 older (65+) adults from across Central Illinois to the FlexToBa condition or to an attention control condition. The former will receive the activity program DVD and the latter will receive a healthy aging DVD (with no physical activity instruction). The control group will be offered the FlexToBa program following 6-month follow-up assessments. The health relevance of this project is considerable as it targets a population that is largely sedentary and suffers from unprecedented levels of functional limitations, factors that have significant implications for compromised quality of life and independent living. By adopting broad recruitment strategies with few exclusionary criteria, we will be able to effectively improve the physical activity behavior of a diverse class of older adults. Offering this as a DVD-based physical activity program will provide a convenient opportunity for older adults to become and stay physically active. We intend to provide a limited number of DVD players to those interested participants who do not already own one. In 2014, investigators will study the comparative effectiveness of the FlexToBa DVD trial as compared to a DVD-only intervention.Researchers will provide the exercise DVD to an entire wave/group of participants with half receiving the motivational telephone calls and feedback (as with earlier waves) and the other half receiving no motivational communications. The procedures for the Support Group, who receive the motivational support, will be identical to earlier waves. Both groups will receive the FlexToBa DVDs and equipment at the initial testing and orientation meeting but the Effectiveness Group will not receive the motivational feedback. Testing at month six is identical to earlier waves and both groups will be asked to evaluate the program at the end of the intervention. There is no plan for follow-up testing at month 12 or month 24 for this wave of participants.</detailed_description>
