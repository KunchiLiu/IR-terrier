	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Subjects must be at least 18 years of age or older Written informed consent and HIPAA authorization Subjects must have histologicallyconfirmed Bcell CLL, including SLL, DLBCL, MCL, or FL. Bcell NHL (DLBCL, FL, MCL): Have previous confirmation of Bcell NHL Subjects with DLBCL or MCL, must have relapsed or refractory disease after at least one prior regimen containing rituximab, either alone or in combination, and be ineligible for any available standard line of therapy known to be lifeprolonging or lifesaving. Subjects with FL, must have relapsed or refractory disease after at least two prior regimens, one of which included rituximab, either alone or in combination, and be ineligible for any available standard line of therapy known to be lifeprolonging or lifesaving. Have measurable disease (at least one lesion ≥ 20 mm in one dimension or ≥ 15 mm in two dimensions as measured by conventional or high resolution [spiral] computed tomography (CT) Not be a candidate for a hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) or bone marrow (BM) transplant Bcell CLL: Have previous confirmation of Bcell CLL with a characteristic immunophenotype by flow cytometry Have relapsed or refractory disease after at least 2 prior lines of treatment, at least 1 of which must have contained rituximab and be ineligible for any available standard line of therapy known to be lifeprolonging or lifesaving Not be a candidate for an HSC or BM transplant Have symptomatic disease that requires treatment Karnofsky Performance Status ≥ 70 Life expectancy of ≥ 12 weeks Toxicities from previous cancer therapies must have recovered to Grade &lt; 2. Adequate hematological function defined as: Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1500/mm3 Platelet count ≥ 75,000/mm3 ((except for CLL subjects with evidence of bone marrow disease, who must have a platelet count ≥ 50,000/mm3) Adequate organ function defined as follows: AST and ALT ≤ 2 × institutional ULN, except in the case of liver involvement ≤ 5 × ULN Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × ULN, except in the case of subjects with documented Gilbert's disease ≤ 2.5 × ULN Creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min as determined by the CockcroftGault equation or by 24hour urine collection for determination of creatinine clearance PTINR/ PTT ≤ 1.5 × ULN, or for patients on anticoagulation therapy, status within therapeutic range Women of nonchildbearing potential or using effective contraception Male subjects with partners of childbearing potential must be surgically sterile or use a contraceptive method For the expansion phase only, subjects with DLBCL, FL, and MCL only, disease must be evaluable by the International Working Group criteria (Cheson et al, 2007). Exclusion Criteria Any of the following excludes the subject from participation in the study: Any available standard line of therapy known to be lifeprolonging or lifesaving Any concurrent chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy, biologic, or hormonal therapy for treatment of cancer For CLL patients only,rapidly progressive disease that in the estimation of the investigator and sponsor would compromise ability to complete study therapy History of allergy or reaction to any component of the CAT8015 formulation Receipt of any chemotherapy or small molecule targeted therapy regimens within 6 weeks Receipt of any biological or immunologicalbased therapies for leukemia or lymphoma within 6 weeks Prior radiation therapy will not be excluded, providing the volume of bone marrow treated is less than 25%. Any history of prior pseudomonasexotoxin (PE) immunotoxin administration including CAT8015, CAT3888, or LMB2 (antiCD25 immunotoxin) History of other invasive malignancy within 5 years, with some exceptions Evidence of significant active infection requiring antimicrobial, antifungal, antiparasitic or antiviral therapy or for which other supportive care is given Autologous stem cell transplantation within 6 months prior to study entry Allogenic stem cell transplantation or any other organ transplant HIVpositive or AIDS Hepatitis B or hepatitis C infection as defined by seropositive for hepatitis B (HBsAg) or hepatitis C and elevated liver transaminases Use of immunosuppressive medication other than steroids within 7 days Use of systemic steroids within 7 days before the first dose of CAT8015 (inhaled and topical corticosteroids are permitted). Subjects may take replacement doses of steroids (defined as ≤ 30 mg/day hydrocortisone or the equivalent) if on a stable dose for at least 2 weeks prior to the first dose of CAT8015. Documented current central nervous system involvement by leukemia or lymphoma Pregnancy or lactation Other severe, concurrent diseases Concurrent enrollment in another clinical study</criteria>
