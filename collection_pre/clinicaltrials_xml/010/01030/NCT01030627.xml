	<brief_summary>This pilot study will document the efficacy and acceptability of administration of magnesium sulfate with the Springfusor pump for patients and staff at two sites where treatment or preeclampsia with magnesium sulfate is limited or not available. Currently, both sites refer patients to tertiary care facilities for further treatment.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Women diagnosed with preeclampsia that the clinic care team deem would benefit from treatment with magnesium sulfate will be given the option of participating in the study. Those who choose to take part in the study and meet study inclusion and exclusion criteria will receive full information about the study and be required to give their written or signed informed consent. Women agreeing to participate in the study will receive a loading dose and maintenance therapy using an IV infusion administered by the Springfusor® pump. Women will receive a 8 mL loading dose containing 4g magnesium sulfate heptahydrate (MgSO4*7H2O) 50% solution, which is approximately 2 mmoL magnesium/mL. The loading dose of 8mL with 4 g MgSO4 will be administered using the Springfusor® pump. The administration of the loading dose will be immediately followed by a maintenance infusion. The maintenance dose of 4 g (8 cc, 50% MgSO4) will be administered with the Springfusor® pump continuously over four hours. Clinical monitoring will occur once every hour during the treatment period. Clinical monitoring will occur throughout the treatment, with reflexes, urine output and respiration to be checked at least every hour (or, if more frequent, as per standard practice at the study site). The pump will be checked at each monitoring visit. Prior to discharge from the study, patients will be asked to assess their opinions about the acceptability and ease of use of the mode of administration. All requests or inquiries about termination of treatment will be recorded.</detailed_description>
