	<brief_title>Classification of Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with HFpEF are a heterogeneous group with varying etiology and pathophysiology, which may play a large role in the difficulty in managing these patients and enrolling them in clinical trials. A major advance in the care of patients with HFpEF would be a classification system based on etiology, pathophysiology, and/or genetic factors as well as machine learning analyses. The ultimate goal of this study is to demonstrate that it is possible to better classify patients with HFpEF based on etiologic, pathophysiologic, and genetic differences between patients. If successful, this study could lead to: (1) novel risk estimation in patients with HFpEF and (2) more fruitful clinical trials based on targeting specific subsets of HFpEF.</detailed_description>
