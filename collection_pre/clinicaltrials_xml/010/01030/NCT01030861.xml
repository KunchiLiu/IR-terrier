	<brief_summary>The study will determine whether the anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody, teplizumab, can help to prevent or delay the onset of type 1 diabetes (T1D) in relatives determined to be at very high risk for developing the disease. Teplizumab has been studied in new onset type 1 diabetes for testing of efficacy and safety in previous studies; other studies are currently in progress. The results of previous studies indicate that teplizumab reduces the loss of insulin production during the first year after diagnosis in individuals with type 1 diabetes. The purpose of this study is to determine if teplizumab can interdict the immune process that causes the destruction of insulin secreting beta cells in the pancreas during the "pre-diabetic" state and thereby prevent or delay the onset of type 1 diabetes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Teplizumab for Prevention of Type 1 Diabetes In Relatives "At-Risk"</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study plans to enroll approximately 71 subjects between the ages of 8-45 years, over 2-3 years. The study is projected to last between 4-6 years, depending upon rate of enrollment and number of subjects who develop diabetes. The main study objective is to determine whether intervention with teplizumab will prevent or delay the development of type 1 diabetes in high risk autoantibody positive non-diabetic relatives of individuals with T1D. Secondary outcomes are to include analyses of C-peptide and other measures from Oral Glucose Tolerance Testing (OGTT), safety, tolerability, and other mechanistic outcomes will be assessed during the study.</detailed_description>
