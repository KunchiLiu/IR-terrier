	<brief_title>Study of Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy Using Tomotherapy for Metastatic Tumors to the Liver</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to determine the response of liver tumors to radiation therapy. This study will be using a type of radiation therapy called tomotherapy. Tomotherapy is a relatively new kind of therapy which is able to focus a large amount of radiation to a small area with relatively less radiation to the surrounding non-cancerous part of the organ. This study is being done to find out if this technique is able to control the cancer better or not than the standard radiation and also to study its safety. The usual treatment for this type of disease for patients who are eligible is surgery to remove the tumors. For patients who aren't eligible for surgery or who chose not to have surgery, they are treated with low daily doses of radiation given over many weeks; however this type of treatment has not been very effective.</detailed_description>
