	<brief_summary>This project is a pilot study of caffeine abstinence in coffee-drinkers who have type 2 diabetes. Evidence suggests that caffeine may impair the control of glucose levels, especially in those people who have type 2 diabetes. Eliminating caffeinated beverages from the diet might improve glucose control, but the difficulty of quitting is unknown. This pilot study will follow a small number of type 2 diabetic patients for three months after a brief intervention designed to help people quit caffeine. Data on success with maintaining abstinence and on changes in glucose control will be collected.</brief_summary>
