	<brief_summary>The study, with the ASTRA TECH Implant System, is comparing short implants (OsseoSpeed™) to standard length implants (OsseoSpeed™) with bone substitution. The hypothesis is that the use of short implants in posterior maxilla with inadequate bone is as safe and predictable as placing standard length implants in combination with bone augmentation.</brief_summary>
