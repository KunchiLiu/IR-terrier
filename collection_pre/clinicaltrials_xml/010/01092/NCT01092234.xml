	<brief_title>Effectiveness of an Observational Unit at St. Olavs Hospital</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Observational units are thought to be more efficient than traditional ward units, but the evidence is scarce. The trial will in a randomized fashion evaluate the study hypothesis at an organizational level and not confined to specific diagnosis. The hypothesis to be tested is to confirm or reject the equal effectiveness of an Observational unit compared to a traditional ward for organizing in-hospital care.There are established eligibility and exclusion criteria based on clinical experience. Endpoint is length of stay and readmission within 30 days. In addition the study will give information on the use of diagnostic and treatment resources used and collect some basic demographic variables.</detailed_description>
