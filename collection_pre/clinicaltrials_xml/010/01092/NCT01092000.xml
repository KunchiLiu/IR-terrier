	<brief_summary>The purpose of the challenge is to see if we, as the nutrition experts, can follow the dietary and physical activity guidelines promoted to the public. We have an opportunity to "practice what we preach." Scientific evidence demonstrates, knowledge is not enough to change ones'behaviors. It is through positive approaches and lifestyle changes that behavior can be altered. By experiencing the planning, work, and motivation required to make lifestyle changes we can all be better clinicians.</brief_summary>
