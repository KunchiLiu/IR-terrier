	<brief_summary>Sickle cell nephropathy is a known complication of sickle cell anemia (SCA) manifested by increase in glomerular filtration rate (glomerular hyperfiltration) and results in proteinuria and chronic renal failure. Our goal is to examine the prevalence of proteinuria and microalbuminuria as an early predictive factor of glomerular injury, among young people who suffer from SCA as well as those who suffer from combined sickle cell/beta-thalassemia.</brief_summary>
