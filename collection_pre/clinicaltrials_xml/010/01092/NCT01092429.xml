	<brief_summary>Development of myocardial ischemia, and/or myocarditis would induce different changes in myocardial contraction behavior pattern,which maybe very subtle, and may not be detected by the 2D and m-mode echocardiography examinations. According to tissue Doppler imaging(TDI), they can be depicted by different models of echo with higher frame rates. In addition, many studies using TDI have significantly contributed of efforts to evaluate systolic and diastolic function and prognosis. This study assess the value of the indices of left ventricular function obtained by using TDI in patient with coronary artery disease(CAD). We hypothesized that TDI will add incremental value for regional wall motion abnormality of CAD and its prognosis.</brief_summary>
