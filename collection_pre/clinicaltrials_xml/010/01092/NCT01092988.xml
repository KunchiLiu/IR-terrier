	<brief_summary>The first magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) treatment of uterine fibroid using the ExAblate 2000 system was performed in 2001. Since then, more than 5000 treatments were done in more than 60 different hospitals around the world. The experience accumulated in this novel treatment was collected by InSightec and implemented into software and hardware updates, clinical tips and guidelines, all aimed to improve the clinical results and their durability, while maintaining a high level of safety. Based on extensive clinical experience and our internal research and development effort goals toward continuous improvement in ExAblate treatment safety and performance, limited changes have been made to the current ExAblate system. This modified ExAblate system version is designated as the ExAblate 2100 UF V2 system. The modifications are believed to improve system's friendliness to the user, without introducing new risks or other issues of safety of the device, and should not have any negative impact on the safety or technical efficacy of the treatments for patients.</brief_summary>
