	<brief_summary>Bimatoprost has been shown to provide effective IOP lowering in patients of all races. Conversely, travoprost has been shown to be more effective in black patients than in Caucasians in some studies. However, Noecker et al 2004 compared bimatoprost with travoprost in African-Americans with glaucoma or OHT, and found that bimatoprost was more likely than travoprost to achieve target pressure at 3 months. These racial differences in efficacy of these medications warrant further investigations. The investigators study aim to compare the IOP-lowering efficacies of bimatoprost and travoprost in an Egyptian population with primary open-angle glaucoma (OAG) or ocular hypertension (OHT).</brief_summary>
