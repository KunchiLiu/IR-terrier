	<brief_title>Study of Pegylated Human Recombinant Arginase for Liver Cancer (BCT-100-002)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objectives of this study are: - To evaluate any objective tumor responses to PEG-BCT-100 in HCC patients receiving weekly doses of PEG-BCT-100 alone. - To perform PK and PD analysis - To measure Quality of Life of the patients Secondary objectives of this study are: - To define any toxicity associated with the metabolic and cellular alterations of ADD relative to dose and PK of PEG-BCT-100 (rhArgIpeg5000). - To confirm the safety and anti-tumor activity of PEG-BCT-100 at the preferred dose (1600U/kg) in 50 patients (at least 18 evaluable subjects) with advanced HCC. - To measure duration of response including Overall Survival and Time to Progression analysis</detailed_description>
