	<brief_summary>This study will assess the effects of colesevelam, alone or in combination with sitagliptin, on glucose metabolism in subjects with T2DM inadequately controlled by diet and exercise</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effects of Co-admin of Colesevelam and Sitagliptin on Glucose Metabolism in Subjects With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The hypothesis is that co-administrationof colesevelam plus sitagliptin results in a greater reduction in HbA1c compared to colesevelam HCl treatment by 1. improving the effects of colesevelam on fasting glucose metabolism 2. improving the effects of colsevelam on postprandial glucose metabolism</detailed_description>
