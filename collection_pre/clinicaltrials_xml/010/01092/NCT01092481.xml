	<brief_summary>This study is designed to confirm that first 3 months of oxaliplatin in 6 months of modified FOLFOX-6 or CAPOX treatment is not inferior to 6 months of oxaliplatin in modified FOLFOX-6 or CAPOX treatment in terms of disease free survival in patients with stage II/III colon cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Investigating the Role of Oxaliplatin Duration in Modified FOLFOX-6 or CAPOX Regimen as Adjuvant Colon Cancer Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is designed to confirm that first 3 months of oxaliplatin in 6 months of modified FOLFOX-6 or CAPOX treatment is not inferior to 6 months of oxaliplatin in modified FOLFOX-6 or CAPOX treatment in terms of disease free survival in patients with stage II/III colon cancer. In addition, we would like to characterize pharmacogenomic profile associated with toxicities and gene expression profiling to predict the recurrence of colon cancer as parallel study.</detailed_description>
