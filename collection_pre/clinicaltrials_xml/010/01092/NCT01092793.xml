	<brief_summary>Atherosclerotic coronary heart disease is a condition thought to involve low-grade inflammation. Several reports, clinical and epidemiological, have demonstrated that intake of fish oil may be beneficial in attenuating the inflammatory process. Still, however, there are lacking data in respect to whether differences in composition of various marine oils may influence the inflammatory status differently. The hypothesis of the current study is that extract from the antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) is better than traditional fish oils when compared head-to-head with balanced composition of omega 3 content on inflammatory status.</brief_summary>
