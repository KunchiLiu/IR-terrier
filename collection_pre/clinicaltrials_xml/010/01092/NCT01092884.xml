	<brief_summary>We will assess whether oral supplementation with Polypodium leucotomos, a commercially marketed fern extract, improves facial melasma in Hispanic women with moderate to severe melasma. Subjects will be randomized to either Group 1, which will receive oral Polypodium leucotomos extract plus topical sunscreen, or Group 2, which will receive oral placebo plus topical sunscreen. The study will last 12 weeks, and we hypothesize that the Polypodium leucotomos group will have more improvement in their melasma compared to the placebo group.</brief_summary>
