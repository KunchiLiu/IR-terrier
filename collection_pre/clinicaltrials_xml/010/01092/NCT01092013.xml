	<brief_summary>This prospective randomized study aims for determination whether focused simulator based laparoscopic camera training in novices can improve camera performance in an actual clinical situations in the same manner as traditional training in the OR does, especially considering efficient use of training time.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparative Evaluation of Simulator Based and Traditional In-surgery Laparoscopic Camera Training's Efficiency in Novices</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Medical students in their final years without any significant experience in handling an angled laparoscopic camera participate in the study and perform a camera guidance test in surgery. The participants are then randomized in two groups to receive either a simulator based or traditional in theatre training during three weeks. The camera test will be repeated, while both tests are going to be recorded. Videos of 14 camera tests carried out by laparoscopic experts are taped as well.</detailed_description>
