	<brief_summary>Children with healing burns often suffer from pruritus that may continue for many months. Pruritus can be very distressing to the child and can interfere with sleep, activities of daily living, and rehabilitation therapy. Additionally, constant scratching of skin grafts may result in damage that requires further surgery, thus putting the patient at additional risk and adding to health care costs. Although the size of the burn injury is a risk factor for pruritus, almost 50% of patients with small burn injuries reported moderate or severe pruritus.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gabapentin for the Treatment of Pruritus Caused by Burn Injuries in Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Gabapentin has been shown to be effective for the treatment of pruritus in adult patients with brachioradial pruritus, uraemic pruritus and pruritus of unknown origin. Although the specific mechanism is unknown, the end result is the downregulation of excitatory neurotransmitter release and decrease in neuronal hyperexcitability. The primary objective of this study is evaluating the effectiveness of gabapentin in reducing the severity of pruritus in children with burn injuries.</detailed_description>
