	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to collect long-term follow-up data of the CryoValve SG Pulmonary Human Heart Valve.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CryoValve SG Pulmonary Human Heart Valve Post Clearance Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The CryoValve SG pulmonary human heart valve is recovered from deceased human donors, treated with the SynerGraft® process,which is designed to reduce the donor cells present on the graft. The valve is then cryopreserved for storage until use. Removing cells from the heart valve has been shown to reduce a component of the immune response after implant compared to a standard allograft valve. However, it is not known how this affects the long-term durability of the valve.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>• Retrospective Patients o Sequential patients implanted with a CryoValve SG Pulmonary Human Heart Halve as a Ross or RVOT reconstruction between February 2000 and March 2004 who were included in the 510(k) data collection will be identified using the following general criteria to aid in selection of patients who are most likely to provide adequate followup data: Patient is alive and the implanted valve is still in place (has not been explanted). Patient is still under the care of the implanting institution or the implanting surgeon. Patient was identified as previously providing data for at least one echocardiographic followup assessment at a minimum of one year postimplant. Additionally, prospective enrolling centers will have the option to enroll retrospective patients. At these centers, all consecutive patients identified from valve implant data at CryoLife, implanted with a CryoValve SG Pulmonary Valve as a valved pulmonary valve prior to Clearance in 2008 will be targeted for inclusion in the retrospective patient data collection. • Prospective Patients Sequential patients implanted with a CryoValve SG Pulmonary Human Heart Halve as a Ross or RVOT reconstruction after FDA 510(k) clearance in February 2008 at selected institutions.</criteria>
