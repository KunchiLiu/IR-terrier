	<brief_summary>One obvious property difference between energy-yielding beverages and solid foods is the oral mechanical processing required to prepare the two food forms for swallowing. Considerable human data are consistent with a contribution of mechanical stimulation to appetite suppression. However, no study has isolated this property and assessed its influence on ingestive behavior in humans. This is the aim of the present study. The null hypothesis is that food rheology will have no effect on these indices. The alternate hypothesis is that increased mechanical stimulation will result in stronger satiation/satiety and reduced energy intake. Further, it is hypothesized that the effects of mastication will be less evident in obese compared to lean individuals.</brief_summary>
