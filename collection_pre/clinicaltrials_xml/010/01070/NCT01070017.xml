	<brief_title>Community-based Accompaniment With Supervised Antiretrovirals in Lima, Peru</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Community-based accompaniment with directly observed antiretroviral therapy (DOT-HAART) may improve adherence and clinical outcomes among impoverished individuals starting HAART in resource-poor settings. Furthermore, the utilization of community health workers may build social capital. This is cluster-randomized trial, with randomization at the level of health centers. Individuals in both intervention and control clusters will receive community-based adherence support (monthly adherence visits) and standard care. In addition, individuals residing in intervention clusters will receive 12 months of community-based DOT-HAART. We will enroll patients as well as community members (health providers, treatment supporters, and community health workers) to assess individual and community-level outcomes.</detailed_description>
