	<brief_summary>The aim of the study was to evaluate efficacy and tolerability of Thalidomide in first-line treatment of multiple myeloma as induction treatment in young patients, with Dexamethasone before autotransplant, and in elderly patients in combination with conventional chemotherapy and as consolidation/maintenance therapy in young and elderly patients at plateau-phase.</brief_summary>
