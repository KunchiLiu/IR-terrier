	<brief_title>Effectiveness and Duration of Effect of Open Treatment in ADHD Patients Treated With Lisdexamfetamine Dimesylate(Vyvanse)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Protocol Summary: Effectiveness and Duration of Effect of Open Treatment in Adult ADHD Patients Treated with Lisdexamfetamine Dimesylate- LDX (Vyvanse) The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and duration of effect of LDX for the treatment of ADHD symptoms in adults. The study will be a 12-week open label extension with 25 adult participants who completed a cross-over study of adherence/efficacy of Adderall Immediate Release (IR) vs. Adderall Extended Release (XR). The secondary objective is to provide information regarding tolerability, dosing and titration of LDX in the adult population with ADHD. An additional fifteen participants will be recruited using advertising and previous Mental Health and Addictive Behaviour Research Program (MHADRP) studies will be offered treatment with LDX. All participants will be diagnosed with ADHD using the Adult Clinician Diagnostic Scale (ACDS). We will be collecting demographic information, administering the Scheduled Clinical Interview for DSM Disorders (SCID), collecting medical history, previous drug therapy, and the participant will have a physical with the physician. A coordinator will give an electrocardiogram (ECG), and collect a blood sample for blood chemistry and hematology. Schedule of Events: Vyvanse Extension Screening Visit - Consent - Demographics (needs to be added?) - Physical - Medical history (needs to be added?) - Previous drug therapy - Vitals (Blood Pressure-BP, Heart Rate-HR, Respiration, weight) - Urine Drug screen - Urine pregnancy test - ECG - Blood sample - SCID - ACDS Visits at week 0,1,2,3,4,6,8,10,12 (every visit) - ADHD-Rating Scale (ADHD-RS) - Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS) - Clinical Global Impression (CGI) - Vitals - Pill count - Adverse Events (AE)/ Concomitant Medications (CM) Visits at week 0,1,4,6,12 also administer - Adult ADHD Medication Rebound Scale (AMRS) (AM/PM) - Adult ADHD Medication Smoothness of Effect Scale (AMSES) (AM/PM) - Wender-Reimherr Adult Attention Deficit Disorder Scale (WRAADS) (AM/PM) First 4 weeks of treatment is a dose adjustment period (30-70 mg po qAM), after those 4 weeks established dose is remained for remaining 8 weeks of treatment.</detailed_description>

Anyone who meets current DSMIVTR criteria for alcohol or any nonalcohol substance abuse or dependence disorder (excluding nicotine). 3. Participants with controlled depressive or anxiety disorders may not participate if, in the opinion of the Principal Investigator, their medications will interfere with safety or efficacy assessments. 4. Participants with any concurrent chronic or acute illness or unstable medical condition that could, in the opinion of the study physician, confound the results of safety assessments, increase risk to the subject or lead to difficulty complying with the protocol. 5. Participants with hypertension at screening, indicated by a blood pressure reading of 135/90 and heart rate above 120bmp. 6. Female participants of childbearing potential who test positive for pregnancy at the time of enrollment based on a urine pregnancy test, or who do not agree to use a reliable method of birth control during the study. Females of childbearing potential are defined as women not surgically sterilized and are between menarche and 2 years postmenopause. 7.
