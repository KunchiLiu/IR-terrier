	<brief_summary>Tahitian Noni Juice (TNJ) made from Morinda citrifolia (noni) fruits may provide a safe adjunctive treatment for osteoarthritis (OA) due to its anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. In this study the investigators examined whether TNJ was able to improve the symptoms and quality of life (QOL) of OA patients. The investigators also sought to evaluate the tolerability and safety of TNJ. This was an open label three-month intervention pilot study. Data were collected by pre and post intervention survey as well as laboratory testing. Inclusion criteria were: adults of both sexes aged 40 to 75, with a diagnosis of OA on the hip or knee by their primary care physician, not on prescription medicine for OA, and who were willing to drink 3 oz of TNJ a day.</brief_summary>
