	<brief_title>Everolimus (RAD001) Therapy for Epilepsy in Patients With Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a genetic disorder with an incidence at birth of 1 in 6000. This disorder is characterized by the development of benign tumors in multiple organ systems, including the brain. The primary neurological manifestations of TSC are epilepsy, mental retardation and autism. Epilepsy is most common, occurring in 80-90% of patients, and often the seizures are severe, unremitting, and uncontrolled by current anticonvulsant medications. It is generally accepted that the seizures arise from cortical and subcortical tubers and surrounding tissue in the brain. These tubers are caused by mutations in the tumor suppressor genes TSC1 or TSC2. The protein products of these genes, hamartin and tuberin, act as negative regulators of the PI3K/PKB(Akt)/mTOR signaling pathway that regulates cell growth and proliferation Everolimus is an immunosuppressant drug that also inhibits mTOR signaling and is capable of reversing aberrant mTOR-dependent effects that occur when hamartin or tuberin are absent or defective. Thus, we hypothesize that drugs like everolimus may be therapeutically useful for the treatment of refractory epilepsy in patients with TSC.</detailed_description>

Topical or inhaled corticosteroids are allowed Patients should not receive immunization with attenuated live vaccines within one week of informed consent or during study period Patients with coexisting malignancies within past 3 years, except for adequately treated carcinoma of the cervix or basal or squamous cell carcinomas of the skin Uncontrolled brain or leptomeningeal metastases, including patients who continue to require glucocorticoids for brain or leptomeningeal metastases Patients who have any severe and/or uncontrolled medical conditions or other conditions that could affect their participation in the study such as: Symptomatic congestive heart failure of New York heart Association Class III or IV, unstable angina pectoris, symptomatic congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction within 6 months of start of study drug, serious uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia or any other clinically significant cardiac disease Severely impaired lung function defined as spirometry and DLCO that is 50% of the normal predicted value and/or 02 saturation that is 88% or less at rest on room air and/or requirement for continuous supplemental O2 Uncontrolled diabetes as defined by fasting serum glucose &gt;1.5 x ULN Active (acute or chronic) or uncontrolled severe infections Liver disease such as cirrhosis, chronic active hepatitis or chronic persistent hepatitis A known history of HIV seropositivity Impairment of gastrointestinal function or gastrointestinal disease that may significantly alter the absorption of everolimus (e.g., ulcerative disease, uncontrolled nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, malabsorption syndrome or small bowel resection) Patients with an active, bleeding diathesis Female patients who are pregnant or breast feeding, or adults of reproductive potential who are not using effective birth control methods. Patients who have received prior treatment with an mTOR inhibitor (sirolimus, temsirolimus, everolimus).
