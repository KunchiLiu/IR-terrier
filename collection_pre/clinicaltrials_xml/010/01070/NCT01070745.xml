	<brief_summary>Patency of the ductus arteriosus (PDA) is functionally essential for fetal circulation, however persistence of ductal patency postnatally may have significant adverse hemodynamic effects in the neonate. Medical therapy for PDA predominantly involves the administration of one of two non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: indomethacin or ibuprofen. Both of these therapies have been shown to be successful in mediating ductal closure in approximately 70% of treated infants. However, the need for a second course of treatment for PDA closure remains quite common. The investigators hypothesize that, because of small differences between the two drugs, a greater percentage of infants who did not respond to a first course of therapy with indomethacin will respond to a second course with ibuprofen than to a repeat course of indomethacin. As such, the investigators aim to compare secondary therapy with a repeat course of indomethacin to secondary therapy with ibuprofen in infants whose ductus remained patent after a first course of therapy with indomethacin.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inborn premature neonates (birth weight [BW] &lt;1500 grams) being treated in the neonatal intensive care unit of the Shaare Zedek Medical Center and diagnosed as still having a hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus (hsPDA) after a first course of therapy with indomethacin, will be considered as potential candidates for study pending response to initial therapy and pending parental consent. Any baby not considered viable Any baby with intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) grade 34 of recent onset (within 3 days). [If no head ultrasound has been performed within the last 34 days, one should be performed prior to onset of study.] Any baby with dysmorphic features or congenital abnormalities Any baby with structural heart disease other than PDA Any baby with documented infection, Any baby with thrombocytopenia (&lt;50,000).</criteria>
