	<brief_summary>Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) may occur during cataract surgeries in patients treated with alpha 1 blockers. IFIS related to alpha 1 blocker Tamsulosin (used for prostate hypertrophy) was reported in 50-90% of patients. IFIS during surgery make the surgery more difficult and raise complication rate. Using anterior corneal incisions was reported briefly in literature as a prophylactic means but was not studied prospectively. we believe (according to our clinical experience) that these anterior incisions do help to reduce the incidence and severity of IFIS signs and complications rate during surgeries.</brief_summary>
