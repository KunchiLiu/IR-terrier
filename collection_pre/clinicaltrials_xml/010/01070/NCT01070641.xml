	<brief_summary>Aim To compare Carvedilol with variceal band ligation in the prevention of first variceal bleed. End points of trial Primary: Variceal hemorrhage Secondary: Death Study design Randomised controlled clinical trial. Results analysed for the above end points on an intention-to-treat basis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>RCT of Carvedilol Versus Variceal Band Ligation in the Primary Prophylaxis of Oesophageal Variceal Haemorrhage</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients from the Gastroenterology section of the Aga Khan University, Karachi, with liver cirrhosis and on endoscopy having grade II, or larger oesophageal varices and who have not bled previously from varices. Method All suitable patients will be recruited after informed consent is given. Randomisation of treatment is by sealed envelopes prepared in batches of 20. Carvedilol This will be administered as a once daily dose of 12.5mg. Variceal band ligation Endoscopy will be performed ever two weeks until eradication of oesophageal varices. Eradication is achieved when no varices or only grade I varices (varices which are small and flatten on air insufflations in the oesophagus) are present. Subsequent endoscopy sessions will be progressively less frequent, at intervals of 3 months, 6 months and 12 months thereafter. Should varices recur, the protocol for eradication as described above will be re-instituted. Follow-up This will take place in a dedicated clinic. First visit is six weeks after initiation of treatment and three monthly thereafter. Clinical and laboratory parameters will be obtained at each visit. All patients with alcoholic liver disease will be asked to provide an up-to-date status on drinking. Treatment will cease upon reaching any of these end-points: variceal haemorrhage, death or liver transplantation. Duration of follow-up is defined as time from randomisation to the above end points or to the last follow-up date available.</detailed_description>
