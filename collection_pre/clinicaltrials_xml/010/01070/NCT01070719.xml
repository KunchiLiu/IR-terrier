	<brief_summary>This is an open-label study of patients with relapsing forms of Multiple Sclerosis designed to assess the biochemical, immunological and pharmacokinetic profiles of a large, actively infusing natalizumab patient population. A duration effect for progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) risk associated with natalizumab therapy appears to exist. There is minimal data available to understand this effect at the biochemical and cellular level. The purpose of this study is to gather preliminary data on several parameters to guide in more focused research on the duration effect.</brief_summary>
