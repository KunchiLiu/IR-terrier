	<brief_summary>Number of patients in mobile palliative care units have pain of both nociceptive and neuropathic origin. In certain cases, procedures of locoregional analgesia can be helpful. The Purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of techniques of locoregional analgesia in a palliative population</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Procedures of Locoregional Analgesia and Quality of Life in Palliative Care Units</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cancer pain is a serious problem in the palliative population. In particular, pain due to compression or invasion of nerve tissue by metastasis is frequent and often unresponsive to oral drug therapy and even to epidural administration of opioids. In such refractory pain in a palliative setting, one modality that could be helpful is the use of technics of locoregional analgesia. Currently, they are routinely used for the management of acute postoperative pain and become to be more widely used for cancer surgery. For example, intrapleural intercostal nerve blocks after major lung resection or preincisional paravertebral blocks after breast surgery have been shown to improve pain control. However, locoregional analgesia is only occasionally used in chronic cancer pain. The procedures used are epidural analgesia, rachianesthesia, or continuous nerve blocks. L-bupivacaine will be used. The procedure will be performed only if the injection test is positive. The patients will be evaluated before and after the procedure, the patient being his/her own control. Evaluations will take place immediately before the procedure, then at 48 hours, 1 week and 1 month after the procedure.</detailed_description>
