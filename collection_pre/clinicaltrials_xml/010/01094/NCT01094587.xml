	<brief_summary>This study aims to prospectively assess outcomes of sutureless versus sutured gastroschisis closure with a randomized control trial. The parameters of this trial were determined using our retrospective study as pilot data. Primary outcome measures will be time on ventilator and time to initiating enteral feeds. Other outcome measures will include cosmetic outcome, length of hospital stay and the associated rate of complications, including bowel resection, sepsis, and death.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study aims to prospectively assess outcomes of sutureless versus sutured gastroschisis closure with a randomized control trial. The parameters of this trial were determined using our retrospective study as pilot data. Primary outcome measures will be time on ventilator and time to initiating enteral feeds. Other outcome measures will include cosmetic outcome, length of hospital stay and the associated rate of complications, including bowel resection, sepsis, and death. In comparing these techniques of gastroschisis closure, we can further evaluate which is the safer and more efficacious method, thereby improving patient care while decreasing hospital cost.</detailed_description>
