	<detailed_description>A lumbar puncture will be done before treatment (baseline), and at 24 weeks to collect CSF for the quantification of biomarkers. As an exploratory effort, we will test the effects of thalidomide on the same biomarkers in the plasma and will determine if detectable changes mirror changes observed in the CSF.</detailed_description>
