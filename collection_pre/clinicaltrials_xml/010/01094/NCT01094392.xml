	<brief_summary>Asparaginase is an important drug in the treatment of childhood leukemia. One of the rare but severe side effects to the treatment is thrombosis in or outside the central nervous system. The aim of this study is to investigate and describe the influence on the coagulation parameters during prolonged treatment with asparaginase. Hopefully this knowledge will help to foresee the risk of thrombosis and thus making it possible to prevent these.</brief_summary>
