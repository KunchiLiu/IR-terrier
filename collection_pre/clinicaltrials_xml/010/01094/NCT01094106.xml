	<brief_summary>Infiltration of a local anesthetic into the surgical wound is a simple method to strive to control postoperative pain after surgery. In the investigators institution, this method is used quite often. However, there is a controversy regarding the analgesic efficacy. Moreover, the cost of the single use elastomeric pump used with this procedure is clearly higher than the costs of other routinely used analgesic methods. According to the investigators observations, infiltration of a local anesthetic into the surgical wound after caesarean section seems to reduce the need for rescue analgesics. However, the scientific evidence of the efficacy of this technique is weak. The investigators decided to conduct a prospective, controlled, randomised, double blind trial on this topic. The hypothesis is that wound infiltration with local anesthetic will reduce postoperative pain and opioid consumption after caesarean section without major adverse effects.</brief_summary>
