	<brief_summary>Many woman undergoing a surgical abortion receive a paracervical nerve block for pain reduction, in which lidocaine (a numbing medication) is injected around the cervix. These injections numb the cervix and possibly the lower part of the uterus. However, the injection can be uncomfortable and it is not well known whether it is effective in reducing pain. The purpose of this study is to determine the level of pain women experience with a surgical abortion and the effect that paracervical block might have on that pain.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigators expect to have 120 women complete this study, between study sites at OHSU's Center for Women's Health and Planned Parenthood Columbia Willamette in Portland, OR. Every participant will still receive the standard oral medication for pain (ibuprofen) and anxiety (lorazepam). Eligible subjects will be at least 18 years of age, less than 11 weeks pregnant and have already decided to have a surgical abortion. The primary outcome evaluated will be pain reported at time of cervical dilation. The investigators will assess pain at various time points (including secondary outcomes) immediately upon completion of the respective step and pain and satisfaction 30 minutes postoperatively.</detailed_description>
