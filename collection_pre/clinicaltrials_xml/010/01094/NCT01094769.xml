	<detailed_description>This study will investigate the effect of moxonidine in lowering urine albumin excretion and limiting further damage to the kidneys in patients with diabetic nephropathy. Reducing urine albumin excretion in type 2 diabetic patients is an indicator of successful treatment. Previous studies have shown that drugs that work in a similar fashion to moxonidine (intervene with the sympathetic nervous system)have been very effective in reducing the amount of albumin in the urine and are associated with long term renal and cardiovascular protection.</detailed_description>
