	<brief_summary>Tecemotide (L-BLP25) is believed to induce a Mucinous glycoprotein 1 (MUC1)-specific T-cell response after vaccination. The primary purpose of this study is to ascertain whether vaccination with tecemotide (L-BLP25) induces a MUC1-specific T-cell response in slowly progressive or chemotherapy naive multiple myeloma subjects.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Documented previously untreated, Mucinous glycoprotein 1 (MUC1)expressing, slowly progressive asymptomatic multiple myeloma with an increasing Mprotein concentration displayed on two occasions separated by an interval of at least 4 weeks within the last 18 months, or Documented MUC1expressing stage II or III multiple myeloma with a treatmentfree interval of at least 3 months following prior antitumor therapy, and fulfilling criteria for having a stable response/plateau phase Signed written informed consent MUC1expressing myeloma cells in the bone marrow Greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 18 years of age Life expectancy of at least 6 months Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of less than or equal to (&lt;=) 1 at study entry Effective contraception for both male and female subjects, if the possibility of conception exists A platelet count &gt;=100 x 10^9/Liter, white blood cells &gt;=2.5 x 10^9/Liter, and hemoglobin &gt;=90 gram per liter (g/L) Total bilirubin &lt;= 1.5 x upper reference range Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &lt;= 2.5 x upper reference range Serum creatinine &lt;= 2 x upper reference PreTherapies: Previous exposure to MUC1 targeting therapy Radiotherapy or any investigational drug in the 30 days before the start of treatment in this study Receipt of immunotherapy (Example: interferons, tumor necrosis factor [TNF], interleukins, or biological response modifiers [granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor {GMCSF}, granulocyte colony stimulating factor {GCSF}, macrophagecolony stimulating factor {MCSF}], monoclonal antibodies) within 4 weeks (28 days) prior to randomization Any preexisting medical condition requiring chronic oral or intravenous steroid or immunosuppressive therapy except for maintenance doses of prednisone of &lt;=10 milligram per day (mg/day) Medical Conditions: Autoimmune disease that in the opinion of the investigator could compromise the safety of the subject in this study Hereditary or congenital immunodeficiencies Known hypersensitivity reaction to any of the components of study treatments Clinically significant cardiac disease, Example: New York Heart Association (NYHA) classes IIIIV; unstable angina, uncontrolled arrhythmia or uncontrolled hypertension, myocardial infarction in the previous 6 months Other previous malignancies within 5 years, with exception of a history of a previous basal cell carcinoma of the skin, carcinoma in situ of uterine cervix, gastrointestinal intramucosal carcinoma Known Hepatitis B and/or C Splenectomy Standard Safety: Known alcohol or drug abuse Medical or psychological conditions that would not permit the subject to complete the study or sign informed consent Significant disease which, in the investigator's opinion, would exclude the subject from the study Pregnant or breastfeeding women, women of childbearing potential, unless using effective contraception as determined by the investigator. Subjects whom the investigator considers may be at risk of pregnancy will have a pregnancy test performed per institutional standard Participation in another clinical study within the past 30 days Legal incapacity or limited legal capacity Concurrent treatment with a nonpermitted drug Any other reason that, in the opinion of the investigator, precludes the subject from participating in the study</criteria>
