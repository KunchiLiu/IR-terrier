	<brief_summary>The major purpose of this study is to examine the anti-tumor activity of the CDX-1307 vaccine regimen when it is given before and after bladder cancer surgery. The study will also provide information about the safety of the vaccine regimen when given in combination with chemotherapy, and how it affects the immune systems.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of the CDX-1307 Vaccine Regimen in Patients With Newly Diagnosed Muscle-Invasive Bladder Cancer (The "N-ABLE" Study)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CDX-1307 is an experimental vaccine that is designed to generate an immune response against a protein called human chorionic gonadotropin-beta (hCG-β). hCG-β is made by several types of cancers, including bladder cancer, and has been shown to be associated with shorter times to development of metastases and reduced survival in bladder cancer. In this study, it is hoped that administering the CDX-1307 vaccine will cause the body's immune system to attack bladder cancer cells in order to kill them or otherwise keep them from spreading or coming back. Standard treatment for early stage, muscle invasive bladder cancer includes the administration of chemotherapy to shrink the tumor followed by surgical removal of the bladder (cystectomy). This study will compare the effect of adding CDX-1307 administration to this standard treatment. CDX-1307 will be given with 3 different immune stimulants to try to increase the immune response against the tumor cells; collectively, this is called the "CDX-1307 vaccine regimen." Only patients whose tumors make the hCG-β protein will be included in this study. Eligible patients will receive "standard of care" chemotherapy with the CDX-1307 vaccine regimen before surgery, and then CDX-1307 vaccine regimen alone (without chemotherapy) after surgery.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Among other criteria, patients must meet all of the following conditions to be eligible to be in the study: 1. 18 years of age or older. 2. Newly diagnosed muscleinvasive transitional cell (urothelial) bladder cancer where neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radical cystectomy with curative intent are indicated (i.e., American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage T24a, Nany, M0). Patients must be entered into the study within eight weeks of their most recent diagnostic procedure, which is usually a diagnostic biopsy or transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) procedure. 3. Histopathologically confirmed, transitional cell (urothelial) carcinoma. Urothelial tumors with mixed histology (but with &lt;50% variant) are eligible. 4. Tumor tissue (obtained during a prior procedure) confirmed to express hCGβ by a central laboratory. 5. Candidate for therapy with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Among other criteria, patients who meet any of the following conditions are NOT eligible to be in the study: 1. Previous systemic chemotherapy or radiation for bladder cancer. Note: Prior immunotherapy or intravesical (administered within the bladder) chemotherapy for superficial disease is acceptable. 2. History of anaphylactic reaction following exposure to humanized or human therapeutic monoclonal antibodies, hypersensitivity to GMCSF or yeast derived products, clinically meaningful allergic reactions to imiquimod, resiquimod, or any known hypersensitivity or prior reaction to any of the formulation excipients in the study drugs. 3. Concurrent chronic treatment with immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory agents, including any systemic steroid (exception: inhaled or topically applied steroids, and acute and chronic standard dose NSAIDs, are permitted). 4. Known infection with HIV, HBV or HCV. 5. Any underlying medical condition that, in the Investigator's opinion, will make the administration of study vaccine hazardous to the patient, would obscure the interpretation of adverse events, or would contraindicate receipt of neoadjuvant chemotherapy or surgical resection.</criteria>
