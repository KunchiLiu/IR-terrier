	<brief_summary>Clopidogrel resistance (CR) or low-responsiveness is associated with increased risk of ischemic events and can be detected by laboratory tests. This multicenter, randomized study is aimed to explore the efficacy and safety of intensive antiplatelet therapy (i.e. double clopidogrel maintenance dose and/or additional cilostazol)for patients with CR after coronary stenting.</brief_summary>
