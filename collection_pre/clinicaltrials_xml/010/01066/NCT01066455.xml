	<brief_title>Cardiac Outcome Measures in Children With Muscular Dystrophy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The research study will include 50 participants aged 8 to 18 years old (before 18th birthday) with Duchenne, Becker, or autosomal recessive limb-girdle (specifically: LGMD 2C-2F and 2I) muscular dystrophies. Participants will be seen in one of five Cooperative International Neuromuscular Research Group (CINRG) centers located in the United States. All study assessments will be completed in the same day and include reviewing past medical and surgical history, collecting vital signs, collecting cardiac measures through echocardiographic tests.</detailed_description>
