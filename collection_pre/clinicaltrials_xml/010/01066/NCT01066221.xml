	<brief_title>Comparative Study of Three Different Testing Mechanisms for Clostridium Difficile</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This comparative study will be carried out in the hospital microbiology laboratory of a tertiary academic health center, St. Joseph's Healthcare (SJH) affiliated with McMaster University, Hamilton, ON on 500 individual stool samples from patients greater than 12 months of age to determine an efficacy of distinction between current gold standard and other methods of testing for Clostridium difficile. This study is required to find a faster test for diagnosis of CDI in order to facilitate prompt treatment and reduce the complications of CDI. Identification of infected cases will lead to the enforcement of infection control measures and thereby prevent spread to other susceptible children. This is turn will reduce costs, length of stay, morbidity, and mortality from CDI if instituted correctly.</detailed_description>
