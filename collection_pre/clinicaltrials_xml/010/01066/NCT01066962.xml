	<brief_summary>The triple therapy darunavir/r + tenofovir/emtricitabine is likely to become a relevant first-line treatment option in the years to come. The dual combination of boosted darunavir + raltegravir is an innovative treatment option that combines two potent new antiretroviral drugs, one of which belongs to a new drug class (integrase inhibitor). The expected efficacy profile of this combination is promising. Moreover, this combination might have a better tolerance profile and has the advantage of sparing the NRTI class. In the context of tenofovir/emtricitabine currently being a reference backbone in first-line antiretroviral regimens, we hypothesise that, in combination with darunavir/r, raltegravir may be an alternative option if its efficacy is non-inferior to tenofovir/emtricitabine.</brief_summary>
