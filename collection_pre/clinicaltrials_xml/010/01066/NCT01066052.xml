	<brief_title>Growth Hormone Treatment for the Prevention of Short Stature in Young Girls With Turner Syndrome Before the Age of 4 Years</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study started as an interventional clinical trial. Following primary completion of the trial, the sponsor together with the investigators decided that it was interesting to perform an observational follow up of the patients, who participated in the interventional part of the study, in order to retrieve more outcome results and safety information on this cohort of young turner patients for whom treatment started before the age of 4. The follow up period was then to be performed until end of GH treatment as decided by the treating physician according to usual clinical practice. More recently, it was agreed to also collect information on final adult height and weight for patients not lost to follow up.</detailed_description>
