	<brief_title>Effectiveness of PeeRelease - a Gel Absorbent Pad in Moderate to Severe Urinary Incontinence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The devices available today on the market serve two polar incontinence conditions: those who have severe urinary incontinence and need to use diapers several times per day, or those who have mild urinary incontinence and can use pads. Such circumstances call for a search of new solution that may provide the benefit of freeing those with moderate incontinence from changing pads several times a day or staying constantly very near a bathroom, as well as freeing those with severe incontinence from using cumbersome diapers. A larger gel containing pad was developed, suitable to absorb up to half a litter liquid, it eliminates odors and enables the users to wear ordinary clothes . It was presented for clinical trial. The objectives of the clinical trial, proposed hereafter is to assess to what extent the new gel pad presents an advantage over the existing means of coping with urinary incontinence in cases when medicinal treatment or surgery is not appropriate.</detailed_description>
