	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to evaluate the bone ingrowth after implantation of the study device. This study will also document any device-related surgical complications or adverse radiographic observations. Improvement in pain, function, and health economic data will be compared with improvements documented with other joint systems.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mini Stem DEXA (Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of the current investigation is to assess the bone ingrowth after implantation with a modular, short hip stem using Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA). The intended use of this product is for patients with non-inflammatory and inflammatory degenerative joint disease who require a primary total hip replacement.</detailed_description>
