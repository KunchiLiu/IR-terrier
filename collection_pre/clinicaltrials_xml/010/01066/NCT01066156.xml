	<brief_title>Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and Seroquel</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An initial telephone interview will be conducted to determine if potential subjects meet the basic study requirements. If no obvious counterindications are present, subjects will be scheduled for a screening visit. After briefing the subjects on the reasons for the research, they will be given an opportunity to read the Informed Consent Form, approved by the Cambridge Health Alliance Institutional ReviewBoard, and to ask questions prior to signing it. Subjects will be given a copy of the signed Consent Form. Each subject will complete a standardized interview schedule designed to obtain personal and background data along with psychodiagnostic and psychometric evaluations. An open-label treatment will be utilized for all patients. Seroquel tablets will be flexibly dosed and begun at a target dose of 25 mg per day and taken over an 8 week period.</detailed_description>
