	<brief_title>An Extension To The B1451006 Protocol To Evaluate The Safety and Efficacy of Dimebon In Subjects With Moderate-to-Severe Alzheimer's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study was terminated on May 7, 2010 due to modification of the dimebon development plan, following the lack of demonstration of efficacy in the completed DIM14 (CONNECTION) Study. The study was not terminated due to any safety findings. Dimebon has been well-tolerated in clinical trials. Demonstration of efficacy for dimebon in Alzheimer's disease is pending completion of the ongoing DIM18 (CONCERT) Study.</detailed_description>
