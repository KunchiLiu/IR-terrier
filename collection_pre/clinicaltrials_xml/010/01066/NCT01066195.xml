	<brief_summary>Pemetrexed was known to be effective to pulmonary adenocarcinoma and gefitinib was known to be more effective to non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with clinical characteristics such as adenocarcinoma, never smoker and female. The investigators try to evaluate which drug (pemetrexed vs gefitinib) is more efficious to NSCLC patients with clinical characteristics such as adenocarcinoma and never smoking history as second- or further-line therapy.</brief_summary>
