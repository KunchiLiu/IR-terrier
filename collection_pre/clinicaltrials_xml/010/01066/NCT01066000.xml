	<brief_summary>This open-label single-arm study will evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of methoxy polyethylene glycol epoetin beta on long-term maintenance of haemoglobin levels in patients with chronic renal anaemia. Patients will receive methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta intravenously once monthly at initial doses of either 120 micrograms or 200 micrograms or 360 micrograms in the titration phase of 16 weeks with a potential dose adjustment in the evaluation phase of 8 weeks. The anticipated time on study treatment is 24 weeks. The target sample size is 50-100 patients.</brief_summary>
