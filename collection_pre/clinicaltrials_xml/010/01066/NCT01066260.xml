	<brief_summary>Probiotic administration is associated with health benefits on gut barrier integrity and immunological functions of the gastrointestinal tract. Recently, probiotic consumption was proposed to reduce fat mass and body weight in rodents (Lee HY. et al. 2006; Hamad EM. et al. 2009). Changes in energy metabolism might be involved in the effects of probiotics on weight control. The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy of the consumption of a probiotic formulation on energy balance in overweight subjects.</brief_summary>
