	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this multi-center, international, short term registry is to assess clinical success and efficacy of the paclitaxel eluting balloon treatment for in-stent restenosis at 6-9 months follow up. Clinical success defined as freedom from major adverse cardiac events (MACE: death, myocardial infarction [MI], target lesion revascularization [TLR]) and target vessel revascularization [TVR]) and stent thrombosis, both early and late occurrences will be assessed. In addition, a cohort of the registry will undergo angiographic follow up at 6-9 months to assess in-stent and in-segment late loss and binary restenosis subsequent to paclitaxel eluting balloon treatment for in-stent restenosis. A prioi analysis will be comparison of the safety and efficacy of patients presenting with drug-eluting stent in-stent restenosis to bare metal stent in-stent restenosis.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients, male or female, &gt; 18 years of age; Patients who present with instent restenosis of a previously placed stent documented by coronary angiogram for which rePCI is planned; The patient has stable or unstable angina, and/or clinical evidence of ischemia (ECG, exercise test, etc.); The target lesion is in a native vessel; Up to two lesions per patient; Target lesion(s) stenosis is &gt; 50%. The patient has had an acute myocardial infarction within the last 48 hours; The patient has a comorbid illness (i.e. any illness likely to limit his/her life expectancy to &lt;12 months); Lesion(s) requiring additional stenting either bare metal or drug eluting (non, bailout indications); The patient has had previous therapeutic radiation to the target vessel; The patient is unable the take dual antiplatelet therapy for at least 6 months; Patients with three or more lesions with instent restenosis requiring angioplasty.</criteria>
