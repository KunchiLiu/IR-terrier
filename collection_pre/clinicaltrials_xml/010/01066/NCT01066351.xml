	<brief_title>Efficacy of Erythropoietin to Prevent Acute Kidney Injury in Chronic Kidney Disease Patients Undergoing Cardiac Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute kidney injury (AKI)occur 7.7-42% after cardiac surgery. The incidence of AKI requiring renal replacement therapy following coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery was 0.7-3.5% and increase mortality rate. Erythropoietin (EPO) is now considered a novel anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory action. The present study was designed to evaluate the administration of EPO as a means of preventing AKI in these patients.</detailed_description>
