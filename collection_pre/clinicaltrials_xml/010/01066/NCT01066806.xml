	<brief_summary>SPECIFIC AIM The aim of this study is to determine if increasing calcium intake to recommended levels with dairy foods in adolescent females with habitually low calcium intake and above-the-median body mass index (BMI) for sex and age will decrease body fat gain compared to similar females who continue their low calcium intake. . HYPOTHESIS Post-menarcheal adolescent girls with habitually low calcium intake who consume dairy foods providing at least 1200 mg of calcium per day will have a smaller increase in percent body fat, as measured by dual energy absorptiometry, during one year than post-menarcheal adolescent girls on a usual diet of 600 mg of calcium per day or less.</brief_summary>
