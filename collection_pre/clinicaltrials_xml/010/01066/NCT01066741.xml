	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the benefit of a mouthwash with a phytopharmaceutical preparation, Homeodent®, compared to a mouthwash solution containing sodium bicarbonate, for prevention of severe mucositis (grade ≥3, RTOG classification) in patients receiving irradiation for oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx or cavum cancer. This is a phase III, controlled, randomized, single blind study. The estimated inclusion period is approximately 24 months. The number of patients required in this monocentric study is 330 (165 per arm).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prevention of Radiation-induced Severe Oral Mucositis in Oral Cavity, Oropharynx, Hypopharynx, and Cavum Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The standard treatment of oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, and cavum cancers is external radiotherapy. However, one of the associated toxicities is the occurrence of mucositis which can be a limiting factor in the treatment (dose reduction or treatment interruption can limit patient's survival), patient's quality of life decreases and severe complications can occur. The treatment of mucositis is mainly symptomatic; a randomized study has shown a benefit of a mouthwash with Benzydamine, a non steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, for patients receiving 50-Gy radiation. Another study with a lower number of patients has also shown a benefit of using a zinc sulfate solution. Boiron laboratories have developed a phytopharmaceutical preparation, Homeodent®, which has no secondary effects and which could prevent radiation-induced mucositis. This study will evaluate the efficiency of mouthwash with Homeodent® in a large randomized trial.</detailed_description>
