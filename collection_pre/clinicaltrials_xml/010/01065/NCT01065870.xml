	<brief_summary>This study is for patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer (cancer that involves the local blood vessels so it cannot be removed without cutting major blood vessels) that cannot be treated with surgery. The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and benefit of 6 three week cycles of chemotherapy treatment consisting of gemcitabine, capecitabine and docetaxel (also called 'GTX'). The patients fall into two groups. Group I are those with only venous involvement. Group II patients have arterial involvement and may also have venous involvement. If there is arterial involvement, GTX will be followed by 5 and 1/2 weeks of radiation therapy with gemcitabine and capecitabine. After the chemotherapy and radiation treatment, participants may be able to have surgery to remove any remaining pancreatic cancer.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the pancreas (When possible the tissue should be evaluated for Kras mutation and the patient evaluated for BRCA and p16 mutations.) Locally advanced disease determined by Endoscopic ultrasound, CT scan (chest/abdomen/pelvis with contrast), MRI scan (of abdomen with gadolinium) or PET scan. No evidence of metastatic disease by CT scan (chest/abdomen/pelvis with contrast), MRI scan (of abdomen with gadolinium) or PET scan. Unresectable tumor. (this reflects those patients whose tumors abut, invade or surround a major vessel, either venous or arterial or both) No prior chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Ineligible for other high priority national or institutional studies. Negative serum or urine βHCG within 1 week of starting treatment for nonpregnant, nonmenopausal females. Must not have other underlying medical conditions that would make them ineligible for surgery, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy.
