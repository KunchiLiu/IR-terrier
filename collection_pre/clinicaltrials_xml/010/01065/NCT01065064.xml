	<brief_title>Visual Performance After RESTOR Implantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To evaluate distance, intermediate, and near vision after aspheric multifocal diffractive AcrySof® ReSTOR SN6AD1 intraocular lens (IOL) implantation. Prospective study of 50 patients with cataract that had phacoemulsification and AcrySof® ReSTOR IOL implantation. Uncorrected distance vision acuity (UDVA), corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA), distance-corrected near visual acuity (DCNVA), and distance-corrected intermediate visual acuity (DCIVA) were measured postoperatively. A patient-satisfaction and visual phenomena questionnaire was administered at the end of the study.</detailed_description>
