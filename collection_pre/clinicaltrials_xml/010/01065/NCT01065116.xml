	<brief_title>Artemether-Lumefantrine (AL) Unit Dose Pre-packs Versus Blister Packs</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prompt and adequate treatment of clinical malaria episodes remains one of the key elements of malaria control and this partly depends on patients' compliance to treatment. Uganda adopted Artemether-Lumefantrine (AL) as first line treatment for uncomplicated malaria. This is available at the health facilities in form of 6 dose pre-packs with different doze strengths in different packages. However, concerns about the costs and stock-outs of these packages have been raised and alternative equally efficacious alternatives need to be determined in order to reduce these problems. This study will assess if AL blister-packs can act as alternatives to the unit dose age specific pre-packs in the public sector</detailed_description>
