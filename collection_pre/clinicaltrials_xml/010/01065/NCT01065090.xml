	<brief_summary>The primary objective of the investigation is to determine whether the addition of exercise (resistance training or modified physiotherapy) improves functional capacity in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) participants undergoing Disease Modifying Therapy (DMT) treatment. We hypothesize that the Progressive Resistance Training (PRT) will improve functional capacity without increasing the risk of relapses in participants undergoing standard DMT treatment. The secondary objectives are to determine whether exercise (resistance training or physiotherapy) improves fatigue, mood and Quality of Life (QoL) in MS participants undergoing DMT treatment. Also as a secondary objective, the study aims at determining whether exercise (resistance training or modified physiotherapy) has an impact on Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), time to first relapse, number of relapse free participants, and immunological factors. We hypothesize that the exercise (resistance training) will improve fatigue, mood and QoL and that an impact on immunological factors will be seen in participants even though they are undergoing standard DMT treatment.</brief_summary>
