	<brief_summary>Intranasal dexmedetomidine has shown to be an effective sedative when used prior to anaesthetic induction as premedication. 1mcg/kg intranasal dexmedetomidine was used in previous study and it produced satisfactory sedation in more than 50% of the children at the time of anaesthetic induction with no adverse effect. In this study we aim to compare 1mcg/kg with 2mcg/kg intranasal dexmedetomidine in children. We expect more children would attain satisfactory sedation prior to anaesthetic induction when higher dose is used.</brief_summary>
