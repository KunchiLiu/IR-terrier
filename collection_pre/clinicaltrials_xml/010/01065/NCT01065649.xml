	<brief_summary>Patients with nonerosive reflux disease (NERD) are less responsive to standard treatment with proton pump inhibitors. The hypothesis of this study was that nortriptyline in analgesic doses may decrease heartburn perception and its corresponding cortical activity measured by magnetic resonance image. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the cortical representation of heartburn in patients with NERD under treatment with nortriptyline and placebo.</brief_summary>
