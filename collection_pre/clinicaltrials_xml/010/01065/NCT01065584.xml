	<brief_summary>In experimental and clinical settings it has been shown that transplant tolerance is possible. It has been suggested that regulatory T cells play a beneficial role in the establishment of tolerance. Calcineurin inhibitors may inhibit development of regulatory T cells. However, the influence of calcineurin inhibitors on markers of transplant tolerance has not been studied in patients undergoing liver transplantation. Currently the investigators conduct a study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a calcineurin inhibitor free immunosuppression in patients undergoing liver transplantation. In this study measurements of immune function and CD4+CD25high-Foxp3+-Il2/CD8+ status will also be performed. In parallel these measurements should be compared to a group of patients undergoing standard immunosuppression including calcineurin inhibitors.</brief_summary>
