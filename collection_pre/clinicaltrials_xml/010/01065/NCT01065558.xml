	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of ecopipam in patients with Lesch-Nyhan Disease (LND). Ecopipam specifically blocks the actions of one chemical in the brain that helps nerves talk to one another; ecopipam does this by stopping the chemical (dopamine) from binding to one of its family of receptors (i.e, the D1 family). LND is a very rare genetic disease. The sponsor is doing this study to find out what side effects ecopipam causes in LND patients, and whether ecopipam may be able to relieve the self-injurious behaviors seen in these patients.</brief_summary>
