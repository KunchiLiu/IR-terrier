	<brief_summary>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a frequent complication of cirrhosis. Occurrence of HCC could be linked with multiple functional region of genome. The determining of a genomic mapping of " single nucleotide polymorphisms " (SNPs) permit to perform some genetic link studies with pathologies without clear hereditary disposition. In this study, the investigators will identify predictives genetic polymorphism of HCC.</brief_summary>
