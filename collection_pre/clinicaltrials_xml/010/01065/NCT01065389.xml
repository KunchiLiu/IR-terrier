	<brief_summary>Dialysis patients usually have peripheral muscle weakness due to metabolic disturbances (increased protein catabolism) and fatigue. This muscle weakness may decrease functional capacity and quality of life. It also serves to increase cardiovascular risk factors in these end stage renal disease patients. Peripheral muscle strength training shall combat physical inactivity during dialysis. In the investigators trial, the investigators hypothesis that peripheral muscle training might regulate protein catabolic rate,renal functions, cardiovascular risk factors, improve functional capacity and quality of life in endstage renal disease patients undergoing dialysis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Resistance Training in Intradialysis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>End stage renal failure patients undergoing dialysis have profound muscle wasting, reduced functional capacity and quality of life due to uremia, steroids, frequent dialysis and fatigue. During dialysis, physical inactivity further deteriorates the patient's functional capacity. Aerobic or strength training may combat this physical inactivity. It may also improve the functional capacity and quality of life. Recent studies have claimed the benefits of resistance exercises in improving functional capacity. But they have not documented effects on kidney function (electrolyte and urea kinetics) and muscle wasting (protein catabolic rate). In our trial, we attempt to study the effects of resistance training in improvement of renal function and muscle wasting apart from functional capacity and quality of life in dialysis patients</detailed_description>
