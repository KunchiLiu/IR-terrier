	<brief_summary>Study AOP 03-007 was designed as a pivotal study to test, if Anagrelide (Thromboreductin®)was not inferior to HU with respect to efficacy in patients with ET. This approach to demonstrate non-inferiority was based on the following decision points: • ET is a rare disease and recruitment of large patient number (&gt; 1600) to prove superiority was not considered possible. . It was decided to recruit only treatment naïve high risk patients to avoid pre-treatment bias, which further limited the number of patients eligible for the study.</brief_summary>
