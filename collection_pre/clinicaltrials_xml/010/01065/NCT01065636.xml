	<brief_summary>Obesity causes frailty in obese older adults by exacerbating the age-related decline in physical function. However, appropriate management of obesity in older adults is controversial. Weight loss without exercise could worsen frailty by accelerating the usual age-related decline in muscle and bone mass that leads to sarcopenia and osteopenia, respectively. Because of the important problem of frailty in obese older adults, it is important to determine the most efficacious approach in reducing, or even reversing frailty in this population. The primary objective of this proposal is to evaluate which distinct type of physical exercise (resistance, aerobic, or combined resistance + aerobic) is most efficacious in preventing the weight-loss-induced reduction in muscle and bone mass and reversing frailty in obese older adults.</brief_summary>
