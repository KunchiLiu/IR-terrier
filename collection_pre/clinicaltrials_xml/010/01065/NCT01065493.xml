	<brief_summary>QuitAdvisorMD: A point-of-care tool for brief smoking cessation interventions Under a Phase II SBIR grant supported by NIH/NIDA, we are developing QUITAdvisorMD: a point-of-care, patient-centered resource for counseling patients who smoke or use tobacco products. It is based on the principles of Motivational Interviewing, a non-confrontational and very effective method for intervening and treating these patients; the 5 A's of behavioral interventions; and the Transtheoretical Model of Change. Through a point and click interface, the tool uses a series of interview questions designed to motivate patients to stop smoking by first assessing their stage of change and then offering effective stage-based interventions and interview techniques. The tool also offers stage-tailored patient information, a clinician educational reference, and the ability to communicate support information patients via email and/or text message.</brief_summary>
