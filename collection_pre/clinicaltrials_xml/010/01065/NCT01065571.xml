	<brief_title>Effects of Carrageenan-Elimination Diet on Ulcerative Colitis Disease Activity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will evaluate the interval to relapse in patients with ulcerative colitis. The patients will be adults, who have been in remission for at least one month. They will have previously required corticosteroids to induce remission. Subjects will be instructed in a no-carrageenan diet and required to follow this diet for the duration of their participation in the clinical study. They will be randomized to receive either placebo capsules or capsules containing carrageenan 100 mg. In this way, the study will be a double blind study of no-carrageenan vs. carrageenan. Main study outcome is the interval to relapse. Since ulcerative colitis is associated with relapses, relapse is anticipated. Other outcome measures will include scores on questionnaires, including the SSCAI and the SIDBQ, and laboratory measurements of inflammation. Subjects will participate for one year or until relapse, with study visits every three months and telephone contacts every two weeks. After three months, participants will increase to two capsules daily, of either placebo or carrageenan.</detailed_description>
