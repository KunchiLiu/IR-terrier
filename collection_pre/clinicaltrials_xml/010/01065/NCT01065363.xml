	<brief_summary>The investigators propose a project of preventive medicine with concern of local context in Taiwan. The target population includes all staff and faculty members, students, and alumni of a university in Northern Taiwan, with chronic hepatitis B infection. The intervention of this project includes standardized lectures, sports courses, nutrition courses, and an information platform. The investigators will evaluate the efficacy after the intervention, like the reduction of hepatitis B viral load and the associated anthropometric parameters. The results of this project will be initially served as a pilot study for this cohort, and applicated as a promising basis for health promotion.</brief_summary>
