	<brief_summary>The Radiotracer 18F-FLT can non-invasively assess excessive cell growth in PET scan images. Tumour growth rate is a useful indicator of tumour aggression and response to treatment. Imaging and measuring the cell growth with 18F-FLT may be useful in monitoring response to anticancer treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Demonstrate the Safety and Preliminary Efficacy of 18F-FLT in Patients With Solid Tumours or Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Clinical trial is a combined Phase I/II imaging, open label, single site study in patients with known or suspected carcinoma of the lung, breast, renal cell, pancreas or brain, and with gastrointestinal malignancies, neuroendocrine tumours, or lymphoma. One 18F-FLT PET scan will be performed in 10 Phase I patients, and pre-injection and post-imaging blood work and vital signs will be collected. Up to 5 18F-FLT PET scans will be performed in 170 Phase II patients.</detailed_description>
