	<criteria>History of coronary artery disease, Stroke Stable heart failure Peripheral vascular disease, or diabetes with at least one other cardiovascular risk factor (hypertension, elevated total cholesterol levels, low highdensity lipoprotein cholesterol levels, cigarette smoking, or documented microalbuminuria). Non stabilized or NYHA grade IV heart failure patients Hemodynamically significant primary valvular or outflow tract obstruction (eg. mitral valve stenosis, asymmetric septal hypertrophy, malfunctioning prosthetic valve) Constrictive pericarditis. Complex congenital heart disease. Syncopal episodes presumed to be due to uncontrolled lifethreatening arrhythmias (asymptomatic cardiac arrhythmias including ventricular tachycardia are not an exclusion criterion). Planned cardiac surgery or angioplasty within 3 months (patient may be reconsidered for the trial after the procedure). Cor pulmonale. Heart transplant recipient. Significant renal disease defined as: Renal artery stenosis; Creatine clearance &lt;0.6 ml/second or serum creatinine≥ 200 mEq/L (≥2.26 mg/dl) Overt nephropathy: ≥1 plus proteinuria on dipstick or urinary albumin excretion &gt; 200 micrograms/minute (300 mg/24 hrs) Hyperkalemia; K&gt;5.5 mEq/L. Patient is simultaneously taking another experimental drug.
