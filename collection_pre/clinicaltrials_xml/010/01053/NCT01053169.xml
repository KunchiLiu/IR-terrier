	<brief_summary>Beriplex® P/N is made from human plasma (the liquid part of the blood) and contains the coagulation factors II, VII, IX and X which are important for blood clotting (coagulation). Lack of any of these factors means that blood does not clot as quickly as it should and so there is an increased tendency to bleed. This observational study was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of Beriplex® P/N in the prevention (prophylaxis) and treatment of bleeding during surgery (perioperative bleeding) in a routine clinical setting.</brief_summary>
