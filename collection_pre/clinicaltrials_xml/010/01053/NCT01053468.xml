	<brief_summary>Breast cancer and its treatments can take a toll on the physical and psychosocial well-being of cancer survivors. Few interventions can help breast cancer patients improve their physical strength, stamina, and overall well-being. Developing ways to facilitate PA behavior during chemotherapy for breast cancer are necessary. This trial explores ways that breast cancer patients receiving chemotherapy can learn about and engage in PA during chemotherapy. This trial will also give Southern Alberta breast cancer survivors an opportunity to participate in evidence-based programs designed to facilitate their health, breast cancer recovery, and disease-free survival. The investigators primary hypothesis is that women receiving the PA intervention resource kit will report a more positive change in self-reported PA at the end of chemotherapy treatments when compared to the group receiving standard materials.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Primary Objective: To compare the effects of an evidence-based intervention consisting of targeted breast-cancer specific PA print materials (i.e., Exercise for health), a step pedometer, a step-walking guidebook (i.e., Step into survivorship), and a physical activity and step journal (INT) to a comparison group receiving a generic, two-page public health PA resource (Standard Material: SM).</detailed_description>
