	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to: - evaluate the effectiveness of percutaneous epidural adhesiolysis in managing chronic low back and/or lower extremity pain in patients without post lumbar surgery syndrome or spinal stenosis and compare with fluoroscopically directed caudal epidural steroid injections. - evaluate and compare the adverse event profile in all groups.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Randomized, Equivalence Trial of Percutaneous Lumbar Adhesiolysis and Caudal Epidural Steroid Injections</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recruitment is indicated in patients with chronic low back pain and/or lower extremity pain without post lumbar laminectomy syndrome or spinal stenosis, non-responsive to conservative therapy with physical therapy, chiropractic, medical therapy, and fluoroscopically directed epidural injections. This is a single-center study performed in an interventional pain management referral center in the United States. The study involves 120 patients assigned to one of 2 groups with 60 patients in each group. Data management analysis includes sample size justification of 40 patients in each group with a power of 80% and a 0.05% 2-sided significance level. Statistical methodology includes chi-squared statistics, Fisher's exact test, t-test, and paired t-test with significance evaluated at P value &lt; 0.05.</detailed_description>
