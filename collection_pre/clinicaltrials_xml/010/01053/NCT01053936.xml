	<brief_title>Phase II Pharmacodynamic Trial to Determine the Effects of Bardoxolone Methyl on eGFR in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes and Chronic Kidney Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bardoxolone methyl (RTA 402) is an Antioxidant Inflammation Modulator (AIM) that is undergoing clinical testing in chronic kidney disease (CKD). Bardoxolone methyl and other AIMs inhibit immune-mediated inflammation by restoring redox homeostasis in inflamed tissues through the induction of the cytoprotective transcription factor Nrf2. In the diabetic population, adipocytes produce cytokines and mobilize free fatty acids which induce insulin resistance. Resultant hyperglycemia and increased cytokine production induces reactive oxygen and nitrogen species which in turn induce vascular inflammation and endothelial dysfunction. These stimuli cause further activation of NF-kB, promoting inflammation, mesangial cell contraction, mesangial expansion and endothelial dysfunction, the end result of which is decreased renal function. By inducing Nrf2 and suppressing redox-driven inflammation, we hypothesize that inflammation and resultant adverse renal functional changes in patients with chronic kidney disease resulting from diabetes can be suppressed. In a Phase IIa open label study of patients with CKD and type 2 diabetes, treatment with bardoxolone methyl for 28 days resulted in significant improvements in renal function, including increases in eGFR, and decreases in serum creatinine, cystatin C, BUN, phosphorus, uric acid, creatinine clearance, and angiotensin II; improvements in glycemic control as assessed by hemoglobin A1c; and improvements in markers of endothelial dysfunction and systemic inflammation, such as circulating endothelial cells and adiponectin. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that bardoxolone methyl improves renal function through suppression of renovascular oxidative stress and inflammation. A new formulation of bardoxolone methyl has been developed, which is the same chemical entity but manufactured to contain an amorphous dispersion rather than a crystalline solid state. The new amorphous dispersion formulation of bardoxolone methyl has been shown to be more orally bioavailable in non-human primates. The purpose of this study is to determine the appropriate dose of the new bardoxolone methyl formulation to use in future clinical studies by determining the dose response relationship on eGFR.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Patients must have a history of type 2 diabetes; diagnosis of type 2 diabetes should have been made at &gt;30 years of age (if diabetes developed at a younger age, Cpeptide level may be obtained to confirm diagnosis); 2. Patients must be at least 18 years of age; 3. The average of 2 eGFR values collected during screening must be within 15 45 mL /min/1.73m2 inclusive. 4. Patients must be receiving an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and/or an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) for at least 8 weeks prior to screening, where the dose of the ACE inhibitor or the ARB is considered appropriate for that patient, and the patient has been stable and maintained on that dose for at least 8 weeks prior to randomization (Day 1). No change in ACE or ARB therapy should be anticipated or planned for the period of the study. 5. Male and female patients must agree to use effective contraception during the entire study period and for at least 2 months after the last dose of study drug, unless documentation of infertility exists 6. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test result at screening and a confirmed negative urine pregnancy test result prior to administration of the first dose of study medication; 7. Patient is willing and able to cooperate with all aspects of the protocol; 8. Patient is willing and able to give written informed consent for study participation 1. Any patient with Type 1 (insulindependent; juvenile onset) diabetes; or any history of diabetic ketoacidosis; 2. Any patient with known nondiabetic renal disease, family history of a hereditary form of kidney disease, or patients with a history of a renal transplant. 3. Any patient with clinical or renal biopsy evidence of any nondiabetic renal disease other than nephrosclerosis; 4. Any patient with blood pressure (BP) that is unable to be controlled to a systolic pressure (SeSBP) &lt;160 mmHg and a diastolic pressure (SeDBP) of &lt;90 mmHg. BP will be determined by the average of 3 readings, taken after being seated for at least 5minutes. BP must be within this range taken at 2 separate timepoints at least 4 days apart during the screening period; 5. Any patient with Hemoglobin A1c level &gt;10% collected at screening; 6. Any patient with cardiovascular disease as follows: 1. Unstable angina pectoris within 3 months before study randomization; 2. Myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass graft surgery, or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty/stent within 3 months before study randomization; 3. Transient ischemic attack within 3 months before study randomization; 4. Cerebrovascular accident within 3 months before study randomization; 5. Obstructive valvular heart disease or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; 6. 2nd degree or 3rd degree atrioventricular block not successfully treated with a pacemaker; 7. Current diagnosis of Class III or IV congestive heart failure ; 7. Any patient with QTc Fredericia interval &gt; 450 milliseconds as determined by the average of values reported by a central reader from 3 ECGs taken at the Screening Visit. 8. Any patient with need for chronic (&gt;2 weeks) immunosuppressive therapy, including corticosteroids (excluding intraarticular injections inhaled or nasal steroids) within 3 months prior to randomization; 9.
