	<brief_summary>The study is conducted as a randomized, non-blinded, 2-way crossover study. Target population is 60 Japanese healthy male adult subjects selected by screening examination which will be conducted within 4 weeks before the first drug administration of period 1 (before the hospitalization of period 1). Subjects will admit in the clinical institute on Day -3 and be discharged on Day 6 in each period. During hospitalization, standardized phosphate diet from Day -2 to Day 4 will start approximately 20 minutes before dosing. Subject will take about 1300 mg of phosphate evenly at breakfast lunch and dinner for each day. Subject should consume at least 95% of a meal. Distilled water not to include phosphate will be used for drinking water and meal. Subjects are to drink at least 1 L of distilled water every day in clinic to make sure enough urine volume. The 24 hours urine collection will be conducted between Day -2 and Day 4 to investigate the urinary phosphate excretion.BAY77-1931 granule 500 mg or Fosrenol chewable tablet 500 mg will be administered three times daily after each meal from Day 1 to Day 4. On day 4 single dose after breakfast will be administered. Study drugs will be administered immediately after each meal, that is within 20 minutes after start of each meal with 240 mL of distilled water. A Fosrenol chewable tablet 500 mg will be taken after chewing completely.</brief_summary>
