	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and immunogenicity of one dose of A/H1N1 non-adjuvanted pandemic vaccine to support registration of the vaccine in India. Primary Objective: - To describe the safety profile (injection site reactions and systemic events) of the vaccine within 21 days following vaccination, and serious adverse events throughout the study in all subjects Secondary Objectives: - To describe the immune response to the vaccine 21 days after vaccination by hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) testing in all subjects - To describe the antibody persistence 6 months after vaccination by HAI testing in all subjects.</brief_summary>
