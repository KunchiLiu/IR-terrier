	<brief_summary>This open-label study will assess the pharmacokinetics and safety of oseltamivir [Tamiflu] in 3 cohorts of infants, aged 0-30 days, 31-90 days and 91-&lt;365 days with influenza infection. Patients will receive 10 doses of intravenous oseltamivir [Tamiflu] therapy over 5 or 6 days. Optional oral therapy with oseltamivir [Tamiflu] may be considered following the intravenous dose associated with pharmacokinetic blood sampling. Evidence of continued virus shedding at day 6 can allow for up to 5 additional days (10 doses) of oral or intravenous administration. Anticipated time on study drug is 5-11 days. Target sample size is &lt;50 patients.</brief_summary>
