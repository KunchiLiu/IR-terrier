	<brief_title>Role of Steroids and 10% Hypertonic Sodium Chloride in Adhesiolysis in Post Lumbar Surgery Syndrome Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recruitment is indicated in patients with chronic low back pain and lower extremity pain secondary to post lumbar laminectomy syndrome, non-responsive to conservative therapy with physical therapy, chiropractic, medical therapy, and fluoroscopically directed epidural injections. This is a single-center, prospective, randomized, double-blind, equivalence, controlled trial performed in an interventional pain management referral center in the United States. The study involves 240 patients studied in 4 groups with 60 patients in each group. Randomization includes sequence generation, allocation concealment, implementation, and blinding. Data management analysis includes sample size justification of 40 patients in each group with a power of 80% and a 0.05% 2-sided significance level. Statistical methodology includes chi-squared statistics, Fisher's exact test, t-test, and paired t-test with significance evaluated at P value &lt; 0.05.</detailed_description>
