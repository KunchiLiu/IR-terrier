	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study in patients with type 2 diabetes was to investigate the acute effect of postprandial blood glucose levels modified by two different insulin treatment regimens on coagulation activation, inflammation and endothelial cell function. The investigators hypothesized that the rapid-acting insulin analogue aspart has a beneficial postprandial effect on coagulation, endothelial dysfunction and inflammation compared with the intermediate-acting insulin NPH due to its ability to lower postprandial glycaemia.</brief_summary>
