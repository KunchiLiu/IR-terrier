	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: - To establish initial safety/tolerability and pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profiles of four formulations of SAR161271 in patients with T1DM. Secondary Objective: - To establish relative potency of SAR161271 compared with insulin glargine in patients with T1DM</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of How Single Rising Doses of SAR161271 Are Absorbed and Act in Patients With Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The total per patient is between 31 and 67 days; including post-study visit between 108 and 172 days. In case of an additional late post-study visit after last dosing, approximately 213 to 279 days, broken down as follows: - Screening: 3 to 27 days; - Treatment Periods each 1 day with institutionalisation from Day -1 to Day 3; - Wash-out between doses: 7 to 10 days; - End of Study visit: 7 to 10 days after last dose. - Post-study visit 84 to 112 days after last dosing. If necessary, additional post-study visit 6 to 7 months after last dosing.</detailed_description>
