	<brief_summary>This study will examine the magnitude and time course of changes in circulating (serum and plasma) biomarker concentrations associated with musculoskeletal injury created by total knee replacement surgery. The sensitivity to injury will be characterized by the changes in mean serum concentration before and after surgery. Specificity for the injured state will be evaluated comparing the baseline to peak change (injury response) with the pre-surgery to follow-up baseline fluctuation (i.e. measurement noise).</brief_summary>
