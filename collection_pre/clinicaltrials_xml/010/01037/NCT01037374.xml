	<brief_title>Anticipation of the Difficult Airway: the Preoperative Airway Assessment Form</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Predicting difficult airway continues to be problematic for even the most seasoned of anesthesiologists. In our study, the resident class will be our sample population. The residents will be randomly assigned into two groups: the experimental group will be utilizing the new preoperative airway assessment form and the control group will be utilizing the standard anesthesia record. Simultaneously, a subset of our anesthesia experts will also be assessing patients preoperatively. The five areas of difficult airway management will be considered: difficult mask ventilation, difficult supraglottic airway, difficult laryngoscopy, difficult intubation, and difficult surgical airway. According to the American Society of Anesthesiologists, the incidence of intubation has remained stable throughout the 1980s and 1990s despite attempts to predict its occurrence. Many of these cases were considered to be preventable; therefore, a better prediction of and preparation for difficult airway management may lead to a reduction in adverse events.</detailed_description>
