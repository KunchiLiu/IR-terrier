	<brief_summary>Abstract Background Pro-inflammatory cytokines play a pivotal role in osteoarthritis, as well as in bone tunnel widening after ACL reconstructive surgery. A new treatment option is to administer autologous conditioned serum (ACS) containing endogenous anti-inflammatory cytokines including IL-1Ra and growth factors (IGF-1, PDGF and TGF-ß1, among others) in the liquid blood phase. Objective The purpose of this trial was to establish whether the osteoclastic effect could be affected by intra-articular application of ACS, thus resulting in a potential decrease of knee laxity and leading to a better postoperative outcome. Methods In a prospective, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial with two parallel groups, 62 patients were treated. Bone tunnel width was measured by CT scans, while clinical efficacy was assessed by patient-administered outcome instruments (WOMAC, IKDC 2000) up to one year following the ACL reconstruction in patients receiving either ACS (Group A) or placebo (Group B). The investigators compared the levels and dynamics of IL-1b concentrations in the synovial liquid and examined the correlation between the levels of IL-1b at three different post-operative points. Level of evidence Therapeutic study, Level 1 (randomized controlled trial [significant differences and narrow confidence intervals])</brief_summary>
