	<brief_summary>This trial is to determine the safety of valacyclovir in persons with chronic hepatitis C and herpes simplex type 2 infection. Participants will be randomized to valacyclovir or matching placebo. After receiving the initial therapy for eight weeks, the participants will cross over to the alternate therapy for an additional eight weeks. Each treatment period will be separated by a two-week period of daily placebo. The hypothesis is that treatment with valacyclovir will result in a significant reduction in serum levels of hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid.</brief_summary>
