	<brief_summary>To analyse the impact on cycle outcome of LH supplementation in ovarian stimulation controlled with a GnRH antagonist in two ages groups: patients upto 35 years old, and patients aged between 36 and 39 years old.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Luteinizing Hormone (LH) Supplementation in Gonadotropin-releasing Hormone (GnRH) Antagonist Cycles</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All patients received an oral contraceptive pill with 0.030 mg of ethinyl-estradiol and 3.0 mg of drospirenone the cycle prior to ovarian stimulation. On the second day of menstruation, patients started ovarian stimulation as follows: Patients &lt; 36: 225 IU/day of recombinant FSH (FSH alone group) or 150 IU of rFSH and 75 IU of rLH/day (FSH+LH group) for 5 days. On day 6, a 0.25 mg/day dose of the GnRH antagonist Cetrorelix is added until the day of rCG administration. Patients 36-39: Initial dose of 300 IU of rFSH /day (FSH alone group)) or 225 IU of rFSH and 75 IU of rLH/day (FSH + LH group) for 5 days. On day 6, a 0.25 mg/day dose of the GnRH antagonist Cetrorelix is added until the day of rCG administration. A maximum of 3 embryos were transferred on day 3 of embryo development.</detailed_description>
