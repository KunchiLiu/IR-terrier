	<brief_summary>This study is designed to provide efficacy and safety data in patients with choroidal neovascularisation (CNV) secondary to myopia using an individualized as-needed (PRN) dosing schedule. Eligible patients who have provided written agreement to take part in the study will receive an intravitreal (into the study eye) injection of ranibizumab 0.5mg. Following eye examinations and tests at monthly clinic visits, the study doctor will repeat the injections on a monthly basis as required for an additional 11 months, in accordance with specified retreatment criteria. Patients will be in the study for approximately 12 months and will visit the hospital clinic 14 times over that period. The main assessments will include visual acuity tests, eye examinations, optical coherence tomography (OCT) to assess retinal thickness, fundus photography and fluorescein angiography (FA), measurement of intraocular pressure, blood pressure and pulse measurements and completion of health-related questionnaires'.</brief_summary>
