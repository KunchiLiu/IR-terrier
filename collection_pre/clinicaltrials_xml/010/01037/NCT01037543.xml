	<detailed_description>Secondary objectives: - to assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) of a single subcutaneous dose of HM10460A. - to compare the PK of HM10460A in Japanese and Caucasian subjects. - to assess the relationship between the serum concentration of HM10460A and absolute neutrophil count (ANC). - to assess the relationship between the serum concentration of HM10460A and CD34+ cell counts in the blood. - To assess the immunogenicity potential of HM10460A by measuring binding antibodies (bAb) and neutralizing antibodies (nAb) to HM10460A and native G-CSF following a single subcutaneous dose of HM10460A.</detailed_description>
