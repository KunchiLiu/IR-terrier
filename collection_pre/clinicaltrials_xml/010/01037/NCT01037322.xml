	<brief_summary>There are many anecdotal reports about improvement of Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) with cannabis smoking. The most effective anti inflammatory compound known today is cannabidiol. cannabidiol can be extracted from the cannabis plant, it has no central effect and is fat soluble so it can be given as drops in oil. Doses of up to 500mg did not cause any side effects. The aim of the proposed study is to examine in a double blind placebo controlled fashion the effect of cannabidiol on disease activity in patients with IBD.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cannabidiol for Inflammatory Bowel Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are relatively common disease with a rising incidence. Treatment includes various immunocompromising agents including corticosteroids, immunomodulators and biologic agents. Current treatment is not always effective and has many side effect. Cannabinoids have been known to have anti inflammatory effect, probably via the CB2 receptor. There are many anecdotal reports of cannabinoids in inflammatory disease such as rheumatoid arthritis, and the impression is that cannabinoids do have an ameliorating effect on IBD and that side effects are negligible. However, there are no placebo controled trials in human subjects. The cannabis plant contains about 600 ingredients, and it is not known which are the active ingredients affecting IBD. The most effective anti inflammatory compound known today is cannabidiol. Cannabidiol can be extracted from the cannabis plant, it has no central effect and is fat soluble so it can be given as drops in oil. Doses of up to 500mg did not cause any side effects. The aim of the proposed study is to examine in a double blind placebo controlled fashion the effect of cannabidiol on disease activity in patients with IBD.</detailed_description>
