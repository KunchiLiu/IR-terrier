	<brief_title>Comedy in Chemotherapy (COMIC) Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients were recruited from the Outpatient Oncology (OPO) clinic at QMC. After signing an informed consent, patients receiving intravenous chemotherapy were randomly assigned to view a 45-minute humorous DVD or non-humorous DVD. The following measurements were obtained before and after patients viewed the DVD: Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS) and the state portion of the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Index (STAI-S) to assess symptoms related to cancer and chemotherapy, salivary immunoglobulin A (IgA) to assess immune function and salivary cortisol to assess emotional stress. In addition, patients, caregivers, and nurses were asked open-ended questions after the intervention to ascertain their impression of the overall intervention experience. Multiple analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) were be used to analyze changes in ESAS, STAI-S, IgA and cortisol within and between the two groups.</detailed_description>
