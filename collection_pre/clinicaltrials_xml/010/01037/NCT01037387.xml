	<brief_summary>Parallel, randomized and controlled clinical trial to evaluate the effect of 12 months of noninvasive mechanical ventilation versus conventional treatment in hypercapnic patients with stable COPD. Main objective: To evaluate the effect of 12 months of noninvasive ventilation on c-reactive protein concentration and daily physical activity in hypercapnic patients with stable COPD. Secondary objectives: To compare the plasmatic concentration of other inflammatory biomarkers between COPD patients with conventional treatment and wich noninvasive ventilation. To determine the response of breathlessness, health-related quality of life and lung function to noninvasive ventilation. To identify the COPD patients with a higher gasometric and clinic response to noninvasive ventilation.</brief_summary>
