	<brief_summary>Type 2 diabetes is associated with diabetic dyslipidemia, which is a major risk factor for coronary heart disease. Triglycerides (TG) and cholesterol are transported in the system of lipoproteins, and the metabolism of these lipids in plasma is closely interrelated. Evidence suggests that increased concentration of very low-density lipoprotein triglyceride (VLDL-TG) is a central pathophysiological feature of the lipid and lipoprotein abnormalities in diabetic dyslipidemia. The objective of this study was to investigate VLDL-TG kinetics and aspects of peripheral VLDL-TG metabolism, i.e. to what extent VLDL-TG associated fatty acids (FA) are oxidized or deposited in regional adipose tissue, in subjects with type 2 diabetes and healthy controls in the postabsorptive state and during acute hyperinsulinemia using ex-vivo labeled VLDL-TG tracers.</brief_summary>
