	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to determine whether greater rectal cancer downstaging and regression occurs when surgery is delayed to 12 weeks after completion of radiotherapy/chemotherapy compared to 6 weeks. Hypothesis: Greater downstaging and tumour regression is observed when surgery is delayed to 12 weeks after completion of CRT compared to 6 weeks.</brief_summary>
