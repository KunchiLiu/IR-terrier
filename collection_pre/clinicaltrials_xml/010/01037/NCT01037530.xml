	<brief_summary>The investigators are conducting a randomised controlled trial to investigate the clinical and cost effectiveness of Ramipril which is an anti-hypertensive medication in patients with intermittent claudication. The investigators aim to recruit 78 participants in total. The investigators will randomise the 78 participants into two groups: Ramipril group with 39 participants and Placebo group with 39 participants. The investigators will measure Ramipril's effect on walking by doing a simple treadmill test and measuring the maximum walking distance the participant can walk. The investigators also want to examine Ramipril's effect on arterial function, cardiovascular prognosis, quality of life and cost effectiveness.</brief_summary>
