	<brief_summary>Neuralgic pain caused by entrapment of peripheral nerves is an often overlooked cause of chronic pelvic pain. The objective of the present study was to assess pain and quality of life in women with pain caused by entrapment of the ilioinguinal nerve, iatrogenic after surgery but also found without previous surgery. In a controlled prospective cross-over study 19 women were randomized either to medical treatment or to resection of the nerve. Statistically significant improvements were found after surgical resection.</brief_summary>
