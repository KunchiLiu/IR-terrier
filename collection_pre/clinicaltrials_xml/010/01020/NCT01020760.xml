	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of postoperative posturing on the outcome of macular hole surgery. Current practice is divided; some individuals are advised to posture face-down for 10 days and others are advised that posturing is unnecessary. By evaluating the effect of posturing in a prospective randomised controlled trial the investigators hope to determine best practice, enabling surgeons and patients to make informed decisions regarding postoperative management.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Protocol for RCT of Posturing in Phacovitrectomy for Full Thickness Macular Hole (FTMH)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description />
	<mesh_term>Retinal Perforations</mesh_term>
	<criteria>1. Patients having surgery for idiopathic full thickness macular hole 2. Able and willing to posture facedown for 10 days postoperatively 3. Agree to participate in the trial and able to give informed consent 1. History of visual loss suggesting a duration of macular hole greater than 12 months 2. Patients unable or unwilling to posture facedown for 10 days postoperatively 3. History of trauma that may have been causative 4. Age less than 16 years (in practice idiopathic macular hole is extremely rare in patients under 30 years). 5. Previous vitrectomy surgery 6. Additional retinal breaks occurring during surgery that necessitate postoperative posturing to prevent retinal detachment.</criteria>
