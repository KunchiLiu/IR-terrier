	<brief_summary>The investigators propose a prospective randomized 2 arm parallel observer-blinded phase II clinical study comparing a distinct method of upper cervical chiropractic manipulation to a sham technique in 50 individuals with stage I hypertension (systolic blood pressure (SBP): 140-159 mm Hg; diastolic blood pressure (DBP):90-99 mm Hg).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Chiropractic for Hypertension in Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>More than 50 million Americans suffer from hypertension, a disease with far-reaching public health impact causing or contributing to 7.1 million deaths yearly at an estimated annual incremental direct cost of $54 billion per year. Common treatments include antihypertensive medications and lifestyle modifications. While these treatments have been shown to be effective, only about 30% of hypertensive patients achieve blood pressure goals. Based on a recently published study (Bakris et al, 2007), one unique non-pharmaceutical approach may be a non-rotary type of upper cervical spinal manipulation to align the first cervical vertebra (atlas) performed by a doctor of chiropractic. We propose to conduct a similar study with a more commonly known chiropractic technique called Toggle Recoil. We propose a prospective randomized 2 arm parallel observer-blinded phase II clinical study comparing a distinct method of upper cervical chiropractic manipulation to a sham technique in 50 (25 in each group) individuals with Stage I hypertension (systolic blood pressure (SBP); 140-159 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP):90-99 mm Hg). Patients will be seen by doctors of chiropractic twice each week for 6 weeks and outcomes will be collected at baseline, 3 weeks, and 6 weeks after enrollment. The primary outcome measure will be change in SBP and the primary endpoint will be at the week 6 assessment.</detailed_description>
