	<brief_title>Effect of Music Therapy on Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The "U" technique is a music therapy method of recent use developed by taking into account recommendations of the scientific literature. The objective of the study is to evaluate this method on chronic painful patients presenting a lumbago, a fibromyalgia, an inflammatory or neurological pathology. During the hospitalization, the intervention group benefited from at least 2 daily sessions of music therapy between day 0 and day 10, and continued the musicotherapy at home until day 60. The evaluated criteria are pain, depression and anxiety and their evolution after 60 days of treatment (since the inclusion). The evaluation at day 90 allows to test the persistence of the effect of the music therapy 90 days later.</detailed_description>
