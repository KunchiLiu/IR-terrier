	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of an initial hormonal treatment gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH Agonist) on 2 biomarkers (PCA3 and TMPRSS2-ERG), in patients with histologically confirmed and advanced stages of prostate cancer. Their characteristics, according to risk factors such as PSA and Gleason score will be determined at baseline and 1, 3 and 6 month post-treatment.</brief_summary>
