	<brief_title>Neuroprotective Study of Electroacupuncture Pretreatment in Patients Undergoing Cardiac Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Heart valve replacement surgery has been proved to be an effective method in treating both regenerative and rheumatic valve disease. Current studies showed that cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and operation related cerebral injury is associated with worse patient morbidity and mortality after elective valve replacement surgery. Recently, Electroacupuncture (EA) pretreatment was proved to produced cerebral protective effects by mimicking ischemic preconditioning in animal models. However, the evidence that EA pretreatment can improve the clinical outcomes such as mortality and morbidity, is still lacking. The investigators perform a randomized controlled study to evaluate that EA pretreatment can improve the outcomes of cardiac surgery. Purpose: The purpose of this study is to examine if EA pretreatment can decrease the mortality and postoperative cerebrovascular complications in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. The effect will be assessed by mortality, scores of neurological defect, post operative cognitive dysfunction and stroke. Methods: Study patients will be randomized to cardiac surgery with EA pretreatment or conventional cardiac surgery in the Department of cardiovascular surgery, Xijing Hospital. EA pretreatment is performed at Baihui acupoint 30 min per day 5 consecutive days before the heart valve replacement surgeryï¼ŽPrimary study outcome is cerebrovascular complications within 6 postoperative months. Secondary outcomes include the S-100B and NSE blood level measured during the first 72 hours of surgery follow-up, the several cytokines, including TNF-a, IL-8, IL-6, IL-10 and HMGB-1 blood level measured during the first 7 days of surgery follow-up, all cardiovascular haemodynamic parameters as measured by a pulmonary artery catheter, the length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay and length of postoperative hospital stay.</detailed_description>
