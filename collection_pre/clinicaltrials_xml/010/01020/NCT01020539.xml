	<detailed_description>Gemtuzumab Ozogamicin (CMA-676) is a chemotherapeutic agent consisting of a recombinant humanized anti-CD33 antibody conjugated with calicheamicin, a highly potent cytotoxic antitumor antibiotic. The antibody portion of Gemtuzumab binds specifically to the CD33 antigen, a sialic acid-dependent adhesion protein expressed on the surface of leukemic blasts, normal and leukemic myeloid colony-forming cells, including leukemic clonogenic precursors, but excluding pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells and nonhematopoietic cells. This results in formation of a complex that is internalized, upon which the calicheamicin derivative is released within the lysosomes of the myeloid cell. The free calicheamicin derivative then binds to deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), resulting in DNA double strand breaks and consequential cell death. Over 80% of AML patients possess myeloid blast cells with CD33 surface antigen expression.</detailed_description>
