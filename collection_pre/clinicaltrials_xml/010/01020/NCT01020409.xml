	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to evaluate a clinically and economically most effective diagnostic algorithm for prediction of inflammatory response related complications in patients undergoing heart surgery with use of cardiopulmonary bypass.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>INFLACOR - Clinical and Genetic Predictors of Inflammation Related Complications After Heart Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Identified so far predictors of mortality and/or morbidity in patients who undergo heart surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), used in previous risk prediction models (EUROSCORE, CABDEAL, Cleveland), will be compared with new candidate variables: 1. anamnestic: recent tooth extractions, chronic inflammatory diseases, specific drug use; 2. biochemical: C-reacting protein, interleukin-6, tumor necrosing factor alpha; 3. genetical: single nucleotide polymorphisms of 10 genes associated with inflammatory response; and 4. clinical from the 1. postoperative day: systemic inflammatory response syndrome, APACHE-III score; against their predictive capability of selected clinical phenotypes of inflammatory response occuring after surgery, beginning from day 2. after surgery.</detailed_description>
