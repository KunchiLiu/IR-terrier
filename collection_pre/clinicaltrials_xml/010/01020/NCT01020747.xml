	<brief_summary>This phase I single center open labeled study is planned to assess the safety and tolerability of bevacizumab for treating patients with bilateral Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis (RRP). Approximately 20 patients will receive bevacizumab directly injected into the vocal folds. Patients who enroll in the protocol will be injected with bevacizumab in one vocal fold that represents the more diseased of the two folds. A sham injection with saline will be administered to the other vocal fold as the control. This therapy will be administered once every 6 ± 1 week for 6 months, with the same vocal fold selected for the initial treatment always getting the drug injection. The investigator will also treat lesions by laser photoangiolysis of both vocal folds using the 532 nm potassium-titanyl-phosphate (KTP) laser.</brief_summary>
