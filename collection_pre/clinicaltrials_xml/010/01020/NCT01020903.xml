	<brief_summary>Anesthesia, especially for laparoscopic surgery, can cause post-operative nausea and vomiting. Most patients are given two drugs, decadron and ondansetron, to try to minimize this. This study is to determine if a new drug, aprepitant, would add any benefit in terms of post-op nausea prevention. All laparoscopic cholecystectomy study patients will receive decadron and ondansetron. Half the patients will receive aprepitant in addition. The other half will receive placebo. The study will be randomized and double-blind.</brief_summary>
