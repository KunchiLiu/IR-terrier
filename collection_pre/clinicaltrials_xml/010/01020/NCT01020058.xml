	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the frequency of long-term post operative pain after an open mesh repair ad modum Lichtenstein performed in local anaesthesia to that after an totally extraperitoneal laparoscopic repair (TEP) for primary inguinal hernia. The investigators will also be assessing the cost for the procedures and hospital care as well as the cost for sick-leave depending on procedure performed. The study hypothesis is that the laparoscopic approach will be associated with less long term post operative pain.</brief_summary>
