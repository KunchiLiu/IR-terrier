	<brief_summary>This trial will be conducted to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of SUNITINIB as add-on therapy with a widely used second-line palliative FOLFIRI chemotherapy in patients with chemo-refractory advanced or metastatic adenocarcinoma of stomach or lower esophagus (mGC). There is a clear scientific rationale for the use of Sunitinib to treat patients with mGC. Despite recent therapeutic advances, the median overall survival (OS) in patients with mG is still â‰¤ 12 months. Therefore, newer agents with novel mechanisms of action are desperately needed for treatment of these patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sunitinib in Patients With Advanced Gastric Cancer and Treated With FOLFIRI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In parallel to the efforts in front-line therapy, second-line protocols like irinotecan-based regimens have been established in clinical trials for those patients. As many patients are still in good performance status and present with low tumor burden after failure of first-line chemotherapy, they clearly benefit from second-line treatment. Sunitinib inhibits the receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) involved in tumor proliferation and angiogenesis, specifically the VEGFR, PDGFR, KIT, FLT-3, and RET. The VEGF pathway has been shown to be a significant factor in metastatic gastric cancer. The safety and efficacy of Sunitinib as single agent for the treatment of mGC has been determined and support the proposed clinical study with FOLFIRI in combination with Sunitinib in the treatment of patients with mGC. Patients included in this trial suffer from advanced or metastatic adenocarcinoma of stomach or lower esophagus. They have failed to respond at least to one standard palliative first-line therapy (based on docetaxel and/or cisplatin plus 5-FU). Irinotecan/FA/5-FU can be determined as one established second-line treatment to be available for these patients. Taken together, treatment of those patients with Sunitinib combined with standard chemotherapy FOLFIRI offers the chance to benefit from a new innovative therapy with acceptable side effects.</detailed_description>
