	<brief_title>Salivary Flow Rate and Oral Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hyposalivation may damage oral functions. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate whether patients under hyposalivation present damaged mastication and speech. Forty subjects composed 2 groups: Control (C) and hyposalivation (H). Masticatory performance (MP) was carried out using artificial material and a 10-sieve method. Mandibular movements during speech were obtained using a 3D jaw-tracking device. Neither mastication nor speech have been impaired by low salivary flow rate.</detailed_description>
