	<criteria>Females, no childbearing potential or negative urine pregnancy test on day of BAY949172 injection Exhibits visual, auditory, and communicative capabilities adequate to provide informed consent or assent and comply with study procedures Is willing and able to lie down in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) scanners Is willing to donate their brain for postmortem examination in case of death The subject, or the subject and/or legally acceptable representative will be compliant and have a high probability of completing the study in the opinion of the investigator Has been fully informed about the study, including provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), as applicable, and informed consent or assent has been signed and dated (with time) by the subject and/or the subject's legally acceptable representative The subjects who have participated in a previous florbetaben study e.g. study 311741 may be included in the present study. The MRI and florbetaben PET scan do not need to be repeated if both scans were performed within twelve months prior to inclusion. Has severe cerebral macrovascular (ie, multistroke) disease or brain tumor (metastasis/brain cancer) as verified by MRI Has any contraindication to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination, eg, metal implants or phobia as determined by the onsite radiologist performing the scan Has been previously enrolled in this study or participated in a clinical study involving an investigational pharmaceutical product within 30 days prior to screening and/or was administered a radiopharmaceutical within 10 radioactive halflives prior to study drug administration in this study Has severe cardiovascular instability requiring intensive care surveillance and/or therapeutic intervention (i.e. catecholamine infusion)</criteria>
