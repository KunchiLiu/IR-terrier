	<brief_summary>The use of paravertebral catheters is a recommended technique to achieve postoperative analgesia after thoracic surgery. To date there is no consensus on which drug regime (local anesthetics with or without opioid) is best. The aim of this prospective clinical trial is to determine wether the use of ropivacaine and sufentanil injected through a thoracic paravertebral catheter results in decreased acute postoperative pain compared with plain ropivacaine in patients after thoracoscopic lung surgery.</brief_summary>
