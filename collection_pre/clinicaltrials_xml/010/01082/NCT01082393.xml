	<brief_summary>We will investigate the process of vitiligo induction and the influence of different commonly used cream treatments on this process. Studies comparing different treatments for vitiligo in the induction stage of the disease are still missing. The study hypothesis = cream treatment can stop actively spreading vitiligo lesions during the early induction stage of the disease.</brief_summary>
