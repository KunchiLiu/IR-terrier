	<brief_summary>This pilot study is examining the feasibility of a primary care and a specialist treatment (methadone clinic) model of treatment for 15 offenders who are part of two community supervision programs: Drug Court and the Treatment Alternative Program (TAP) in Dane County. The questions addressed by future larger studies based upon the current pilot-feasibility study will center around whether access to primary health care as opposed to more traditional methadone treatment services will improve the health and criminal justice outcomes for participants.</brief_summary>
