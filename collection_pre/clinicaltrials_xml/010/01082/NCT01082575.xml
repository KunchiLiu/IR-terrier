	<brief_summary>The pain medication given after major surgery may cause some patients to stop breathing for periods of time especially at night time. An oxygen monitor may reflect this abnormal breathing pattern. This is an observational study of 100 post-operative patients who will be monitored with a pulse oximeter for a minimum of two nights and a maximum of five nights to determine the prevalence of this abnormal breathing pattern.</brief_summary>
