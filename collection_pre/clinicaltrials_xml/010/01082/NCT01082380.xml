	<criteria>Healthy male subjects between the ages of 18 and 55 years, inclusive (Healthy is defined as no clinically relevant abnormalities identified by a detailed medical history, full physical examination, including blood pressure and pulse rate measurement, 12 lead ECG and clinical laboratory tests). Body Mass Index (BMI) of 17.5 to 30.5 kg/m^2; and a total body weight &gt;50 kg (110 lbs). Evidence or history of clinically significant hematological, renal, endocrine, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, psychiatric, neurologic, or allergic disease (including drug allergies, but excluding untreated, asymptomatic, seasonal allergies at time of dosing). Any condition possibly affecting drug absorption (eg, gastrectomy). A positive urine drug screen.</criteria>
