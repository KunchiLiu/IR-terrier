	<brief_title>Multicenter Transplant Study for Fanconi Anemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The trial proposed is a single arm phase II multicenter treatment protocol designed to examine engraftment, toxicity, graft-versus-host disease, and ultimate disease-free survival following a novel cytoreductive regimen including busulfan, cyclophosphamide and fludarabine and ATG (Anti-thymocyte globulin)for the treatment of patients with Fanconi anemia who have severe aplastic anemia (SAA), or myelodysplastic syndrome(MDS) or acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), lacking HLA-genotypically (HLA = human leukocyte antigen) identical donors using stem cell transplants derived from HLA-compatible unrelated donors or HLA haplotype-mismatched related donors using Miltenyi's CliniMACS.</detailed_description>
