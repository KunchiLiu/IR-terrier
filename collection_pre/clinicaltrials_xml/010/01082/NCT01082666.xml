	<brief_title>Continuous Control of Tracheal Cuff Pressure and Microaspiration in Critically Ill Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Randomized controlled open label study, performed in a 10-bed ICU. All patients intubated with a PVC-cuffed tracheal tube and receiving enteral nutrition who require at least 48 h of mechanical ventilation are eligible. Patients receive continuous control of cuff pressure using a pneumatic device (intervention group) or manual control using a manometer (control group). Target cuff pressure is 25 cmH2O. In all patients, pepsin is measured in tracheal aspirate during a 48-h period after inclusion, as proxy for gastric content aspiration. In addition tracheobronchial colonization and ventilator associated pneumonia rates will be compared between the two groups.</detailed_description>
