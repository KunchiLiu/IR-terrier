	<brief_title>Effect of Febuxostat on Renal Function in Patients With Gout and Moderate to Severe Renal Impairment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Gout is caused by high levels of uric acid in the body, and is associated with a broad range of conditions including heart disease, chronic kidney disease and high blood pressure. Hyperuricemia, which is defined as an elevation in serum urate levels, develops into gout when urate crystals form in the body and settle in joints and other organs. Approximately 40-60% of patients with hyperuricemia and gout have some degree of renal impairment. Hyperuricemia has long been associated with renal disease, and chronic hyperuricemia as seen in gout can lead to deposition of urate crystals resulting in diminished renal function. This study will evaluate the effect of febuxostat on the renal function of patients with hyperuricemia and gout and moderate to severe renal impairment. All participants must have an average sitting blood pressure measurement less than 160 mmHg systolic and less than 95 mmHg diastolic. All participants must meet the American Rheumatism Association (ARA) diagnostic criteria for gout (subjects with tophi were excluded). Participants are expected to return to the site for approximately 10 visits.</detailed_description>
