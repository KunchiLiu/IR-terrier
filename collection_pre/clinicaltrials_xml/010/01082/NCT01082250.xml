	<criteria>1. Diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or schizophreniform disorders as per DSMIV or DSMIVTR criteria, which in the opinion of the investigator have been clinically stable for the past 6 months. 2. Body mass index (BMI) ≥ 19.5 and ≤ 37 kg/m2. 3. No clinically relevant abnormal laboratory values. 4. No clinically significant findings in the 12lead electrocardiogram (ECG): 5. No clinically significant findings from a vital signs measurement. 6. Able to understand and provide written consent prior to initiating any study procedure after being informed of the nature of the study. 7. Females who participate in this study: are unable to have children (e.g. postmenopausal, tubal ligation, hysterectomy); OR are willing to remain abstinent [not engage in sexual intercourse] from Day 5 until the final followup visit; OR are willing to use an effective method of doublebarrier birth control (e.g. partner using condom and female using diaphragm, contraceptive sponge, spermicide, or intrauterine device [IUD]) from Day 5 until the final followup visit. 8. Males must be willing to remain sexually abstinent or use an effective method of birth control (e.g. condom) from Day 5 until the final followup visit. 1. Significant disease(s) or clinically significant finding(s) in a physical examination determined by an Investigator to pose a health concern to the patient while on study. 2. Known history or presence of intolerance to psychiatric medications (e.g. atypical antipsychotic medications). 3. History of alcohol or drugdependence as per DSMIV criteria during the 6month period immediately prior to study entry. 4. Significant orthostatic hypotension (i.e. a drop in systolic blood pressure of 30 mmHg or more and/or drop in diastolic blood pressure of 20 mmHg or more on standing). 5. Presence or history (within the last year) of a medical or surgical condition (e.g. gastrointestinal disease) that might interfere with the absorption, metabolism, or excretion of orally administered lurasidone. 6. A history of epilepsy or risk of having seizures. 7. Positive test results within 30 days prior to the start of the study for: 1. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). 2. Hepatitis B surface antigen and Hepatitis C antibody. 3. Urine drugs of abuse test (marijuana, amphetamines, barbiturates, cocaine, opiates, benzodiazepines and methadone). 4. Serum betaHCG consistent with pregnancy (females only). 8. Participated in another clinical trial or received an investigational product within 30 days prior to Screening. 9. Use of any inhibitor or inducer of CYP3A4 taken within 30 days prior to checkin, including but not limited to those listed in Appendix 19.3. 10. Difficulty fasting or consuming the standard meals. 11. Females taking oral or transdermal hormonal contraceptives within 14 days preceding period 1 dosing. OR Females having used implanted or injected hormonal contraceptives within 6 months prior to period 1 dosing. 12. Donation or loss of whole blood prior to drug administration, as follows: 1. ≤ 499 mL within 30 days prior to dosing 2. ≥ 500 mL within 56 days prior to dosing. 13. Patient has a prolactin concentration ≥ 100 ng/mL at Screening.</criteria>
