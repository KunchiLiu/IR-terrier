	<brief_summary>Following the rapid development of significant drug resistance to both chloroquine and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (the first line therapy in Tanzania from 2001 -2006), artemether- lumefantrine (Coartem or AL) was adopted as first line therapy in Tanzania in 2006. Now that this drug has been widely used for some time, the investigators propose to conduct an antimalarial efficacy trial to monitor the effectiveness of this therapy, to determine if this drug remains efficacious, or if significant resistance has emerged, in which case a new antimalarial strategy will need to be contemplated. The investigators hypothesize that the efficacy of Artemether-lumefantrine remains high, and that the other artemisinin combination therapies will be equally efficacious. Children 6-59 months of age with symptomatic malaria will be randomly assigned to be treated with either artemether + lumefantrine (Coartem) or dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (Duo-Cotecxin or Artekin). Clinical, parasitologic, and hematologic parameters will be monitored over a 42-day follow-up period and will be used to evaluate drug efficacy.</brief_summary>
