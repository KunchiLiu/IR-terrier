	<brief_summary>Evidence is lacking on the effects of different psychotropic drugs in the treatment of anorexia nervosa (AR). However, HVA levels seem to be elevated in this disease, therefore suggesting a role for drugs with a partial agonist profile on dopaminergic receptors. This is a pilot study assessing the effects of aripiprazole in teenagers with AR, compared with a placebo.</brief_summary>
