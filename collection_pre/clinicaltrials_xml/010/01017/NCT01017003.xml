	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetic Study With Colchicine in Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open label, single group, sequential dose study will compare the single dose pharmacokinetics of colchicine 0.6 mg given orally to colchicine pharmacokinetics after 10 days of a standard prophylactic dose (0.6 mg every 12 hours) in healthy volunteers. After a fast of at least 10 hours, fourteen healthy non-smoking, non-obese, non-pregnant volunteers will receive a single oral dose of colchicine 0.6 mg. Fasting will continue for 4 hours after the dose, at which time a standard meal will be served. Blood will be drawn from all participants at times sufficient to adequately define the single dose pharmacokinetics of colchicine and its 3 major metabolites, 2, 3 and 10 demethylcolchicine. Following a 14 day washout period, all participants will begin a 10 day regimen of colchicine 0.6 mg orally every 12 hours. On the morning of day 25, after a fast of at least 10 hours, all participants will receive their final dose of colchicine 0.6 mg. Again blood will be drawn at times sufficient to determine the pharmacokinetics of colchicine and its 3 major metabolites after chronic dosing. The pharmacokinetic parameters for each dosing situation will be derived and compared for relevant differences. Though not a specific goal of this study, all participants will be monitored for adverse events by observation and query during periods of confinement on days 1, 15 and 25, as well as by complete blood count (CBC) with differential and clinical chemistry, sitting and standing blood pressures, and heart rate and 12-lead electrocardiogram (EKG) before and after dosing, on days 1 and 25.</detailed_description>
