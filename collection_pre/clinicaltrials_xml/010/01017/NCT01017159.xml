	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether subcutaneous immunoglobulin given in small doses, is effective in maintaining the force, in patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy compared with placebo (saline infusions), and intravenous immunoglobulin.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Subcutaneous Immunoglobulin Treatment of Patients With Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CIDP is an autoimmune disease of the peripheral nervous system, responding well to treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), steroids and plasmapheresis. IVIg is effective in treating patients with CIDP, but most of the patients need long time maintenance treatment, which is associated with decreased autonomy and regular hospital admissions. Furthermore many of the patients complain of infusion related side effects such as headache, chills and fatigue, and over time there is problems obtaining intravenous entry because of occlusion of the veins. There is therefore a critical need for alternative methods to IVIg treatment. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, tolerability and safety of small doses of immunoglobulin administered subcutaneously (SCIg), compared with placebo. At the same time we compare the efficacy of SCIg with the regular IVIg treatment. We therefore hypothesize, 1: SCIg is better than subcutaneous placebo infusions, and is as good as IVIg in maintaining muscle function in patients with CIDP. 2: SCIg home treatment is safe and tolerable. 3: SCIg home treatment is preferred to IVIg under hospital admission, by the patients.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>All patients with typical or pure motor CIDP, who meet the clinical or electrophysiological criteria of the EFNS/PNS for certain or probable CIDP and who are in regular treatment with IVIg on one of the neurological departments in Denmark, are eligible for the study Pregnancy Known cancer disease Severe medical diseases Other immuno modulating treatment than lowdose steroid (prednisolone &lt; 25 mg/day) within the last 6 weeks before inclusion Hepatitis B or C or HIV Breastfeeding Nonresponding to treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin Known hypersensitivity to intravenous immunoglobulins or Kiovig Adverse events: Previous moderate headache or minor rash for a few days during or after infusion is not an exclusion criteria In case of severe adverse effects to treatment patients are excluded. Moderate or mild sideeffects can be treated with analgetics or steroids for 12 weeks during the initial study phase</criteria>
