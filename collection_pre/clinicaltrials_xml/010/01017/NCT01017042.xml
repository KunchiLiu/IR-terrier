	<brief_summary>This study aims to characterize the pharmacokinetic profile of colchicine after a regimen of 1.8 mg over two hours. A secondary goal is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of this regimen in healthy volunteers. To this end, all study subjects will be monitored for adverse effects throughout the entire study period.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetic Study of an Acute Gout Regimen</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study aims to characterize the pharmacokinetic profile of colchicine and its three main metabolites, after a regimen of 1.8 mg over two hours. After a fast of at least 10 hours, fifteen healthy non-smoking, non-obese, non-pregnant adult volunteers between the ages of 18 and 55 will be given colchicine 1.2 mg (2 x 0.6 mg) orally followed by an additional single 0.6mg dose one hour later. Fasting will continue for 4 hours after the first dose at which time a standardized meal will be served. Blood will be drawn from all participants at times sufficient to adequately define the pharmacokinetics of colchicine and its 3 major metabolites, 2, 3 and 10 demethylcolchicine. A further goal of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of this regimen in healthy volunteers. To this end, subjects will be monitored throughout participation in the study for adverse reactions to the study drug and/or procedures. Seated and standing blood pressure and pulse will be measured prior to the first dose and 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 12 hours post-dose. Twelve-lead electrocardiograms will be obtained at the same time points. All adverse events whether elicited by query, spontaneously reported, or observed by clinic staff will be evaluated by the Investigator and reported in the subject's case report form.</detailed_description>
