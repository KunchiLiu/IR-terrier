	<brief_summary>Solid tumours contain varying degrees of hypoxia. Studies show hypoxia to be associated with poor local control and survival, as hypoxia is a cause of resistance to radio- and chemotherapy and the development of a more aggressive tumour. Previous attempts to measure hypoxia have been biased because the techniques have been invasive, not repeatable or difficult to apply on a routine basis. There is great interest in trying to measure hypoxia in tumours as this could lead to individualized hypoxia-modifying therapy and prediction of treatment response. Additionally the investigators' knowledge of change in hypoxia over time is limited, but of great interest as individualised treatment, such as intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is emerging. 18F-FAZA, appears promising. It is a nitroimidazole, which gets trapped in hypoxic cells and can be detected by a positron emission therapy (PET) scan. Compared to other nitroimidazoles, 18F-FAZA has superior biokinetics and thereby is believed to provide a faster and clearer image of hypoxia. The investigators' hypothesis is that 18F-FAZA can be used as a prognostic marker in HNSCC.</brief_summary>
