Common complications of this type of surgery are difficulty swallowing and nerve dysfunction that can effect voice. The chance of having voice and swallowing disturbances increases if this type of surgery has to be repeated. The purpose of this study is to document the voice and swallowing function of patients undergoing this type of surgery in an effort to find better ways to identify and treat these common complications.</detailed_description>
