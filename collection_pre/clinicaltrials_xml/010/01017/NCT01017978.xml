	<brief_title>Quantitative MR Biomarkers for Sarcoma Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to determine if MRI imaging can be used to accurately determine if a sarcoma is responding to the type of chemotherapy being used or if it is ineffective early on in the treatment; instead of finding this out 2-3 months later. If it is determined that MRI can accurately diagnose tumor response, medications can be switched early on potentially improv8ing the patients'chances of recovery.</detailed_description>
