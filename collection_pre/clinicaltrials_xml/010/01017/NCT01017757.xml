	<brief_summary>Immunosuppressive drugs such as tacrolimus, cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil, sirolimus and everolimus may have toxic pulmonary effects, particularly interstitial alterations. The aim of the present study is to explore the presence of subclinical interstitial lung abnormalities in stable renal transplant recipients taking the different immunosuppressive drugs used as maintenance therapy for renal transplantation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Interstitial Lung Abnormalities in Renal Transplant Recipients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prospective, cross-sectional study examining the high-resolution CT scans obtained in 63 stable renal transplant recipients taking immunosuppressive treatment for at least 24 months. The findings in patients taking the newer immunosuppressive drugs (mycophenolic acid, sirolimus and everolimus) are compared with those of the patients treated in the traditional way (cyclosporine, tacrolimus, azathioprine). All patients undergo high-resolution CT scanning. Eligibility criteria: recipients of kidney or kidney-pancreas transplant, on immunosuppressive therapy for at least 24 months, with stable renal function and absence of any overt lung disease or lung alterations induced by other drugs, systemic diseases or occupational exposure to fibrogenic agents.</detailed_description>
