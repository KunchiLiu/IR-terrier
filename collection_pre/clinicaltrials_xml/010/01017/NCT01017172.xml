	<brief_title>Safety and Immune Response to Adjuvanted A(H1N1)v Influenza Vaccine in HIV-1 Infected and Immunosuppressed Adult Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The efficacy of an adjuvanted A(H1N1)v influenza vaccine in HIV-infected and immunosuppressed patients is unknown. Therefore we aim to investigate the immunoresponse as assessed by a anti-hemagglutinin assay before, 21 days after the first and 21 days after the second vaccination. The safety of the vaccination will be recorded by a standardized questionaire.</detailed_description>
