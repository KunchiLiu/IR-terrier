	<brief_title>Radiosurgery and Avastin for Recurrent Malignant Gliomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this pilot study, 15 human subjects with recurrent, unifocal malignant gliomas up to 5-cm in maximum dimension no longer responding to conventional chemotherapy but able to tolerate further chemotherapy will be enrolled. The primary endpoint of this study will be the proportion of patients who experience CNS toxicity, with secondary endpoints progression-free survival, overall survival, steroid dosage, development of radionecrosis, quality of life, objective radiographic response and performance status.</detailed_description>
