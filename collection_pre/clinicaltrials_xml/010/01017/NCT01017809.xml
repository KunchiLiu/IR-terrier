	<brief_summary>The investigators propose to totally abolish the emesis (vomiting) associated with the regimen of oxaliplatin + topotecan by adding a daily administration of aprepitant (Emend) for 17 days to the HT3 blocker routinely given on days 1 and 15.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prolonged Emend in a Study (NYU 03-67) of Oxaliplatin and Topotecan in Previously Treated Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients enrolled in NCT0031361, NYU 03-67 (A Phase II study of Oxaliplatin combined with continuous infusion topotecan as chemotherapy for patients with previously treated ovarian cancer NCI #6317) will receive oxaliplatin 85mg/m2 as a 2-hr IV infusion on D1, 15 and topotecan 0.4mg/m2/day as a continuous infusion for 14 days beginning on D1 (D1-15) on a 4 week cycle. On days 1 and 15 of the first cycle, patients will also receive IV ondansetron 32 mg and 10mg of dexamethasone. Emend 125 mg will be given on day 1; on days 2-17, patients will be given daily oral 80mg Emend without dexamethasone. On cycles 2-6 patients opting to continue to receive Emend as above: Emend 125 mg will be given on day 1; on days 2-17, patients will be given daily oral 80mg Emend without dexamethasone. Following cycle 1, Emend will be given in its conventional schedule (i.e., d 1-3, and d 15-17) unless after discussion with the Principal Investigator, the patient's request to receive drug as in cycle 1 is deemed desirable and safe to enter the optional extension arm.</detailed_description>
