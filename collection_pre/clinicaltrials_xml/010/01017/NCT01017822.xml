	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as conatumumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine hydrochloride and capecitabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Radiation therapy may uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Giving conatumumab together with gemcitabine hydrochloride, capecitabine, and radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of conatumumab when given together with gemcitabine hydrochloride, capecitabine, and radiation therapy and to see how well they work in treating patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To evaluate the maximum tolerated dose of conatumumab up to a target dose of 10 mg/kg given concurrently with capecitabine and radiotherapy following induction therapy comprising conatumumab and gemcitabine hydrochloride in patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer. (Phase I) - To evaluate the overall survival of patients treated with this regimen. (Phase II) Secondary - To evaluate the safety profile in patients treated with this regimen. (Phase I and II) - To evaluate the progression-free survival of patients treated with this regimen. (Phase II) - To evaluate the primary tumor response rate in patients treated with this regimen. (Phase II) - To generate translational research hypotheses. (Phase II) OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, phase I dose-escalation study of conatumumab, followed by a phase II study. - Induction therapy: Patients receive conatumumab IV over 30-60 minutes on days 1 and 15 and gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 2 courses. - Conatumumab and chemoradiotherapy: Beginning 14-42 days after the last course of induction therapy, patients undergo 3-dimensional radiotherapy once daily, 5 days a week, for 5½ weeks (28 treatments). Patients also receive conatumumab IV over 30-60 minutes on days 1, 15, and 29 and oral capecitabine twice daily, 5 days a week, for 5½ weeks. - Maintenance therapy: Beginning 28-56 days after completion of chemoradiotherapy, patients receive conatumumab IV over 30-60 minutes on days 1 and 15 and gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.</detailed_description>
