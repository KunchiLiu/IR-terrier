	<brief_summary>This was a Phase II, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted at 1 site in South Africa. A total of 26 subjects were randomized 1:1 to receive 2 doses of either AERAS-402 at 3 x 10^10 vp (N=13) or placebo (N=13) on Study Days 0 and 28. Dose-escalation to a second group of 40 subjects was planned, but although no safety concerns were identified, the sponsor decided not to continue the study.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Age 21 years through 45 years (i.e., subject had not yet reached his/her 46th birthday at day of randomization). 2. Had completed the written informed consent process prior to undergoing any screening evaluations. 3. Had BCG vaccination at least 5 years previously, documented by medical history or presence of scar. 4. Females: Ability to avoid pregnancy for at least 6 months after receiving the last study vaccination: Women physically capable of pregnancy (not sterilized and still menstruating or within 1 year of the last menses if menopausal) must have avoided pregnancy from 28 days prior to administration of the study vaccine and must have agreed to avoid pregnancy through at least 6 months after receiving the last study vaccination. Acceptable methods of avoiding pregnancy included a sterile sexual partner, sexual abstinence (not engaging in sexual intercourse), or use of a combination of at least two forms of acceptable contraception: hormonal contraceptives (oral, injection, transdermal patch, or implant), vaginal ring, intrauterine device (IUD), and the use of a condom or a diaphragm; or the use of a condom or a diaphragm combined with spermicide. 5.

Had ability to complete followup period as required by the protocol. 8. Was able and willing to commit to avoiding elective surgery for at least 6 months after receiving the last study vaccination. 9. Was able and willing to stay in contact with the study site for the duration of the study. 10. Had committed to simultaneous enrollment in Aeras Vaccine Development Registry Protocol. 11. Had laboratory evidence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, defined as a positive HIV1 ELISA test plus a positive confirmatory test (e.g., a second HIV1 ELISA, PCR, or rapid ELISA). 12. Had four (4) (for Group 1) or three (3) (for Group 2)* CD4+ lymphocyte count tests, each performed at least four days apart within the 42day screening period, with at least three (for Group 1) or two (for Group 2) CD4+ lymphocyte count results greater than 350 cells / mm3. 13. Not currently receiving antiretroviral drugs. 14. Committed to not participate in any other clinical trials during the first 12 months of participation in this study. 1. Acute illness. 2. Fever ≥37.5°C. 3. Significant symptomatic infection. 4. Used immunosuppressive medication within 42 days prior to randomization (inhaled and topical corticosteroids were permitted). 5. Received immunoglobulin or blood products within 42 days prior to randomization. 6. Received any investigational drug therapy or vaccine within 182 days prior to randomization. 7. History of having received any adenovirusvectorbased vaccine. 8. Medical history that may have compromised the evaluation of safety of the subject in the study (e.g., diabetes, seizure disorder, sickle cell disease). 9. Pregnant or breastfeeding female, or intention to become pregnant during the study within 6 months after receiving the last study vaccination. 10. Liver function tests &gt;Grade 2 per the toxicity table. 11.
