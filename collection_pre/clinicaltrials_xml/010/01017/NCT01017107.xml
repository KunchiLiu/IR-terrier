	<brief_summary>Activated protein C (APC)has been shown to reduce mortality in severe sepsis(Bernard et al. 2001b). The clinical picture of severe acute pancreatitis (AP) is similar to that of sepsis. The investigators conducted a randomised double-blinded placebo-controlled pilot study in AP patients (16+16) with the same dose of APC that has been proven to be efficacious and safe in septic patients. The aim of the study is to investigate whether the APC replacement therapy diminishes the occurrence and severity of organ dysfunction in patients with severe AP. The effect of APC on inflammatory and hemostatic parameters is also assessed.</brief_summary>
