	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare two different approaches to treating non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in East Asian never-smoker participants. Half of the participants will receive chemotherapy (pemetrexed/cisplatin) followed by an oral anti-cancer agent (gefitinib) and the other half of the participants will receive only the oral anti-cancer agent (gefitinib).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Histological diagnosis of NSCLC with locally advanced or metastatic disease that is of nonsquamous histology. Participants must be "light exsmokers" or "neversmokers". "Light exsmokers" defined as having ceased smoking for greater than or equal to 5 years and not to have exceeded 10 packyears. "Neversmokers" are defined as having smoked &lt;100 cigarettes or equivalent during his/her lifetime. Participants must be of East Asian ethnicity. No prior systemic therapy for lung cancer. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1. Presence of clinically significant (by physical exam) thirdspace fluid collections, for example, ascites or pleural effusions that cannot be controlled by drainage or other procedures prior to study entry. Any evidence of clinically active interstitial lung disease. Asymptomatic participants with chronic, stable, radiographic changes are eligible. Participants whose Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) mutation status is known prior to study entry will be excluded. Participants in which EGFR mutation testing has not been performed, or whose EGFR mutation status is unknown or inconclusive at study entry are eligible.</criteria>
