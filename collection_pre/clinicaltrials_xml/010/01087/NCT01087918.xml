	<brief_title>Lokomat Versus Strength Training in Chronic Incomplete Spinal Cord Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although task-specific training has been promoted during the last years to improve function, recent studies showed that after an incomplete spinal cord injury, strength, but not complex movement coordination, is affected. In this randomized cross-over trial we investigate the effectiveness of a task-specific 4 week Lokomat training with a 4 week (unspecific) lower extremity muscle strength training on walking-related and other outcomes.</detailed_description>
