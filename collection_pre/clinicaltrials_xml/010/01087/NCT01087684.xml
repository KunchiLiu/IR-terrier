	<brief_summary>Laser trabeculoplasty is a routine treatment for glaucoma and can be performed with either argon (ALT) or selective Yag (SLT) lasers. The effectiveness of each has not been studied in patients under 60 years, which is younger than average for the procedure. The study hypothesis is that there will be no difference between the two laser types.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Response to SLT vs. ALT in Patients Under 60 Years of Age</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Forty-two young patients (age 29 to 60) had one eye randomized to ALT (n = 22) or SLT (n = 20). Intraocular pressure was measured prior to laser and 1 hour, 1 day, 6 weeks, 3 months, every 3 months until 2 years, and then yearly post-laser. Ï‡2 analysis and student's t-test were used to determine statistical significance.</detailed_description>
