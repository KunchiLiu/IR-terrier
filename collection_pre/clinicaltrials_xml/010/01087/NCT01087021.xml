	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: - To assess the potential effect on QTcF interval (QTc Fridericia) of cabazitaxel in cancer patients Secondary Objectives: - To assess the effects of cabazitaxel on heart rate (HR), QT, QTcB (Bazett's correction), and QTcN (population specific correction) intervals - To assess the clinical safety of cabazitaxel - To assess cabazitaxel plasma concentrations at Cycle 1 at early timepoints (during infusion and up to 5h post end of infusion)</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Cabazitaxel on the QTc Interval in Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The main period of the study consists of a maximum of 21-day screening phase, then first 2 treatment cycles with cabazitaxel. End of main period will be Cycle 3 or 30 days after last dose if patient discontinues study after 1 or 2 treatment cycles. The duration for a patient for the main period of the study will be about 9 to 10 weeks (screening, 2 cycles). After Cycle 2, patients will have the option to continue to receive cabazitaxel and should be followed for safety reporting until 30 days after the last dose of cabazitaxel.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: Histologically or cytologically confirmed solid malignancy that is metastatic or unresectable, and for which standard curative measures do not exist, and a treatment with a novel taxane agent is considered. Exclusion criteria: Conditions with screening ECG repolarization difficult to interpret, or showing significant abnormalities. This includes, but is not limited to: high degree AV block, pacemaker, atrial fibrillation or flutter QTcF &gt;480 msec on screening Electrocardiogram (ECG) Significant hypokalemia at screening (serum potassium &lt;3.5 mMol/L) Significant hypomagnesemia at screening (serum magnesium &lt;0.7 mMol/L) (Note: Patient may be enrolled after correction of these laboratory abnormalities) Patient receives (and cannot discontinue), or is scheduled to receive a QTprolonging drug The above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a patient's potential participation in a clinical trial.</criteria>
