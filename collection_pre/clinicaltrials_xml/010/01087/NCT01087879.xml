	<brief_summary>The impact of different administration routes of hormonal contraceptives on androgen secretion, glucose metabolism and inflammation. A prospective randomized trial. The investigators assume, that transdermal or transvaginal hormonal contraception would have less effects on androgen levels, glucose metabolism and inflammatory markers than oral contraceptives.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>45 patients are recruited in the study. Each study group will consist of 15 women (aged 20-35 years) receiving oral, transdermal or transvaginal hormonal contraception continuously for 9 weeks. The subjects should have at least 2 months wash out period from all hormonal medication prior to the study. The measurements for serum sampling and OGTT will be performed before and after 9 weeks of medication.</detailed_description>
