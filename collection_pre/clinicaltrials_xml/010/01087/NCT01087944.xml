	<brief_summary>This randomized, cross-over, open label study will compare the tolerability and handling of application of peginterferon alfa-2a [Pegasys] by autoinjector versus pre-filled syringe in patients with chronic hepatitis C, either on treatment with peginterferon alfa-2a for at least 12 weeks or treatment-naïve for peginterferon alfa-2a. Patients will be randomized to self-injection of 180mcg peginterferon alfa-2a once a week using either an autoinjector or a prefilled syringe for 3 weeks, then switch to use the other method of injection for another 3 weeks. Anticipated time on study treatment is 6 weeks. Target sample size is &lt;100 patients.</brief_summary>
