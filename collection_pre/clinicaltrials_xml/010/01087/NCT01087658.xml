	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: To assess the benefit of glutamine when added to calcium-magnesium on the occurrence of grade 2, 3 and 4 peripheral sensory neuropathy (PSN) related to oxaliplatin with the National Cancer Institute-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Event (NCI-CTCAE) scale taking into account the time from start of oxaliplatin at which the first event occurred. Secondary Objective: To determine cumulative dose of oxaliplatin and time when the first occurrence of grade 2, 3 or 4 PSN. To determine the incidence of dose-reductions, dose-delays and discontinuations of oxaliplatin due to PSN grade 3 or 4. To assess effects of glutamine when added to calcium-magnesium on patients-reported outcomes using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy/Gynecologic Oncology Group-Neurotoxicity 12 items questionnaire (FACT/GOG NTX-12) subscale. To evaluate the incidence of diarrhea. To determine Progression Free Survival (PFS) in metastatic patients.</brief_summary>

Previous oxaliplatinbased chemotherapy. 3. Previous or current diagnosis of PSN. 4. Concomitant treatments with drugs/ingredients reported to have a potential activity in preventing PSN: carbamazepine, amitriptyline, gabapentin, phenytoin, glutathione, alphalipoic acid, celecoxib, amifostine, venlafaxine, vitamin B1 (thiamine), B6 (pyridoxine). 5. History of known allergy to oxaliplatin or other platinum agents, 5FU, LV or capecitabine. 6. History of known allergy to glutamine or to calciummagnesium. 7. Participation in another clinical trial with any investigational drug within 30 days prior to study screening. 8. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness: e.g. high blood pressure, unstable angina, symptomatic congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association Classification III or IV), 9. Serious cardiac arrhythmia, diabetes, or active infection. 10. Concurrent active cancer originating from a primary site other than colon or rectum. 11.
