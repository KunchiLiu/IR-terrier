	<brief_summary>We are studying if putting a gel capsule over a standard HIV drug changes the ability of the body to absorb the drug. This is important because we want to be able to study new HIV drugs against the most common drugs used today and the most common is Sustiva, which is also called efavirenz. We will give you Sustiva every day for 5 days and draw blood to see how much is absorbed. Then we will give you Sustiva that has a gel capsule over it for 5 days and we will draw blood to see how much is absorbed.</brief_summary>
