	<brief_title>Troponin T as Risk Stratification Tool in Peripheral Arterial Occlusive Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Troponin T and I are established risk markers in patients with acute coronary syndrome. Only recently, troponin I was found to be elevated in patients with acute critical limb ischaemia. In another study, troponin I was associated with a higher mortality in patients with chronic critical limb ischaemia followed over two years. In a longitudinal study design we intend to follow all patients that were treated for symptomatic PAOD (Fontaine stages II-IV) from 01/2007 to 12/2007 in our department of angiology. Main outcome parameters are death and the occurrence of major vascular events and revascularization procedures during follow-up.</detailed_description>
