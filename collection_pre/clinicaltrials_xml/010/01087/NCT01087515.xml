	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to investigate the immunomodulatory potential of Isolated Plasmacytoide Dendritic Cells (pDCs) and Regulatory T-cells (TREGs) isolated with clinical grade magnetic bead isolations techniques (MACS®) on the antigen presenting cell-induced proliferation of lymphocytes after allergen uptake in an in vitro cell culture system.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study for Cell Based Therapies in Patients With Asthma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>pDCs as well as TREGs will be co-incubated with generated allergen presenting cells, lymphocytes, and allergen. For in vitro experimentation immune cells will be collected from blood of grass mix or house dust mite sensitized atopic/asthmatic patients.</detailed_description>
