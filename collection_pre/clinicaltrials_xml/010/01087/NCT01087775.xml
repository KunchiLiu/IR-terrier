	<brief_summary>The investigators hypothesis are as follows: H1a: OEF/OIF veterans with PTSD who perform cognitive training (CT) will demonstrate greater objective improvements on standard (untrained) neurocognitive measures, with the largest gains in verbal memory, learning and sustained attention. H1b: Objective cognitive improvements in CT participants will be sustained at three months post-intervention, suggesting persistence of neuroplasticity-based cognitive training benefits. H2a: OEF/OIF veterans with PTSD who perform CT will report greater improvements in cognitive function. H2b: OEF/OIF veterans with PTSD who perform CT will demonstrate improved social and occupational functioning and quality of life. H2c: OEF/OIF veterans with PTSD who perform CT will demonstrate greater improvements in community reintegration.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>An experienced clinical interviewer with Master'slevel training will conduct first and secondlevel screening to determine study eligibility for enrollment in the randomized controlled trial. The FirstLevel Eligibility Screen will be conducted by phone and will apply the following inclusion criteria in an effort to recruit a homogeneous sample: 1. Confirmed OEF and/or OIF military service 2. Male veterans, ages 18 to 40 years with 12 to 16 years of education 3. History of a prior positive PTSD screen or diagnosis either by SFVAMC study referral or selfreport' 4. Able and willing to travel to SFVAMC 5. Able and willing to perform daily homebased computer exercises for three months. The Second Level Eligibility Determination will occur inperson at the SFVAMC of potential participants who have met firstlevel screening eligibility criteria. Secondlevel eligibility screening will require signed informed consent (see below) before the secondlevel screening is conducted. During the secondlevel eligibility screen, consenting participants will be administered: 1. The ClinicianAdministered PTSD screen (CAPS) and the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) 29 to assess for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM)IV Axis I psychiatric disorders 2. The VA TBI secondlevel screen [TBI event history and Neurobehavioral Symptom Inventory (NSI) for cognitive symptoms].30 To be eligible for enrollment in the randomized controlled, veterans at secondlevel screening must: 1. Meet threshold criteria for current full or subsyndromal PTSD by DSMIV criteria 31 2. Report â‰¥ 1 moderate or severe cognitive symptom(s) on the NSI that interfere(s) with daily function including moderate to severe poor concentration, forgetfulness, difficulty making decisions and slowed thinking. Because PTSD is a highly comorbid condition, eligible participants may have other comorbid stable neuropsychiatric disorders, including depression or a history of a mild traumatic brain injury. The following exclusion criteria will apply to firstlevel screening: 1. Poor English comprehension and fluency 2. Unstable medical condition, injury or disability, including moderate to severe TBI (by selfreport) and hearing impairment 3. Current (or past 60 day) evidencebased PTSD or cognitive remediation therapy; in contrast, stable supportive therapy for PTSD and/or other mental disorders, such as group therapy or on stable psychoactive medication (&gt; 30 days) will be acceptable. The following exclusion criteria will apply to secondlevel screening: 1. Drug and alcohol dependence and other unstable serious mental illness (e.g. psychosis) (assessed using the MINI)</criteria>
