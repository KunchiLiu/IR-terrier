	<brief_summary>Idiopathic juvenile thoracic scoliosis is a tridimensional deformation of the spine which may impact on the intrathoracic organs. Bracing is one of the oldest treatments of spinal deformities. It relies on the indirect manipulation of spinal curvatures in order to prevent curve progression, which may affect respiratory function. The acoustic reflection method is based on the analysis of the reflection of a single transient planar wave giving the longitudinal cross-sectional area profile of the examined cavity. It is noninvasive and harmless. The EOS™ device allows a double incidence, full body, and low-dose X-ray acquisition with thoracic 3D reconstruction. The aim of the study is to evaluate the impact of bracing on the upper airways patency (by means of the acoustic method), on the breathing pattern (noninvasive respiratory muscles assessment), and on the thoracic penetration index (by means of the EOS™)</brief_summary>
