	<criteria>Male or female, aged ≥ 18 years. Patient with infrarenal aorta or chronic lower limb ischemia with various clinical signs of gravity (stages IIIV according to the classification of Leriche and Fontaine) or/and Doppler ultrasonography indicating abdominal or lower limb arteriopathy. Patient scheduled for a conventional XRay angiography (intraarterial Digital Substraction Angiography = DSA) within 30 days of MRA with a minimum time interval of at least 24 hours between the 2 examinations. Patient planned to undergo therapeutic intervention in abdominal or lower limb vessels between the time of MRA and Xray Angiography will be performed. Patient who had a major cardiovascular event within 30 days prior to the inclusion. Patient treated with unilateral hip replacement, abdominal aortic or iliac graft or stent.</criteria>
