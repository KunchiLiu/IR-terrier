	<brief_title>Clinical Evaluation of the Interlace Medical Hysteroscopic Morcellator</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A retrospective review of medical records for eleven (11) premenopausal women who had been treated with the new hysteroscopic morcellator was conducted at four hospital or ambulatory surgical center sites. Four physicians performed hysteroscopic operative procedures to remove intrauterine polyps, type 0 (completely within the uterine cavity), type I (mostly within the cavity) and type II (&lt; 40% within the cavity) submucous myomas. Percent pathology removed, total morcellation time, total fluid used, fluid deficit and treatment-related adverse events were assessed. Each of the four treating physicians also evaluated device performance using a 10 point scale (1 = "poor" and 10 = "excellent").</detailed_description>
