	<brief_title>Valacyclovir vs. Acyclovir as HSV-2 Suppressive Therapy: Effect on Plasma HIV-1 Levels Among HIV-1/HSV-2 Co-infected Persons</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sexual transmission is responsible for the vast majority of HIV-1 infections among adults worldwide. In sub-Saharan Africa, the region hardest hit by the HIV-1 epidemic, HSV-2 prevalences of 30-50% have been seen in the general population with prevalence up to 90% in infected with HIV-1. HSV-2 is common in those with, or at risk for, HIV-1 infection, and HSV-2 reactivation increases HIV-1 acquisition and infectiousness. Recent studies have shown that suppression of HSV-2 has a sustained effect on lowering HIV-1 levels in blood plasma. New data have raised the question whether higher doses of HSV-2 suppressive therapy might be more effective at suppressing HIV-1 levels. Acyclovir and valacyclovir, chosen for use in this study, are safe and effective treatments for decreasing the frequency of HSV-2 reactivation and shedding. The standard dose of acyclovir is 400 mg twice a day. Valacyclovir, a drug that converts to acyclovir after absorption, delivers higher concentrations of acyclovir. 1.5 grams of valacyclovir, will be used to provide a higher dose of acyclovir, and will be compared with the standard dose of 400 mg twice a day of acyclovir.</detailed_description>
