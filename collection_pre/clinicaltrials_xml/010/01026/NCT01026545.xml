	<brief_summary>This study is a randomized, investigator blind, subject blind, sponsor-open, placebo controlled, multiple dose escalating, sequential, parallel cohort study of PF-04287881. Subjects will undergo screening procedures within 28 days prior to dosing. At least 1 day after the Screening visit, eligible subjects who meet the entry criteria will be admitted to the Clinical Research Unit (CRU) and confined in the unit until discharge on Day 15. Approximately 60 healthy volunteers (20 volunteers of Japanese origin for Cohorts 5 and 6), 18 to 55 years of age, males and females (women of non childbearing potential only) will be enrolled and randomized in a 4:1 ratio to treatment with either PF-04287881 or placebo within each cohort. Each cohort will have a 10 day dosing period and each will consist of 10 subjects (8 active and 2 placebo). In each cohort, each subject will receive a single daily oral dose of either placebo or PF-04287881 under fasted state for 10 days.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Following a Serious Adverse Event (potential Hy's Law case), a risk-benefit assessment review of all preliminary safety data, and a review by Pfizer's internal hepatic injury advisory panel, it was concluded that PF-04287881 had an unacceptable therapeutic window. The FDA was notified of our intention to discontinue development as of 09April2010.</detailed_description>
