	<brief_summary>For the present study, 400 consecutive men with unilateral primary inguinal hernia are randomized to Lichtenstein repair using either light weight polypropylene mesh (38g/m2) or light weight ProGrip mesh. ProGrip mesh adheres to tissues with polylactic micro hooks without suturing. The primary aim is to examine, whether the ProGrip mesh produces less pain than sutured polypropylene mesh. Secondary outcomes are operation time and convalescence as well as recurrence rate. ProGrip mesh is supposed to be faster to apply as no sutures are needed, which may compensate for its higher cost. The patients are blinded to which mesh they receive.</brief_summary>
