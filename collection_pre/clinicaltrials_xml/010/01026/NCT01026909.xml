	<detailed_description>Legg-Calve-Perthes disease (LCP) represents the loss of blood flow to the head of the femur, resulting in significant hip pain and potential long term disability. The cause of LCP is still unknown, but tends to occur predominantly in boys from ages 4-12. For the majority of those affected, observation and symptomatic treatment with oral antiinflammatories, such as ibuprofen, is indicated. This study represents a single center, randomized, prospective, controlled study comparing the treatment of LCP with an intraarticular corticosteroid (triamcinolone hexacetonide) injection with traditional nonoperative treatment. The investigators will test for improved outcomes by measuring functional outcomes (PODCI and ASKp questionnaires, StepWatch activity monitor), hip range of motion and visual-analog pain scales. The investigators hypothesize that injections of corticosteroids (potent, injectable antiinflammatories) will result in improved overall function through decreased pain and increased hip range of motion in this patient population.Additional biological research will be performed. There is no human information on the inflammatory response that occurs in the hip joint of children with Perthes disease, and there are no true animal models of Perthes disease. To better understand the pathobiology of Perthes disease, the collection of joint fluid from both hips may provide insight into the treatment of a disease for which we currently have no explanation of cause, and consequently no therapies</detailed_description>
