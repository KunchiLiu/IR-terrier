	<brief_summary>The objectives of this clinical trial are to estimate the incidence and duration of air leaks and the incidence of prolonged air leaks (defined as &gt; 5 days by the Society for Thoracic Surgery) when using the ENDO GIA Staplers with ENDO GIA Single Use Loading Units (SULUs) buttressed with Duet TRS TM in an anatomic pulmonary resection via Video Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery (VATS). Anatomic pulmonary resection is defined as either a lobectomy or segmental resection. Results of the study will be compared to contemporary literature for a similar population.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>The patient must be 18 years of age or older The patient must be scheduled to undergo segmentectomy or lobectomy via Video Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery (VATS) for a lung nodule suspicious for or clinically proven to be primary lung cancer The patient must be able to tolerate general anesthesia and have cardiopulmonary reserve to tolerate the procedure The patient must be willing and able to comply with all study requirements and have understood and signed the informed consent. The patient is pregnant or breastfeeding The patient is scheduled to undergo sleeve lobectomy, wedge resection, bilobectomy, pneumonectomy or Lung Volume Reduction Surgery (LVRS), or lung biopsy for suspected interstitial lung disease The patient has received preoperative chemotherapy or radiation therapy for the lung cancer that will be resected The patient is scheduled to receive intraoperative brachytherapy The patient has other severe illnesses that would preclude surgery such as unstable angina or myocardial infarction within 3 months Reoperative surgery is excluded if it is on the same side as the previous surgery The patient requires chest wall reconstruction</criteria>
