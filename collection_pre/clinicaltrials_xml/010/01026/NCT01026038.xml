	<brief_summary>This is an open-label study (a study in which the doctors and participants know which drug or vaccine is being administered) in children who previously received a 4-dose series of a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PnC) during infancy in Study 6096A1-008-EU (NCT00366678). In this study, participants will receive an additional dose of 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. The purpose of this study is to evaluate persistence, if any, of the antibody response by measuring any remaining pneumococcal antibodies since the previous study. This study will also evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine when administered at least 24 months after the last dose of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine.</brief_summary>
