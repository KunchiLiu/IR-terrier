	<brief_title>Observational Study of the Effects Intravenous Bortezomib Has on Osteoblast (Cell That is Responsible for Bone Formation) Activity in Multiple Myeloma Patients.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Among several symptoms in patients with multiple myeloma, the bone disease is one of the most common symptoms that approximately 80 percent of the patients experience. Multiple myeloma is different from other tumors in that several osteoclast activating factors (OAF) released from multiple myeloma cells resorb bone and, at the same time, activation of osteoblast is inhibited, leading to unbalance of breakdown and formation of bone. Activation of osteoclast and inhibition of osteoblast brings about bone fractures, osteoporosis, hypercalcemia, bone pain and spinal cord compression. Those symptoms are directly related to patients' quality of life. Therefore, they are the important therapeutic targets for multiple myeloma. Various types of bisphosphonate agents are used for the treatment of the bone disease in patients with multiple myeloma. This is a prospective (a study where the participants are identified and then followed forward in time), multi-center, Phase 4, observational study (studies that record specific events occurring without any intervention from the researcher) in order to analyze the change in bone metabolism markers (DKK-1, sRANKL, OPG, sRANKL/OPG,bALP, OC) before and after the use of bortezomib injection by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in serum. The adverse events will be assessed through the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 3.0 (NCI CTCAE V3). The patients will receive bortezomib injection into a vein 1.3 mg/m2 twice a week for 21 days under usual clinical practice.</detailed_description>
