	<brief_summary>The hematocrit level is defined as the ratio of plasma volume and red blood cell mass. Determination of this level is important for the diagnosis and follow-up of various hematological and renal disorders. In clinical practice, automated hematology analyzers are commonly used. Recently, a new method for hematocrit level determination has been introduced which employs layered resonant piezoelectric sensors. In the present study this technique will be applied in blood samples of healthy subjects and compared to a standard laboratory method.</brief_summary>
