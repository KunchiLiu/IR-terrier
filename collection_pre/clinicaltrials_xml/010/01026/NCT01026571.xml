	<brief_summary>BAVgenetics is a partnership between Investigators at Brigham and Women's Hospital, Massachusetts General Hospital and the Harvard-Partners Center for Genetics and Genomics, dedicated to discovering the genetic causes of bicuspid aortic valve disease and associated aortic disease.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Identification of Genetic Mechanisms of Bicuspid Aortic Valve Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Investigators at BAVgenetics are dedicated to discovering the mechanisms of bicuspid aortic valve disease and why individual genetics seem to play such an important role in generation of this disease. If you have, or have had, a bicuspid aortic valve, we seek your help in this effort by volunteering to donate DNA and details of your disease to the Investigators, so that this disease can be better understood and therapies for it can be developed.</detailed_description>
