	<brief_summary>This study was to compare the safety and efficacy of the preservative-free formulation of 0.0015% MK2452 (tafluprost) and preservative-free 0.5% timolol maleate in patients with open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension. This study was to demonstrate that the preservative-free formulation of 0.0015% tafluprost is non-inferior to preservative-free 0.5% timolol maleate.</brief_summary>
