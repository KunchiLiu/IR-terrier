	<brief_summary>Obese patients are known to have increased work of breathing inducing dyspnea, exercise intolerance and impaired quality of life. Respiratory muscle training is known to increase respiratory muscle capacity, reduce dyspnoea and improve exercise performance in healthy subjects and respiratory patients. The investigators hypothesized that Respiratory muscle training would reduce dyspnoea, increase exercise tolerance and quality of life in obese patients.</brief_summary>
