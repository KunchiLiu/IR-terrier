	<brief_title>A Single-Dose Pharmacokinetics and Safety Study of Ceftobiprole in Pediatric Patients =3 Months to &lt;18 Years of Age</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This purpose of this study will be to assess the pharmacokinetics (how drugs are absorbed, distributed in the body and removed over time) and safety of a single dose of ceftobiprole in pediatric patients undergoing treatment with systemic antibiotics and may be used to guide dosing recommendations for ceftobiprole in children. This study is an open-label (all patients will know the identity of the drug) single-dose, pharmacokinetic study in infants and children =3 months to &lt;18 years of age who are medically stable as judged by the clinical investigator and require therapy with antibiotics. Patients will be given a 2-hour i.v. infusion (given directly into the vein) of 7, 10, or 15 mg/kg ceftobiprole. The study population will be grouped according to the following 4 age groups: =12 to &lt;18 years of age; =6 to &lt;12 years of age; =2 to &lt;6 years of age; and =3 months to &lt;2 years of age. Every attempt will be made to include patients of both sexes in each age group. Safety evaluations will include clinical laboratory tests (hematology, serum chemistry, and urinalysis), pregnancy testing, vital signs, physical examination, monitoring of adverse events, and recording of concomitant medications. Patients will be given a single 2-hour i.v. (given directly into the vein) infusion of ceftobiprole. The total duration of the study is approximately 18 days, including screening and posttreatment.</detailed_description>
