	<brief_summary>This study compares wireless capsule endoscopy (patients swallow a pill-size camera that sends pictures of the intestine to a recorder worn on their belt) to an x-ray study (called dedicated small bowel contrast radiography) in patients who have bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract without a source of the bleeding identified on routine endoscopic examinations of the esophagus (food pipe), stomach, small intestine, and large intestine. The investigators hope to determine if the capsule is a better test in terms of decreasing further bleeding, decreasing the need for further diagnostic testing, and decreasing the need for blood transfusions and time spent in the hospital.</brief_summary>
