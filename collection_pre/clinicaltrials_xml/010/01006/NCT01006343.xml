	<brief_summary>The entire study protocol will last 13 weeks. Women will be randomly assigned to one of two experimental groups: high and low protein. All women will consume their unrestricted habitual diet during week 1 while baseline testing and measurements are taken. Starting at week 2, women in both groups will be counseled to consume a 750 kcal/day energy deficit diet containing either the RDA (LP group) or more than the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) (HP group) for protein. The energy restriction period will continue for 12 weeks (through study week 13) and is expected to result in body weight reduction of approximately 17 pounds. Testing and measurements will be repeated during week 13.</brief_summary>
