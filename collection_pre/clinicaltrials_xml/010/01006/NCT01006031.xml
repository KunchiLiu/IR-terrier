	<brief_summary>Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of high doses of both peginterferon-alfa 2a (360 ug per week) plus ribavirin (800 mg b.i.d.) in HIV-infected patients with compensated liver cirrhosis by HCV genotype 1 or 4 without previous virological response(*) to a standard dose treatment of both drugs. (*) Non previous virological response: no decrease of plasma RNA-HCV at least 2 log10 after 12 weeks in treatment or breakthrough viremia while on treatment. Additionally, this study will evaluated the influence of simultaneous peginterferon-alfa 2a and ribavirin plasma concentrations on early viral response (EVR) and sustained viral response (SVR) in these patients. Method: Pilot clinical trial, phase II-III, open labeled multicenter in which patients from several hospitals of the Servicio Andaluz de Salud will be enrolled. The usual clinical and analytical follow up will be performed but additional blood samples will be obtained for determination of interferon and ribavirin plasma levels. The primary end point will be a sustained virologic response (defined as an undetectable serum HCV-RNA after 24 weeks after the cessation of treatment). Likewise, rapid virological response (at 4 weeks of treatment), early virological response (at 12 weeks), and end of treatment response rates will be evaluated as well as their relationships with the plasma interferon an ribavirin concentrations determined by ELISA and HPLC, respectively. The safety and tolerability of the studied medications will be evaluated by means of clinical adverse events, physical examination and laboratory results. The evolution of liver fibrosis will be evaluated comparing the basal and end of treatment results of transient elastometry.</brief_summary>
