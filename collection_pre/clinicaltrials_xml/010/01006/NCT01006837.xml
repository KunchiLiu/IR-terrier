	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to analyze changes in core body- and skin temperature during pre-hospital and early in-hospital treatment of multi-traumatized patients. The researchers want to investigate when trauma patients get cold and to what extent.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hypothermia in the Trauma Patient - When do Trauma Patients Get Cold?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypothermia is a common finding in severely traumatized patients. Decreases in core temperature during the course of initial evaluation and resuscitation are common, and can contribute to poor outcomes in multi-traumatized patients. In this study the temperature will be recorded continually with multiple skin probes and an ear-probe from the site of the accident to arrival in the intensive care unit (including time in primary surgery, if any).</detailed_description>
