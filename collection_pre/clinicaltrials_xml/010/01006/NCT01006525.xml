	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy of Chronic Hypnotic Use</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The acknowledged drugs of choice for the pharmacological treatment of insomnia are the benzodiazepine receptor agonist hypnotics (BzRA). Studies show that at therapeutic doses, used over the short-term, the abuse liability of BzRAs is relatively low and their efficacy outweighs their minimal risks. However, an increasing number of patients use BzRAs nightly for longer periods of time than is currently indicated (i.e. 4 weeks) and, minimal data on the long-term abuse liability and efficacy of these drugs exist. This project, using both prospective and retrospective methods, will address questions about the long-term abuse liability and efficacy of the BzRAs. The questions being raised are: What are the abuse liability and efficacy of hypnotics currently being used chronically and what is the prospective abuse liability and efficacy of hypnotics used chronically? Zolpidem is the chosen standard for this project as it is the most frequently prescribed BzRA and also arguably the BzRA with the best short-term efficacy and safety profile. The focus of the first question is clinical; it is about the long-term abuse liability and efficacy of BzRAs, specifically zolpidem, as it is currently being prescribed and about the type of patients who receive this drug. The second question addresses the issue of whether a standard BzRA can be prescribed efficaciously and safely for the long-term to patients with primary insomnia.</detailed_description>
