	<brief_summary>This trial is conducted in Africa, Asia, Europe and South America. The aim of this clinical trial is to compare NN1250 (insulin degludec (IDeg) with insulin glargine (IGlar) in patients with type 2 diabetes. Subjects treated with oral antidiabetic drug(s) (OAD(s)) should continue their current OAD treatment at the stable, prerandomisation dose level and dosing frequency.</brief_summary>
