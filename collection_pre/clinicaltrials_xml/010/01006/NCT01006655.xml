	<brief_summary>Respiratory diseases including Asthma are high prevalent among preschool children. Specific treatment, nowadays, include steroid inhalers and anti leukotrienes. It is known that the amount of the drug reaching small airways and lungs is bigger how much smaller the particles liberated by inhalers. Beclometasone is being used for treating asthma for 30 years. Lately emerged a new presentation of beclometasone, which liberates particles as small as 2.1 µg, that is supposed to reach the small airways at higher concentrations and be more suitable to patients who don't cooperate properly to the procedure of inhalation. The investigators' group has reported successfully the possibility to perform Pulmonary Challenge tests (adenosine, methacholine and exercise) in tender age. Other studies reported relation between asthma control and reduction in airway hyperreactivity. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of Beclometasone dipropionate - Qvar to reduce airways hyperreactivity in preschool children, as demonstrated by adenosine challenge test.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect of HFA - Beclomethasone Dipropionate Qvar on Bronchial Hyperreactivity in Preschool Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>26 - 30 patients, between 3 -6 years old, mild asthmatics, with positive adenosine challenge test, will received in a randomized, double blind, cross over assignment Beclometasone dipropionate (100µg twice a day) or placebo, through an inhaler (autohaler) device, attached to a spacer device, during four consecutive weeks. Adenosine Challenge test will be performed another time at the end of this four weeks period. After 2 weeks with no medication (wash out period) the patients will receive the second intervention (beclometasone dipropionate or placebo) in a cross over manner and will be submitted to the last adenosine challenge test. Clinical evaluation, resting spirometry and subjective evaluation through an analogical symptoms scale will be recorded in each visit.</detailed_description>
