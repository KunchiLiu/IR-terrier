	<criteria>Have a histologic and/or cytologic diagnosis of metastatic melanoma (Stage IV) Have the presence of evaluable disease as defined by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.0) Have a performance status of 0 to 1 on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group(ECOG) Scale Have progressed after 1 previous systemic treatment containing dacarbazine or temozolomide for metastatic melanoma Have discontinued all previous therapies for cancer, including chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy, or other investigational therapy for at least 30 days (6 weeks for mitomycinC or nitrosoureas) before study enrollment and recovered from the acute effects of therapy (except alopecia) Have a serum albumin level greater than or equal to 3.0 g/dL or greater than or equal to 30 g/L Have received greater than or equal to 2 previous chemotherapycontaining systemic treatment regimens for metastatic melanoma. An immunotherapy or antibodybased regimen [including biologic agents and vaccinationbased treatments], or treatment with a targeted agent (e.g BRAF or cKit inhibitor, is not counted as a prior treatment regimen for determining study eligibility, unless either was combined with a cytotoxic drug). Have active central nervous system (CNS) or leptomeningeal metastasis (brain metastasis) at the time of study entry. Patients with signs or symptoms of neurological compromise should have appropriate radiographic imaging performed before study entry to rule out occult brain metastasis. Patients with a history of a solitary CNS metastasis previously treated with curative intent (e.g., stereotactic radiation or surgery) and not requiring steroids are eligible. Are receiving warfarin Have primary ocular or mucosal melanoma Any previous treatment with paclitaxel or a paclitaxelcontaining regimen for metastatic melanoma Have serious concomitant disorders, including active bacterial, fungal, or viral infection, incompatible with the study (at the discretion of the investigator) Have previously completed or withdrawn from this study or any other study investigating tasisulam Have a known hypersensitivity to paclitaxel or Cremophor EL (polyoxyethylated castor oil) Are pregnant or lactating Have received a recent (within 30 days before enrollment) or are receiving concurrent yellow fever vaccination Have known positive test results in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B surface antigen (HBSAg), or hepatitis C antibodies (HCAb) Are unable to withhold dosing of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or protonpump inhibitors (PPIs) for at least 72 hours before and after treatment with tasisulam.</criteria>
