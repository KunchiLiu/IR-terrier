	<brief_summary>Histaminergic agents are known to be involved with the sleep/wake cycle. This compound is a histaminergic agent which therefore may improve alertness and awakeness in patients with excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) associated with narcolepsy. Significant improvement in EDS when treated with this compound compared to placebo in patients with narcolepsy is hypothesized.</brief_summary>
