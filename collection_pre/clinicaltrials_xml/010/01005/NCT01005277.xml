	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Studying samples of DNA from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors identify and learn more about biomarkers related to cancer. PURPOSE: This research study is looking at biomarkers in DNA samples from patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia or acute myeloid leukemia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Biomarkers in DNA Samples From Patients With Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia or Acute Myeloid Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Collect DNA samples from patients with cytogenetically, well characterized, and uniformly treated acute lymphoblastic leukemia or acute myeloid leukemia for use in analysis of a wide range of host factors influencing etiology and outcome of the disease. - Identify host factors that can be determined at onset of treatment to predict outcome of chemotherapy, and thus modify the therapy administered. OUTLINE: Previously collected DNA samples are analyzed for polymorphisms at a variety of loci. Gene expression and expression profiles are correlated with genotype and therapy outcomes.</detailed_description>
