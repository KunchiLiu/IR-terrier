	<brief_summary>This study will be a cross-sectional survey of interobserver variability associated with contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) to detect endoleaks using computed tomographic angiography (CTA) as the practice standard. The investigators will enroll 40 consecutive patients undergoing endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR). At the first follow-up visit after the procedure, participants will undergo two abdominal ultrasound examinations with and without contrast, and one CTA. Analyses will be conducted to examine interobserver variability in the detection and characterization of endoleaks using contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS). Other endpoints include examination of sensitivity and specificity of CEUS compared to CTA, and characterization of the number and types of endoleaks detected.</brief_summary>
