	<brief_summary>To determine whether functional electrical stimulation (FES) promotes neurological and physical recovery in patients with spinal cord injury (SCI). The researchers will investigate the extent of functional recovery in patients with spinal cord injury who receive functional electrical stimulation in the upper extremities compared with patients who do not receive FES.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Patterned Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) Ergometry of Arm and Shoulder in Individuals With Spinal Cord Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A randomized, controlled, single-blinded, in-subject controlled (A-B type) trial will be performed in patients with SCI receiving an upper extremities non-FES assisted exercise protocol compared with patients receiving upper extremities ergometry in combination with FES. Neurological and functional outcome measures will be obtained at baseline (time 0), after 1st 4 months of intervention (4 months), after 1 month washout (5 months),after 2nd 4 months intervention (9 months), and 3 month after completing the last intervention (12 months).</detailed_description>
