The combination of the aromatase inhibitor exemestane with with another breast cancer drug that blocks epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and Erb-2 activity (lapatinib) is being studied for the possibility of improving response to therapy, and delaying resistance to endocrine therapy.</brief_summary>
