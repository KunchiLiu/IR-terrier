	<brief_summary>The primary goal of this study is to evaluate the effect of PF-04360365 on the clearance of ABETA from the CSF (cerebrospinal fluid) in patients with mild Alzheimer's disease and healthy volunteers. Additionally, the study will assess the pharmacokinetics of PF-04360365, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic relationships in plasma and CSF and the safety and tolerability of single doses of PF-04360365 administered to patients with Alzheimer's disease and healthy volunteers.</brief_summary>
