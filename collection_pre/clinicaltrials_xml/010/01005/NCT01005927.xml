	<brief_summary>Fructooligosaccharides (FOS) are believed to have positive effects on calcium absorption and bone accrual during growth. This study aims to see whether the addition of fiber in the form of FOS to a calcium-containing beverage will increase calcium absorption. During two clinical visits, participants will receive a beverage containing a small amount of calcium, supplemented with either no dietary fiber or a small amount of fiber. Height, weight, bone density and geometry, calcium absorption, and physical fitness will be measured. The effects of this fiber intervention may provide support for improving bone health with minimal fiber supplementation.</brief_summary>
