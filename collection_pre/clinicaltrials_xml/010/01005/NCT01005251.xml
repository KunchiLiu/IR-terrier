	<brief_summary>This study is being carried out to see whether AZD3355 is an effective treatment as an add-on to PPI therapy in patients with Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) with a partial response to PPI and to compare this with Proton Pump Inhibitor (PPI) treatment alone. Another goal of the study is to examine which of the investigated doses of AZD3355 is optimal for treatment of these patients. This study will also measure levels of drug in the blood and see how well it is tolerated.</brief_summary>
