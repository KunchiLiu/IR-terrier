No prior systemic chemotherapy for lung cancer. At least one unidimensionally measurable lesion meeting Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance status of 0 or 1. Adequate organ function. Prior radiation therapy allowed to &lt;25% of the bone marrow. Signed informed consent document on file. Estimated life expectancy of greater than or equal to 12 weeks. Participant compliance and geographic proximity that allow adequate follow up. Peripheral neuropathy of great than or equal to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Grade 1. Inability to comply with protocol or study procedures. A serious concomitant systemic disorder that, in the opinion of the investigator, would compromise the participant's ability to complete the study. A serious cardiac condition, such as myocardial infarction within 6 months, angina, or heart disease, as defined by the New York Heart Association Class III or IV. Second primary malignancy that is clinically detectable at the time of consideration for study enrollment. Documented brain metastases unless the participant has completed successful local therapy for central nervous system metastases and has not taken corticosteroids for at least 4 weeks before enrollment. Presence of clinically significant thirdspace fluid collections, for example, ascites or pleural effusions that cannot be controlled by drainage or other procedures prior to study entry. Significant weight loss (that is, greater than or equal to 10%) over the previous 6 weeks before study entry. Concurrent administration of any other antitumor therapy. Inability to interrupt aspirin or other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents for a 5day period (8day period for longacting agents, such as piroxicam). Inability or unwillingness to take folic acid or vitamin B12 supplementation. Inability to take corticosteroids. Pregnant or breastfeeding. Are currently enrolled in, or discontinued within the last 30 days from, a clinical trial involving an offlabel use of an investigational drug or device (other than the study drug), or concurrently enrolled in any other type of medical research judged not to be scientifically or medically compatible with this study.</criteria>
