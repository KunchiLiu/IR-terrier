	<brief_summary>This study is a non-intervention, multicenter study to address biomarkers of acetaminophen toxicity in children. Specifically, the study will examine acetaminophen (APAP) protein adducts and markers of liver injury in the blood samples of hospitalized children and adolescents who are receiving standard doses of acetaminophen, and children and adolescents who are status post acetaminophen overdose. Ultimately, the data generated from this study will be used to establish second generation biomarkers of acetaminophen toxicity, based on specific adduct proteins, which can be used in future risk assessment studies of children receiving acetaminophen.</brief_summary>
