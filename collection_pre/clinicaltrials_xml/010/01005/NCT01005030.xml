	<detailed_description>Oxidative stress has been implicated as a factor in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). The overall goal of this proposal is to use a novel metabolomics platform, based on near infrared biospectroscopy, to detect oxidatively modified blood plasma constituents. These spectral findings can be used to model the degree of oxidative stress with a modeled "stress index" that may distinguish PD cases from healthy elderly controls.</detailed_description>
