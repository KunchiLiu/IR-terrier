	<brief_title>Genetic Investigation of Solid Tumors Cohort</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recent studies in human genetics have discovered several intervals in the human genome containing inherited variants that are statistically associated with the propensity to develop solid tumors. Even though it has been firmly established that if an individual carries these DNA variants they have an increased chance of developing a solid tumor the underlying biological mechanisms for most of these associations are largely unknown. In addition to inherited DNA variants that are associated with the development of solid tumors it is well established that during the development and growth of solid tumors the DNA in these cancer cells undergo somatic changes (mutations). These somatic DNA changes have been studied over the past decade and frequently are specific chromosomal translocations and amplifications associated with the development of particular solid tumors. In some instances, examining the chromosomal translocation and amplification has lead to the discovery of proteins contributing to solid tumor pathology. the human 8q24 interval that has strong genetic associations with solid tumor development has also been noted as frequently amplified in solid tumors and serves as a predictor of poor survival in prostate cancers.</detailed_description>
