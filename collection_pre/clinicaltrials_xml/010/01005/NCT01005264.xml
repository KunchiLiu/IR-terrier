	<brief_summary>1. Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of removable cast walker compared to non-removable fiberglass off-bearing cast in the treatment of diabetic plantar foot ulcer 2. Research design and methods: Forty-five adult diabetic patients with non-ischemic, non-infected neuropathic plantar ulcer were randomized to treatment with a non-removable fiberglass off-bearing cast (TCC group) or walker cast (Stabil-D group). Treatment duration was 90 days. Percent reduction in ulcer surface area and total healing rates were evaluated after treatment.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study design: Two centers specializing in diabetic foot management (located in Sesto S. Giovanni and Milan, Italy) participated to this open, randomized clinical trial. The ethics-committee approved the study on January 10th, 2008. Enrollment of consecutive patients began February 2008 and ended March 2009. Eligible patients were fully informed of the study aim and procedures and written consent was obtained prior to study participation. Patients were then randomly assigned to one of the two treatment groups by opening randomization codebreak envelopes containing one of the two options. Separate randomization was performed for each center, and a copy of all randomization envelopes was kept at the statistical department of the Multimedica center. The two arms were composed of patients managed with non-removable fiberglass off-bearing cast (TCC group) and patients offloaded with the Stabil-DÂ® (Podartis srl, Montebelluna, Treviso, Italy) walker cast (Stabil-D group).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The presence of neuropathic plantar ulcer with an area graded IA according to the Texas University classification, AND The presence of peripheral neuropathy. Peripheral neuropathy was diagnosed based on insensitivity to a 10g SemmesWeinstein monofilament in more than 6 out of 9 areas of the foot and by a vibration perception threshold measured by biothesiometer (Neurothesiometer SLS, Nottingham, UK) at the malleolus &gt; 25 volts. Presence of an anklebrachial pressure index (ABI) &lt; 0.9 and/or transcutaneous oxygen tension (TcPO2) &lt; 50 mmHg tested on the dorsum of the foot, Presence of clinical signs of infection, including edema, erythema, increased local skin temperature, or drainage, The probetobone maneuver was required to be negative, Tthe standard Xray examination of the foot was required to be negative for osteomyelitis, Use of steroids or cytostatic drugs, Presence of sensory, motor, or visual problems that could impair functional autonomy, Active ulcer on the contralateral foot, Previous major amputation of the contralateral limb, Previous or current deep venous leg thrombosis, OR Mental disorders interfering with patient compliance.</criteria>
