	<brief_summary>The investigators hypothesis is that spinal tetracaine with fentanyl and epinephrine used for CSE labor analgesia volume will last a significantly longer period of time that that of spinal bupivacaine with fentanyl. After informed consent is obtained for the study, subjects meeting criteria when analgesia is requested will be randomized to receive a combined spinal-epidural containing either tetracaine 2 mg with fentanyl and epinephrine or bupivacaine 2 mg with fentanyl and epinephrine.</brief_summary>
