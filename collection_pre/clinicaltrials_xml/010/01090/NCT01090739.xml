	<brief_title>Clinical Study to Investigate the Effectiveness of the TOPAS System to Treat Fecal Incontinence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, multi-center, single-arm, open-label, two- stage, adaptive study conducted to obtain data to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the TOPAS system for the treatment of FI in women who have failed conservative therapy. It was approved by the FDA for up to 152 implanted subjects at up to 15 investigational sites in the US. Eight study centers are led by a Colorectal Surgeon and seven centers are led by an Urogynecologist. This study is being conducted in compliance with Title 21 CFR Parts 11, 50, 54, 56, and 812; the principles of GCP as set forth in the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki (2008); and the ISO standard 14155:2011 (Clinical investigation of medical devices for human subjects - Good clinical practice).</detailed_description>
