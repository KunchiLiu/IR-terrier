	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to identify aspects of the bladder cancer (BlCa) survivorship experience that differ by clinical risk at diagnosis. The investigators will collect cross-sectional data from persons with BlCa to identify aspects of health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and symptom management. The study originally enrolled only nonmuscle-invasive bladder cancer survivors but has been expanded to include survivors with any stage disease. Information from this study will be used to develop a new patient education and counseling intervention.</brief_summary>
