	<brief_summary>St. Jude Medical developed the Merlin.net™ Patient Care Network (Merlin.net™ PCN) to augment or replace routine scheduled in-clinic visits. This investigation is designed with the hypothesis that detection of events (system integrity and diagnostic related) through Direct Alerts™ via Remote Monitoring allow clinicians an earlier opportunity to address and resolve events and may therefore improve patient care.</brief_summary>
