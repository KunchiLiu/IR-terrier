	<brief_summary>Percutaneous treatment of bifurcation lesion is a complex procedure. After main vessel stent implantation, the side branch became jailed and the carina can be displaced resulting in complete occlusion of this vessel. Re-wiring the side branch in this conditions may result difficult and some times impossible. There is no agreement regarding the need of side branch pre-dilation (before main vessel stent implantation) to reduce these complications. Researchers from European Bifurcation Club have proposed no to pre-dilate the side branch to avoid vessel dissection and difficulties in rewiring the true lumen of the vessel. On the contrary, our group has a good experience in the treatment of bifurcation lesions treated with side branch pre-dilation. Aims: 1.- To determine the efficacy of the side-branch pre-dilation in patients with bifurcations lesions treated with provisional T stenting. 2.- To determine the success rate and incidence of complications in patients with and without side-branch pre-dilation, as well as economic impact in terms of number of used wires.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Introduction: Percutaneous treatment of bifurcation lesion is a complex procedure. After main vessel stent implantation, the side branch became jailed and the carina can be displaced resulting in complete occlusion of this vessel. Re-wiring the side branch in this conditions may result difficult and some times impossible. There is no agreement regarding the need of side branch pre-dilation (before main vessel stent implantation) to reduce these complications. Researchers from European Bifurcation Club have proposed no to pre-dilate the side branch to avoid vessel dissection and difficulties in rewiring the true lumen of the vessel. On the contrary, our group has a good experience in the treatment of bifurcation lesions treated with side branch pre-dilation. Aims: 1.- To determine the efficacy of the side-branch pre-dilation in patients with bifurcations lesions treated with provisional T stenting. 2.- To determine the success rate and incidence of complications in patients with and without side-branch pre-dilation, as well as economic impact in terms of number of used wires. Design: Prospective and randomized study. Patients and methods: The series is constituted by 420 patients with bifurcations lesions that will be treated with drug-eluting stents; 210 patients will be treated with side branch pre-dilation before main vessels stent implantation, while the remaining 210 patients will be randomized to no pre-dilation of the side-branch. Primary end point: - TIMI flow at Side Branch after main vessel stent implantation. Secondary end points: - Time of re-wiring. - Number of used wires. - % of stenosis at Side Branch. - Levels of CK and TpI after the procedure. - Related cardiac events at 9 months. Relevance: Currently there has been controversy over the use of the side branch pre-dilation in patients with bifurcations lesions treated with provisional T-stenting. However, we have no comparative study in the literature.</detailed_description>
