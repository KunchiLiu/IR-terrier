Adults in general good health as determined by the Investigator based upon the results of medical history, laboratory profile, and physical examination. 3. Females of reproductive potential are eligible to participate in the study if they have a negative urine pregnancy test at screening and baseline and who are using 2 forms of effective birth control. 4. Palmar/Plantar PGA of 3 or more 1. Psoriasis patients without palm and/or sole psoriasis or a palmar/plantar PGA score of less than 3 2. Patients younger than 18 and older than 85 years old. 3. Evidence of skin conditions at the time of the screening visit (e.g. eczema) other than psoriasis that would interfere with evaluations of the effect of study medication on psoriasis 4. Receipt of any investigational drugs within 4 weeks of study drug initiation 5. Psoralens + UltraViolet A (PUVA) or oral systemic treatments within 4 weeks of study drug initiation. 6. Biologics within 3 months of study initiation 7. Ultraviolet B (UVB) therapy or topical steroids within 2 weeks of study drug initiation 8. A prior history of tuberculosis, and/or a positive Purified Protein Derivative (PPD) skin test/Chest XRay (CXR) at screening without appropriate treatment. Treatment of latent Tuberculosis (TB) infections (for those with positive PPD tests) must be initiated prior to therapy. 9. Receipt of live vaccines 1 month prior to or while in study 10. Chronic hepatitis B or hepatitis C infection 11. History of alcohol or drug abuse one year before and during the study. 12. Known Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)positive status or any other immunesuppressing disease. 13. Any grade 3 or 4 adverse event, or laboratory toxicity, at the time of the screening visit or at any time during the study 14. Presence of a grade 3 or 4 infection &lt;30 days prior to the screening visit, between the screening visit and the first day of treatment on study, or any time during the study that in the opinion of the Investigator would preclude participation in the study. 15.
