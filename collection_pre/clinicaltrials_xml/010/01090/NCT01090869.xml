	<brief_summary>The investigators aimed to evaluate the health benefits of physical training per se, weight loss per se and exercise-induced weight loss in young, overweight men. The investigators hypothesized that physical training would have independent effects on various health parameters (insulin sensitivity, fasting glucose and insulin, total and abdominal fat mass, waist circumference, blood pressure and key muscle proteins), and that a concomitant weight loss from physical activity would increase the effect.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Physical Training Per se</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>At baseline, during the intervention and in the week following the intervention participants underwent a panel of tests: - Cardio respiratory fitness - blood pressure - anthropometric measures At baseline and after the intervention a hyperinsulinemic, euglycemic clamp were performed to asses insulin sensitivity. Tissue and blood samples were also collected for further analysis: - Total-protein analysis of selected proteins - Fasting plasma glucose, insulin and free fatty acids</detailed_description>
