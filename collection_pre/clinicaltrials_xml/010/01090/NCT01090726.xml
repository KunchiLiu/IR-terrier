	<brief_summary>The purpose of the pilot study is to compare new laryngoscopes for infants by assessing the equipment best suited to assist the intubation, with the best overview, shortest time to intubation and use these numbers to make a sample size calculation for the full protocol. The investigators hypothesis is that the Storz videolaryngoscope® has a better success rate than infants (&lt;2 years). The patients will be optimally anaesthetized with neuromuscular blockade for the intubation. All patient will be evaluated with af Macintosh blade laryngoscope, with an Airtraq® or a Storz videolaryngoscope®, and finally intubated with the other one of the later, which the patient was randomized to.</brief_summary>
