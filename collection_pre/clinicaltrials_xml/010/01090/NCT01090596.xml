	<brief_summary>Using tissue samples obtained from a previous study, the effect of naproxen on the gene expression profiles of antral mucosal tissue will be assessed. We hypothesize that there will be distinct changes in the gene expression profiles of samples taken from individuals treated with naproxen versus samples taken from individuals treated with placebo.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We will use microarray technology to quantify the transcriptome-wide changes in gene expression in said-samples.</detailed_description>
