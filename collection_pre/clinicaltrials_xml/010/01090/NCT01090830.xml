	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to establish the safest dose of the investigational medication Belinostat that can be administered with a standard of care chemotherapy regimen of bevacizumab, carboplatin, and paclitaxel. Further study will examine the short and long-term effect (up to 2 years) of this medication on participant's disease status and overall survival.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy of Belinostat When Used With Standard of Care Chemotherapy for Untreated Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase Ib/II, single center, open label, dose-finding study to evaluate the use of Belinostat when given with standard of care chemotherapy in patients with untreated, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In the Phase Ib portion, dose limiting toxicity evaluation will be used to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of Belinostat when given with fixed doses of bevacizumab, carboplatin, and paclitaxel(a BelCap-B regimen). Three dose levels of Belinostat are proposed (600mg/kg, 800mg/kg, 1000mg/kg). Determination of MTD will be the basis for establishing set dosing for the phase II component of the study. The phase II portion of the study includes further drug safety evaluation and a preliminary assessment of efficacy of Belinostat when used with specified induction and maintenance regimens. Response will be evaluated through the RECIST criteria. Additional analysis will be done to estimate the time to response, progression free survival, median survival, and overall survival (OS) in study participants to 2 years post-initiation of cycle 1. Based on a standard 3 x 3 statistical design, the phase Ib portion may accrue between 3 to 12 participants. Phase II will have a minimum sample size of 10 and a maximum of 16 patients. Participants who complete the Phase I portion and are able to advance to Phase II, will be evaluable for the Phase II objectives.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically or cytologically documented NSCLC confirmed. Has advanced NSCLC (Stage IV), not previously treated with any chemotherapy regiment (prior adjuvant chemotherapy and/or chemotherapy/radiation for Stage III allowed). Measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as &gt;20 mm with conventional techniques or as &gt;10 mm with spiral CT scan. Life expectancy of &gt; 3 months Must have returned to baseline or grade 1 adverse event from any acute toxicity related to prior therapy Adequate immune and multisystem organ function (as evidenced by urine and blood values within specified parameters). Brain or meningeal metastases. Note, patients with adequately treated brain metastases, e.g. surgically resected, or adequately controlled by radiotherapy, with no residual neurological symptoms due to metastases and no steroid treatment required, can be enrolled. If clinical suspicion, adequate investigations should be performed to rule out brain metastases or meningeal involvement. History of a previous malignancy within 5 years with the exception of nonmetastatic nonmelanoma skin cancer or cervical carcinoma in situ. Prior systemic therapy for other malignancy must be completed at least 5 years before treatment is allowed. Lung carcinoma of squamous cell histology (mixed tumors will be categorized by the predominant cell type unless small cell elements are present, in which case the patient is ineligible; sputum cytology alone is not acceptable). History of hemoptysis within 3 months prior to enrollment Current or recent (within 10 days of enrollment) use of aspirin (&gt;325 mg/day) or chronic use of other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory medications. Prior systemic antitumor therapy for Stage IV lung cancer. Note, prior radiotherapy is allowed provided treatment was completed at least 2 weeks before enrollment. Prior surgery is allowed if completed at least 4 weeks before enrollment. Treatment with investigational agents within the 2 weeks prior to enrollment. Significant vascular disease (e.g., aortic aneurysm, history of aortic dissection) or clinically significant peripheral vascular disease. Hypertension not controlled by medical therapy. Significant cardiovascular disease, myocardial infarction within the past 6 months, unstable angina, unstable arrhythmia or a need for antiarrhythmic therapy (use of medication to control heart rate in patients with atrial fibrillation is allowed, if stable medication for at least last month prior to enrollment, or evidence of acute ischemia on electrocardiogram). Marked baseline prolongation of QT/QTc interval that required use of concomitant medication that may cause Torsade de Pointes Significant, nonhealing wounds, acute or nonhealing ulcers, or bone fractures within 3 months of fracture. Undergone major surgery within 4 weeks of planned initiation of cycle 1. History of abdominal fistula, gastrointestinal perforation, or intraabdominal abscess within 28 days of enrollment. History of any gastrointestinal bleeding within the 3 months prior to enrollment. Known hypersensitivity to either platinum compounds or paclitaxel, or any components of the study medications, and inability for desensitization. Peripheral neuropathy NCI â‰¥ Grade 2. Coexisting active severe infection or any coexisting medical condition likely to interfere with trial procedures. Known infection with HIV, or known active Hepatitis B or C infection. Pregnant or lactating. not willing to use effective contraception during the study and until 6 months postcompletion of last cycle administered</criteria>
