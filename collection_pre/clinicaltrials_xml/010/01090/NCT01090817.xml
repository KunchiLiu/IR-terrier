	<brief_summary>Despite the advent of newer biologic therapies such as infliximab for Crohn's disease, a form of autoimmune inflammatory bowel disease, a proportion of patients are refractory to such therapy and require surgery. The hypothesis is that mesenchymal stromal cell therapy using third party human cultured cells will be safe and effective</brief_summary>
