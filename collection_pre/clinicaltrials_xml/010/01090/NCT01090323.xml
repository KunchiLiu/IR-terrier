	<brief_title>Evaluation of the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics (PK) and Effects on Liver Iron Concentration of ICL670 Relative to Deferoxamine(DFO).</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The treatment period started once the patient completed the core study and signed informed consent. It is continued for up to 4 years. Safety parameters were assessed every 4 weeks. Eye and Ear examinations were performed on a yearly basis. To further investigate the extent of iron overload, serum ferritin, iron, and transferrin were monitored every four weeks. The Program Safety Board monitored the safety of ICL670 during the study to evaluate and categorize any serious case reported in association with ICL670.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients were included who met the following criteria: Completion of the core [Study 0109] Serum ferritin greater than or equal to 500 µg/L Ability to comply with all studyrelated procedures, medications, and evaluations Sexually active postmenarche female patients must use doublebarrier contraception, oral contraceptive plus barrier contraceptive, or must have undergone clinically documented total hysterectomy and/or oophorectomy, tubal ligation or be postmenopausal defined by amenorrhea for at least 12 months. Written informed consent and assent by the patient and or their parents or legal guardian. Additional inclusion criteria for pediatric patients The definition of the term 'pediatric' for enrollment and study conduct was in accordance with local law. Parents or the legal guardians were fully informed by the investigator as to the requirements of the study. The pediatric patients themselves were informed according to their capabilities in a language and terms that they were able to understand. Written informed consent was obtained from their legal guardian on the patient's behalf in accordance with national legislation. If capable, all patients had to also personally sign their written informed consent. Patients who met the following criteria were to be excluded: History of noncompliance to medical regimens and patients who are considered potentially unreliable and/or not cooperative Serum creatinine above the ageappropriate upper limit of normal within one week prior to entry Patients with ALT ≥ 500 U/L within one week prior to entry Evidence of chelationrelated cataracts or hearing loss within 4 weeks prior to baseline Pregnancy (as indicated by serum βHCG pregnancy test for all female patients with the potential to become pregnant) and patients who are breastfeeding Patients treated with systemic investigational drug within 4 weeks prior to or with topical investigational drug within 7 days prior to the baseline visit Other protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply</criteria>
