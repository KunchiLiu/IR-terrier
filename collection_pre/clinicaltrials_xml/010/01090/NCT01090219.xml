	<brief_summary>The aim of this study was to analyze the shrinkage of two different screens in the repair of inguinal hernias in men . 32 patients with unilateral inguinal hernia were assigned randomly. A Lichtenstein tension-free hernia repair was accomplished by emplacing heavy weight versus ultralight weight polypropylene meshes for repair of incisional hernia, marked next to the lips with six titanium clips (LT200).</brief_summary>
