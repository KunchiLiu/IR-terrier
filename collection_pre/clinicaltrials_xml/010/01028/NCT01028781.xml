	<brief_summary>Patients will undergo a standard history and physical examination detailing objective clinical exam findings performed by one of the co-investigators. The research coordinator will obtain baseline values for intensity of pain, quality of life, and coping strategies. Baseline serum levels inflammatory markers will then be measured. Over the course of 12 weeks Thalidomide will be titrated as tolerated to achieve a minimum of a 30% reduction of pain on VAS from week 2.</brief_summary>
