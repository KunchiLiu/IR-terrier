	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the prevalence of pre-surgical patients who are MRSA carriers. From an evidence-based practice perspective, findings from this study can be considered in the evaluation of the hospital SOP mandating pre-surgical MRSA screening requirements for patients with scheduled surgeries. The central hypothesis to be addressed in this study is whether the MRSA colonization and subsequent post-operative infection are the equivalent in these populations.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Design and Methods: Subjects in this study of 975 pre-operative, scheduled surgical patients are in one of the three following groups: - Group 1 (N=325): Allocation sample of surgical patients required to be MRSA screened per hospital SOP (including patients having a positive MRSA history, orthopedic surgery, undergoing dialysis, or transfer from another hospital, nursing home, skilled nursing facility, or jail). - Group 2 (N=650): Randomized sample (1:1 ratio) of surgical patients not required to be MRSA screened per hospital SOP, to one of the following two groups: - 2a (N=325): MRSA screening; or - 2b (N=325): No MRSA screening. All subjects were followed for 30 days post-operatively to determine the incidence of post-operative infection. Treatment, diagnostic, and hospitalization data were collected for patients diagnosed with post-operative infection.</detailed_description>
