	<brief_summary>This is an 8 week research study of aripiprazole (abilify) which is used to reduce irritable behaviors in autism spectrum disorders. All participants will receive active study medication. Participants will also receive diagnostic and cognitive evaluations at no cost. Participants will be required to undergo two fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging scans) where we will take pictures of your brain while performing simple tasks.</brief_summary>
