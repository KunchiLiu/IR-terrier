	<brief_summary>This study will investigate the efficacy of the Flutemetamol (18F) Injection PET tracer in identifying abnormal (18F) flutemetamol uptake patterns which predict the conversion from aMCI to a b-amyloid associated clinically probable Alzheimer's disease.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>The subject is 60 years old or older. The subject meets the Petersen criteria for amnestic MCI. The subject has a score of less than or equal to 4 on the Modified Hachinski Ischemic Scale. The subject has a MMSE score of 2430. The subject has a noncontrast MRI examination as part of the screening visit that excludes aMCI arising from structural causes. The subject and/or the subject's legally acceptable representative, if applicable, in accordance with local regulations, has signed and dated an informed consent. The subject has any significant neurologic disease other than suspected aMCI; such as Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, normal pressure hydrocephalus, brain tumor, supranuclear palsy, seizure disorder, subdural hematoma, multiple sclerosis, or history of significant head trauma followed by persistent neurologic deficits, or known structural brain abnormalities. The subject has one or more aneurysm clips, artificial heart valves, metal implants, embedded metal fragments or pacemakers that would pose a risk during an MRI. The subject has major depression, bipolar disorder, as described in the DSMIV within the past year. The subject has history of schizophrenia (DSMIV criteria). The subject has had, within the prior 3 months, psychotic features, agitation or behavioral problems that could lead to protocol compliance issues.</criteria>
