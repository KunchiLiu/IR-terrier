	<brief_summary>In the investigators study, the investigators will focus on the screening of the related proteins and miRNA to IBS in order to reveal the possible clues or molecular mechanism for this disorder.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Abnormal Expression Proteins, Mitochondrial DNA and miRNA of Irritable Bowel Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For the proteomic procedures, Our study groups extracted proteins from the cecum and sigmoid colon samples and ran on the two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE). The proteins on 2-DE were visualized by the silver stain, and then gel maps were scanned and analyzed with the Image Master 2D Elite. The obvious abnormal protein spots were identified by the mass spectrometry. Western blot 、 immunohistochemistry 、 mRNA and miRNA were also performed for further verification of the proteins.</detailed_description>
