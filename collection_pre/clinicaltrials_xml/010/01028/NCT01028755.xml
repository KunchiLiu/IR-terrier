	<brief_summary>This is the first time this drug will be tested in humans in order to determine the safety of the drug, the ability to tolerate the drug, to measure how the drug is used in the body and as a result of these tests to determine a maximum dose to be given. Specifically, the following aspects will be investigated: - side effects of BAY79-4620 given as infusion every three weeks - evaluation of highest and safest dose of BAY79-4620 - distribution and concentration of BAY79-4620 in the blood at specific times after administration - effect of BAY79-4620 on tumor growth - assessment of "biomarkers" (eg, analysis of specific proteins in blood samples, or analysis of tumor tissue sampled at the time of cancer diagnosis) for changes during the treatment or prediction of safety or benefits of the treatment with BAY79-4620.</brief_summary>

ECOG Performance Status of 0 2 Life expectancy of at least 12 weeks Patients with advanced, histologically or cytological confirmed solid tumors, refractory to any standard therapy or have no standard therapy available Radiographically or clinically evaluable tumor Adequate bone marrow, liver and renal function as assessed by the following laboratory requirements to be conducted within 14 days prior to start of first dose: Hemoglobin &gt; 10.0 g/dL Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt; or = 1500/mm3 Platelet count &gt; or = 100,000 /mm3 Total bilirubin &lt; or = 1.5 times the upper limit of normal ALT and AST &lt; or = 2.5 x upper limit of normal (&lt; or = 5 x upper limit of normal for patients with liver involvement) INR less than or = 1.5 and a PTT within normal limits (patients who do not undergo an anticoagulative treatment, but have an abnormal high PTT while INR is normal, indicating towards an artificial PTT elevation caused by heparinized, are eligible. Serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 times the upper limit of normal History of impaired cardiac function or clinically significant cardiac disease (i.e. congestive heart failure (CHF) NYHA Class III or IV); myocardial infarction, unstable angina or cardiac arrhythmias requiring antiarrhythmic therapy &lt; 6 months prior to study entry (beta blockers or digoxin are permitted) and LVEF &lt;40% (as measured at screening by MUGA or echocardiogram).
