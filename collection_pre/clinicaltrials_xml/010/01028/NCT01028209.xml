	<criteria>The following criteria will be met for inclusion of AD subjects in this study: The participant is 50 years or older. Written informed consent is obtained. Participants have a clinical diagnosis of probable Alzheimer's disease based on National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke/Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS/ADRDA) criteria. Clinical Dementia Rating Scale score ≤ 2. Modified Hachinski Ischemia Scale score of ≤ 4. For females, nonchild bearing potential or a negative urine or blood pregnancy test on day of [18F]PBR06 injection. The following criteria will be met for inclusion of PD subjects in this study: The participant is 30 years or older. Written informed consent is obtained. Participants have a clinical diagnosis of Parkinson disease (at least two of the three cardinal symptoms: resting tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia). Hoehn and Yahr ≤4. For females, nonchild bearing potential or a negative urine or blood pregnancy test on day of [18F]PBR06 injection. The following criteria will be met for inclusion of MS subjects in this study: The participant is 18 years or older. Written informed consent is obtained. Participants have a clinical diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis (per the 2005 Revised McDonald Criteria; Polman, et al., 2005). Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) ≤ 7.5. For females, nonchild bearing potential or a negative urine or blood pregnancy test on day of [18F]PBR06 injection The following criteria will be met for inclusion of healthy control subjects in this study: The participant is 18 years or older. Written informed consent is obtained. Negative history of neurological or psychiatric illness based on evaluation by a research physician. Clinical Dementia Rating score = 0. For females, nonchild bearing potential a negative urine or blood pregnancy test on day of [18F]PBR06 injection. Alzheimer's subjects will be excluded from participation for the following reasons: The subject has a history of significant cerebrovascular disease. The subject has a clinically significant abnormal laboratory value and/or clinically significant unstable medical or psychiatric illness The subject has evidence of clinically significant gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, renal, hematological, neoplastic, endocrine, neurological, immunodeficiency, pulmonary, or other disorder or disease. Pregnancy Parkinson's subjects will be excluded from participation for the following reasons: The subject has a clinically significant abnormal laboratory value and/or clinically significant unstable medical or psychiatric illness The subject has evidence of clinically significant gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, renal, hematological, neoplastic, endocrine, neurological, immunodeficiency, pulmonary, or other disorder or disease. Pregnancy MS subjects will be excluded from participation for the following reasons: The subject has a clinically significant abnormal laboratory value and/or clinically significant unstable medical or psychiatric illness The subject has evidence of clinically significant gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, renal, hematological, neoplastic, endocrine, neurological, immunodeficiency, pulmonary, or other disorder or disease. Pregnancy Healthy control subjects will be excluded from participation for the following reasons: The subject has a clinically significant abnormal laboratory value and/or clinically significant unstable medical or psychiatric illness. The subject has evidence of clinically significant gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, renal, hematological, neoplastic, endocrine, neurological, immunodeficiency, pulmonary, or other disorder or disease.
