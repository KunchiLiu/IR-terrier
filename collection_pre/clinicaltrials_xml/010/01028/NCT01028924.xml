	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this trial is to investigate if teduglutide has an effect on cardiac repolarisation (QT, QTc interval). Secondary objectives are the investigation of possible effects on heart rate and cardiac conduction (RR and PR intervals, QRS duration), pharmacokinetics and safety and tolerability in healthy subjects, and to determine the effect of the positive control, moxifloxacin, for sensitivity analysis. The trial will consist of a screening and a treatment phase of four treatment periods. There is a washout period of at least 7 days and 4 weeks at maximum between administrations. The expected total trial duration for the individual subject will be about 7 weeks (maximum 17) weeks.</brief_summary>
