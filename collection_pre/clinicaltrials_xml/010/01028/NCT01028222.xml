	<brief_title>A Study of AMNN107 in the Treatment of Metastatic and/or Inoperable Melanoma Harboring a c-Kit Mutation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This trial began as a multi-center, randomized, Phase III, controlled trial for nilotinib vs (DTIC) dacarbazine to assess the efficacy and safety of nilotinib (400 mg bid) in patients with c-Kit mutated metastatic and/or inoperable melanoma. The study was open to patients with mucosal or acral melanoma. Due to substantial difficulties identifying and recruiting eligible patients, the trial design was altered from a randomized, two-arm, Phase III study to a single-arm, Simon two-stage Phase II study with protocol Amendment 2 (27-Jul-2011). While the original protocol required the recruitment of 120 patients, this amendment required the study to recruit only 41 patients (patients randomized to nilotinib prior to Amendment 2 were to be counted in this total, but those randomized to dacarbazine ( DTIC ) DTIC were not). Patients randomized to DTIC were allowed to cross-over to nilotinib, either immediately or at the time of progression.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Histologically confirmed mucosal or acral 2. Presence of a cKit mutation of exon 9, 11 or 13, or mutations Y822D and mutations D820Y, Y823D of exon 17, as confirmed by the central laboratory 3. Stage III unresectable or stage IV disease 4. The presence of one or more measurable lesions as detected by radiological or photographic methods and assessed according to RECIST 1.0. Lesions must have a size of at least 10mm at longest diameter (using a slice thickness of 5 mm)or double the slice thickness to be considered a target lesion. Target lesions should not be selected in previously irradiated fields unless there is clear evidence of progression 5. WHO performance status 0 2 1. CKit mutation of exons 17(except mutations D820Y, Y822D or Y823D) or any other exon not allowed by the inclusion criteria 2. Patients with cKit amplifications only and no mutation 3. Patients with any history of brain metastases 4. Patients who have had any prior treatment with TKIs 5. Patients receiving medications or herbal extracts which interfere with nilotinib metabolism which are not discontinued by the time of the baseline visit 6. Acute or chronic liver or renal disease considered unrelated to melanoma Other protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criteria may have applied.</criteria>
