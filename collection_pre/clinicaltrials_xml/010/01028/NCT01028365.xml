	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to learn a way to measure a person's fertility. After 1 year of trying, 1 out of every 7 women will not be pregnant. This is called infertility. This results in significant distress and anxiety. Infertility is common; however, the investigators have no markers to predict who will be infertile. For couples diagnosed with infertility, the investigators have used blood and urine hormone levels (follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), inhibin B, and antimullerian hormone (AMH)) to tell us who will get pregnant with fertility treatment. The investigators don't know if these hormone levels can predict if regular people trying to get pregnant will be able to get pregnant. This study will try to determine if these hormone levels can predict fertility and infertility.</brief_summary>
