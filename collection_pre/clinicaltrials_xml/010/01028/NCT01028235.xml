	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to identify the prevalence of pathologic eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) in the cohort of adult patients who present for specialty care in the gastroenterology clinics with complaint of difficulty swallowing (dysphagia). From this, the investigators will make recommendations regarding routine screening for the diagnosis in this cohort. The prevalence of EoE in patients presenting for specialty care in the gastroenterology clinics with the complaint of dysphagia is great enough that the diagnosis should be routinely screened against in this cohort.</brief_summary>
