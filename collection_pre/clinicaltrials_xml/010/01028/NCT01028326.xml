	<brief_summary>The World Health Organization has recommended that developing countries should incorporate pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) into their routine immunization schedules. The Kenya Ministry of Health anticipates introducing a new formulation of PCV, PCV10, into the routine childhood immunization schedule in 2010. In the areas of Kenya that have been designated to monitor the impact of vaccine, a catch-up campaign will be implemented to vaccinate children aged 12-59 months. PCV10 has been found to be safe and effective in infants. It is licensed for use in children up to 2 years of age, but its use as a primary series in children over age 12 months has not been evaluated. This study will assess the immunogenicity and reactogenicity of PCV10 first administered at an age of 12-59 months.</brief_summary>
