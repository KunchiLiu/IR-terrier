	<brief_summary>Helicobacter pylori colonizes approximately to 50% of the world-wide population. There is an exigency to find routes alternating to control the infection with an ample perspective but without the complications of induction of resistance to antibiotics. Supplement dietetic with Lactobacillus reuteri (L. reuteri) in humans takes to the colonization of epithelium gastric and this, combined with the observation of which L. reuteri has the capacity to inhibit the growth of H. Pylori and its union to the gastric mucosa, indicates the potential that the native human bacteria control and influence in the colonization in humans. The acid-lactic bacteria (in particular the lactobacillus) have been studied by their effects in humans infected with H. Pylori with some success to reduce the load of bacteria Studies using supplements with L. reuteri as much in infected symptomatic patients as asymptomatic with H. pylori showed a clear reduction of the load of bacteria after 4 weeks of use and this was concordant with a reduction in the symptoms associated to the infection.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Control of Helicobacter Pylori Infection by Dietary Supplementation With Lactobacillus Reuteri</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective of this study is to determine if the dietetic supplementation with a combination of the stock of L. Reuteri (L. reuteri Progastria) is effective to control the load of bacteria and the consequences of the infection in patients infected with H. pylori.</detailed_description>
