	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of physical training on work capacity and vascular function after heart transplantation, cardiac transplant recipients are randomized to 8 weeks of intense physical training or control. Vascular function is measured non-invasively. Effect on the hormones and the immune system is evaluated using blood samples.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>To investigate the effect of physical training on work capacity and vascular function after heart transplantation, cardiac transplant recipients are randomized to 8 weeks of intense physical training or control. Vascular function is measured non-invasively using forearm flow mediated dilatation. Effect on the blood natriuretic peptides and the inflammatory markers is evaluated using blood samples at baseline and after the training or control period.</detailed_description>
