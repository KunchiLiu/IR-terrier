	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether hypertonic saline is as much effective as mannitol to treat intracranial hypertension after traumatic brain injury and has at least the same effects on PtiO2 and cerebral metabolism studied through microdialysis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mannitol vs HS to Treat ICHT After Severe TBI : Comparison on PtiO2 and Microdialysis Values</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Mannitol is frequently used to treat intracranial hypertension after TBI. However, it can be deleterious, particularly through hyperdiuresis and risks of hypovolemia. It also needs volume compensation and induces logistical problem because of needs of high infused volume to achieve osmolar load and avoid hypotension. Finally, some recent studies tend to prove superiority of hypertonic saline versus mannitol on the prognosis of TBI. especially through modulation of inflammatory reactions mechanisms and apoptosis. We would like to prove non inferiority of hypertonic saline versus mannitol after TBI to allow its large utilization, especially by field military doctors with specific logistical problems. For that, more than the single Intracranial Pressure, we want to study effects of HS vs mannitol not only on PtiO2 but also on cerebral microdialysis which gives informations on focal metabolism with profiles of ischemia, metabolic crisis, hyperglycolysis (possible reflect of neuronal restoration) and normality.</detailed_description>
