	<brief_summary>Extracts of chicory root have anti-inflammatory properties in vitro and in animal models of arthritis. The primary objective of this investigator-initiated, Phase 1, placebo-controlled, double blind, dose-escalating trial is to determine the safety and tolerability of a proprietary bioactive extract of chicory root in patients with osteoarthritis (OA). Secondary objectives are to assess effects on the signs and symptoms of this disorder. Individuals greater than 50 years of age with OA of the hip or knee will be eligible for trial entry.</brief_summary>
