	<brief_summary>The benefits of laparoscopic ("minimally invasive" or "keyhole") surgery for gallbladder removal (cholecystectomy) over open surgical procedures in terms of significant reductions in pain, scarring and recovery time are well accepted. In a conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy however, the excised gallbladder still has to be extracted through the abdominal wall skin via a laparoscopic port site using an incision of 10mm or greater. Despite being much smaller than that required for open surgery, this incision is painful, leaves a scar and can result in a port site hernia to follow requiring further surgery to repair it. Recent attempts to further reduce the invasiveness of the surgical procedure have suggested performing the operation via an endoscope passed through the mouth and through an incision in the stomach wall - so called Natural Orifice Translumenal Endoscopic Surgery (NOTES). Unlike a skin incision, an incision in the wall of the stomach (gastrotomy) should give no pain, visible scar or herniation risk yet still allow access to the peritoneal cavity for surgical procedures such as cholecystectomy. Against this, it has the potential risks of contamination and leakage of gastric contents into the peritoneal cavity. Whilst the limitations of present technology make it very difficult to perform an entire cholecystectomy through the stomach wall in patients, endoscopic methods for closing a gastrotomy are available that are approved for use in patients (CE marked) and it is hypothesised that removing the excised gallbladder through the stomach in this way would avoid the problems of extracting it through the abdominal wall described above. Data are required to determine whether the extraction of the gallbladder via a gastrotomy rather than through the skin is safe, producing smaller scars and a better cosmetic result. A secondary endpoint would be to assess possible reductions in pain and recovery from this less invasive approach.</brief_summary>
