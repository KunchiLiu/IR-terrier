	<criteria>1. Subject meets Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fourth Edition; Text Revision (DSM IV TR) criteria for a primary diagnosis of ADHD (diagnostic code 314.00 and 314.01) established by a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation that reviews DSMIVTR criteria with at least 6 of the 9 subtype criteria met. 2. Subject has been previously treated for ADHD with an adequate course of amphetamine therapy with no history of intolerance, or lack of efficacy, as determined by the Investigator. 3. Subject does not have any physical disability (eg. colorblindness, limitations with use of one or both hands, etc) that would interfere with the subject's participation in or performance on any of the neuropsychometric tests. For a number of these tasks speed is a key factor thus subjects cannot have any obvious impediments/impairments in the use of their hands.</criteria>
