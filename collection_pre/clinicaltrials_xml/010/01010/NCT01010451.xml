	<brief_summary>There is a lack of evidence of the long-term successful outcomes of antimicrobial endodontic treatment for primary teeth. This study intended to evaluate (by survival analysis) the effectiveness of an antimicrobial pulpotomy (chloramphenicol, tetracycline, zinc oxide/eugenol) in primary molars compared to calcium hydroxide pulpectomy, testing the hypothesis that antimicrobial pulpotomy could be an alternative pulp therapy for primary teeth with pulp inflammation or necrosis.</brief_summary>
