	<brief_summary>Treatment for childhood cancer interferes with normal bone maturation such that maximal peak bone mass may never be attained by some survivors of childhood cancer. In childhood cancer survivors, a randomized trial evaluating the effectiveness of vitamin D and calcium supplementation among ALL survivors is currently underway; however, few other interventions have been offered for this at risk population. Recent evidence demonstrates that low magnitude; high frequency mechanical stimulation can improve bone quantity and quality, perhaps providing an alternative or adjunct to pharmacologic intervention in populations where additional medications are either contraindicated or not acceptable to the individuals at risk. This application proposes a prospective double blind randomized clinical trial of low magnitude, high frequency mechanical (LMHF) stimulation for childhood cancer survivors whose bone mineral density is one or more standard deviations below the mean for their age and gender.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vibration Intervention For Bone Enhancement In Childhood Cancer Survivors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a two arm parallel allocation of participants to either the intervention or control group will be utilized for a one year trial. Participants will be randomly assigned to stand on a low magnitude, high frequency mechanical stimulation device ("vibrating") platform for 10 minutes twice daily for one year. Participants in the control arm will stand on a placebo device. This study will evaluate the effects of low magnitude, high frequency stimulus on bone mineral content(BMC), bone mineral density (BMD), and bone strength in childhood cancer survivors who present with BMD values 1.0 or more standard deviations below the mean for their age and gender for the lumbar or whole body. This study will evaluate the effects of low magnitude, high frequency stimulus on markers of bone turnover in childhood cancer survivors who present with BMD values 1.0 or more standard deviations below the mean for their age and gender for the lumbar or whole body. At baseline participants will have evaluations to determine bone mineral content and bone mineral density (Dual X-ray Absorptiometry and Qualitative Computed Tomography) and a blood sample collected to measure biomarkers of bone turnover, hormonal status and Vitamin D metabolism. Anthropometrics and tanner stage will be obtained at baseline, 3 months, 6 months, 9 and 12 months. A physical activity monitor will be worn for a 7 day period and a food frequency questionnaire will be completed. Tibial length will be measured. Participants have a blood sample collected either at home or at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital (SJCRH) every 3 months during the study to measure biomarkers of bone turnover, hormonal status and Vitamin D metabolism, anthropometrics and tanner stage, physical activity monitor and food frequency questionnaire. All measurements and evaluations required at baseline will be repeated at the completion of study visit.</detailed_description>
