	<brief_summary>This open-label, single-arm, non-randomized study will evaluate the adherence and persistence to tocilizumab therapy in patients with moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis, who have an inadequate clinical response to non-biologic DMARDs. Patients will receive tocilizumab 8 mg/kg as intravenous infusion once every 4 weeks in combination with methotrexate or in case of intolerance to methotrexate as monotherapy. The anticipated time of study treatment is 6 months. The target sample size is 20-50 patients.</brief_summary>
