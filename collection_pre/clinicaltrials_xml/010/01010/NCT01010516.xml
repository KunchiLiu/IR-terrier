	<brief_summary>Statin therapy does not fully eliminate the cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk associated with low high density lipoprotein-C (HDL-C) and high triglyceride levels. It is currently unknown what would be the best treatment option for patients with mixed hyperlipidemia who fail to meet their lipid targets with statin monotherapy at conventional does, i.e. high dose rosuvastatin or conventional statin dose plus micronized fenofibrate or conventional statin dose plus niacin/laropiprant. The aim of the present study is to compare the efficacy of high-dose rosuvastatin vs conventional statin dose plus micronized fenofibrate vs conventional statin dose plus extended-release niacin/laropiprant on lipid profile in patients with mixed hyperlipidemia. The primary efficacy endpoint will be changes in non-HDL-C levels at 6 months after treatment initiation.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>NonHDLC above target goal according to NCEPATP III after 3 months of treatment with conventional statin doses, e.g. simvastatin 1040 mg, atorvastatin 1040 mg or rosuvastatin 520 mg Known CVD, triglycerides &gt; 500 mg/dL, renal disease (serum creatinine levels &gt; 1.6 mg/dL), hypothyroidism [thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) &gt; 5 IU/mL], liver disease (ALT and/or AST levels &gt; 3fold upper limit of normal in more than 2 consecutive measurements), alcohol consumption &gt; 3 drinks/day for men and &gt; 2 drinks/day for women, and current or previous gout. Patients with diabetes will be included in the study if they are adequately controlled (HbA1c &lt;7%) with one or 2 antidiabetic drugs (no change in their treatment will be made during the study period). Patients with hypertension will be included in the study if they are on stable medication for at least 3 months and their blood pressure is adequately controlled (no change in their treatment will be made during the study period). Patients currently taking lipidlowering drugs (other than statins at a conventional dose) or having stopped them less than 4 weeks before study entry will be excluded.</criteria>
