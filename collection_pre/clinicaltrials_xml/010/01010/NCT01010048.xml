	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the stone clearance rate treated with different drugs after ESWL in urinary calculus,These drugs are often used in urinary calculus,such as progesterone,tamsulosin,propantheline Bromide and nifedipine.In these study the investigators want to investigate different effect of these drugs use to treat urinary calculus after ESWL.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Compare the Therapeutic Effect Treated With Tamsulosin and Progesterone After ESWL( Extra Corporeal Shock Wave Lithotripsy) in Urinary Calculus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There is 4 groups in these investigation, group1 urinary calculus treated with ESWL only ,group2 urinary calculus treated with ESWL and tamsulosin,group3 urinary calculus treated with ESWL and progesterone,group4 urinary calculus treated with ESWL ,propantheline Bromide and nifedipine.We want to investigate which one is better or not in urinary calculus treated with ESWL .</detailed_description>
