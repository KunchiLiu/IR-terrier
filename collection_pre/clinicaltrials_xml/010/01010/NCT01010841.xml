	<brief_summary>The objective of this study was to investigate from 3 sites (University of Connecticut, University of Florida, and University of California, Irvine) whether enhancement of a modified Mediterranean-style, low glycemic load diet (MED) with specific phytochemicals (soy protein, phytosterols, rho iso-alpha acids and proanthocyanidins; PED) could improve cardiometabolic risk factors in women with metabolic syndrome.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial of Two Dietary Programs on Cardiometabolic Risk Factors in Subjects With Metabolic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>As the worldwide dietary pattern becomes more westernized, the metabolic syndrome is reaching epidemic proportions. Lifestyle modifications including diet and exercise are recommended as first-line intervention for treating metabolic syndrome. Previously, we reported that specific phytochemical supplementation for 12 weeks (soy protein, phytosterols, rho iso-alpha acids and proanthocyanidins) increased the effectiveness of the modified Mediterranean-style low glycemic load dietary program on variables associated with metabolic syndrome and CVD in subjects with metabolic syndrome and elevated LDL cholesterol. In this study, we propose to conduct a multi-center randomized trial to confirm our previous findings.</detailed_description>
