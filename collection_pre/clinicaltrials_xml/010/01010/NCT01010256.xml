	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the level of a specific protein (PTEN) in the cancer cells of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) patients. This protein might be involved in the transformation from normal blood cells to leukemia cells. The PTEN protein has not been investigated in CMML specifically but it has been discovered in closely related cancers. If this study demonstrates an abnormality in this protein, future testing will be designed to evaluate the genetic abnormality that resulted in lack of the normal presence of this protein. The goal is that the results of this study will help to develop new drugs and strategies to treat the future patients with CMML by understanding the abnormality of the disease at the cellular and molecular levels. The results of this study can also be utilized by future studies to develop individualized treatment to patients who have abnormal levels of this protein.</brief_summary>
