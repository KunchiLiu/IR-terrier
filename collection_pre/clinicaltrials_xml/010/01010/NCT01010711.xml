	<brief_summary>Migraine in children and adolescents can be associated with low serum levels of coenzyme q10, the key-enzyme of mitochondrial energy production.During migraine attacks inflammation is an important issue. Based on a double-blind placebo-controlled trial with coenzyme q10 in adults it is hypothesized that daily supplementation of coenzyme q10 as well as different antioxidative phytochemicals (from berries) and specific minerals and vitamins are able to reduce the "days with migraine" as primary parameter (open clinical trial).</brief_summary>
