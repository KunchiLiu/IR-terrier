	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to explore the efficacy and safety of Nadolol in hemangiomas of infancy. The secondary objective is to assess the feasibility of conducting a randomized controlled trial comparing nadolol with corticosteroids and propranolol.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nadolol for Proliferating Infantile Hemangiomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Systemic corticosteroids are currently the most frequent used medication for treatment of problematic infantile hemangiomas (IH's). Since June 2008, systemic propranolol has been an important addition to the therapeutic options for problematic IH, allowing decreased dependence on the systemic corticosteroids. So far, we have found excellent response with propranolol with minimal short-term side effects. Studies, which compared nadolol and propranolol in children with other conditions, suggest that nadolol is safer and more efficacious than propranolol. In addition, it has better dosing schedules and less central nervous system (CNS) penetration, making it suitable even for patients with suspected or proven PHACES syndrome.</detailed_description>
