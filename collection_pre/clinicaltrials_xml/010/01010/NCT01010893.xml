	<brief_title>Tolerability and Immunogenicity of Fluval P Monovalent Influenza Vaccine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objective: To assess tolerability/safety (incidence of adverse events) of the study drug. To assess the efficacy (immunogenicity) of the study drug by serology testing of blood samples taken at Day 21‑28 after immunization in groups and age groups. Secondary Objectives: To assess the long-term safety of the study drug 50-60 days after immunization. To determine the tolerability of simultaneous administration of FLUVAL P monovalent pandemic influenza vaccine and FLUVAL AB trivalent seasonal influenza vaccine in case of adults and elderly people. To assess the efficacy of the study drug by optional epidemiological follow-up of the participants until the end of the influenza season. To assess the immunogenicity of the study drug by optional cross-reactive immunity tests performed with non-homologous influenza A and B virus strains.</detailed_description>

Subjects will not be excluded with known adequately treated clinically significant organ or systemic diseases (e.g. asthma or diabetes), such that, in the opinion of the investigator, the significance of the disease will not compromise the subject's participation in the study; Femal volunteers of childbearing potential with a negative result from the urine pregnancy test prior to vaccination who agrees to use an acceptable contraception method or abstinence throughout the trial and not become pregnant for the duration of the study. Capable of understanding and complying with study protocol requirements; The volunteers provide written informed consent prior to initiation of study procedures; Absence of existence of any exclusion criteria.
