	<brief_summary>Research shows that resveratrol is able to induce vasodilation (and therefore blood flow) by interacting with nitric oxide (NO). Research also shows that acute administration of metabolic substrates, like oxygen and glucose, can enhance aspects of cognitive performance in young, healthy humans. The aim of this investigation was to determine if the consumption of resveratrol could modulate cerebral blood flow and if this in turn could influence cognitive performance by increasing access to blood borne metabolic fuel. Results showed that compared to placebo, after consuming 500mg pure trans-resveratrol, levels of total haemoglobin were significantly higher in the frontal cortex of young, healthy participants during cognitive task completion. Cognitive performance was not effected.</brief_summary>
