	<brief_summary>To determine the differences in intra-operative complications, surgical duration, fluid usage, corneal thickness and endothelium cell density in eyes undergoing microcoaxial phacoemulsification (MCP) either with Torsional or longitudinal ultrasound during the surgery and at post-operative day 1, 1 month and 3 months.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Outcomes of Phacoemulsification With Torsional Ultrasound</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduced in mid 2006, torsional ultrasound (OZil, Infiniti Vision System, Alcon Laboratories, Texas, USA) uses rotational oscillations at ultrasonic frequencies to emulsify cataractous lens material in a seamless cutting motion from a tip that oscillates laterally. The side-to-side movement of the phaco tip produces minimal repulsion of lens material from the phaco tip resulting in improved followability. Clinically this translates into more effective lens removal with torsional phaco in comparison to the conventional ultrasound mode.to test this in a clinical scenario we undertook this study.</detailed_description>
