	<brief_summary>Septic arthritis is a frequent, potentially disabling and/or life-threatening disease. To diagnose a septic arthritis is a complex procedure, first because of numerous differential diagnoses (such as crystal arthritis), second because of poor sensitivity of initial gram staining (for example after untimely antibiotic therapy). This protocol will use SELDI-TOF as a tool to analyse joint fluid of patients with various acute, polymorphonuclear-rich arthritis, as to determine specific and sensitive new biomarkers of a septic origin. Such biomarkers will allow rapid diagnosis of septic arthritis in the first hours of admission.</brief_summary>
