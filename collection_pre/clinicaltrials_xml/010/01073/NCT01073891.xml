	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to describe the pharmacokinetics of a new oral liquid moxifloxacin formulation and the influence of concommitant food intake on the pharmacokinetics in healthy adults compared to the marketed oral tablet. Pharmacokinetics is to see how the body absorbs, distributes and gets rid of the study drug. The absorption of the drug administered in a different dosage form may be altered due to the influence of different excipients used. The safety of moxifloxacin when administered as an oral liquid formulation will also be looked at. Results from this study will be used to guide dosing strategies of the larger clinical trial planned for children.</brief_summary>
