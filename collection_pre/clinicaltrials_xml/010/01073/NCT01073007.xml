	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether simvastatin treatment started within the first 12 hours from stroke onset improves neurological and functional outcomes, evaluated at seventh day/discharge or at the third month. Also, to demonstrate that simvastatin is safe and not associated with higher rates of hemorrhagic transformation in patients who receive thrombolysis.</brief_summary>
