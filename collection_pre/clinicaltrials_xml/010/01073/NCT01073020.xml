	<brief_summary>There is substantial clinical evidence regarding the safety and efficacy of currently practiced bariatric surgical techniques to improve metabolic control and/or resolve type 2 diabetes (T2DM) in clinically severe obese patients (class 3 obesity). Evidence suggests such procedures have greater effects on insulin secretion and insulin action than that expected from weight loss alone, which has led to the recent claim that such procedures may be useful as a primary treatment for T2DM in the moderately obese population. Concurrently, there have also been substantial advances in the non-surgical medical management of T2DM. As a result, the best treatment algorithm for T2DM patients with class 1 &amp; 2 obesity is increasingly controversial. This trial investigates the utility of currently practiced and available bariatric surgical procedures as compared with multidisciplinary intensive medical and weight management for the treatment of T2DM with class 1 and 2 obesity.</brief_summary>

Detectable levels of GAD antibody or a history of diabetic ketoacidosis or uncontrolled T2DM (consistent fasting blood glucose &gt;200 mg/dl or HbA1c above twice normal); Previous gastrointestinal surgery, inflammatory bowel disease, esophageal diseases including severe intractable esophagitis, Barrett's Disease, esophageal dysmotility or other impaired gastric motility (gastroparesis), or hiatal hernia &gt;3 cm in size, chronic or acute bleeding conditions including peptic ulcer disease, portal hypertension (gastric or esophageal varices), chronic pancreatitis, or cirrhosis of the liver; Malignant or debilitating medical conditions, severe cardiopulmonary disease including uncontrolled hypertension (repeated systolic measures &gt;160 or diastolic &gt; 95 mm Hg on more than one day), unstable angina pectoris, recent myocardial infarction within 6 months, history of coronary artery bypass surgery or angioplasty, congestive heart failure, arrhythmia, stroke or transient ischemic attacks, urinary albumin excretion &gt;300 mcg/mg creatinine and/or serum creatinine &gt;1.5 mg/dL (permitting safety of increased dietary protein intake), Any endocrine disorder other than T2DM or thyroid disease which is stable on replacement therapy, including Cushing's syndrome; Any previous history of eating disorders, history of drug and/or alcohol abuse within 2 years of the screening visit, history of impaired mental status by DSMIV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, 4th Edition) criteria and including, but not limited to active substance abuse, a history of schizophrenia, borderline personality disorder, uncontrolled depression, suicidal attempts within the past two years or current suicidal tendencies or ideations. Subjects will be excluded if there is a history of significant weight loss (&gt;3%) within the previous 3 months or participation in alternate medically supervised exercise or weight reduction program within the previous 3 months, or with use of prescription or over the counter weight reduction medications or supplements within one month of the Screening Visit and for the duration of study participation. Women who are lactating, planning pregnancy, or unwilling to use contraception during the course of the trial.</criteria>
