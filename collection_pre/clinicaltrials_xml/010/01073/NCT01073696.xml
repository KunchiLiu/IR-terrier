	<criteria>Healthy male or female subjects aged ≥ 18 and ≤ 45 years at screening. Subjects must demonstrate understanding of the purposes and risks of the study and agree to follow the restrictions and schedule of study procedures, as evidenced by voluntary written informed consent (signed and dated) obtained before taking part in any trialrelated activities. Any current or previous disease, disorder, allergy or condition (including recent unexplained weight loss) that could affect the study conduct or laboratory assessments, or that presents undue risk from the study medication or procedures. Hypersensitivity to adhesive plasters or surgical tape. Any physical examination or screening investigation result that indicates the subject is unfit for the study. Scarring on upper arms, including extensive tattoos making skin reactions unevaluable. A positive virology test, urine test for drugs of abuse, or pregnancy test result (females of childbearing potential only). Recent use of prescribed or overthecounter medication that, in the opinion of the Investigator or the Sponsor, will interfere with the study procedures or compromise safety. Received an investigational drug within 3 months (90 days) preceding patch application. Loss of ≥ 400 mL of blood (e.g. been a blood donor) within the past 3 months. Average weekly alcohol consumption of greater than 21 units (males) or 14 units (females), or habitually smokes ≥ 5 cigarettes or equivalent tobacco per day within the 6 months before patch application. Subjects may not smoke while confined to the study site. Subjects must not consume alcohol, or xanthinecontaining foods or drinks within 48 hours prior to dosing until discharge. Lactating female subjects, and female subjects of childbearing potential who are not willing to use an acceptable form of contraception from the screening visit, during the study and for 90 days after the study.
