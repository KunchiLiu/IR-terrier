	<brief_summary>Training Executive, Attention and Motor Skills (TEAMS) is a new research program for preschool children with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) that attempts to use game-like activities and physical exercise to promote the growth of neural processes that underlie the core features of the disorder (e.g., hyperactivity, impulsivity) as well as associated areas of difficulty (e.g., socialization, motor skills). These activities are implemented at home and in supervised playgroups at no cost to families and are coupled with extensive parental education about ADHD symptoms and associated impairments.</brief_summary>
