	<brief_summary>Lung isolation is used to achieve one lung ventilation to facilitate thoracic surgery. Two methods are commonly used, a double lumen tube (DLT) or a bronchial blocker introduced through a single lumen tube. However, both techniques have advantages and disadvantages. Briefly, the DLT can be positioned faster and remains firmly in place, but is sometimes difficult or even impossible to introduce. The DLT is larger than a conventional single lumen tube and the incidence of postoperative hoarseness and airway injuries is higher. Compared to the DLT, bronchial blocking devices are more difficult to position and need more frequent intraoperative repositioning. These disadvantages of the existing devices for lung isolation prompted further development of the bronchial blocker concept. The design of a new Y shaped bronchial blocker, the EZ- Blocker® (AnaesthetIQ BV, Rotterdam, The Netherlands) (EZB), combines the advantages of both lung isolation techniques. The aim of the study is to compare in a randomised, prospective way the ease of placement, the incidence of malpositioning and the quality of lung deflation of a left DLT and a EZB. Secondly, the incidence and severity of damage to laryngeal, tracheal and bronchial structures caused by the use of the DLT or the EZB is a target of the study.</brief_summary>
