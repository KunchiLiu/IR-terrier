	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this trial is to determine whether two doses of an extract from bran demonstrate a prebiotic effect on colonic bacteria (by modulating selected fecal microbial populations, particularly bifidobacteria). The secondary objective is to measure the potential beneficial effects of consuming an extract from bran on the following physiological parameters: laxation, fecal pH, fecal moisture and stool consistency, blood glucose and insulin concentrations, plasma lipid profiles and serum free fatty acids, colonic bacterial short chain fatty acid production, ammonia metabolism and protein degradation, and biomarkers of oxidative stress and inflammation.</brief_summary>
