	<brief_summary>To investigate bile culture and susceptibility test in patients with malignant biliary obstruction (MBO) or relation between bile, portal vein or vein culture and biliary infection. Also to get the information of bile metabonomics to find potential tumor marker .Culture of the organism is recognized as the "gold standard" for diagnosis of infection. Our research may be one of the first research on culture and susceptibility test in patients with MBO. The results of the trial research will be benefit to experiential therapy of MBO with biliary infection and diagnosis of MBO.</brief_summary>
