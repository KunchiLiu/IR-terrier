	<brief_summary>This is a multicentric prospective randomized study comparing technique of tension-free repair with placement of a bovine pericardium bioprosthesis (Tutopatch® and Tutomesh®) to current conventional surgical techniques in potentially contaminated hernia repair and abdominal wall reconstruction. The hypothesis is that using Tutomesh® prostheses reduces the risk of postoperative complications at 30 days in the treatment of incisional hernias or complicated abdominal wall hernias (ref early complications) for potentially contaminated fields.</brief_summary>
