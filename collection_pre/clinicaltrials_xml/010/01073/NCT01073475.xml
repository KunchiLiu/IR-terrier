	<detailed_description>The purpose of the Global Network for Women's and Children's Health Research is to develop and test feasible, sustainable interventions to improve the outcome of women and children and to develop research capacity in resource-poor settings. Because most of the sites have weak health care systems, unacceptably high rates of maternal and neonatal mortality and lack birth and death registries, they lack precise data on outcomes and measures of care. Information from a vital registry system will allow the Global Network to document maternal and neonatal mortality, design trials to address the major causes of poor outcome, assess the outcome of our interventions, and ultimately disseminate the results as the basis of public health policy.</detailed_description>
