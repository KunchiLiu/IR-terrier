	<brief_title>Noninvasive Blood Glucose Monitoring Using Otoacoustic Emissions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participation in the study will involve listening to sounds through earphones while blood glucose levels are measured by taking blood samples using a lancet. During the study, blood glucose levels will be increased by drinking a beverage containing sugar. Up to five visits to the NCRAR will be needed over a six-month period to complete the study. Each visit lasts either two or four hours, and will be scheduled at your convenience. You will be paid $20 for the first 2-hour screening visit and $50 for each 4-hour visit. You will be paid $30 if you are selected to participate in a 2-hour Attention Correlation Test that a sub-set of 10 participants will complete.</detailed_description>
