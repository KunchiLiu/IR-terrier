	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare coronary endothelium function in patients with a zotarolimus-eluting versus a sirolimus-eluting or a everolimus-eluting stents with optical coherence tomography, vasoconstriction in response to acetylcholine, and coronary biomarker level.</brief_summary>
