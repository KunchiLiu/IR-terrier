	<brief_summary>Workers in the various branches of the investigators industrial society can be considered as a group susceptible to risks due to the nature of its activities related to the intense demands of their work units with varying degrees of physical overload. Among the risk factors involved in postural genesis of occupational low back pain is work in uncomfortable positions, such as maintenance of static postures for long periods of time and frequent implementation of flexion, extension and trunk rotation.The association between body instability (lack of postural balance) and back pain is seen with some frequency, especially in working groups.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Rehabilitation of Dynamic Muscle, Back Pain and Postural Balance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of rehabilitation of the dynamic muscle (RDM®) in back pain and postural balance of industrial operators. The sample consisted of industrial operators, individuals with low back pain, referred to the industry of Physical Therapy. After the screening criteria of inclusion and exclusion, 82 individuals were randomly selected and divided at random in: experimental group (GE, n = 41, age = 41 ± 4 years, body mass index (IMC) = 26.46 ± 3 , 25) and control group (CG, n = 42, age = 42 ± 5 years, IMC = 26.47 ± 3.34). The GE was part of treatment with RDM. The CG was composed of individuals who did not participate in any physical therapy treatment during the search. The procedures used for evaluation were: back pain (Borg scale) and postural balance (pedana stabilometric and posturométrica). The process of intervention by the RDM had a duration of 20 minutes, frequency of twice a week and was extended for 12 weeks, and the systematic treatment performed on 4 occasions.</detailed_description>
