	<brief_title>Phase II Study Of Oral PHA-848125AC In Patients With Thymic Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Simon's optimal 2 stage design is adopted for this single-arm, open-label, multicentre phase II clinical trial of PHA-848125AC administered to patients with recurrent or metastatic, unresectable thymic carcinoma previously treated with chemotherapy (only one prior systemic therapy allowed). The intent of the study is to assess the antitumor activity of PHA-848125AC and ultimately to improve the outcome of patients with thymic carcinoma who have already exploited one chemotherapy option. The primary end point for this study is a progression free survival rate of 3 months.</detailed_description>
