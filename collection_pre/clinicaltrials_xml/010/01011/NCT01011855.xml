	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare three radiant warmer beds that contain different computer heating software and different bed styles. Radiant warmers are used in many neonatal intensive care units (NICU) to provide heat to infants to help regulate an infant's temperature. It is common for babies to require care on an open bed that provides heat to the baby according to the baby's needs and at the same time allows easy access to the baby for care and necessary procedures. There are different styles of beds, each with unique computer software that can guide how a bed's heater output is automatically adjusted according to a baby's temperature needs. It is unknown which style of bed or method of heating might be best. This study seeks to evaluate infant responses to three different types of radiant warmer beds.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Any baby &gt; 32 weeks gestation and &gt; 1500 grams that requires initial care on a radiant warmer during confinement in the neonatal intensive care unit. Any baby who has a skin condition that may prevent or compromise thermistor placement and interfere with accurate temperature readings from thermistors or IR camera. Any baby who is deemed too sick to tolerate movement from one radiant warmer to another by the attending physician. Any baby who has a medical condition or anomaly that contraindicates axillary or abdominal temperature measurements</criteria>
