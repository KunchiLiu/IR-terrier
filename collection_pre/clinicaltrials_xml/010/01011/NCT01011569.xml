	<brief_summary>There are largely 2 surgical methods for one-level cervical disc disease; cage only and plate/graft. Even there are many reports about the efficacy of either cage only or plate/graft, prospective comparative study is few. The object of the present study is to present design of prospective study and to demonstrate preliminary result.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Cage Versus Plate in One Level Cervical Disc Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prospective study was started from April 2004 after permission by our Institutional Review Board. Inclusion criteria were single cervical disc disease with radiculopathy/myelopathy. We excluded patients with severe spondylosis, multiple disc disease, overt instability, osteoporosis or previous cervical operation history. Operation method was randomized using the table of random sampling numbers. All operations were performed with standard anterior-medial approach. Two types of cages and 2 types of plates were used: cage, MC+ cage (LDR, Austin, Tx, USA) or Solis cage (Stryker, Kalamazoo, Michigan, USA); plate, Black stone (Orthofix, McKinney, Tx, USA) or Atlantis (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA). We checked neck disability index (NDI), neck visual analogue scale (VAS) and limb VAS before operation and 1/3/6/12/24/36 months after operation. Disc height ratio, cervical lordosis, bone fusion status and segmental lordosis at the index level were measured from X-rays and follow-up X-rays were obtained at before operation and 1/3/6/12/24/36 months after operation. The present prospective study was planned until 80 patients (cage n = 40, plate/graft n = 40) were enrolled.</detailed_description>
