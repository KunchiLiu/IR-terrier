	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of three drugs (cyproterone acetate, medroxyprogesterone acetate and venlafaxine) in the treatment of hot flushes caused by leuprorelin LP 11.25 milligram (mg) in participants suffering from prostate cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment of Hot Flushes Caused by Leuprorelin 11.25 mg in Prostate Adenocarcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Three drugs will be tested in this study: cyproterone acetate, medroxyprogesterone acetate and venlafaxine. Cyproterone acetate, medroxyprogesterone acetate and venlafaxine are being tested to treat men who suffer from hot flushes due to androgen suppression treatment for prostate cancer. This study will look at the frequency and severity of hot flushes caused by leuprorelin in participants who will take cyproterone acetate, medroxyprogesterone acetate or venlafaxine. The study will randomize approximately 311 participants. All participants will receive 2 injections of leuprorelin 11.35 mg at Months 0 and 3 along with flutamide tablets in the first month of treatment to prevent flare-up. After 6 months, eligible participants will receive third injection of leuprorelin and will be randomly assigned to one of the three treatment groups—which will remain undisclosed to the participant and study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent medical need): - Cyproterone acetate (Androcur® 50 mg) - Medroxyprogesterone acetate (Gestoral® 10 mg) - Venlafaxine (Effexor® LP 37.5 mg) All participants will be asked to take 2 capsules in the morning and 1 capsule in the evening for 10 weeks. All participants will be asked to complete the self-evaluation hot-flushes (HF) questionnaire daily for 12 weeks from the start of treatment for hot flushes. This multi-center trial will be conducted in France. The overall time to participate in this study is approximately 9 months. Participants will make 5 visits to the clinic during the study.</detailed_description>

Patient has symptomatic bone metastases. Patient already treated with hormonotherapy for his prostate cancer or has received a hormonal treatment other than a GnRH agonist for this cancer (apart from palliative care of flareup with antiandrogens).
