	<brief_summary>A novel technique in identifying unspecified sleep apnea has been developed. This technique uses signals typical acquired from a bedside monitor that is found in critical care environments. Those signals are then processed by a sleep analysis algorithm to provide an Apnoea Hypopnea Index (AHI) score. This study is intended to determine whether the prevalence of sleep disordered breathing identification among patients in a Coronary Care Unit (CCU) using this novel approach is significantly different than using routine techniques.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study will focus on inpatients diagnosed with coronary conditions. Specific eligibility criteria will include: - Unstable angina - Acute myocardial infarction - Congestive heart failure Subjects enrolled in the study will be scored for sleep apnea using a novel approach designed by the sponsor. That score will not be used in the course of treatment. A follow-up call will determine whether the subject was identified for sleep disordered breathing during the hospital stay. A comparison will be done on the number of those identified with and without the use of the sleep scoring device.</detailed_description>
