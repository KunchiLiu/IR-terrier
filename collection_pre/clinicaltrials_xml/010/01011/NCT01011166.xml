	<brief_summary>This study will assess short term safety, antiviral activity and pharmacokinetics (PK) of IDX184 in combination with Peg-interferon (Peg-IFN)/Ribavirin (RBV) in participants with hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype (GT) 1 infection. These data will guide dose selection for future, longer term studies.</brief_summary>
