	<brief_summary>The investigators will test the hypothesis that aspirin or clopidogrel taken twice daily will augment their antiplatelet efficacy in patients with an elevated platelet turnover (as measured by the proportion of reticulated (young) platelets) compared with once daily dosing.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Studying the Efficacy of Aspirin &amp; Clopidogrel in Healthy Subjects With Stable Coronary Artery Disease.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1. To study whether in healthy subjects with an increased platelet turnover, a twice daily dosing of aspirin 81 mg will be more effective in inhibiting platelets compared with once a day aspirin 81 mg. 2. To study whether in patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD) with an increased platelet turnover, a twice daily dosing of aspirin 81 mg will be more effective in inhibiting platelets compared with once a day aspirin 81 mg. 3. To study whether in healthy subjects with an increased platelet turnover, a twice daily dosing of aspirin 81 mg and clopidogrel 75 mg will be more effective in inhibiting platelets compared with once daily of both aspirin and clopidogrel. 4. To study whether in patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD), increased platelet turnover and aspirin resistance, an oral fatty acid (docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentanoic acid (EPA), 4 gm/day) supplementation will increase the efficacy of aspirin by modifying platelet function compared to once a day aspirin 81 mg.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Group A: Healthy subjects aged 1864 years with no evidence of coronary artery disease or any major risk factors for CAD including smoking, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, hypertension and obesity. Group B: Patients with known CAD aged 1864 years taking aspirin 81 mg daily as the only antiplatelet therapy. Patients should be in stable condition and at least one month post myocardial infarction. Group C: Patients with known stable CAD aged 1864 years taking aspirin 81 mg and clopidogrel 75 mg daily. Patients should be in stable condition and at least one month post myocardial infarction. Subjects will be excluded if they used NSAID's within one week prior to the study, have renal insufficiency, inflammatory disorders such as rheumatologic conditions, autoimmune disorders, active infections, malignancy or if they are undergoing chemotherapy. Other exclusion criteria include contraindications to aspirin including active bleeding, hypersensitivity, thrombocytopenia (platelet count &lt; 50,000) and anemia (hemoglobin &lt; 10.0 gm/dl). We will also exclude patients with unstable angina and recent (less than a month) CABG or PCTA.</criteria>
