A random sample of patients having at least one prescription for an INS other than Flixonase Patientlevel exclusion Patients with less than 180 days of continuous eligibility before index date Patients who are under four years of age at index date Patients who are older than 85 years of age at index date Episodelevel exclusion When patient history was divided into Flixonase or other INS use episodes, patients with less than 120 days of eligibility after the last prescription in the episode Patients with an event of interest 180 days prior to patients' entry into the cohort or anytime prior to an episode index date were automatically excluded from the analysis of that event.
