	<brief_summary>This 2 arm study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of Avastin + gemcitabine, and Avastin + gemcitabine + attenuated doses of cisplatin, as first line treatment in elderly patients with non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer. Patients will be randomised to receive either Avastin 7.5mg/kg iv on day 1 + gemcitabine 1200mg/m2 on days 1-8 of each 3 week cycle, or Avastin 7.5mg/kg iv on day 1 + cisplatin 60mg/m2 on day 1 + gemcitabine 1000mg/m2 on days 1-8 of each 3 week cycle. After 6 cycles of combination therapy, all patients will continue to receive Avastin monotherapy. The anticipated time on study treatment is until disease progression, and the target sample size is &lt;100 individuals.</brief_summary>
