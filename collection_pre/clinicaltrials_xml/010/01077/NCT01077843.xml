	<brief_summary>This is a descriptive study of a cohort of patients with ankylosing spondylitis and use of etoricoxib in this population. It also includes a nested case-control analysis (when greater than or equal to 700 events of a given type are available for analysis) that will estimate the odds of current exposure to etoricoxib, and to various other anti-inflammatory treatments, compared with non-exposure to any such treatments, for the clinical outcomes of interest in European patients with Ankylosing Spondylitis. The study population and follow-up time will be refreshed / added to annually, and the analysis re-run annually on a cumulative basis until 2017.</brief_summary>
