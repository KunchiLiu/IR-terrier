	<brief_summary>Although discography and spinal imaging techniques, either alone or in combination, are commonly used to diagnose discogenic pain, their exact role in predicting surgical results are poorly defined. Our aim in this study is to compare the ability of Functional anesthetic discography (FAD), and Provocative Discography (PD) to diagnose discogenic pain and to correctly identify the disc levels for the surgical treatment. Proper identification for disc levels should improve the overall results of surgery for this condition. Patients with discogenic pain have better outcomes if the disc levels for the fusion surgery are identified by using FAD compared to similar disc level identification by PD.</brief_summary>
