	<brief_summary>Susceptibility testing is commonly employed in patients with bacterial infections in order to guide rational use of antibiotics; however, the use of antifungal susceptibility testing is limited due to lack of availability, costs, and delays in receiving results. The goals of antifungal susceptibility testing should mirror those of antibacterial susceptibility testing: to predict clinical response or failure. Additionally, susceptibility reports should be used as a guide for physicians when transitioning patients from parenteral to oral antifungal agents. Currently, it is unknown whether antifungal susceptibility testing impacts treatment decisions in hospitals that routinely perform Candida susceptibility testing. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the changes in antifungal treatment based on in vitro susceptibility reports and how these decisions affect mortality, recurrence of infection, and length of hospital stay in candidemia patients.</brief_summary>
