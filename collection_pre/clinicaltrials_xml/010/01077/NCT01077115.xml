	<detailed_description>The prospective, single center, randomized study includes 120 patients who are operated electively - 60 patients operated laparoscopically and 60 patients operated traditionally. Biohumoral and endocrine parameters of response to trauma are determined from 24 hour urine and blood: adrenalin, noradrenalin, metabolites of corticosteroid hormone - 17- hydroxyl and 17- keto steroid (HPLC method), C reactive protein and albumin, glycemia, creatine phosphokinase, lactate dehydrogenase, sedimentation of erythrocytes and serum concentration of potassium.</detailed_description>
