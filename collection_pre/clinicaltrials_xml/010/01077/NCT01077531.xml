	<brief_summary>The assessment of otelixizumab in rheumatoid arthritis subjects will provide safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic information which will enable the identification of appropriate safe and well-tolerated dosage regimens to be used in clinical efficacy studies. This study will consist of a screening phase, followed by a treatment period where four cohorts of subjects will receive 5 daily intravenous infusions of otelixizumab. The cumulative dose will increase in each successive cohort and infusion rates can be adjusted based on signs and symptoms of cytokine release syndrome and to ensure the specified maximum infusion rate is not exceeded. Serial blood samples will be obtained for clinical laboratory testing, determination of pharmacodynamic markers, serum otelixizumab PK parameters, exploratory biomarkers and immunogenicity. Safety and pharmacodynamic data from the previous cohort(s) will be evaluated prior to dosing subsequent cohorts to ensure safety. Adverse events, laboratory values, vital signs and ECG's will be monitored closely during this study. All subjects in the study will undergo long-term follow-up out to 48 months to monitor patient safety.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Male or female subjects between 18 and 75 years of age inclusive. Female subjects of: a. nonchildbearing potential defined as premenopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea [in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) &gt; 40 mIU/ml and estradiol &lt;40 pg/ml (&lt;140 pmol/L) is confirmatory]. Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the contraception methods in Section 8.1 if they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status prior to study enrollment. For most forms of HRT, at least 24 weeks will elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends on the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of their postmenopausal status, they can resume use of HRT during the study without use of a contraceptive method. b. Childbearing potential and agrees to use one of the contraception methods listed in Section 8.1 of the protocol for an appropriate period of time to sufficiently minimize the risk of pregnancy at that point. Female subjects must agree to use contraception for at least 2 weeks prior to dosing and for at least 60 days after the last dose. Male subjects must agree to use one of the contraception methods listed in Section 8.1 of the protocol. This criterion must be followed from the time of the first dose of study medication until at least 60 days after the last dose. Body mass index within the range 18.5 35 kg/m2 inclusive.

If taking methotrexate, the patient must have been taking methotrexate for at least 12 weeks and to be on a stable dose of methotrexate (7.525 mg/week) for at least four weeks prior to dosing and be willing to remain on this up to 12 weeks after last dose of the investigational product in this study unless change required for clinical management of disease activity or safety. If sulfasalazine is being taken, the patient must have been taking sulfasalazine for at least 12 weeks and to be on a stable dose within local treatment guidelines for at least 4 weeks prior to dosing and be willing to remain on this dose for at least 12 weeks after the last dose of study drug unless change required for clinical management of disease activity or safety. If leflunomide is being taken, the patient must have been receiving this DMARD for at least 6 months prior to dosing with otelixizumab and the DMARD dose has been stable dose within local treatment guidelines for 12 weeks prior to dosing with study drug. Patients on glucocorticoids e.g. prednisolone (≤10mg/day), must be on stable dosing regimens for at least 4 weeks prior to dosing and be willing to remain on this regime for at least 12 weeks after the last dose of study drug.
