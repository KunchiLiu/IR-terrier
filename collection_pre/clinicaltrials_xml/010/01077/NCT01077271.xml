	<brief_summary>Compliance to Synagis (palivizumab) is a key factor to obtain maximal protection against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection as shown in the IMpact study. Many factors such as parents' knowledge of burden of respiratory syncytial virus disease or physicians' satisfaction with Synagis as well as the appropriate use of the product might influence compliance. The primary objective of this observational study is to evaluate the compliance to Synagis under daily pediatricians practice conditions in premature infants 33 to 35 weeks gestational age (wGA). Palivizumab, monoclonal antibody for passive immunoprophylaxis against severe respiratory syncytial virus disease, was administered according to usual clinical practice. Compliance was assessed using four criteria: The number of injections per participant per respiratory syncytial virus season, the body site where injections were administered, the interval in days between injections, and the dosage per administration. Originally the study was to include two respiratory syncytial virus seasons but was extended to a third season.</brief_summary>
