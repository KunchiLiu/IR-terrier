	<brief_title>Virtual Bronchoscopy Transbronchial Needle Aspiration(TBNA): a Proof of Concept Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Accurate staging of mediastinal lymph nodes (MLNs) in patients with lung carcinoma (LC) is paramount as the N stage largely determines treatment strategy, prognosis and outcome. Surgical staging such as mediastinoscopy is considered the gold standard. A less invasive alternative is transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA). This technique is limited however by moderate and operator dependent accuracy. Recently less invasive strategies such as esophageal ultrasound guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) and endobronchial ultrasound guided TBNA (EBUS-TBNA) were introduced. These strategies have largely complemented TBNA and surgical staging, with high accuracy and low morbidity. Disadvantages compared to TBNA however are required specific expertise, higher equipment and maintenance costs, the need for more assisting personnel and the need for sedation. Advances in computer generated image processing based on available CT and PET images enable (quasi) real-time virtual bronchoscopy that can assist minimal invasive surgical performance including bronchoscopy. Optimizing the traditional TBNA procedure with these modern imaging techniques might be equally accurate and more cost effective.</detailed_description>
