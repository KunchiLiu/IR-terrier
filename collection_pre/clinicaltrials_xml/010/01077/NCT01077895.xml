	<brief_summary>Intra- abdominal hypertension (IAH) and abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) are a cause of organ dysfunction in critically ill patients. IAH develops due to abdominal lesions (primary IAH) or extra-abdominal processes (secondary IAH). Secondary IAH arises due to decreased abdominal wall compliance and gut edema caused by capillary leak and excessive fluid resuscitation. Decreasing intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) using decompressieve laparotomy has been shown to improve organ dysfunction. However, laparotomy is generally avoided in patients with secondary IAH due to the risk of abdominal complications. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is one of the first and most pronounced organ failures associated with IAH and many patients with AKI in the ICU require renal replacement therapy (RRT). Fluid removal using continuous RRT (CRRT) has been demonstrated to decrease IAP in small series and selected patients. The aim of this study is to evaluate whether fluid removal using CVVH in patients with IAH, fluid overload and AKI is feasible and whether it has a beneficial effect on organ dysfunction (compared to CVVH without net fluid removal).</brief_summary>
