	<brief_title>Study on Energy Cost Prediction of Cycle Ergometer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Oxygen consumption (ml/min) was measured while subjects were at rest and exercised at four submaximal workloads in steady state on cycle ergometer. Bioelectrical impedance analysis was used to estimate the body fats and skeletal muscle mass.</detailed_description>
