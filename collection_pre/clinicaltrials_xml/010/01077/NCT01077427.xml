	<criteria>1. Any ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas confirmed by histology 2. Previous R0 or R1 resection of pancreatic tumor with a standardized procedure 3. No other previous or concomitant treatment of pancreatic carcinoma like radiation, neoadjuvant therapy or immunotherapy 4. No tumor recurrence after surgery 5. Postoperative tumor marker (CEA/CA199) ≤ 2.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) to be documented within 1 week prior to randomization 6. Performance status ECOG 02 7. Adequate bone marrow function defined as WBC count ≥ 3.5 x 109/L and platelets ≥ 150 x 109/L and haemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dl documented within 1 week prior to randomization 8. Adequate renal function defined as serum creatinine ≤ 1.2 mg/dL and calculated GFR ≥ 60 mL/min documented within 1 week prior to randomization 9. Adequate coagulatory function defined as Quickvalue ≥ 70% and aPTT ≤ 1.5 x ULN documented within 1 week prior to randomization 10. Transaminases (AST, ALT) ≤ 3 x ULN and bilirubin ≤ 2 x ULN documented within 1 week prior to randomization 11. At least 18 years of age 12. Women with childbearing potential and fertile men must use adequate contraceptive measures during and for at least 3 months (female) and 6 months (male) after completion of study therapy (Adequate methods for women are oral contraceptives with estrogen and progesterone, vaginal rings, contraceptive patches, estrogenfree ovulation inhibitors, intrauterine devices with progesterone,3month injections with depot progesterone, implants setting free progesterone, abstinence or sterilization (vasectomy) of the male partner. Men must use condoms.) 13. Women with childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within 1 week prior to randomization (postmenopausal women with amenorrhea for more than 1 year are regarded as having no childbearing potential) 14. Written informed consent Exclusion criteria: 1. Cystic carcinoma of the pancreas 2. Periampullary, papillary cancer 3. Metastatic disease 4. Presence of an active infection grade 3 or higher 5. Other severe disease which could impair the patient's ability to participate in the study according to the investigator's opinion 6. Pregnant or breastfeeding women 7. Known allergies or contraindications with regard to substances or procedures of study therapy 8. Severe, nonhealing wounds, ulcers or bone fractures 9. Participation in another clinical trial during this study or within 4 weeks prior to randomization 10. Past or current abuse of illegal or legal drugs or alcohol 11. Other primary malignant diseases in the medical history during the last 5 years (exceptions: carcinoma in situ of the cervix or adequately treated basal cell carcinoma of the skin). 12. Permanent cardiac pacemaker 13. Gross adiposity defined as BMI &gt; 40 kg/m² 14. Treatment with regional hyperthermia not possible for technical reasons (e.g. metal implant)</criteria>
