	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety Study for Cognitive Deficits in Adult Subjects With Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase 2 study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ABT-288 in approximately 210 adults with schizophrenia. Subjects will be randomized to one of three treatment groups (ABT-288 Dose 1, ABT-288 Dose 2 or placebo) for a 12-week Treatment Period. The purpose of this research study is to find out whether ABT-288 compared to placebo can improve cognition and what side effects ABT 288 may cause. Cognition is the way a person thinks, and it includes abilities like paying attention, focusing, remembering things, and solving problems. Acronyms listed in the Outcomes and/or Eligibility sections for this study are defined below: - MCCB: Measurement and Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia (MATRICS) Consensus Cognitive Battery - UPSA-2: University of California at San Diego (UCSD) Performance-Based Skills Assessment-2 - CANTAB: Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery - PANSS: Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale - NSA-16: Negative Symptom Assessment-16 - CGI-S: Clinical Global Impression - Severity</detailed_description>
