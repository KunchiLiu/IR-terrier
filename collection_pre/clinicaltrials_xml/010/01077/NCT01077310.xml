	<brief_summary>This is a randomized controlled trial of injectable intramuscular naltrexone (XR-NTX) versus intramuscular placebo among HIV-infected prisoners meeting Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) criteria for alcohol dependence or problem drinking, who are transitioning to the community and seeking treatment to prevent relapse to alcohol use. We hypothesize that extended release naltrexone (XR-NTX) will result in improved HIV outcomes (lower log10 HIV-1RNA levels and higher CD4 count) as well as improved alcohol treatment outcomes, and reduced drug/sex HIV related risk behaviors and decreased rates of reincarceration.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>INSPIRE is a randomized controlled trial of injectable intramuscular NTX (XR-NTX) versus intramuscular placebo among Human Immunodeficiency (HIV) infected prisoners meeting DSM-IV criteria for alcohol dependence or problem drinking, who are transitioning to the community and seeking treatment to prevent relapse to alcohol use. While the COMBINE trial has demonstrated the effectiveness of oral naltrexone in a group of active alcohol dependent persons in decreasing relapse to alcohol use over placebo, naltrexone has not been studied in people who have a history of current alcohol dependence prior to incarceration, are incarcerated and not actively using alcohol and are likely to return to alcohol use when released. In this study, we conduct a placebo-controlled trial to determine if naltrexone has an effect in this group, which could be important in making the case for having naltrexone available to alcohol dependent or problem drinking HIV+ prisoners prior to release. We will compare their HIV treatment (HIV-1 RNA levels, CD4 count), alcohol treatment (time to relapse to heavy drinking, percent of days drinking, percent of days abstinent and alcohol craving) and HIV risk behavior (sexual and drug-related risks) outcomes. The hypotheses include: i. XR-NTX will result in improved HIV clinical outcomes, including changes in HIV-1 RNA levels, and higher CD4 counts. ii. XR-NTX will result in improved alcohol treatment outcomes, including longer time to alcohol relapse, lower percent days drinking, and lower craving for alcohol.</detailed_description>
