	<brief_title>An Early Safety and Efficacy Study of Ascites Management: Standard Paracentesis or Early Intervention With Pleurx Catheters in Patients With Malignant Ascites</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Design: Single institution, open-label, randomized study Study Device: Pleurx Catheter Treatment Plan: Cohort A: 15 patients treated with standard therapy (therapeutic paracentesis +/- diuretics) Cohort B: 15 patients treated with peritoneal Pleurx catheter Duration of Participation: Patients will be followed for one year, or until death, whichever comes first. Primary Outcome: Safety of the Pleurx catheter procedure or paracentesis Secondary outcomes: Overall complications, quality of life, overall survival, and symptom control</detailed_description>

	<criteria>(Patients can receive chemotherapy at the discretion of treating oncologist) 1. Patients with recurrent malignant ascites 2. Patients with refractory malignant ascites 3. Proven malignancy 4. Age &gt;= 18 years old 5. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance scale =&lt; 2 6. Ability to understand and willingness to sign a written informed consent Definitions: Malignant ascites: One of the following criteria 1. Positive ascitic fluid cytology 2. Histology proven malignancy with imaging studies with evidence of liver metastasis and ascites 3. Malignant Budd Chiari Syndrome with associated ascites 4. Hepatocellular carcinoma and ascites 5. Chylous ascites due to lymphoma 6. Peritoneal carcinomatosis and concurrent ascites 7. Proven abdominal malignancy with concurrent ascites Refractory / Recurrent ascites: One of the following criteria 1. Symptomatic ascites that recurred after one paracentesis in a patient with known malignant ascites. 2. Symptomatic ascites that did not respond clinically to at least two weeks of diuretics. Use of diuretics at the discretion of the treating physician. 3. Intolerance or relative contraindications to diuretics: (serum sodium (Na) concentration of &lt;125 mmol per liter or serum creatinine &gt;1.5 mg/dl, hyperkalemia (potassium &gt;5.2 mEq/L or azotemia Bun/Creatinine ratio &gt; 20). 4. Removal of at least 5 L in the preceding two months for symptoms relief Exclusion criteria: 1. Life expectancy less than one month 2.

Inability to provide inform consent 6. Platelet counts &lt; 50,000/mcL 7. Uncontrolled illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection requiring intravenous (IV) antibiotics, that the physician feels would increase the risk of infection with the procedures or white blood cell (WBC) count &gt; 20,000/mcL 8. Absolute neutrophil count &lt;1000 / cu mm 9. Pregnant women 10. Multiloculated ascites</criteria>
