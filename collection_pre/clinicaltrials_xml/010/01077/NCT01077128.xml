	<brief_title>Greek Study of the Quality of Life in Patients With Psoriasis Treated With Adalimumab</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of this post-marketing observational study in adult patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis is to obtain further data on patient's Quality of Life and assess the impact of Adalimumab treatment on patient's quality of life in conditions of day-to-day clinical practice in Greece. This study will further assess the relationship between clinical outcomes and patient-reported outcomes. As this is an observational study, Abbott will not provide the study drug. Humira will be prescribed according to the routine medical practice. The participating physicians are free to determine the appropriate therapy for each patient and make treatment choices as deemed clinically necessary. The Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) will be used to assess patient quality of life. The Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) total scores range from 0 to 30, with 0 corresponding to the best quality of life and 30 to the worst. The Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) has well-established reliability and validity as determined in several studies. Moreover, it is frequently used in clinical trials of psoriasis. The physician's global assessment of disease severity (PGA) will be used to measure patients' disease status at the time of assessment. It is a 6-point scale measuring the degree of overall psoriatic lesion severity, and scores range from 0 (clear) to 5 (very severe). Complementary, European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions health questionnaire (EQ5D) will be used as a measure of health outcome. This is applicable to a wide range of health conditions and treatments and it provides a simple descriptive profile and a single index value for health status. Health economic data will be collected by using European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions health questionnaire (EQ5D) questionnaire and data regarding patients hospitalisation due to psoriasis. Hospitalisation data will be collected 6 months before the period and throughout the observation period. Moreover, this study will observe the current medical practice in prescribing Adalimumab in Greece and more detailed data on prescription behavior will be collected. Guidelines have been developed in order to ensure that the new class of therapy (biologic agents) is introduced in a systematic and planned way to achieve the greatest possible benefit to people with psoriasis and to facilitate safe and effective prescribing. However, many issues are not fully addressed, such as recommendation regarding the amount of time for wash out of previous antipsoriatic drugs and combination therapies. Such issues remain at the discretion of the healthcare professional. Since this is an observational study the patient will be treated in accordance with the physician's usual and customary medical practice. Thus, the following information regarding the use of Adalimumab will be collected - the previous systemic treatment history will be recorded including previous biological therapies that patient received, if any, - wash out periods prior to initiating Adalimumab therapy, if any - reasons for stopping previous treatment, - combination of Adalimumab with other topical or systemic antipsoriatic agents, if applicable Furthermore, demographic data of patients suffering from psoriasis in Greece will be collected (age, gender, ethnicity) and disease data such as duration of the disease, involvement of nails or joints, geographic distribution of the disease in Greece will be collected.</detailed_description>
