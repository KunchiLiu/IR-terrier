	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ofatumumab and bendamustine combination therapy in patients with indolent B-cell NHL that did not respond to rituximab or a rituximab-containing regimen during or within 6 months of the last rituximab treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ofatumumab and Bendamustine Combination Therapy Compared With Bendamustine Monotherapy in Indolent B-cell Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL) Unresponsive to Rituximab or a Rituximab-Containing Regimen</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ofatumumab is an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody shown to have monotherapy activity in patients with follicular lymphoma that has relapsed following rituximab-containing therapy. Bendamustine was approved by FDA for the treatment of in patients with indolent B-cell Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL) that did not respond to rituximab or a rituximab-containing regimen during or within 6 months of the last rituximab treatment. Biologics have demonstrated enhanced efficacy when added to chemotherapeutic combinations in the frontline treatment for indolent NHL. The combination of ofatumumab and bendamustine may provide additional clinical benefit and efficacy to those who no longer respond to rituximab or rituximab-containing regimens. The objective of this study is to determine the effect of ofatumumab and bendamustine combination therapy in patients with indolent B-cell NHL that did not respond to rituximab or a rituximab-containing regimen during or within 6 months of the last rituximab treatment.</detailed_description>
