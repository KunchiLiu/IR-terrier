	<brief_summary>The primary aim of this study is to evaluate whether an intervention that combines positive affect and self-affirmation with motivational interviewing (TRIUMPH) improves blood pressure control compared to an educational/behavioral contract intervention at 12 months. We hypothesize that a greater proportion of participants in the experimental arm of TRIUMPH will have adequate blood pressure control as defined by Seventh Joint National Committee on Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of Hypertension (JNC-7.)</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial Using Motivational Interviewing Positive Affect and Self-Affirmation in Hypertension (TRIUMPH)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>TRIUMPH is designed to build on the findings of our previous studies by combining positive affect and self affirmation with motivational interviewing in order to increase blood pressure control in community based practices that care for large numbers of hypertensive black patients. Patients in both the educational and behavioral contract control group and would receive a workbook, would make a behavioral contract, and a home blood pressure monitor. The positive affect/self-affirmation group would receive the same components as the control group. In addition the experimental group would receive a positive affect/self-affirmation induction and motivational interviewing. Both the control group and the experimental group would be followed at 2 month intervals. The outcome blood pressure control in this group will be contrasted to the knowledge/behavioral contract group. We hypothesize that we can increase the percent of patients who have blood pressure control to 75%.</detailed_description>
