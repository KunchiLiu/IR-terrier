	<brief_summary>In this study, the novel vaccine candidate, MVA.HIVconsv, will be tested for safety, tolerability and immunogenicity in HIV-1-seropositive subjects receiving effective antiretroviral therapy. MVA.HIVconsv will be tested as a single vaccine modality, as a prelude to testing in a heterologous viral vector boost regimen which will include a replication-defective simian adenovirus expressing the same immunogen.</brief_summary>
