	<brief_title>Study to Evaluate the Diagnostic Value of a Combined Molecular Breast Imaging/ Breast Tomosynthesis Modality</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this pilot study is to obtain preliminary data on a new way of imaging the breast that combines the benefits of a 3-D anatomical technique (Digital Tomosynthesis) with those of a functional imaging technique (Molecular Breast Imaging). Combining data from these 2 modalities would provide co-registered functional and anatomical information on the breast, in the same way that PET/CT does today in oncology. This should greatly facilitate the evaluation and biopsy of lesions seen on MBI but occult on conventional mammography.</detailed_description>
