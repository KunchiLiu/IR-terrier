	<brief_summary>The primary aim of this pilot study is to test the efficacy of the selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor, Escitalopram, in the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in an open clinical trial. A secondary aim is to determine whether treatment with escitalopram increases plasma allopregnanolone levels in patients with PTSD and if increases in allopregnanolone levels are correlated with treatment efficacy.</brief_summary>
