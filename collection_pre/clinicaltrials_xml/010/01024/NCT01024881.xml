	<brief_summary>Infraclavicular approach of the subclavian veins is commonly used for central venous access. Aberrant locations of catheter tip are frequently quoted for this approach, but few studies have been performed to document the relationship between the shoulder position and catheter tip location. This prospective study was performed to assess the influence of the shoulder position on the safe and proper placement of infraclavicular subclavian catheters.</brief_summary>
