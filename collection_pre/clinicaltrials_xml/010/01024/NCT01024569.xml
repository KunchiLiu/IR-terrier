	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to test the effectiveness of a standardized peer-led intervention to teach self-management skills in improving outcomes of individuals with a severe mental illness. The intervention is known as Wellness Recovery Action Planning or WRAP, co-developed by Dr. Mary Ellen Copeland. The focus of the inquiry is on whether and how developing an individualized plan for successful living: 1) lowers psychiatric symptoms; 2) enhances psychosocial outcomes such as self-perceived recovery, empowerment, self-advocacy, coping, and social support; 3) increases knowledge of personal mental illness self-management strategies; and 4) enhances satisfaction with the service delivery system. The study evaluated the following hypotheses: Hypothesis #1: Compared to wait-list control subjects, those who participate in the WRAP intervention will report reduced levels of psychiatric symptoms. Hypothesis #2: Compared to wait-list control subjects, those who participate in the WRAP intervention will report enhanced enhanced feelings of empowerment, hope, recovery, quality of life, and functioning. Hypothesis #3: Compared to wait-list controls, those who participate in the WRAP intervention will report increased levels of social support. Hypothesis #4: Compared to wait-list controls, those who participate in the WRAP intervention will report increased use of peer services, higher satisfaction with services, and have lower overall service costs. Hypothesis #5: Compared to controls, those who participate in the WRAP intervention will report increased knowledge of mental illness self-management, including making/using a WRAP plan. Hypothesis #6: There will be no difference in employment rates of control vs. intervention subjects.</brief_summary>
