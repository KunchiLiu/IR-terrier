	<brief_title>Confocal Laser Endomicroscopy for the Detection of Gastric Intestinal Metaplasia: a Randomized Controlled Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Gastric intestinal metaplasia is a well-known premalignant lesions for intestinal type gastric cancer. However, present guidelines such as the updated Sydney System require multiple biopsies whereas reveal an unsatisfactory yield considering the detection and surveillance of these lesions. Confocal laser endomicroscopy is a newly developed endoscopic device that enables microscopic view of the digestive tract. Previous study has showed high sensitivity and specificity for in vivo diagnosis of gastric intestinal metaplasia using confocal laser endomicroscopy. This study aims to assess the real number of biopsies that can be reduced for the detection of gastric intestinal metaplasia using confocal laser endomicroscopy.</detailed_description>
