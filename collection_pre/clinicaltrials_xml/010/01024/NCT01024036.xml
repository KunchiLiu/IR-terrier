	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that CNTO 328 when administered in combination with best supportive care (BSC) is superior to BSC in terms of durable tumor and symptomatic response (complete response or partial response) among patients with Multicentric Castleman's Disease.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of CNTO328 Plus Best Supportive Care in Multicentric Castleman's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multicenter (study conducted at multiple sites), randomized (the study medication is assigned by chance), double blind (neither investigator nor the participant knows the treatment that the participant receives), placebo controlled (an inactive substance that is compared with the study medication to test whether the study medication has a real effect in clinical study), study to assess the efficacy and safety of CNTO 328 plus BSC compared with BSC in patients with symptomatic Multicentric Castleman's Disease. The study mainly consists of 3 phases, including: the screening phase (majority of assessments performed within 28 days of first dose), the treatment phase (blinded and unblinded), and the follow up phase. In the blinded treatment phase, approximately 78 patients will be randomly assigned in 1:2 ratios to either of 2 treatment groups, ie, Placebo + BSC, or CNTO 328 + BSC. Participants receiving placebo + BSC during blinded treatment period who do not respond and have treatment failure will have the option to crossover and receive siltuximab + BSC during unbllinded treatent period. The follow up phase will be 3 months after last dose of study medication and the survival will be followed up until the study ends. Safety evaluations for adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, electrocardiogram, vital signs, patient-recorded temperature, and physical examination will be monitored throughout the study. The total study duration will be 5 years after the last patient starts study medication.</detailed_description>
