	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to determine if the implementation of guidelines utilizing immediate CT Perfusion and CT Angiography in addition to non-contrast CT alters (reduces or increases) the time to decision-making for or against rt-PA in acute ischemic stroke, and by extension, time to therapy in treated patients and time to transfer from the department for all patients. A secondary objective is to determine if using CTP/CTA-inclusive hyperacute stroke guidelines improves safety by decreasing symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage and mortality in patients who receive rt-PA.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients presenting to the emergency Signs and symptoms of acute ischemic stroke: impairment of language, motor function, cognition and/or gaze, vision or neglect. Patients with an NIH Stroke Scale score &gt; 4 Age less than 19 Patient symptomatic for greater than five hours. Intravenous thrombolytic therapy must be instituted within three hours of symptom onset in order to minimize the risk of Intracerebral or symptomatic hemorrhage; other interventions such as intraarterial thrombolytic therapy and clot retrieval allow for a sixhour window. One hour is an achievable time for arrival to institution of therapy, therefore a fivehour limit on enrollment allows the greatest number of patients the possibility of therapy. Inability to verify a clear onset of symptoms. As noted, time elapsed since the patient's last known baseline state is correlated to Intracerebral and symptomatic hemorrhage, and therapy is approved only for patients with a clear time of onset.</criteria>
