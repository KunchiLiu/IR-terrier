	<brief_title>Effectiveness of a Cognitive and Physical Intervention to Reduce Head and Muscle Pain in a Large Population</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In a previous non-randomized-controlled study in which the cognitive and physical programme was applied to a consistent number of office workers, a significant reduction of frequency of pain in the head and neck areas and of analgesic drug consumption was obtained. The results were stable at a 12 month follow up. More recently a controlled, cluster randomised, interventional trial was conducted on 1930 local government employees of the Municipality of Turin. The data obtained confirm those of the previous studies. The present study was designed to confirm the data in a much more extensive population , that is, residents of the Italian Region Piemonte (Piedmont) who will apply to participate. Primary objective is to confirm the effectiveness of the cognitive and physical programme (Intervention), in reducing the frequency of pain involving the head and neck area in a large population of a territory. Secondary objective is to confirm the effectiveness of the Intervention, in reducing analgesic drugs consumption after the Intervention in the same population.</detailed_description>
