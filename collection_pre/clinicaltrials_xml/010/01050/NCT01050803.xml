	<brief_title>Effectiveness of the Farsi Diabetes Self-management Education (FDSME) Program for People With Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For designing the management program, we will use Intervention Mapping (IM) framework for systematically developing the theory and evidence based program. Based on IM approach, this study will have seven phases: Step 1: needs assessment (Development the problem analysis: health, quality of life, behavior, environment). Step 2: We will develop proximal program objectives with a multidisciplinary expert panel of participants. Step 3: After identification of the proximal program objectives, the next step will be to select theoretical methods and practical strategies based on evidence for alternative methods. Step 4: The forth step of the program development will comprise of composing program materials and pre-testing these materials with a sample of patients at a diabetic outpatient clinic. Step 5: By involving the future program facilitators (health care workers at outpatient clinics) a linkage system will be foreseen. Step 6: planning for evaluation Step 7: Randomized Clinical Trial</detailed_description>
