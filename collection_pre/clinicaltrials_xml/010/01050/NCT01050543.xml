	<brief_summary>This is a randomized, active-controlled, parallel-group, single-dose, multi-site, safety-assessor blinded study comparing sugammadex to neostigmine for reversal of neuromuscular blockade in Korean subjects undergoing elective surgical procedures under general anesthesia that require rocuronium for neuromuscular blockade. Study medication will be administered at reappearance of T2. Time to recovery will be measured from start of study medication administration to recovery of the T4/T1 ratio of 0.9. The primary hypothesis is that the time to recovery of the T4/T1 ratio of 0.9 is shorter with sugammadex than with neostigmine.</brief_summary>
