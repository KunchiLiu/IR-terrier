	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether specific assays of DNA damage repair proteins can be used in patients undergoing radiation therapy. The ultimate goal of this research is to develop clinically useful biomarkers from blood samples that could be used to customize radiation treatment for individuals, leading to reduced side effects and improved outcomes.</brief_summary>
