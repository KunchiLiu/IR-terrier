	<brief_summary>The purpose of this Treatment IND is to make miltefosine available for mucocutaneous leishmaniasis patients presenting in the United States. If entrance criteria are met, subjects with mucosal or cutaneous leishmaniasis will receive miltefosine at a targeted dose of 2.5 mg/kg/day for 28 days. During treatment at weeks 1, 2, and 4, the patient will return to the treatment facility to be assessed for adverse events. Blood for transaminase and creatinine values will be drawn at the midpoint and at the end of therapy. Patients will return to the treatment facility to be examined clinically at 6 wks (ie, 2 wks after the end of therapy), 3 months (2 months after therapy), and 7 months (6 months after treatment) for ML and CL patients, and also at 13 months (12 months after treatment) for ML patients.</brief_summary>
