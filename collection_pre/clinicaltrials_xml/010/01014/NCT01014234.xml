	<brief_summary>The immune system response is mediated by the interaction between the antigen presenting cell (APC), CD4+ T helper cells (Th) and CD4+ CD25+ regulatory T cells, a subgroup of CD4+ T cell which express IL-2 receptor (CD25) and the transcriptional factor foxp3. Regulatory T cell may contribute to the maintenance of tolerance by suppressing the immune response to normal or tumor associated antigens. Regulatory T cell emerge from the thymus during ontogenesis and they represent about 10 % of the peripheral Cd4+ t cells. Rapamycin is one the most use treatment to prevent renal allograft failure. Differently from calcineurin inhibitors (cyclosporine and tacrolimus), that inhibit T-cell activation through the inhibition of calcineurin activation, rapamycin inhibits cellular proliferation by impairing the progression of the cellular cycle, in particular by interaction with mTOR. Recently Battaglia et al. have demonstrated a Treg amplification in murine CD4+ lymphocytes treated with rapamycin in vitro. Aim of the study is to evaluate the effect of different immunosuppressive regimens on regulatory T cell and to verify the hypothesis that rapamycin may induce tolerance in kidney transplanted patients, more than cyclosporine treatment.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>It is two years randomised controlled trial in parallel groups. It has been resolved to compare different immunosuppressive regimens: 1. cyclosporine+ mycophenolate+prednisone 2. rapamycin + mycophenolate + prednisone, this treatment should be introduced after one month from renal transplantation. Patient should visited at month 1-6-12-24 from the transplant. During the control we will reported the following data: physical examination, blood test (blood count, creatinin, BUN, immunosuppressive blood concentration, histological response of surveillance renal biopsy), blood pressure, attendant change of current therapy, pathological variation, or any hospitalisation both ordinary or in DH regimen. Moreover in all control visit it will be collected a blood sample for evaluation of regulatory t cells.</detailed_description>
