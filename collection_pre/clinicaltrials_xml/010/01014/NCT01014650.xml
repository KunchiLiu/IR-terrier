	<brief_title>Single Ascending Dose Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics Study of GLYX-13 in Normal Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>NMDA receptor glycine site partial agonists (GFPAs) have been demonstrated to be efficacious in animal models and/or in early human studies of several Central Nervous System (CNS) diseases including neuropathic pain, major depressive disorder, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, anxiety including posttraumatic stress syndrome, and cognition in Down's syndrome and autism and others, without the psychomimetic side effects of NMDA receptor channel blockers. GLYX-13 has demonstrated a wide therapeutic ratio (500:1) between efficacy and side effects in animals. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of GLYX-13 following a single IV dose.</detailed_description>
