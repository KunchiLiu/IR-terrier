	<brief_summary>The investigators are studying the impact of the interventions of a multidisciplinary team (MDT) - consisting of a Coventry case manager, social worker, and medical director, alongside a Medco specialist pharmacist - on the hospitalization rates of high risk seniors with chronic conditions, compared with a usual care approach. The study will also examine the impact on quality of life, medication adherence, medical costs, hospital readmission rates, and a variety of other important measures. The outcome of COSS may support a means to further enhance and develop a comprehensive care model program by leveraging the partnership between a health plan and a pharmacy benefit manager.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Coventry Outcomes Study of Seniors (COSS): A Comparative Effectiveness Study to Evaluate the Effect of a Multidisciplinary Team's Intervention on the Incidence of Nonelective Hospitalizations in a Medicare Population</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The multidisciplinary team will provide face-to-face visits in a home setting with interventions that focus on five key areas: care transitions, self-management, care coordination, pharmacy and prevention, all designed to support high-risk Medicare members and their relationship with their primary care providers. If the study proves to reduce hospitalizations in the senior population, it could provide important guidance for future efforts to reduce the cost and improve the quality of care for seniors with chronic conditions.</detailed_description>
