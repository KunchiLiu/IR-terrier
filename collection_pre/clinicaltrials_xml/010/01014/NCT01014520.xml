	<brief_title>Efficacy of Gabapentin or Amitriptyline to Reduce Postoperative Pain After Lumbar Laminectomy and Diskectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pain suppression plays a decisive role in patients' satisfaction following lumbar diskectomies, as the psychological component of the pain is a major cause of treatment failure. Controversy exists whether preemptive prescription of gabapentin, as a known contributor to reduce postoperative pain, has a role in patients undergoing laminectomy for lumbar diskectomy or spinal canal stenosis.The aim of this study is to test the efficacy of amitriptyline and gabapentin in this group of neurosurgical patients.</detailed_description>
