	<brief_summary>Single-centre, controlled, randomized, evaluator-blinded, bilateral (split-face) comparison study in subjects with moderate to severe forehead wrinkles. One botulinum toxin type A will be injected in one side of the forehead and the other one will be injected in the other side of the forehead at baseline. Allocation of each BoNT-A to each side of the forehead will be randomized.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Two Botulinum Toxins Type A on Forehead Wrinkles</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There are two formulations of BoNT-A available: Botox速/Vistabel速, Allergan and Dysport速/Azzalure速, Ipsen - Galderma. These formulations behave distinctly in different ways electrophysiologically and clinically and results obtained with one formulation cannot be extrapolated to the other. There are only few clinical research directly comparing the two formulations in the treatment of forehead lines.</detailed_description>
