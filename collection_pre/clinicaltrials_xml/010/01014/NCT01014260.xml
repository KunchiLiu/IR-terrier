	<brief_summary>Cardiovascular disease, specifically from atherosclerosis, is the major cause of mortality in SLE in developed countries. In a recent study the investigators have shown that high sensitivity C reactive protein (hs-CRP) is higher in SLE patients with (versus without) coronary calcium, a measure of subclinical atherosclerosis. In an ongoing two year intervention trial of atorvastatin, the investigators will determine if statins retard coronary calcium and reduce hs-CRP. However, 10% of the patients in the trial were intolerant of statins. The investigators want to now investigate whether there are additional, and potentially safer ways, to reduce hs-CRP in SLE. In this study, the investigators will determine if doxycycline reduces hs-CRP and other vascular inflammatory markers including interleukin 6 (IL-6), soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule (sVCAM-1), soluble inter cell adhesion molecule (s-ICAM-1) and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) in SLE.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Patients with a clinical diagnosis of SLE, with a hsCRP above &gt; 3mg/L, (high risk level) for the last 3 months, are eligible. 2. Patients must be 18 years of age or older and able to give informed consent. 3. Contraception other than OCPs is necessary if a woman is at risk for pregnancy. 1. SLE patients who are allergic to doxycycline or other tetracyclines. 2. Patients who are pregnant or are planning to become pregnant. 3. Patients who are on oral contraceptives (any method of contraception other than OCPs can be used. 4. Tetracycline use within the previous 2 weeks of enrollment. 5. Patients who are currently on statins will be excluded, because statins might reduce hs CRP. 6. Patients who are on warfarin. 7. Patients whose most recent EKG shows significant cardiac dysrhythmias or heart block.</criteria>
