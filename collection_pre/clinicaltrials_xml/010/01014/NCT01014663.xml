	<brief_title>Non-contact Boxing Training and Traditional Therapeutic Exercise for Persons With Parkinson's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Physical therapists commonly treat patients with Parkinson's disease. Typical clinical interventions used by physical therapists including strengthening, stretching and aerobic training have been shown to improve function and quality of life of persons with Parkinson's disease. Alternative exercise interventions that incorporate non-traditional concepts, such as tango dance, tai chi and taiji have also been found to lead to improvements in function in persons with Parkinson's disease. It is important that comparisons between different types of exercise programs for persons with Parkinson's disease be explored in order to determine effective options for care. Here in Indianapolis, Indiana, individuals with Parkinson's disease have a unique opportunity for alternative exercise with the recent development of the popular non-contact boxing training program offered by the Rock Steady Boxing Foundation. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to compare the effects of the non-traditional boxing training program to a traditional therapeutic exercise program on activity and participation outcomes in persons with Parkinson's disease. Thirty participants with Parkinson's disease will be recruited from Central Indiana. All potential participants will be screened to determine eligibility for the study. Participants who are eligible and give consent will be randomly assigned to participate in either the non-contact boxing training or the traditional therapeutic exercise program for 36 sessions lasting over 12 weeks with 60-90 minutes of exercise each session. Participants will be measured immediately before (pre-test) and after (post-test) the intervention period.</detailed_description>
