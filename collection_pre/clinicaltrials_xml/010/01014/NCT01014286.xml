	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this protocol is to determine the frequency of oncogenic mutations in 1000 patients with advanced adenocarcinoma of the lung. The linked clinical and mutational analyses will be used to determine the frequency of each mutation, its association with clinical features and outcome, and its association with other mutations. As future therapeutic protocols specific for these mutations are developed, patients may be notified of their eligibility for these studies. Future translational studies may be used to: a) unravel the complex biology of lung cancer; b) identify prognostic markers; c) define predictive markers of response/resistance to new therapies; d) identify new targets. A secondary goal is to establish a consortium of sites that have the capability of conducting multiple mutation testing in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) certified lab.</brief_summary>
