	<brief_title>Treatment for Depressed Primary Care Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Major depression affects 5%-9% of older primary care patients, is often chronic or recurrent and disabling, and leads to frequent use of medical services. Most depressed elders are treated by primary care physicians (PCPs) and prior research has shown that collaboration between primary care physicians and depression care managers is effective in treating depression. The challenge has been in securing third-party reimbursement for such services. This research study will address this barrier by developing a collaborative depression care management model (C-DCM) that encourages collaboration between PCPs and trained social workers employed by community-based, public and nonprofit mental health clinics. In addition to developing C-DCM, a total of 112 primary care outpatients will participate in this study to test whether C-DCM is more effective than the standard of care in decreasing the severity of depression and disability experienced by older adults. Each subject will be randomized into either Usual Care or C-DCM. All subjects will be assessed at Baseline and at 2 and 4 months while the C-DCM subjects will also meet with social worker depression case managers bi-weekly over four months. If shown effective, C-DCM may bring to bear an available, yet untapped resource in the care of depressed elders.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age 60 years and older: This study focuses on the clinical complexities of latelife depression and its treatment. Family Services of Westchester (our partner community mental health agency) offers geriatric mental health counseling services to adults age 60 and older. Diagnosis of unipolar major depression MADRS score &gt;=18: Depression of such severity in primary care patients requires treatment. CANE score &gt;0: Reflects the presence of at least one unmet need in the domains of housing, selfcare, safety, finances, benefits, legal matters, transportation, etc. and thus need for social services. Capacity to provide written consent for both research assessment and depression care management: PCPs will be asked to clinically evaluate prospective participants' capacity to consent and document it in their medical record. Working knowledge of English: Command in English sufficient for comprehending questionnaires of the study and/or for understanding the DCM therapists. English does not have to be the subject's first language. Psychotic depression: This will be determined by the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM Disorders(SCID) assessment; presence of delusions and or hallucinations. This is a severe disorder typically referred for treatment to mental health specialists. Active suicidal ideation: This will be determined by the SCID and MADRS assessments. Older patients at these levels of risk for selfharm typically are referred to mental health specialists. Antisocial personality by Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)IV: This disorder will possibly interfere with adherence to research procedures and treatment. Significant Cognitive Impairment (MMSE score &lt;24) or clinical diagnosis of dementia by DSMIV: These conditions may limit the patient's ability to participate in treatment and require social service interventions exceeding those available through the proposed depression care management models. Current participation in specialist psychiatric care: Such patients will require the development of collaborative arrangements for depression care management which differ from those being tested in this study. Acute or severe medical illness: i.e., delirium, metastatic cancer, decompensated cardiac, liver or kidney failure, major surgery, stroke or myocardial infarction during the three months prior to entry; or drugs often causing depression, e.g., steroids, reserpine, alphamethyldopa, tamoxifen, vincristine.</criteria>
