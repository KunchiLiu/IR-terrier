	<brief_summary>A double blind randomised placebo controlled parallel trial of the effect of fosinopril, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, on the quadriceps muscle in 80 COPD patients who have quadriceps weakness. Patients will have a baseline assessment including measures of quadriceps strength and endurance and a quadriceps biopsy. Patients with weakness will be randomised to ACE inhibitor or placebo and re-assessed after three months of treatment. The investigators aim to show that ACE-inhibition will alter the IGF-1/AKT/FoXO/atrogene pathways involved in muscle wasting in COPD.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Adult patient with COPD diagnosed according to GOLD criteria. Clinically unstable patients (within one month of exacerbation), those with a permanent pacemaker (which is a contraindication to magnetic stimulation), or significant comorbidity, patients with an accepted indication for ACE inhibition (left ventricular dysfunction, diabetes) or a contraindication such as renovascular disease; creatinine clearance (estimated) &lt;50); hypotension; use of anticoagulants (contraindication to biopsy) or ACEI or ATII receptor antagonists. Allergy to ACEinhibitors. Pregnancy. Patients will not be enrolled within three months of participation in a pulmonary rehabilitation program.</criteria>
