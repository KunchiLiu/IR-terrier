	<brief_summary>This is a multicenter, multinational, non-randomized, non-controlled open-label phase II trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of treosulfan in a combination regimen with fludarabine as conditioning therapy prior to allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) in patients with MDS. The aim is to demonstrate a clinical benefit compared to historical data with intravenous busulfan.</brief_summary>
