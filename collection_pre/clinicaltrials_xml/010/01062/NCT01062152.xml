	<brief_summary>This is an open label, multicenter Phase 1 dose escalation study evaluating five doses of ezatiostat in combination with lenalidomide in patients with non-del(5q) low to intermediate 1 risk MDS. The HI-E, HI-N, HI-P rates [by International Working Group (IWG) 2006 criteria] and safety of each treatment group will be evaluated to select the optimal dose of ezatiostat in combination with lenalidomide for future studies.</brief_summary>
