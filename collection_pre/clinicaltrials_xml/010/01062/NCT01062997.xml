	<brief_summary>A randomized, prospective comparison of volar locked plating versus Hoffman II bridging external fixation supplemented by K-wire fixation in patients with comminuted distal radius fractures, AO/OTA type C2 &amp; C3. Hypothesis: There is no significant difference in using volar plates compared to Hoffman II bridging external fixation supplemented by K-wire fixation in patients with comminuted distal radius fractures, AO/OTA type C2 &amp; C3 as evaluated by a Quick-DASH score at 24 months follow-up.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Volar Locked Plating Versus Bridging External Fixation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We have designed a randomized, prospective study for comparison of volar locked plating versus Hoffman II bridging external fixation supplemented by K-wire fixation in patients with comminuted distal radius fractures, AO/OTA type C2 &amp; C3. On the basis of power analysis a total of 140 patients are to be included in this project. The follow-up period is 2 years and evaluation is based on x-ray analysis, grip strength, range of movement, pain and various tools to measure quality of life and satisfaction with the treatment (EQ-5d, SF-36, Quick-DASH).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>All patients admitted to Ahus and Lillestrom legevakt with a distal radius fracture are to be classified according to the system of the Orthopaedic Trauma Association (AO/OTA). All patients between the age of 18 and 70 diagnosed with a C2 or C3type fracture, or a dislocated C1fracture, are eligible for inclusion. GustilloAnderson type III open fractures Previous distal radius/ulnafracture and/or disabling hand injury of the same extremity Dementia Congenital anomaly Bilateral radius fracture Pathological fracture other than osteoporotic fracture Congenital bone disease (for example osteogenesis imperfecta) Age below 18 and above 70 Disabling nury to other parts og the movement apparatus at the same time as the current injury</criteria>
