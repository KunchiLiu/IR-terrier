	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial studies temozolomide, radiation therapy, and cediranib maleate to see how well they work compared with temozolomide, radiation therapy, and a placebo in treating patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma (a type of brain tumor). Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as temozolomide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Cediranib maleate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor. It is not yet known whether temozolomide and radiation therapy are more effective when given with or without cediranib maleate in treating glioblastoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Temozolomide and Radiation Therapy With or Without Cediranib Maleate in Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine if the addition of cediranib (cediranib maleate) to chemoradiation treatment enhances treatment efficacy as measured by the 6-month progression-free survival rate. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine if the addition of cediranib to chemoradiation treatment enhances treatment efficacy as measured by overall survival. II. To determine if the addition of cediranib to chemoradiation treatment enhances treatment efficacy as measured by progression-free survival. III. To determine if there is an association between tumor O6-methylguanine-deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methyltransferase (MGMT) gene methylation status and treatment response and outcome. IV. To compare and record the toxicities of the cediranib + chemoradiation arm versus the chemoradiation arm. V. To evaluate whether 6-month progression-free survival is associated with overall survival. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. ARM I: Patients receive cediranib maleate orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 3 days. Patients then undergo radiation therapy (intensity-modulated radiation therapy or 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy) QD, 5 days a week, for 6 weeks and receive temozolomide PO QD and cediranib maleate PO QD for 6 weeks. Patients then receive temozolomide PO QD alone on days 1-5. Treatment with temozolomide repeats every 28 days for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. ARM II: Patients receive placebo PO QD for 3 days. Patients then undergo radiation therapy (intensity-modulated radiation therapy or 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy) QD, 5 days a week, for 6 weeks and receive temozolomide PO QD and placebo PO QD for 6 weeks. Patients then receive temozolomide PO QD alone on days 1-5. Treatment with temozolomide repeats every 28 days for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year, every 4 months for 1 year, and then every 6 months thereafter.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically proven diagnosis of glioblastoma or gliosarcoma [World Health Organization (WHO) grade IV] confirmed by central review prior to step 2 registration Tumor tissue that is determined by central pathology review prior to step 2 registration to be of sufficient size for analysis of MGMT status Patients must have at least 1 block of tumor tissue; submission of 2 blocks is strongly encouraged Cavitron ultrasonic aspirator (CUSA)derived material is not allowed; fresh frozen tumor tissue acquisition is encouraged Diagnosis must be made by surgical excision, either partial or complete; stereotactic biopsy is not allowed because it will not provide sufficient tissue for MGMT analysis The tumor tissue must be sent as soon as possible to maximize the likelihood of eligibility; tumor tissue may not be submitted later than 28 days after the surgical procedure, because tissue analysis will not be able to be performed in time for treatment to commence by the mandatory 6week postsurgery outer limit; submission of tissue earlier than 28 days postsurgery is highly recommended The tumor must have a supratentorial component History/physical examination, including neurologic examination, within 14 days prior to step 2 registration The patient must have recovered from the effects of surgery, postoperative infection, and other complications before step 2 registration A diagnostic contrastenhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain must be performed preoperatively and postoperatively prior to step 1 registration; the postoperative scan must be performed within 28 days prior to step 1 registration Documentation of steroid doses/concurrent medications within 14 days prior to step 2 registration Karnofsky performance status &gt;= 70 within 14 days prior to step 2 registration Complete blood count (CBC)/differential obtained within 14 days prior to step 2 registration on study, with adequate bone marrow function defined as follows: Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;= 1,800 cells/mm^3 Platelets &gt;= 100,000 cells/mm^3 Hemoglobin &gt;=10.0 g/dl (Note: The use of transfusion or other intervention to achieve hemoglobin (Hgb) &gt;= 10.0 g/dl is acceptable) Adequate renal function, as defined below: Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) =&lt;
