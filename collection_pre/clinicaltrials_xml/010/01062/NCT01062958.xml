	<brief_summary>This study is a multi-site, retrospective chart review to determine the effect of Neevo® or Neevo®DHA (with higher folate and B12) versus standard prenatal vitamins on hemoglobin (Hgb) levels in pregnant women throughout the course of pregnancy. Neevo® is a prescription medical food indicated for the dietary management of women under a doctor's care who face high risk pregnancies, older overactive bladder (OB) patients and patients unable to fully metabolize folic acid. Data will be collected from existing patient charts of subjects administered Neevo® or Neevo®DHA daily compared to subjects administered a prenatal vitamin daily.</brief_summary>
