	<brief_summary>The study's objective is to measure changes in human visual cortex organization that may arise as a result of injury to the visual pathways. Subjects with retinal or cortical injury will be studied and compared to appropriate controls. Functional magnetic resonance imaging methods are used to monitor cortical topography in time. The main aims of the study are to determine: 1) what are the patterns of cortical reorganization that are seen spontaneously after injury, and 2) whether rehabilitative training can promote adaptive reorganization enhancing recovery.</brief_summary>
