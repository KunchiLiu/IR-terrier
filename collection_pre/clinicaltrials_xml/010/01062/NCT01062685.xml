	<brief_title>Near Infrared Spectroscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) can be utilized to measure tissue oxygenation, offering promise as a guide in the early treatment of severe sepsis; however, the role and utility of this technology is still evolving. Three distinct ways to measure StO2 have been proposed: 1) initial random spot-check measurements (StO2 initial); 2) minimum value over a 3-hour observation period (StO2 min); and, 3) changes in StO2 in response to an ischemic challenge (change in StO2 and StO2 slope). The purpose of this study is to assess the diagnostic ability of each of these parameters to predict morbidity, mortality, and resource utilization. This study will utilize the Hutchinson InSpectra StO2 tissue oxygenation monitor, which is FDA approved for use in monitoring patients during circulatory or perfusion examinations of skeletal muscle, or when there is a suspicion of compromised circulation.</detailed_description>
