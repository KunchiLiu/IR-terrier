Abnormal liver function tests: transaminases&gt;10 times upper limit of normal, Alkaline phosphatase&gt;5 times upper limit of normal, total bilirubin&gt;5 times upper limit of normal. History of allergies to echinocandins. Echinocandins are contraindicated for any reason. Volunteers unwilling to comply with study procedures. Suspected or documented systemic fungal infection.
