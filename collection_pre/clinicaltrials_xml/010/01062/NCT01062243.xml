	<brief_title>Brain Injury Inpatient Educational Intervention for Families and Caregivers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Brain Injury Inpatient Guide for Families and Caregivers (BIIG-FACS), developed by J. Niemeier and J. Kreutzer, is a comprehensive intervention to meet the needs of family members and significant others of patients who are undergoing acute brain injury rehabilitation. Program development was guided by considerable clinical experience, research review, and solicited consumer feedback. The intervention has been manualized to facilitate efficient and effective administration. Now, a rigorous investigation involving randomized assignment to treatment and control groups is needed to empirically examine outcomes. Helping family members to cope more effectively has the potential to improve outcomes for persons with ABI. Strengthening families can enable persons with ABI to live more independently, achieve greater community integration, and live healthier lives. The investigation serves as a logical next step forward in advancing our understanding of standardized interventions designed to serve the family unit.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Family members/caregiver friends of patients with ABI will be eligible to participate in the present investigation. ABI is defined as damage to brain tissue caused by stroke, aneurysm, anoxia, nonprogressive brain tumor, infection, or an external mechanical force as evidenced by: loss of consciousness, post traumatic amnesia (PTA), objective neurological findings, or skull fracture. Lacerations and/or bruises of the scalp or forehead without other criteria listed above will be excluded. All family member participants and patients must be at least 18 years of age or older and able to understand and provide consent (or assent in the case of the patients). Family members at imminent risk of psychiatric hospitalization, or in imminent danger of hurting themselves or others, as judged by the investigators, will be excluded from the study.</criteria>
