	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to implement a unique evidence-based intervention program to help military families deal with the critical issue of combat injury and its impact on current and future family health and functioning. The study is a randomized study. The study will compare the effects of the newly designed FOCUS-CI (Families OverComing Under Stress - Combat Injury) with the existing standard of care (SoC) at three military medical rehabilitation sites (Walter Reed Amry Medical Center, Brooke Army Medical Center and Madigan Army Medical Center) on key aspects of family health and functioning.</brief_summary>
