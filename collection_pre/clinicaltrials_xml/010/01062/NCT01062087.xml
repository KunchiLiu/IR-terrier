	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to attempt to determine retrospectively whether there was a statistically significant difference in patient need for postoperative narcotics between two different groups of women who received a laparoscopic tubal ligation. One group received a local anesthetic injection or gel at the surgical sites, in addition to general anesthesia. The other group did not receive any local anesthetic but did receive general anesthesia. The investigators hypothesize that the group that received the local anesthetic injection or gel had lower average postoperative narcotic requirements and shorter postoperative dismissal to home times than the group that did not receive the auxiliary local anesthetic.</brief_summary>
