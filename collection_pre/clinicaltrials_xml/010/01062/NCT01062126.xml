	<brief_summary>Pacemaker technology is constantly evolving. In the past 10 years, numerous advancements have been made in pacemaker therapy, diagnostics and connectivity. These advancements include automated capture, automated sensing, patient alert functions, algorithms minimizing ventricular pacing, automatic mode switching in response to atrial tachyarrhythmia, rate responsive pacing, advanced diagnostic features, remote monitoring and radiofrequency (RF) technology. However, little information is available on how these new features are being utilized by physicians in the real world and how these features impact patient outcomes. This observational study will gather data on the patients' presenting clinical status, indication for device implantation, utilization of advanced device features, device therapy choices, clinical management and outcomes in a general pacemaker population. The primary aim of the study is to evaluate the usage of advanced features and diagnostics in patients with St. Jude Medical pacemakers. The secondary aim of the study is to learn more about the progressive clinical outcomes in the general pacemaker patient population. The tertiary aim of the study is to evaluate the correlation between the usage of advanced features in pacemaker patients and the patient's clinical outcomes.</brief_summary>
