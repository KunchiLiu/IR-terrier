	<brief_summary>Intravenous lidocaine has been shown to have analgesic, antinflammatory, antihyperalgesic, antithrombotics and neuroprotective properties. In a previous study conducted in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy under general anesthesia with desflurane and fentanyl, intraoperative i.v. infusion of lidocaine spared opioids consumption in the recovery room by 30%. The purpose of this study was to determine if an i.v. infusion of lidocaine without intraoperative opioids would reduce the amount of fentanyl to the same extent and opioids-related side effects.</brief_summary>
