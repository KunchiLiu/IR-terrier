	<detailed_description>The Automated Telephone Nutrition Support (ATNS) study is a joint effort between the University of California at San Francisco, La Clinica de la Raza, and patients living with diabetes in Fruitvale (Oakland). Our goal is to see if motivated people with diabetes are able to get their blood sugar under better control by choosing a healthier diet. Since it's hard to eat a healthy diet, one of the ways we are trying to help is by calling people, having them record what they've eaten, and reminding them of the right foods to eat. The innovative part is using an automated telephone system to call them to have them record their dietary choices and giving them feedback immediately regarding what to modify as appropriate.</detailed_description>
