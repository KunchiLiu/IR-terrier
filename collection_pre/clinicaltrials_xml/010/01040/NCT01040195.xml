	<brief_summary>Till now no drug has been conclusively shown to affect the natural course of the inflammatory back ache in seronegative spondylarthropathies. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) have been the main stay of treatment for these diseases for long. Despite providing good pain relief, they are largely ineffective in altering the natural course of these diseases. However, very often, in spite of therapy, pain and discomfort continues in these patients with recurrent exacerbations. Other drugs have been tried in these patients. The DMARDS (Disease Modifying Anti Rheumatic Drugs) are a group of drugs which have come into prominence following their remarkable efficacy in the management of Rheumatoid Arthritis, another chronic inflammatory autoimmune arthritis. The major drugs which come in this group are Methotrexate, Sulfasalazine, Hydroxychloroquine and Leflunomide. Of these drugs, the most well studied drug in Spondylarthropathy is Sulfasalazine. Trials have shown variable results of response of spondyloarthropathy to sulfasalazine. The other major DMARD tried is methotrexate. Though large well controlled trials are lacking, the available data on its efficacy in spondyloarthropathy has not been favorable. Leflunomide, the other major DMARD has also fared poorly in a controlled trial in ankylosing spondylitis. There is at present inadequate data regarding the efficacy of Hydroxychloroquine. The discovery of anti TNF-α have been the major breakthrough in the management of ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and Spondyloarthropathies (SpA). These drugs, besides providing symptomatic improvement, also produce improvement in the indices of disease activity as Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) and the Assessment of Spondylo-Arthritis International Society (ASAS). Besides, the enormous cost, incurred at a rate of about Rs 700,000/- per annum, put it out of reach of the majority of affected population. Add to these is the increased risk of tuberculosis and fungal infections, a major problem in India. In this background there is severe and pressing need for alternate safe and effective drugs in the management of these diseases. It is here that the combination DMARD therapy assumes importance as a potential safe and cheaper alternative. We aim to assess the efficacy of combination DMARD therapy in patients with early inflammatory chronic backache in patients with sero negative spondyloarthropathies.</brief_summary>
