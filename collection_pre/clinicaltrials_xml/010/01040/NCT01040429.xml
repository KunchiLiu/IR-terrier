	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study IS to - explore the underlying pathophysiology of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) in adolescents, particularly focusing on genetics, infections/immunology, endocrinology, autonomic control and cognitions - to assess the effect of clonidine (a drug that attenuates sympathetic nervous activity) in adolescent CFS.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Persisting or constantly relapsing fatigue lasting 3 months or more. Functional disability resulting from fatigue to a degree that prevent normal school attendance Another disease process or current demanding life event that might explain the fatigue Another chronic disease (in particular pheochromocytoma, polyneuropathy, Renal insufficiency) Permanent use of pharmaceuticals (including hormone drugs) Permanently bedridden Positive pregnancy test Evidence of reduced cerebral and/or peripheral circulation due to vessel disease Know hypersensitivity towards clonidine or inert substances (lactose, sakkarose) in capsula Abnormal ECG (in particular bradyarrythmias due to sick sinus syndrome or AVblock. Isolated ectopic beats do not lead to exclusion) Supine heart rate &lt; 50 beats/min Supine systolic blood pressure &lt; 85 mmHg Systolic blood pressure fall upon standing &gt; 30 mmHg</criteria>
