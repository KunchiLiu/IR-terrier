	<brief_title>Very Long Term Results After Laparoscopic Retrocolic Antegastric Gastric Bypass</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There is lack of very-long term outcomes after bariatric surgery; A few series have been reported. However, most of them analyze medium-term outcomes. For RYGB, there are just two retrospective cohort studies reporting very long-term outcomes. Both studies have an open approach and a proximal Roux-en-Y configuration with different pouch orientation and size. MacLeanÂ´s series, with a better follow-up rate (83.4%), had a 67.6%EWL at a mean of 11.4 years; Failure rates were 20 and 35% for the morbidly obese and super obese, respectively. We will analyze our own series with a laparoscopic approach, vertically, lesser-curve base &lt; 10-15ml pouch and proximal Roux limb. The main end-points for our study are 1) Morbidity including status of specific biochemical markers &amp; Mortality, 2) Weight loss expressed as BMI or %EWL, 3) Trends in major comorbidities and 4) Assessment of Quality of Life.</detailed_description>
