	<brief_summary>Fall risk is increased in people with diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) and yet, minimal research has been conducted to identify appropriate fall risk assessment tools and improve our understanding of falls in these individuals. Purpose: The primary purpose of this study is to establish a foundation of knowledge needed to address falls in people with DPN. This will be accomplished through 1) comparing the validity of 4 fall risk assessment tools, 2) identifying risk factors for falls and 3) determining how quality of life is influenced by factors related to falls in people with DPN.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>All subjects participate in testing that involves questionnaires, cognitive testing, fall risk assessment, and other testing related to physical parameters including body mass index, glycosylated hemoglobin, lower extremity nerve conduction study, and ankle range of motion, proprioception and strength. After testing, subjects are interviewed to determine fall status (faller or non-faller). A "faller" is defined as someone that has fallen at least 2 times in the past year. Data Analysis: The validity of the fall risk assessment tools will be compared using sensitivity and specificity analyses. Variables related to ankle function, neuropathy, glycemic control and general activity will be analyzed for association with recent fall history through multivariable logistic regression. Variables related to falls, neuropathy and activity level will be analyzed for association with health-related quality of life through multivariable linear regression.</detailed_description>
