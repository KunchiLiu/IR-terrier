	<brief_title>Bilateral Dual TAP Block: Description of a Novel Four-point Approach</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective cohort study is designed to describe a novel ultrasound-guided bilateral dual transversus abdominis plane (BD-TAP) block and to evaluate the postoperative analgesic efficacy in a selection of patients having undergone major abdominal surgery under general anaesthesia where neuraxial anaesthesia and/or intravenous administration of analgesics had failed or was unwanted by the patient, or if the placement of an epidural catheter was deemed impossible by the anaesthetist in charge. 30 consecutive patients planned for the study. BD-TAP to be performed bilaterally with a high frequency linear ultrasound probe, with bupivacaine. Success rate, decline in VAS score, postoperative demand of opioids and block performance time to be recorded.</detailed_description>
