	<brief_summary>PCI has been one of the most common choice of treatments for patients with coronary artery disease, and studies indicated that intensive statin treatment before PCI could reduce adverse events as comparing to the placebo. In China, statin with regular dose is currently applied to the patients admitted for Non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Here we hypothesize that intensive statin treatment with arovastatin before PCI could further reduce clinical adverse events.</brief_summary>
