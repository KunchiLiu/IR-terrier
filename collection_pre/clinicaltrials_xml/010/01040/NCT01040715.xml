	<brief_summary>The objective of this trial is to demonstrate that active immunization with anti-TNFα kinoid (TNF-K) is able to induce polyclonal anti-TNFα antibodies in RA patients who were previously treated with anti-TNFα mAb but have lost susceptibility to therapy.</brief_summary>

A washout period before the first administration of the study product of at least ten weeks since the last administration of certolizumab or golimumab; at least eigth weeks since the last administration of infliximab; at least four weeks since the last administration of adalimumab or etanercept History of positive response defined as an ACR20 or DAS 28 decrease ≥ 1.2 or by the investigator opinion with previous TNFα antagonist treatment. Secondary treatment failure to maximum one previous TNFα antagonist treatment as defined by: Investigator opinion. OR DAS28 increase ≥ 0.6 during the last six months. OR Decrease in European League Against Rheumatoid (EULAR) score. Written informed consent . Treatment with nonbiological DMARDs within four weeks prior to first study product administration. MTX is allowed provided it is administered at as table dosage &lt; ou = 20 mg/week since at least 4 weeks. Treatment with any rheumatoid arthritis biological therapy other than TNFα antagonists at any time prior to first study product administration. Administration of high doses of intraarticular corticosteroids for the treatment of an acute monoarthritis (eg knee) within 3 months prior to first study product administration. High dose of corticosteroids is defined as &gt; 50 mg triamcinolone or equivalent. History of documented severe bacterial infection within 28 days prior to first immunization History of primary resistance or intolerance to any TNFα antagonist. History of or current congestive heart failure, controlled or not. Corticosteroids (prednisone or equivalent, &lt; ou = 10 mg per day) are allowed if they are administered at stable dosage since at lesat 4 weeks prior to the first immunization. Inhaled and topical steroids are allowed. Known history of tuberculosis (TB). Suspicion of TB at chest Xrays at screening or within three months prior to first administration of study product. Suspicion of latent or active tuberculosis as defined by : Positive Mantoux/Purified Protein Derivative (PPD)test (&gt; ou = 5mm induration measured 48 to 72 hours after intradermal injection of tuberculin) at screening or within 30 days prior to first administration of study product. and/or positive interferonγ (IFN γ) TB diagnostic test (as measured by the ELISpot method) at screening or within three months prior to first administration of study product. Positive for HIV, HCV or HBV including HBsAg and antiHBc antibodies. Use of any investigational or nonregistered product (drug or vaccine).
