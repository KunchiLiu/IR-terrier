Subjects that began to take anticonvulsants, antihistamines, antidepressants, sedatives, tranquilizers, antiinflammatory drugs, or daily analgesics within one month prior to the start of the study or who have to start taking these during the course of the study. Participation in a desensitizing dentifrice study or regular use of a desensitizing dentifrice within the past three months. Current participation in any other clinical study.
