	<brief_summary>Orthopedic surgery is reportedly among the most painful surgical procedures. Surgical damage following major orthopedic surgery often involves a large, deep incision with considerable tissue dissection and muscle, bone, and vascular exposure. Post-operative pain after such surgery is exacerbated on movement or by reflex spasms of the muscles, which may delay mobilization, reduce satisfaction, prolong hospitalization, and possibly increase medical costs. We design a prospective randomized study for postoperative pain control following total hip arthroplasty.</brief_summary>
