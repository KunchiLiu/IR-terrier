	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to explore the association between the genetic polymorphisms of estrogen-related genes, including estrogen synthesis, metabolizing, and receptor genes, and ischemic stroke. Furthermore, independent and joint effects of traditional risk factors and estrogen related genes on risk of stroke in young adults will also be examined in this study.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cerebrovascular diseases are the third leading cause of death in Taiwan in 2007. It is also the most important reason for disability among elderly adults. Sex hormones are well reported to be associated with cardiovascular disease risk. Several studies showed that estrogens have been shown to have beneficial effects on the cardiovascular system via favorable effects on anti-inflammatory effects. Genetic polymorphisms of estrogen related genes are speculated to influence estrogen level and will count for human susceptible to risk of stroke in young adults. In addition, several studies showed that the decrease in estrogen-induced vascular inflammatory markers including adhesion molecules and chemokines might be the mechanism for vascular protection. Recently, a novel and unique mechanisms for 17β-Estradiol (E2) anti-inflammatory activity which is E2 prevents inflammatory gene transcription induced by inflammatory agents by inhibiting NF-κB intracellular transport was found. Therefore, we proposed a study to explore the association between the genetic polymorphisms of estrogen-related genes, including estrogen synthesis, metabolizing, receptor genes, and NF-κB and ischemic stroke in young adults.</detailed_description>
