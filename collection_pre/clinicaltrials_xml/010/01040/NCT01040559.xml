	<brief_title>Chemoembolisation of Non Resectable, Non Metastatic Hepatocellular Carcinomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common malignancy and the third most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Most of the patients are diagnosed at intermediate-advanced stage when the sole standard treatment is transarterial chemoembolization (TACE). In the literature, survival rates in TACE studies vary widely and finally, there is no suggestion for the best chemotherapeutic agent or the optimal treatment regimen. We hypothesise that the use of idarubicin (the most cytotoxic drug on HCC cell lines) in DC Bead would enhance the efficacy of TACE. The primary objective of the study is to determine the maximal tolerated dose of idarubicin in DC Bead for chemoembolization of non resectable non metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma.</detailed_description>
