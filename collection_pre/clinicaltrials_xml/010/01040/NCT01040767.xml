	<brief_summary>Study Objective: Training physicians in new skills via classroom-based teaching has inherent costs and time constraints. We sought to evaluate whether web-based didactics result in similar knowledge improvement and retention of basic ultrasound principles and the EFAST (Extended Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma) compared with the traditional method. Methods: Physicians from two German emergency departments were randomized into a classroom group with traditional lectures and a web group that watched narrated lectures online. All participants completed a pre- and post-test, and a second post-test eight weeks later. Both groups underwent hands-on training after the first post-test. A control group completed the two initial tests without didactic intervention.</brief_summary>
