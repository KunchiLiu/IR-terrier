	<brief_title>Ultrasound Guided Aspiration of Hydrosalpingeal Fluid and IVF-ET Outcomes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A Cochrane review of prospective randomized trials of laparoscopic salpingectomy confirmed the beneficial effect of laparoscopic salpingectomy on IVF ET outcomes in patients with hydrosalpinges. Surgery is not usually safe especially in patients with extensive adhesions, morbid obesity and previous multiple laparotomies. Other less invasive options for patients with hydrosalpinges as ultrasound guided aspiration of hydrosalpingeal fluid, antibiotics and hysteroscopic occlusion of fallopian tube were studied in order to find an alternative to salpingectomy. Although these methods are simple and getting popular,current data are inadequate to recommend these treatment options instead of salpingectomy. The aim of this study is to determine whether the ultrasound guided aspiration of hydrosalpingeal fluid at the time of oocyte retrieval can improve the outcomes of IVF-ET .</detailed_description>
