	<brief_summary>The study hypothesis is that 6 weeks of repetitive handgrip exercise will improve endothelial function and venous compliance in pre-dialysis patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of less than or equal to 20 ml/min. If proven correct then arm exercise might be useful to improve the success rate for a surgically created arteriovenous fistula in the forearm to become usable as a vascular access for hemodialysis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Exercise on Endothelial Function and Vascular Compliance in Chronic Kidney Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is the optimal vascular access for chronic hemodialysis. However, AVFs frequently fail to mature. Better strategies are needed to promote AVF maturation. Successful AVF maturation involves arterial and venous dilation. Arterial dilation depends on endothelial release of nitric oxide which can be measured by brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD) and has been reported to predict successful AVF maturation. Venous dilation depends on venous compliance which can be measured by venous plethysmography and is also predictive of successful AVF maturation. Endothelial function is impaired in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Aerobic exercise has been reported to improve endothelial function and venous compliance but it has not been studied in the pre-dialysis patient. To address this question we will determine whether 6 weeks of repetitive handgrip exercise with upper arm venous compression can improve brachial artery endothelial function or venous compliance in pre-dialysis patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of less than or equal to 20 ml/min.</detailed_description>
