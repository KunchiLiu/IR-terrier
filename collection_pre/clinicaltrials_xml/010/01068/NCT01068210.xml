	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is look at the effects of different modalities of exercise training and its effect on post-surgical lung cancer patients. Subjects will take part in a 16 week training intervention that can consist of aerobic, resistance, aerobic &amp; resistance, or a control group. Pre and Post testing will include stress tests, echos, blood, and urine samples.</brief_summary>

Able to complete an acceptable baseline CPET in the absence of high risk ECG findings or other inappropriate response to exercise as determined by the investigator. Ability to achieve and complete an acceptable baseline onerepetition maximum muscular strength test as defined by the effective execution of protocolspecific joint and muscle ranges of motion without remarkable signs or symptoms of pain, discomfort or distress. Presence of a concurrent, actively treated other malignancy, or history of other malignancy treated within the past 3 years (other than nonmelanoma skin cancer); Presence of metastatic disease; Room air desaturation at rest ≤ 85%; Mental impairment leading to inability to cooperate.
