	<brief_title>Rosuvastatin in Visceral Adiposity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The accumulation of intra-abdominal fat has been suggested to be of primary importance in the development of the metabolic syndrome and associated metabolic disturbances and it has been hypothesized that a selective reduction of visceral fat tissue would improve the symptoms of the metabolic syndrome. Treatment with statins decrease levels of LDL-cholesterol and reduce coronary artery disease (CAD) events. Although it is widely accepted that the majority of benefit obtained with statins is a direct result of their lipid-lowering properties, they also demonstrate additional cholesterol-independent or pleiotropic effects. The results of experimental studies have now shown that statins decrease fat mass in the visceral region in an animal model. In the present study, we will investigate whether statins can decrease visceral obesity in humans.</detailed_description>

Strong clinical indication for statin treatment In the Principal Investigator's opinion, the patient has other clinically significant cardiac, oncologic, neurologic or psychiatric disease that could be adversely affected by Study participation. For any reason the patient is considered by the Principal Investigator to be an unsuitable candidate to participate in the Study.</criteria>
