	<brief_summary>This study looks at global gene expression in pterygium and found the derangement of matrix genes in particular to be a feature of pterygium. In the investigators opinion, it would be more beneficial to elicit changes in gene expression before the recurrence of pterygium and by developing a panel of biomarkers that are associated with pterygium recurrence; one would be able to predict the post surgical prognosis of patients after resection.Biomarker levels will be compared to discover a biomarker panel for prediction of recurrence.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Risk Factors and Biomarkers Associated With Recurrence After Excision of Primary Pterygium</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A comprehensive questionnaire will be used to evaluate the environmental, biological, physical and behavioral risk factors of associated with the recurrence after pterygium excision. Slit lamp digital color photographs will be taken on primary and recurrent pterygium and pterygium will be graded in three levels of severity, based on relative transparency of pterygium tissue; grade 1 (transparent), grade 2 (intermediate), and grade 3 (opaque) to see whether the risk factors correlate to the morphology of the pterygium. Tear samples will be collected before surgery using schirmers strip.Proteins in tear samples will be analyzed using the iTRAQ method. The transcriptional differences in pterygium and conjunctival tissue samples will be analyzed using western blot, qPCR and immunohistochemistry assays.</detailed_description>
