	<brief_summary>Randomized trial comparing lumbar plexus catheter versus femoral nerve catheter (single-shot femoral block as control group) for postoperative pain control after anterior cruciate ligament repair in children (age 11-21). Primary outcome is pain scores for the first 72 hours. Secondary outcomes include opioid consumption, incidence of opioid side effects and quality of recovery (previously validated scale). Our hypothesis is that lumbar plexus catheter will provide superior pain control and overall quality of recovery compared to femoral nerve catheters.</brief_summary>
