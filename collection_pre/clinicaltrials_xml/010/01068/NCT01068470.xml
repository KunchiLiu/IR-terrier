	<brief_summary>Therapy with Interleukin-2 stimulates lymphocytes in humans to become Lymphokine-activated Killer cells (LAK). This study will determine if these killer cells are able to kill certain standard cell-lines in the laboratory.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Determining the Lymphokine Activated Killer (LAK) Cytotoxicity Present in Patients Undergoing Interleukin-2 Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Blood samples will be taken from patients undergoing outpatient Interleukin-2 therapy to measure the LAK cytotoxicity at baseline, after 1 cycle of therapy and 2 months later. The LAK cytotoxicity assay will be a standard colorimetric assay that measures lactic dehydrogenase release from lysed cells.</detailed_description>
