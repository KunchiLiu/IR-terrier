	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare two cushioning materials (a gel mattress and an egg-crate foam mattress) placed beneath patients undergoing gynecologic surgery to prevent patients from sliding toward the head of the bed during head-down positioning. Our hypothesis is that the two materials will be equally good at preventing slide on the table and that slide will be less than 5 cm (&lt;2 inches) on average.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trendelenburg's Slide Prevention Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patient undergoing laparoscopic gynecologic surgery are often placed in steep (30 to 45 degrees) Trendelenburg's (head lower than feet) position. This helps the bowels to move towards the patient's head, making surgery in the pelvis safer. During surgery, if patients slide a great deal toward the head of the bed, nerve injury and hernia risk may be increased. Several techniques are in use to prevent patients from sliding on the bed during surgery, and of these, increasing the friction between a patient's skin and the bed surface appears to be the safest technique. Two materials are in use to increase this friction: a gel pad or an egg-crate foam mattress upon which the patient lies with bare skin. This study is comparing these two materials to see which material is associated with the LEAST amount of patient slide. Our hypothesis is that the two materials will be equally good at preventing slide on the table and that slide will be less than 5 cm (&lt;2 inches) on average.</detailed_description>
