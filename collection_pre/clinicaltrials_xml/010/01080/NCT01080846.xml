	<brief_title>Fever After Misoprostol Administration for the Treatment of Primary Postpartum Hemorrhage</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study purpose is to confirm whether a lower, 600 mcg dose of sublingual misoprostol will reduce the incidence of elevated body temperature (≥40°C) associated with misoprostol. The study will compare the incidence of high fevers following treatment with 600 mcg sublingual misoprostol to previously documented rates using 800 mcg sublingual misoprostol. An additional line of research is to investigate whether some women are more susceptible to experiencing high fevers following misoprostol administration, and whether genetic factors are responsible for misoprostol-induced fevers.</detailed_description>
