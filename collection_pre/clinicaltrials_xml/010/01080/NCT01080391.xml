	<brief_title>Phase 3 Study Comparing Carfilzomib, Lenalidomide, and Dexamethasone (CRd) vs Lenalidomide and Dexamethasone (Rd) in Subjects With Relapsed Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase 3, randomized, open-label, multicenter study comparing two treatment regimens for subjects with relapsed multiple myeloma. Eligible subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either the control Rd or CRd. Randomization will be stratified by β2 microglobulin levels (&lt; vs ≥ 2.5 mg/L), prior bortezomib (no vs yes), and prior lenalidomide (no vs yes). Subjects will receive the treatment determined by randomization in 28-day cycles until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity (whichever occurs first). The primary endpoint of this Phase 3 study is progression-free survival.</detailed_description>

Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1.0 × 10^9/L within 21 days prior to randomization 11. Hemoglobin ≥ 8 g/dL (80 g/L) within 21 days prior to randomization 12. Platelet count ≥ 50 × 10^9/L (≥ 30 × 10^9/L if myeloma involvement in the bone marrow is &gt; 50%) within 21 days prior to randomization 13.

If previously treated with bortezomib (alone or in combination), progression during treatment 2. If previously treated with a lenalidomide and dexamethasone (len/dex) combination: Progression during the first 3 months of initiating treatment Any progression during treatment if the len/dex combination was the subject's most recent line of therapy 3. Discontinuation of previous lenalidomide or dexamethasone due to intolerance; subjects intolerant to bortezomib are not excluded 4. Prior carfilzomib treatment 5. POEMS syndrome (polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal protein, and skin changes) 6. Waldenström's macroglobulinemia or IgM myeloma 7.

Radiotherapy to multiple sites or immunotherapy/antibody therapy within 28 days prior to randomization; localized radiotherapy to a single site within 7 days prior to randomization 10. Corticosteroid therapy at a dose equivalent to dexamethasone &gt; 4 mg/day within 21 days prior to randomization 11. Pregnant or lactating females 12.

Significant neuropathy (Grades 34, or Grade 2 with pain) within 14 days prior to randomization 20. Known history of allergy to Captisol® (a cyclodextrin derivative used to solubilize carfilzomib) 21. Contraindication to any of the required concomitant drugs or supportive treatments, including hypersensitivity to all anticoagulation and antiplatelet options, antiviral drugs, or intolerance to hydration due to preexisting pulmonary or cardiac impairment 22. Ongoing graftvshost disease 23. Subjects with pleural effusions requiring thoracentesis or ascites requiring paracentesis within 14 days prior to randomization 24. Any other clinically significant medical disease or condition that, in the Investigator's opinion, may interfere with protocol adherence or a subject's ability to give informed consent</criteria>
