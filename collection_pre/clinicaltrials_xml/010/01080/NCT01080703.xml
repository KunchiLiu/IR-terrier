	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if a lower extremity strengthening program as part of pulmonary rehabilitation will improve quadriceps muscle strength, endurance and functional status as well as overall quality of life. Hypothesis: 1. Lower extremity resistance training as part of a pulmonary rehabilitation program will improve quadriceps strength, endurance and functional capacity. 2. Lower extremity resistance training as part of a pulmonary rehabilitation program will improve quality of life in patients awaiting lung transplant.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objectives: 1. To determine if a lower extremity strengthening program as part of pulmonary rehabilitation is effective at increasing quadriceps strength when measured with a hand held dynamometer. 2. To determine the effectiveness of a lower extremity strengthening program as part of pulmonary rehabilitation for improving endurance and functional capacity as measured by the six minute walk test. 3. To determine if the lower extremity strengthening program as part of pulmonary rehabilitation improves overall quality of life as measured by the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire. 4. To provide a basic framework for a larger randomized control study evaluating if a lower extremity strengthening program as part of a pulmonary rehabilitation program is more effective than a pulmonary rehabilitation program alone at improving quadriceps strength, endurance, and functional level.</detailed_description>
