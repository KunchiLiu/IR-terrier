	<brief_summary>All patients eligible for TIPS (Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt) procedure will be considered for inclusion. After written inform consent, psychometric tests in order to calculate the psychometric hepatic encephalopathy (PHES) score, the gold standard for the diagnosis of minimal encephalopathy and critical flicker frequency (CFF) will be performed before the TIPS procedure. After TIPS, patients will be followed during one year and the psychometric test and CFF will be performed every 3 months. 30 patients will be included. The main endpoint is the success rate of CFF. The secondary end points are - Correlation between CFF and PHES score - Performance of CFF and PHES score to predict the occurrence of overt encephalopathy after TIPS procedure - A sample collection during TIPS procedure is also performed for validation of biomarkers</brief_summary>
