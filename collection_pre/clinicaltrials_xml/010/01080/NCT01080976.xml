	<brief_summary>Abstract Diabetes behavior can be influenced by patients exploring diabetes topics that may lack scientific credibility. The question this study examines is whether a Google or Health on the Net (HON) internet search, presents websites that would incline a more or less likely recommendation to patients ? A preliminary trial suggests that referrers recommend websites based on rules that may prioritize website source over content. This study will qualitatively assess the rules that participants use in deciding which websites are more suitable than others. Method The investigators will inject a diabetes related search term into a HON and a Google search engine. The top 5 mutually exclusive websites from each search engine will be presented to 5 people from three groups stratified across endocrinologists, informaticians and PCPs. Participants will rank the websites and then identify the rules that they applied to reach their decision.</brief_summary>
