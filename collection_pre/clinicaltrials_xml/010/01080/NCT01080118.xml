	<brief_summary>The use of the video laryngoscope to teach laryngoscopy will improve the performance of tracheal intubation done by novices because it will allow a shared view of the airway leading to a better feedback from the trainer to the trainee.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effectiveness of Video System in Improving Learning of Tracheal Intubation Using Standard Laryngoscopy Among Novices</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A group of 30 fourth year medical students and interns rotating through the department of anesthesiology will be studied. Firstly, a standard lecture will be provided in which the description and importance of laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation will be explained. This will include descriptions of anatomy, relevant equipment and technique of tracheal intubation. Following the lecture , the students will be randomly allocated using sealed envelopes into two groups : a control group ( taught with a standard Macintosh Laryngoscope ) and a study group ( taught with the Airtraq video laryngoscope).Each group will receive a demonstration and verbal instruction on how to perform laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation by their instructor.</detailed_description>
