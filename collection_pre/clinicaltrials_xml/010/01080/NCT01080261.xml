	<brief_summary>A non-randomized, small vessel (SV) trial at approximately 15 sites in Japan to enroll 60 patients with a de novo lesion ≤28 mm in length (by visual estimate) in a native coronary artery ≥2.25 mm to &lt;2.50 mm in diameter (by visual estimate). Approximately thirty patients will be randomly assigned to the angiographic subset to also undergo angiographic assessment after the 12-month clinical follow-up.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patient must be at least 20 years of age Patient understands the study requirements and the treatment procedures and provides written informed consent before any studyspecific tests or procedures are performed Patient is eligible for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with regards to the target lesion Patient is considered suitable for PCI if any of the following criteria meet. Evidence of ischemia documented with stress electrocardiogram (ECG) and/or any diagnostic imaging tests. Target vessel supplies blood to relatively large area of the myocardium. Target lesion is a possible culprit of angina. Target vessel is a potential collateral source for other major vessels Patient has documented stable angina pectoris or documented silent ischemia; or unstable angina pectoris Patient is an acceptable candidate for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) Patient has a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥30% as measured within 30 days prior to enrollment Patient is willing to comply with all protocolrequired followup evaluation Patient has clinical symptoms and/or ECG changes consistent with acute myocardial infarction (MI) Patient has had a known diagnosis of recent MI (i.e., within 72 hours prior to the index procedure) and has elevated enzymes at the time of the index procedure as follows. Patients are excluded if any of the following criteria are met at the time of the index procedure. If creatine kinasemyoglobin band (CKMB) is &gt;2× upper limit of normal (ULN), the patient is excluded regardless of the CK Total. If CK MB is 1 2× ULN, the patient is excluded if the CK Total is &gt;2× ULN. If CK Total/CK MB are not used and Troponin is, patients are excluded if the following criterion is met at the time of the index procedure. Troponin &gt;1× ULN with at least one of the following. Patient has ischemic symptoms and ECG changes indicative of ongoing ischemia (e.g., &gt;1 mm ST segment elevation or depression in consecutive leads or new left bundle branch block [LBBB]); Development of pathological Q waves in the ECG; or Imaging evidence of new loss of viable myocardium or new regional wall motion abnormality. Note: For patients with unstable angina or patients who have had a recent MI, CK Total/CK MB (or Troponin if CK Total/CK MB are not used) must be documented prior to enrolling the patient. Patient has received an organ transplant or is on a waiting list for an organ transplant Patient is receiving or scheduled to receive chemotherapy within 30 days before or after the index procedure Patient is receiving oral or intravenous immunosuppressive therapy (inhaled steroids are not excluded) or has known lifelimiting immunosuppressive or autoimmune disease (e.g., human immunodeficiency virus, systemic lupus erythematosus, but not including diabetes mellitus) Patient is receiving chronic (≥72 hours) anticoagulation therapy (e.g., heparin, warfarin) for indications other than acute coronary syndrome Patient has a platelet count &lt;100,000 cells/mm^3 or &gt;700,000 cells/mm^3 Patient has a white blood cell (WBC) count &lt;3,000 cells/mm^3 Patient has documented or suspected liver disease, including laboratory evidence of hepatitis Patient is on dialysis or has known renal insufficiency (i.e., Creatinine &gt; 2.0 mg/dl or &gt;150 μmol/L) Patient has a history of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy or will refuse blood transfusions Patient has had a cerebrovascular accident (CVA) or transient ischemic attack (TIA) within the past 6 months, or has any permanent neurologic defect that may cause noncompliance with the protocol Target vessel or side branch has been treated with any type of PCI (e.g., balloon angioplasty, stent, cutting balloon, atherectomy) within 12 months prior to the index procedure (excluding PCI of the nontarget lesion within the target vessel treated during the index procedure (Refer to Multiple Interventions During Index Procedure)) Target vessel has been treated within 10 mm proximal or distal to the target lesion (by visual estimate) with any type of PCI (e.g., balloon angioplasty, stent, cutting balloon, atherectomy) at any time prior to the index procedure Nontarget vessel or side branch has been treated with any type of PCI (e.g., balloon angioplasty, stent, cutting balloon, atherectomy) within 24 hours prior to the index procedure Planned or actual target vessel treatment with an unapproved device, directional or rotational coronary atherectomy, laser, cutting balloon, or transluminal extraction catheter immediately prior to stent placement Planned PCI or CABG after the index procedure Patient previously treated at any time with coronary intravascular brachytherapy Patient has a known allergy to the study stent system or protocolrequired concomitant medications (e.g., stainless steel, platinum, chromium, nickel, tungsten, acrylic, fluoropolymers, everolimus, thienopyridines, aspirin, contrast) that cannot be adequately premedicated Patient has an active peptic ulcer or active gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding Patient has one of the following. Other serious medical illness (e.g., cancer, congestive heart failure) that may reduce life expectancy to less than 24 months Current problems with substance abuse (e.g., alcohol, cocaine, heroin, etc.) Planned procedure that may cause noncompliance with the protocol or confound data interpretation Patient is participating in another investigational drug or device clinical trial that has not reached its primary endpoint Patient intends to participate in another investigational drug or device clinical trial within 12 months after the index procedure Patient with known intention to procreate within 12 months after the index procedure (Women of childbearing potential who are sexually active must agree to use a reliable method of contraception from the time of screening through 12 months after the index procedure.) Patient is a woman who is pregnant or nursing (A pregnancy test must be performed within 7 days prior to the index procedure in women of childbearing potential.) Patient has more than 1 target lesion and 1 nontarget lesion, which will be treated during the index procedure</criteria>
