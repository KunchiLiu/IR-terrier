	<criteria>• Positive clinical findings for distal subungual onychomycosis as determined by clinical examination Must have a great toenail involvement with onychomycosis in ≥25≤65% of the visible nail. (more than one nail maybe affected however only the index great toenail will be evaluated) Nail plate must be ≤ 3 mm thick. Must have a positive KOH and positive identification of a Dermatophyte via culture. Written informed consent must be obtained from the subject.

Must agree to take measures to avoid pregnancy during the study period Must agree to avoid the use of oral or topical antifungals unless provided by the investigator for the relief of symptomatic (active clinical signs) tinea pedis which has occurred during the treatment / follow up phase of the study. (The treatment provided will be Lotrimin®). • The presence of proximal subungual onychomycosis or white superficial onychomycosis Fungal involvement of the lunula or less than 2 mm of clear nail from the the proximal nail fold Subjects with psoriasis, eczema, symptomatic (with active clinical signs) interdigital or plantar tinea pedis, lichen planus, or other abnormalities (e.g. traumatized or dystrophic nails) that could result in a clinically abnormal nail or the investigator thinks the current condition will compromise the integrity of the trial Any presence of dermatophytoma or onychomycotic spikes Subjects with either uncontrolled diabetes mellitus or known diabetics on pharmaceutical therapy or those with no palpable pedal pulse Subjects with peripheral vascular disease Subjects who are immunosuppressed those on chronic corticosteroid therapy (see below), with solid organ or bone marrow transplantation, cytotoxic chemotherapy within the previous 12 months (or planned within the next 12 months), or HIV infection. Use of topical antifungals e.g. (clotrimazole, ketoconazole, miconazole, oxiconazole (Oxistat®, Glaxo Smith Kline), sulconazole, naftifine (Naftin®, Merz), terconazole, econazole nitrate (Spectazole®, OrthoMcNeil), butoconazole ,Fluconazole, tolnaftate, haloprogin), ZeasorbAF Ciclopirox (e.g. Penlac® Nail Lacquer, SanofiAventis) and corticosteroids (e.g. hydrocortisone, betamethasone, fluticasone and mometasone) in the preceding 15 days of Day 1, on or immediately around the area under evaluation. Use of systemic corticosteroids within 30 days preceding Day 1 Use of systemic antifungals in the preceding 120 days of Day 1 including (terbinafine (Lamisil®, Novartis), Itraconazole (Sporanox®, Janssen), fluconazole (Diflucan®, Pfizer), ketoconazole, miconazole, griseofulvin (GrisPEG®, Pedinol), butoconazole, terconazole, potassium iodide,.
