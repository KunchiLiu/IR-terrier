	<brief_title>Substudy of Change in Cardiometabolic Disease (CMD) Risk Factors During an Interactive Fitness Program</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Childhood obesity is increasingly common and is predictive of adult type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Recent pediatric studies suggest exercise reduces cardiometabolic risk factors. Despite evidence of its benefits, exercise training prescribed by pediatricians is traditionally vague, developmentally inappropriate, and/or fraught with psychological, financial and practical barriers. There has been recent interest in the use of interactive technologies, also termed "exer-gaming" as a way to translate known positive benefits of exercise into increased physical activity in youth. Initial adult studies demonstrate benefits, yet there are few studies of exer-gaming involving children at increased CVD risk. This project involves a partnership between Children's Hospital Boston and the GoKids Boston Youth Fitness Research and Training Center at UMass Boston, featuring an interdisciplinary team of researchers and clinicians from pediatric cardiology, prevention, nursing, exercise physiology, and behavior change. Participants are eligible for this substudy based on enrollment in a pilot project evaluating the effects of a state-of-the-art exercise training facility incorporating the latest technology-based exercise games ("exer-games") in Boston Public School elementary children. Effects on CVD risk factor levels including lipids, blood pressure, body composition vascular reactivity, insulin resistance pre and post intervention will be compared to an Advice-Only condition and correlated with activity level. Eligible participants will be identified as part of the baseline measurements of that study and will be offered the chance to participate in the CHB Sub-Study, a two visit observational design.</detailed_description>
