	<brief_title>Coronary Flow Reserve in Patients With Bio-active Stent or Everolimus-eluting Stent Implanted in Acute Coronary Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective: The aim of the trial is to assess coronary artery reactivity using adenosine-induced coronary flow reserve (CFR) by transthoracic echocardiography in patients with Bio-active stent (BAS) and Everolimus-eluting stent (EES) distal to the original culprit lesion at 6-8 months. Design: BASE-CFR is a substudy of the larger randomized multicenter BASE-ACS trial comparing bio-active Titan stent to everolimus-eluting stent in patients with acute coronary syndrome. CFR assessment will be performed at 6-8 months after stent implantation at the same time with OCT assessment. In-stent restenosis will be ruled out using OCT. Primary endpoint: CFR at 6-8 months after stent implantation. Secondary endpoint: Coronary flow velocity at baseline and during adenosine-induced hyperemia 6-8 months after stent implantation.. Association of CFR to unendotheliazed stent struts and stent malapposition. Enrollment: 40 patients (20 receiving BAS and 20 receiving EES). Clinical site: Satakunta Central Hospital, Finland Turku University Hospital, Finland</detailed_description>
