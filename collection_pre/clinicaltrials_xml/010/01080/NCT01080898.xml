	<brief_summary>Determination of the sensitivity and specificity of different combinations of imaging techniques (spectral domain optical coherence tomography, fundus photography and fluorescein angiography) used for the diagnosis of choroidal neovessels complicating age -related macular degeneration. This information will help to determine the choice of the most suitable combination for the above diagnosis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of Optical Coherence Tomography.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The following combinations will be studied: spectral domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) + fundus photography; fluorescein angiography + fundus photography and the combination of all three techniques (OCT+ fundus photography + fluorescein angiography).The sensitivity and specificity of the latter combination will be assessed by comparison with the results for this combination reported by several readers. Inter- and intra-observer reproducibility of the different combinations will also be studied.</detailed_description>
