	<brief_summary>EMD Serono decided to terminate enrollment based on a review of the available clinical data and low probability of completing the trial based on the observed recruitment rate. Subjects already enrolled in the study continued participation in the study, consistent with the protocol, to study completion.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase I, Dose-escalation Study of AS703569 Given Orally to Subjects With Haematological Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal of this research study is to investigate for the first time the safety and tolerability of a new drug (AS703569), called an aurora kinase inhibitor, being tested to treat blood cancers in patients with different blood cancers. The research study will also assess how the body breaks down AS703569 and what changes occur in the blood after oral doses of AS703569. It will also look to see if there is any improvement in your blood cancer. The use of AS703569 in this study is experimental.</detailed_description>

Chemotherapy, immunotherapy, biologic therapy or any experimental anticancer therapy within 28days prior to study Day1 and/or not having recovered from its toxicity. Extensive radiotherapy involving ≥30% of bone marrow (e.g. whole pelvis, half spine) within 6months prior to study Day1. Active CNS disease involvement. Any condition, including laboratory, medical history or prestudy assessment findings, that in the opinion of the Investigator, constitute a risk or contraindication for participation or that could interfere with the study objectives, conduct or evaluation of a drug to be taken orally.
