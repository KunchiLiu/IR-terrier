	<detailed_description>The pediatric primary care setting is a relatively untapped resource for addressing obesity prevention. The goals of this developmental study are to develop and evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a primary care-based, preschool obesity prevention intervention integrating pediatrician counseling and a home-based program for parents of 2-4 year old children at risk for obesity. We propose to recruit 60 parent-child dyads from families of 2-4 year old at risk children (e.g., BMI between the 85th and 95th percentile for age and gender or a BMI between the 50th and 85th percentile and at least one overweight parent) and randomize each dyad to one of the following groups: (a) Healthy Eating/Physical Activity Intervention including brief pediatrician counseling regarding the child's current BMI%ile status, recommendations for home environmental changes to achieve a healthy weight gain trajectory, and home safety and injury risk reduction recommendations paired with a 6 month home-based program delivered via phone by a health behavior specialist to promote implementation of the obesity prevention home environmental strategies, or (b) General Health/Safety/Injury Prevention Contact Control Intervention: Families will receive the same brief counseling from their pediatrician paired with a 6 month home-based program delivered via phone by a health behavior specialist to promote implementation of the general health, safety and injury prevention home environmental strategies. - Healthy Eating/Physical Activity Home-based Intervention: The "Busy Bodies/Better Bites" intervention arm will include brief pediatrician counseling regarding the child's current BMI percentile status, recommendations for home environmental changes to achieve a healthy weight gain trajectory, and home safety and injury risk reduction environmental recommendations paired with a 6 month home-based program delivered via phone by a masters-level health behavior specialist to promote implementation of the obesity prevention home environmental strategies. - Safety/Injury Prevention Home-based Contact Control Intervention: The "Healthy Tots/Safe Spots" intervention arm will include the same brief counseling from the pediatrician paired with a 6 month home-based program delivered via phone by a masters-level health behavior specialist to promote implementation of the safety and injury prevention home environmental strategies.</detailed_description>
