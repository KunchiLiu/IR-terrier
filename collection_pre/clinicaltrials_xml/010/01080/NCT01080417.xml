	<brief_summary>The objective of the study is to compare the bioavailability and characterise the pharmacokinetic profile of Mycophenolate mofetil 250 mg capsules Panacea Biotech Ltd, India and Cellcept® 250 mg capsules Mycophenolate mofetil capsule, Roche Labs Inc. New Jersey, USA in normal, healthy, adult human subjects under fed conditions, and to assess the bioequivalence.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bioequivalence Study of Mycophenolate Mofetil 250 mg Capsule Under Fed Condition</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>72 + 12 (stand-by) normal healthy adult subjects will be enrolled in the study. Subjects will be administered either the Test or the Reference Product with 240 mL of water in each period as per the randomization schedule. Subjects will fast for at least 10 hours prior to High Fat Breakfast half an hour before administration of the study drug and for four (4) additional hours each, post dose during each study period. Standardized meals will be provided in each study period. Water will not be accessible to the subjects 1 hour Predose and 2 hours Post dose in each period.A total of 27 blood samples will be withdrawn for pharmacokinetic profiling. The concentration of mycophenolate mofetil and mycophenolic acid will be quantitated using validated LC-MS / MS method.ANOVA, two one-sided tests for bioequivalence, power and ratio analysis for un-transformed and ln-transformed pharmacokinetic parameters Cmax, AUC0-t AUC0-inf will be computed and reported for Mycophenolic acid. Bioequivalence of the test product with that of the reference product under fasting conditions will be concluded if the 90% confidence interval falls within the acceptance range of 80.00-125.00% for ln-transformed pharmacokinetic parameters Cmax, AUC0-t and AUC0-inf for Mycophenolic acid.</detailed_description>
