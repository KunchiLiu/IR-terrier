	<brief_summary>Rotational maneuver is a vestibular rehabilitation method, performed in a supervised manner. Using a rotating chair, subjects are rotated towards the opposite direction of dominant side in order to inhibit this side and simultaneously, stimulate the subordinate side. We propose that the rehabilitative effect is the result of a decrease in the vestibular imbalance, mainly due to a decrease in the response of the dominant vestibular side. Previously, we have shown the short-term effects of this maneuver on patients with recent onset vestibular imbalance. In the present study, we investigated the long-term effects of the rotational maneuver in patients with a history of peripheral vestibular vertigo for at least one year, originally confirmed by clinical tests. Our results show a significant improvement which lasted for &gt;4 weeks after the end of rehabilitation (i.e., the last time tested). Moreover, there seems to be a relationship between the decrease in DP values and a decrease in subjective symptoms. We propose that this maneuver can be used as an effective method for both short- and long-term rehabilitation.</brief_summary>
