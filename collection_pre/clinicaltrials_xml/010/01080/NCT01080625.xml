	<brief_summary>Postreperfusion syndrome (PRS) is a relatively common phenomenon in patients undergoing liver transplantation which is characterized by an acute drop in blood pressure immediately after the prefusion is restored to the transplanted liver. We hypothesized that PRS would be prevented when phenylephrine or epinephrine is administered immediately prior to reperfusion in liver transplantation.</brief_summary>
