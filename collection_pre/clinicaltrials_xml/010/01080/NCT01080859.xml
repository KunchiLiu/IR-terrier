	<brief_summary>The purpose of the trial is to evaluate the completeness of struts coverage and vessel wall response (strut malapposition, neoin-timal formation) to the bio-active-stent (BAS) versus ever-olimus-eluting stent (EES) implanted for the treatment of the culprit lesion in acute coronary syndrome.</brief_summary>
