	<brief_summary>The team's ultimate goal is to improve health care quality and effectiveness and support patient-centered care. In this project, we, the investigators, will test whether providing patients with guideline based-recommendations regarding tobacco use, physical activity and mental and physical health-related quality of life (patient reported measures: PRMs) using health information technology increases doctor-patient discussions regarding these topics and results in improvements in PRMs. We will randomize physicians in a single general internal medicine practice. Patients seeing intervention physicians will receive guideline-based recommendations regarding PRMs, those seeing control physicians will not. We will compare differences in doctor-patient discussions regarding PRMs between the intervention and control groups. The successful completion of this project will provide evidence the effectiveness of involving patients in their care through the use guideline-based feedback.</brief_summary>
