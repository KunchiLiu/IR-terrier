	<brief_summary>This is a study to compare subject response and symptoms resulting from administration of three clinical assessments. * The 3 assessments are 1. passive upright tilt table testing, 2. quantitative sudomotor axon reflex testing (QSART)and 3. punch biopsy. The comparison of results will be from two subject groups: - Group A, the migraine suffering patient with or without aura - Group B, the migraine suffering patient with or without aura who has diagnosed orthostatic intolerance (i.e.,feeling dizzy or faint when making a body position change).</brief_summary>
