	<brief_summary>The objectives of this study are to evaluate the safety and efficacy of E10030 intravitreous injection when administered in combination with Lucentis® against a control of Lucentis® alone in subjects with subfoveal choroidal neovascularization secondary to age-related macular degeneration (AMD).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Safety and Efficacy Study of E10030 (Anti-PDGF Pegylated Aptamer) Plus Lucentis for Neovascular Age-Related Macular Degeneration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to the following dose groups: - E10030 0.3 mg/eye + Lucentis® 0. 5 mg/eye - E10030 1.5 mg/eye + Lucentis® 0. 5 mg/eye - E10030 sham + Lucentis® 0. 5 mg/eye Subjects will be treated with active E10030 or sham E10030 in combination with Lucentis® at Day 0, Week 4, Week 8, Week 12, Week 16 and Week 20. Primary Efficacy Endpoint: The primary efficacy endpoint is mean change in visual acuity from baseline at the Week 24 visit Safety Endpoints: Safety endpoints include adverse events, vital signs, ophthalmic variables [visual acuity, intraocular pressure (IOP), ophthalmic examination, color fundus photography, fluorescein angiograms (FA), optical coherence tomography (OCT)], and laboratory variables. Approximately 444 subjects will be randomized into one of the three treatment cohorts (approximately 148 patients per dose group).</detailed_description>
