	<criteria>Healthy volunteers only Males/females ≥ 50 years and ≤ 65 years of age Cancer patients and inflammation patients (inflammation patients in study part 2 = optional, in study part 3 mandatory) Males/females ≥ 30 and ≤ 80 years of age patients had an FDG PET/CT for detection, or staging, or restaging, or therapy response assessment that still showed tumor mass with high certainty, for 1. NSCLC (non small cell lung cancer), or 2. adenocarcinoma of the breast (female patients) or 3. squamous cell cancer of head and neck and the cancer disease is histologically confirmed. 4. Patients with confirmed/known inflammatory focus/foci after FDGPET/CT imaging Exclusion criteria for all healthy volunteers and patients: any concomitant disease (for healthy volunteers) and for patients any concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled and/or unstable other medical disease (e.g. poorly controlled diabetes, congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction within 12 months prior to planned injection of BAY869596, unstable and uncontrolled hypertension, chronic renal or hepatic disease, severe pulmonary disease) which could compromise participation in the study For healthy volunteers and patients: known sensitivity to the study drug or components of the preparation. tumor patients with known inflammatory disease, where images overlap inflammatory lesions with tumor lesions</criteria>
