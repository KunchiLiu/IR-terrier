RoActemra/Actemra will be administered as a monotherapy or in combination with DMARDs. RoActemra/Actemra will be administered as intravenous infusion at a dose of 8 mg/kg every 4 weeks for a total of 6 infusions. The anticipated time on study treatment is 24 weeks. The target sample size is 50-150 patients.</brief_summary>
