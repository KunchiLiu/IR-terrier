	<brief_summary>This is a phase II multicenter randomized open-label clinical study that will determine whether treatment with Lactofiltrum (orally administered tablets) in combination with antibiotic therapy (metronidazole) is effective in women with bacterial vaginosis. Lactofiltrum is a composite drug that includes enterosorbent lignin and prebiotic Lactulose. It's supposed that supplement of Lactofiltrum to a standard therapy of bacterial vaginosis (metronidazole administered orally) improves women's general state, leads to better recovery of clinical, microbiological, biochemical and histological features of the disease.</brief_summary>
