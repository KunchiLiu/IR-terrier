	<brief_summary>Which are the anthropometric parameters and/or of severity of the syndrome of apnea of sleep (SAS) which make it possible to anticipate occurred of vascular anomalies, anatomical and/or functional precociously found among patients SAS? Secondary objectives: 1. Which are the anthropometric parameters and/or of severity of SAS allowing to anticipate occurred of early of the cardiac function and/or rhythmic anomalies found among patients SAS? 2. Do there exist biological markers who allow to anticipate the early vascular lesions or the anomalies beginners of the cardiac function? 3. Which are the cardiovascular effects of a treatment of SAS by Continuous Positive Pressure (PC) after 3 to 6 months of treatment? 4. Do the identified early cardiovascular attacks and/or the biological anomalies make it possible to predict occurred of cardiovascular events in this population of patients carrying SAS (followed longitudinal at 5 years)?</brief_summary>
