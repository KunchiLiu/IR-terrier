	<brief_summary>Parkinson disease is one of the most common neurodegenerative illnesses. The disease is characterized by decrease in dopamine levels and decrease in the number of dopaminergic neurons and dopamine receptors. There are gene mutations that increase the risk for the disease. Two of those mutations are on the LRRK2 gene and on GBA gene. It is yet unknown if there is a difference between the metabolic brain function of Parkinson patients that carry one of the two mutations to Parkinson patients with no known mutation. Participants: diagnosed Parkinson patients that carry a gene mutation in either LRRK2 or GBA genes, Parkinson patients with no known mutation and healthy volunteers as a control group. The participants will go through both examinations DAT SCAN and PET CT SCAN at the Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center Nuclear Medicine Institute. The examination results will be given to the participants by a doctor from the neurology department.</brief_summary>
