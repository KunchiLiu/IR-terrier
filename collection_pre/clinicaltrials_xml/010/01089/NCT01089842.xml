	<brief_title>Health Coaching to Promote Physical Activity for Coronary Heart Disease Prevention</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiovascular diseases are the main cause of death in developed countries. Epidemiological studies have shown that a sedentary lifestyle is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases, mainly related to classical risk factors (obesity, diabetes, hypertension). International guidelines recommend, because of that, a minimum of 30 minutes per day at least 5 days per week of moderate physical activity for primary and secondary cardiovascular disease prevention. Physical inactivity is an increasing public health problem in developed countries. It is known that clinical advice has a poor efficacy to increase levels of physical activity on individuals and new strategies need to be developed. Coaching is a strategy of personal help that is being widely and successfully used in business world. It consists of an structured and individualized process of assistance to people to promote cognitive changes needed to achieve behavioural changes. It can be a complementary method to information and sanitary education emphasizing on consciousness and responsibility of the patient and is now starting to be used in medical practice. The purpose of the study is to define usefulness of an strategy based on coaching techniques to promote physical activity practice and healthy lifestyle on individuals with known coronary heart disease or cardiovascular risk factors.</detailed_description>
