	<brief_title>Non-Idiopathic Scoliosis Treated With Tranexamic Acid</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To investigate whether tranexamic acid (TXA) reduces perioperative blood loss and transfusion requirement in pediatric patients with secondary scoliosis undergoing posterior spinal fusion.In addition determination of the optimal TXA dosing for perioperative reduction of blood loss and transfusion requirement as well as to evaluate use of thromboelastography (TEG) as a measure of coagulation and fibrinolysis in pediatric patients with secondary scoliosis undergoing posterior spinal fusion (this may help guide blood product therapy). The investigation will determine the effects of TXA on the TEG profile and whether plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) level affects bleeding and transfusion requirement during scoliosis surgery. Finally to investigate whether PAI-1 level affects bleeding in response to TXA during scoliosis surgery.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Children with secondary scoliosis undergoing posterior spinal fusion 1. Known bleeding disorder as this may increase the risk of bleeding 2. Current antifibrinolytic therapy as these patients may bleed less 3. Patient or family history of thromboembolic disease as there may be potential risk of thrombosis 4. Use of NSAIDS within 5 days of surgery as this may increase the risk of bleeding 5. Known allergy to TXA 6. History of renal insufficiency as TXA is renally excreted 7. Colour vision disturbance</criteria>
