	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to compare the two imaging modalities perfusion weighted MR-imaging and FET-PET in their ability to provide an accurate histological evaluation of low grade glioma and to reveal focal abnormalities within a homogeneously appearing tumor. Additionally, therapeutic effects should be assessed during a time period of two years.</brief_summary>
