	<brief_summary>Coffee and green tea are 2 widely consumed beverages. Both contain polyphenol antioxidant compounds (chlorogenic acids for coffee and catechins for tea). The bioavailability of catechins is somewhat known and has been referenced in the literature. However, bioavailability data from tea infusion is non-existent, even though it reflects better how consumers drink this beverage. In addition, bioavailability of coffee chlorogenic acids is less understood and no dose response study has been reported so far in the literature. Thus, there is a great need to understand and reinforce our knowledge on the bioavailability of coffee and tea polyphenol compounds.</brief_summary>
