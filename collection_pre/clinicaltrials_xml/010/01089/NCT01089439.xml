	<detailed_description>Acute chest syndrome is a severe sickle cell disease complication in children requiring blood transfusion therapy to prevent acute respiratory failure and death. Nitric oxide is a potent vasodilator that could reverse pulmonary vascular occlusion and restore normal oxygenation. The randomized trial will test that hypothesis in a prospective randomized double-blind placebo controlled study. 50 children in two years will be included: 25 in each arm.</detailed_description>
