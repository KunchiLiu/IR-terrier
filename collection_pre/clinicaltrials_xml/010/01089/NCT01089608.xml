	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety Assessment of Azyter® Eye Drops (T1225) in Patients With Blepharitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently, topical antibiotic ointments are used for blepharitis. They provide prolonged contact time with the lid margin but with little penetration into eyelid tissue. Azithromycin eye drops may offer on advantage over these preparations because azithromycin achieves sustained high concentration in various ocular tissues including the lid margin. Patients will be treated during 7 days (1 drop twice daily the first day following by one drop once daily for 6 days) following by a period of 2 weeks without treatment. This therapeutic scheme will be repeated two times. Efficacy will be evaluated by change from baseline (Day 0) to Day 63 Â± 3 Days of the global ocular discomfort evaluation (VAS).</detailed_description>
