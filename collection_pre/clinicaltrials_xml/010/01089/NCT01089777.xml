	<brief_summary>The study is an open prospective study of coronary flow preferably of the left anterior descending artery (LAD), by a Transthoracic Parametric Doppler (TPD) system during conventional exercise stress test. The system is a noninvasive non-imaging device designed to monitor coronary flow velocity and display the data continuously during exercise stress tests. The system enables continuous monitoring of coronary flow during resting, stress loading and recovery phases. The study intent is to improve the stress test predictive value for CAD.</brief_summary>
