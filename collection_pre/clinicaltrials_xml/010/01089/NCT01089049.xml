	<brief_title>Effect of a Natural Health Product on Urinary Estrogen Metabolites</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The active botanical constituents in femMED Breast Health Formula contain lignans, compounds with anti-estrogenic activity, that have been shown to exert an estrogenic effect during the follicular phase [i.e. when estrogen is low] and an antiestrogenic effect in the luteal phase of a female menstrual cycle. These are plant-derived chemicals that can act as weak mimics of estrogen in the body. Overall these compounds have been found to be helpful in stabilizing the natural cyclical fluctuation of estrogen levels. The trial will be a double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel study in which 100 subjects will be recruited to one of two arms of the study: one arm will consist of pre-menopausal women; another will consist of post-menopausal women. Each arm of the study will be carried out concurrently and in one phase, with no washout period. The placebo assignment will be randomized within each arm of the study. Subjects in each arm of the study will follow the same protocol. Urine and blood samples will be collected from each group at both the first and last visit, and subjects will receive a month's supply of treatment or placebo at the first visit, which they will consume on a daily basis until their second lab visit 28 days later. Urine samples will be analyzed for the following estrogen metabolites: 2-OH-estrone and 16-Î± OH-estrone. Blood samples would be collected and assessed for levels of enterolactone. Pre and post-supplementation results will be assesses for any differences by statistical comparison.</detailed_description>
