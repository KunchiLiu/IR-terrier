	<brief_title>A Study of CK-2017357 in Patients With Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a Phase II, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, three-way crossover study of CK-2017357 in patients with ALS. 36 to 72 patients will be randomized to one of six different treatment sequences. Each treatment sequence consists of three dosing periods; in each dosing period¸ patients receive a single oral dose of placebo, 250 mg of CK-2017357, or 500 mg of CK-2017357. All six treatment sequences will enroll approximately the same number of patients. A washout period of at least 6 days (to a maximum of 10 days) will be employed between the doses for each patient. This study is designed to assess the effect of CK-2017357 on maximal voluntary muscle strength, on the development of fatigue at maximal and sub-maximal voluntary muscle contraction, and on selected pulmonary function parameters. The plasma concentration of CK-2017357 will be measured at selected time points after each of two single doses of CK-2017357 in men and women. The plasma concentration versus time data obtained in this study may be used to develop a population PK model and estimate inter-subject variability of PK parameters in this target patient population, in particular between male and female study patients.</detailed_description>
