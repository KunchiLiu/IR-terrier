	<criteria>neuroradiologically suspected Glioblastoma multiforme histological verification will be obtained either by microsurgery or by stereotactic biopsy. The neuropathological diagnosis will be verified by a reference neuropathologist patients will undergo radiochemotherapy subsequent to surgical procedure patients older than 18 years Karnofsky Performance Score &gt;=70 pregnant or nursing female patients will not be included in this study safe contraceptive methods during the radiochemotherapy and chemotherapy patients in whom informed consent cannot be obtained due to organic brain syndrome or insufficient language skills patients who cannot lie quiet for a time period of app. two hours during the FETPEt scan medical history of a metastatic brain disease patients in whom an MRI scan cannot be performed due to claustrophobia metallic protheses or pacemakers etc.</criteria>
