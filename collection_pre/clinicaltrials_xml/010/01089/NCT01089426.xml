	<brief_title>Omegaven Treatment of Parenteral Nutrition (PN) Induced Liver Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In the United States, patients dependent upon parenteral nutrition (PN) receive parenteral fat emulsions composed of soybean oils. Lipids are necessary in PN dependent patients due to their high caloric value and essential fatty acid content. They have been implicated in predisposing patients to PN associated liver disease. Phytosterols such as those contained in soybean oils are thought to have a deleterious effect on biliary secretion. Children requiring prolonged PN are at risk for developing PN associated liver disease. We hypothesize that although omega-6 fatty acid emulsions prevent fatty acid deficiency, they are not cleared in a manner similar to enteral chylomicrons and therefore accumulate in the liver and resulting in steatotic liver injury. We further hypothesize that a fat emulsion comprised of omega-3 fatty acids (i.e., fish oil) such as Omegaven™ would be beneficial in the management of steatotic liver injury by its inhibition of de novo lipogenesis, the reduction of arachidonic acid-derived inflammatory mediators, prevention of essential fatty acid deficiency through the presence of small amounts of arachidonic acid, and improved clearance of lipids from the serum. Animal studies have shown that IV fat emulsions (IFE) such as fish oil that are high in eicosapentaenic and docashexaaenoic acid reduce impairment of bile flow which is seen in cholestasis caused by conventional fat emulsions. Intravenous omega three fatty acids may be well tolerated and might reduce the inflammatory effect in the liver of prolonged PN exposure and could potentially reverse any hepatic dysfunction due to PN/IFE use. By administering Omegaven™ in place of conventional phytosterol/soybean fat emulsions we may reverse or prevent the progression of PN associated cholestasis and thus allow the patient to be maintained on adequate PN until they are able to ingest adequate nutrition enterally.</detailed_description>
