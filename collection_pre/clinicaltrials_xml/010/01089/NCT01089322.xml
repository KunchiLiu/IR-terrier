	<brief_summary>Several studies have demonstrated the efficacy of asthma treatment but despite being correctly diagnosed, conveniently prescribed and adherent to the therapeutics, 5% to 10% of asthmatics do not reach disease control. The aim of this study is to measure asthma control, evaluate inflammatory and functional characteristics, describe comorbidities and aggravating factors and phenotypes derived from the characteristics of a severe asthmatic population followed at an outpatient university service in Sao Paolo, Brazil.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study design: interventional Patients selection: Seventy-four severe asthma patients, aged between 18 and 65 years old were recruited from the outpatient clinics of the Pulmonary Division of the University of SÃ£o Paolo Hospital. Severe asthma were defined according to GINA. Intervention: after 2 weeks screening period patients were treated with high inhaled corticosteroid dose plus long acting beta 2 agonist during 12 weeks plus oral corticosteroid ( prednisone 40 mg/day) during 2 weeks. Procedures ( baseline, after 2 weeks and 12 weeks): asthma control questionnaire (ACQ), asthma control (ACT) test, lung function test, quality of life questionnaire (SGRQ and SF-36), exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), induced sputum (IS). After 12 weeks patients underwent the following evaluation: Upper Digestive Endoscopy, Esophageal 24hs pHmetry, High Resolution Chest Tomography, Nasoscope exam,Bronchofibroscopy with endobronchial biopsy.</detailed_description>
