	<brief_title>Use of Autologous Serum Eye-drops as Tears in Patients With Recalcitrant Dry Eye</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A group of selected dry eye patients from the Singapore National Eye Centre who have exhausted the usual treatment options (lubricants, topical immunosuppressive and punctal occlusion) and not keen for tarsorrhaphy will be recruited. After informed consent, they will undergo plasmapheresis and start on daily autologous serum eyedrops for a period of 4 months. Clinical monitoring for standard dry eye parameters such as punctate corneal keratitis, Schirmers testing, tear break up time as well as severity and frequency of dry eye symptoms will be conducted. Tear inflammatory proteins captured on Schirmers paper pre and post treatment will be analysed as well.</detailed_description>
