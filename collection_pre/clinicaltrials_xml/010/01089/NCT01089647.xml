	<brief_summary>In children with mild apnea combined therapy with an inhaled nasal steroid and a medication that decreased nasal congestion (montelukast) was shown to be effective. We are testing to see if this combination works in adults with mild apnea as well.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Montelukast and Inhaled Nasal Steroid Tx in Adult Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>40 adults with mild OSA (&lt; 5 apneas/hypopneas per hour of sleep) will receive either a combination of two medicines that decrease nasal congestion-montelukast and nasal budesonide-or a placebo pill and nasal spray. After 3 months of therapy, a repeat sleep study will be done to determine the differences, if any, in the frequency of sleep disordered breathing in the two groups.</detailed_description>
