	<brief_summary>The propose of this study is to determine whether a 6-day duration of oral amoxicillin treatment of erysipelas is non-inferior to a 14-day standard duration intravenous then oral amoxicillin regimen. This trial will be open but evaluation will be perform by a blind evaluator.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Short Course of Amoxicillin for Erysipelas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To fight against increasing rate of bacterial resistance to antibiotics, several studies have demonstrated efficacy of short antibiotic course in e.g. acute streptococcal tonsillitis, community acquired pneumonia, and urinary tract infection. Erysipelas is an acute dermo-hypodermal infection due to streptococcus. To date no resistance of theses bacteria to amoxicillin was described. The diagnosis of erysipelas is clinical. Thus, short course of antibiotic is a good regimen to test in erysipelas treatment. To date there is no controlled trial concerning efficacy of oral amoxicillin in erysipelas treatment. Expected advantages of the demonstration of the non inferiority of a short and oral amoxicillin treatment in erysipelas are: reduction of antibiotic selective pressure, cost, adverse events caused by infusion and hospitalisation.</detailed_description>
