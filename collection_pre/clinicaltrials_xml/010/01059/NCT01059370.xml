	<brief_summary>Autonomic dysreflexia in high spinal cord-injured can be initiated by a full bladder or bowel, or when trying to empty either. This randomised study aims at evaluating whether irrigation procedure or digital stimulation or evacuation of the rectum is less provocative of autonomic dysreflexia. Participants have their bowels emptied on different days, in the morning fasting. Bladder filling with sterile saline water is evaluated on a third day as a control.</brief_summary>
