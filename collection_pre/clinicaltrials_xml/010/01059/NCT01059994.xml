	<brief_summary>This is a pilot study funded by the National Institutes of Health. In this project, we will investigate the potential effect of skeletal muscle nitric oxide (NO) production on muscle strength and physical function in older individuals. We propose to test a new method that may enable simultaneous determination of both vascular and skeletal muscle NO production for the first time in humans. Further, we will determine whether augmentation of NO-mediated responses, by administration of sildenafil citrate (Viagra), reduces fatigue and fatigability in older individuals.</brief_summary>
