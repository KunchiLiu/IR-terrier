	<brief_summary>This is a randomized controlled trial to compare propofol to dexmedetomidine for prolonged sedation (&gt; 24 hours) in critically ill patients who require mechanical ventilation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dexmedetomidine Versus Propofol in the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Mechanically ventilated critically ill patients are routinely given sedative and analgesic medications to relieve pain and anxiety associated with intubation, mechanical ventilation, and critical care in general. While integral in minimizing discomfort, these medications may increase mechanical ventilation time, the duration of intensive care unit (ICU) stay, ICU complications (e.g. delirium, ventilator associated pneumonia, venous thromboembolism), the morbidity associated with critical illness, and patient mortality. This study compares two sedative medications that have been used in patients who require a mechanical ventilator. Enrolled patients will be randomly assigned to receive propofol or dexmedetomidine for sedation while they require ventilatory support. All patients will also receive the pain medication fentanyl as needed.</detailed_description>
