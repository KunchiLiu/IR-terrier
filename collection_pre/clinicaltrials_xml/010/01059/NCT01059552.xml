	<detailed_description>This phase I trial will escalate doses of the histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDAC) vorinostat to a chemoradiation platform for cisplatin, pemetrexed and radiation to a dose of 70Gy in NSCLC patients with unresectable IIIA and dry IIIB disease. The endpoint will be to determine MTD of the combination.</detailed_description>
