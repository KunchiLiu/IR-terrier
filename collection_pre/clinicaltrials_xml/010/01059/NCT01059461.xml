	<criteria>* Infant aged 36 months with perinatal history of moderate or severe HIE collected from his NICU's file. Criteria of neonatal asphyxia and encephalopathy according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologist and American Academy of Pediatrics, metabolic acidosis with a cord pH of 7.0 or less or a base deficit of at least 12 mmol/L, early onset of encephalopathy, and multisystem organ dysfunction with exclusion of other possible causes for findings. Criteria of neonatal asphyxia: Full term neonate more than 36 weeks of gestation pH of 7.0 or less or a base deficit of 16 mmol per liter or more in a sample of umbilicalcord blood or any blood during the first hour after birth. If, during this interval, a pH is between 7.01 and 7.15, a base deficit is between 10 and 15.9 mmol per liter, or a blood gas is not available, additional criteria are required. These includes an acute perinatal event (e.g., late or variable decelerations, cord prolapse, cord rupture, uterine rupture, maternal trauma, hemorrhage, or cardiorespiratory arrest) and either a 10minute Apgar score of 5 or less or assisted ventilation initiates at birth and continues for at least 10 minutes. Criteria of neonatal encephalopathy according to Sarnat and Sarnat. Presence of one or more signs in at least three of the following six categories: level of consciousness. spontaneous activity. posture. tone. primitive reflexes (suck or Moro. autonomic nervous system (pupils, heart rate, or respiration). The number of moderate or severe signs determined the extent of encephalopathy; if signs were equally distributed, the designation was based on the level of consciousness. * Severe intrauterine growth retardation. Congenital malformations. Suspected inborn error of metabolism. Suspected inherited neurologic disease. Intracranial hemorrhage Meningitis</criteria>
