	<brief_title>Observational Safety Study for KALBITOR (Ecallantide) in the Treatment of Acute Attacks of Hereditary Angioedema</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective of this study is to evaluate immunogenicity and hypersensitivity upon exposure to KALBITOR, in particular: 1. Determine the rate of anaphylaxis and Type I hypersensitivity reactions upon exposure to KALBITOR. 2. Determine the rate of seroconversion to anti-ecallantide antibodies upon exposure to KALBITOR. 3. Determine the rate of adverse events related to disordered coagulation (hypercoagulability and hypocoagulability) upon exposure to KALBITOR.</detailed_description>
