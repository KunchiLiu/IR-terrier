	<criteria>Subjects who the investigator believes can and will comply with the requirements of the protocol (e.g., completion of the diary cards, return for followup visits). Written informed consent obtained from the subject. Male or female adults, 1940 years of age at the time of the first vaccination. Body weight of at least 110 pounds (49.9 kg). Safety laboratory tests results within the parameters specified by protocol. Satisfactory baseline medical assessment by physical examination (stable health status with no exclusionary conditions). Stable health status is defined as the absence of a health event satisfying the definition of a serious adverse event, or a change in an ongoing drug therapy due to therapeutic failure or symptoms of drug toxicity, within one month prior to enrollment. Comprehension of the study requirements, ability to comprehend and comply with procedures for collection of safety data, expressed availability for the required study period, and ability and willingness to attend scheduled visits as documented by signature on the informed consent document. Access to a consistent means of telephone contact, which may be either in the home or at the workplace, land line, or mobile, but NOT a pay phone or other multipleuser device (i.e., a commonuse phone serving multiple rooms or apartments). Female subjects of nonchildbearing potential may be enrolled in the study. Nonchildbearing potential is defined as current tubal ligation, hysterectomy, ovariectomy, or postmenopause. Female subjects of childbearing potential may be enrolled in the study, if the subject: has practiced adequate contraception for 30 days prior to vaccination, and has a negative pregnancy test on the day of vaccination, and has agreed to continue adequate contraception during the entire treatment period and for 2 months after completion of the vaccination series Previous vaccination with an A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)vlike virus vaccine A medical history of physicianconfirmed infection with an A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)vlike virus. Prior receipt at any time of any seasonal influenza vaccine. Planned administration of any vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol (including any influenza vaccine other than the study vaccine) between Days 0 and the Day 164 phlebotomy. Administration of any licensed vaccine within 30 days before the first study vaccine dose. Use of any investigational or nonregistered product (drug or vaccine) other than the study vaccines within 30 days preceding the first dose of study vaccine, or planned use during the study period. Receipt of systemic glucocorticoids (e.g., prednisone ≥ 0.5 mg/kg/day, or ≥ 10 mg/day [whichever is less] for more than 14 consecutive days) within one month prior to study enrolment, or any other cytotoxic or immunosuppressive drug within six months of study enrolment. Topical, intraarticularly injected, or inhaled glucocorticoids, topical calcineurin inhibitors or imiquimod are allowed. Receipt of any immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within 9 months of study enrolment or planned administration of any of these products during the study period. Presence of evidence of substance abuse or of neurological or psychiatric diagnoses which, even if stable, are deemed by the investigator to render the potential subject unable/unlikely to provide accurate safety reports. History of anemia. Presence of a temperature ≥ 38.0ºC (≥100.4ºF), (oral temperature assessment preferred), or acute symptoms greater than "mild" severity on the scheduled date of first vaccination Diagnosed with cancer, or treatment for cancer, within 3 years. Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, based on medical history and physical examination. (No laboratory testing is required.) Any significant disorder of coagulation or treatment with warfarin derivatives or heparin. Persons receiving individual doses of low molecular weight heparin outside of 24 hours prior to vaccination are eligible. Persons receiving prophylactic antiplatelet medications, e.g., lowdose acetylsalicylic acid, and without a clinicallyapparent bleeding tendency, are eligible. An acute evolving neurological disorder or history of GuillainBarré syndrome within six weeks of receipt of any vaccine. Any known or suspected allergy to any constituent of influenza vaccines (including egg proteins or mercurial preservatives); a history of anaphylactictype reaction to consumption of eggs; or a history of severe adverse reaction to any vaccine. Known pregnancy or a positive urine betahuman chorionic gonadotropin (βHCG) test result prior to first vaccination. Lactating or nursing women.</criteria>
