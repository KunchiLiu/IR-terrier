	<brief_summary>Study hypothesis : An early blockade of aldosterone receptors initiated at the first medical contact after acute myocardial infarction may reduce major cardiovascular events within 6 months after the occurrence of the myocardial infarction. Primary efficacy criterion : The 6 month rate of the composite of death, resuscitated cardiac arrest, potentially lethal ventricular arrhythmia, indication for implantation of an implantable cardioversion device, occurrence or aggravation of heart failure. Primary objective: To demonstrate the superiority of aldosterone blockade initiated as soon as possible within 72 hours after the onset of acute myocardial infarction on top of standard therapy, compared to standard therapy alone, with or without reperfusion therapy. Study design : Prospective, multi-centre randomised, open labeled with 2 parallel study arms.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Rational :The blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAA) pathway by angiotensin conversion enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) is one corner stone in the management of heart failure as well as the management of ischemic heart disease, especially after acute myocardial infarctionHigh plasma aldosterone levels have been associated with both direct and indirect toxic effects on myocardium. ACEIs are associated with partial and temporary reduction of plasma aldosterone levels.The RALES randomized controlled trial has shown a reduction of mortality associated with the use of the selective aldosterone receptor blocker spironolactone, on top of standard therapy including ACEIs in the setting of NYHA 3-4 chronic heart failure. The EPHESUS randomized controlled trial has shown a reduction of mortality associated with the use of another selective aldosterone receptor blocker Eplerenone, initiated 3 to 14 days after acute myocardial infarction complicated by clinical heart failure and left ventricular ejection fraction &lt; 40%.Both previous studies have also reported a rapid reduction of global and arrhythmia-related mortality, within 30 days after the initiation of the medication.Such benefit has been reported after delayed initiation of aldosterone blocked, while aldosterone is at its highest level at presentation after acute myocardial infarction, with a rapid decrease within days after admission. Furthermore high aldosterone levels on admission are associated with adverse outcome independent of heart failure. The ALBATROSS trial :Hypothesis: An early blockade of aldosterone receptors initiated at the first medical contact after acute myocardial infarction may reduce major cardiovascular events within 6 months after the occurrence of the myocardial infarction. Primary objective: To demonstrate the superiority of aldosterone blockade initiated as soon as possible within 72 hours after the onset of acute myocardial infarction on top of standard therapy, compared to standard therapy alone, with or without reperfusion therapy.</detailed_description>
