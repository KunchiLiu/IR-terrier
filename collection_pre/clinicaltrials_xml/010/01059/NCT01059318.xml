	<criteria>Female aged &gt;/= 18 years with a diagnosis of LAM Pulmonary function abnormalities as follows: FEV1 of ≤ 80% of the predicted value following administration of a standard dose of a short acting β2agonist (*200 µg Salbutamol, measured between 10 and 15 minutes of inhalation) OR FEV1 &lt; 90% of the predicted value of bronchodilator following administration of a standard dose of a short acting β2agonist (*200 µg Salbutamol, measured between 10 and 15 minutes of inhalation) and DLco (uncorrected) &lt;80% predicted. Female patients including those of childbearing potential will be included in this study. Negative pregnancy test at screening and baseline FEV1&lt;50% of predicted postbronchodilator. Change in FVC (ml) &gt; ± 15% of screening value at baseline visit (not less than 14d after screening visit). Use of any medicine containing estrogen in the 4 months prior to the screening visit and for the duration of the study Significant hematologic, renal, hepatic laboratory abnormality or amylase &gt; 1.5x the upper limit of the normal range at the screening or baseline visits Fasting blood glucose &gt; 126mg/dl or random blood glucose &gt;200mg/dl at screening and/or baseline Recent surgery (involving entry into a body cavity or requiring sutures) within 2 months of the screening visit or any evidence of unhealed surgical wound. Uncontrolled hyperlipidemia (defined as persistent elevation of total cholesterol or triglycerides &gt;6.5nM/L) or a history of clinical atherosclerotic disease including heart attack, angina, peripheral vascular disease or stroke. Previous organ transplantation Inability to give informed consent Inability to perform pulmonary function or 6 minute walk tests and imaging assessments Other protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply</criteria>
