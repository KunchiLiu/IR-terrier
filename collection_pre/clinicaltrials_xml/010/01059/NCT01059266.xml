	<brief_summary>This study investigates the safety of two up-dosing regimen. The safety of PURETHAL Grasses will be evaluated in a rush regimen (maximum dose reached in 3 injections during 2 weeks) compared to the conventional regimen (maximum dose reached in 6 injections during 5 weeks). The primary parameter will be the proportion of patients who experience systemic reactions &gt; grade I within 24 hours after injection or who need more than 2 additional injections during the up-dosing phase until the maintenance dose has been reached. It is expected that up-dosing PURETHAL Grasses according to the rush regimen is as safe as using the conventional regimen.</brief_summary>
