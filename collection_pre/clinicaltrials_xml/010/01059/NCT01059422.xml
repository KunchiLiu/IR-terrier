	<brief_summary>The study will investigate whether combination antiretroviral therapy of raltegravir and 3TC/ABC is effective and safe to use in tuberculosis (TB)/HIV co-infected adults receiving rifabutin-containing, first-line antituberculous treatment. Hypothesis:Combination antiretroviral therapy of raltegravir and 3TC/ABC and is effective and safe to use in tuberculosis (TB)/HIV co-infected adults receiving rifabutin-based first-line antituberculous treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Raltegravir + Lamivudine/Abacavir in HIV/Tuberculosis Co-Infected Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a phase IIIB/IV, open-label, multi-center, single-arm descriptive pilot study of the efficacy and safety of RAL BID in combination with ABC/3TC QD in antiretroviral-naïve HIV-1 infected individuals with a presumptive or confirmed diagnosis of tuberculosis, without planned comparative analyses. A goal of 40 subjects will be enrolled from 3 sites in the Russian Federation, including in our site, and receive RAL BID + 3TC/ABC QD for 48 weeks. This study will include screening, treatment and follow-up periods. Screening period up to 28 days includes initial visits at Day -28 (screening) and Day -14 (switch to rifabutin). The second visit will be required if patient is initially on rifampin-based TB regimen that will need to be switched to rifabutin-based regimen. Patients receiving rifampin-containing TB therapy will be switched to rifabutin (300 mg daily) a minimum of 14 days prior to initiation of antiretroviral therapy. Patients must not have received more than 45 days of tuberculosis therapy. Treatment period from Day 1 to Week 48 includes 7 visits and a follow-up period (2-4 weeks after the Week 48 visit or Withdrawal visit) includes one visit for resolution of ongoing AEs and new SAEs. Patients will therefore have 10 scheduled assessments: screening (Day -28; Day -14), baseline (Day 1), Weeks 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, and 48, and follow-up visit.</detailed_description>
