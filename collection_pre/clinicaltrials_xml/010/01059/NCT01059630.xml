	<brief_summary>This open-label, multicenter, randomized Phase III study will investigate the efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacoeconomics of obinutuzumab (RO5072759, GA101) combined with bendamustine followed by continued obinutuzumab treatment (maintenance monotherapy) compared with bendamustine alone treatment in participants with rituximab-refractory indolent Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (iNHL).</brief_summary>
