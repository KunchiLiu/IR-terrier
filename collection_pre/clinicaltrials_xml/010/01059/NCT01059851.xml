	<brief_summary>This study will investigate whether the plasma concentration-time profile and pharmacokinetics (PK) of suvorexant (MK-4305) in participants with impaired renal function are similar to those observed in healthy participants; and will evaluate the safety and tolerability of suvorexant both in participants with impaired renal function and in healthy participants.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetics of Suvorexant in Participants With Impaired Renal Function (MK-4305-023)(COMPLETED)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Design: This study plans to enroll 16 participants in Part I (8 participants with severe renal impairment and a control group of 8 healthy participants) and 32 participants in Part II (8 participants with moderate renal impairment and a control group of 8 healthy participants; and 8 participants with mild renal impairment and a control group of 8 healthy participants). Part II will be conducted only if the primary hypothesis is not met in Part I and there is a significant difference in the PK of suvorexant between healthy participants and severe renal impairment participants.</detailed_description>
