	<brief_summary>Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is an effective treatment of heart failure (HF) refractory to optimal medical management, in presence of a depressed left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction and a wide QRS complex. It is mainly limited by a high proportion of non-responders. Attempts have been made, in small studies, to increase the number of stimulation sites in order to optimize the resynchronization therapy. V3 is a planned multicenter, randomized trial whose objective is to evaluate the clinical benefit conferred by the addition of a second endocardial or epicardial LV lead in non-responders after at least 6 months of standard biventricular stimulation. The V3 trial will examine the clinical benefit conferred by the addition of a second LV lead in non-responders compared to standard CRT.</brief_summary>
