	<brief_summary>Background: - INFUSE AMI is an ongoing clinical trial examining how patients with heart attacks are treated. The study's aim is to help determine the best way to treat patients with specific kinds of heart attacks caused by blood clots. - To evaluate the effect of the heart attack on the heart tissue and function, participants in the INFUSE-AMI study will have magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the heart at specific times after their heart attack. Objectives: - To perform cardiac MRI scans on patients who are participating in the INFUSE-AMI study. Eligibility: - Individuals at least 18 years of age who are enrolled in the INFUSE-AMI study. Design: - Participants will have an MRI scan of the heart about 5 days and between 23 and 44 days after their heart attack. The MRI scan at day 5 is optional. - Participants will provide a blood sample prior to the MRI scan. - During the scan, participants will be given a contrast drug to show the blood flow to and within the heart. An electrocardiogram will be used to monitor the heart during the procedure. - No other treatment will be provided in this protocol.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cardiac MRI for Patients Enrolled in INFUSE-AMI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this research protocol is to perform contrast enhanced cardiac MRI studies on patients enrolled in the INFUSE-AMI study (INFUSE-AMI is a multicenter, open-label controlled single-blind randomized study with up to 452 patients enrolled in approximately 50 US and European sites). Patients who present with anterior ST elevation myocardial infarction by electrocardiogram (STEMI) and an occluded proximal or mid left anterior descending artery (LAD) with TIMI 0/1 flow will be eligible for randomization to one of the following arms: 1) Local infusion of Abciximab and thrombus aspiration, 2) Local infusion of Abciximab and no thrombus aspiration, 3) No local infusion and thrombus aspiration, or 4) No local infusion and no thrombus aspiration. Cardiac MRI is performed to assess left ventricular function and infarct size for the primary INFUSE-AMI study. Thus, this local research protocol will provide the cardiac MRI scans at no cost to the participant. Additional images of the heart will be obtained for local research purposes. Cardiac MRI scans will be performed at around 5 days (optional) and at 30 days after myocardial infarction.</detailed_description>
