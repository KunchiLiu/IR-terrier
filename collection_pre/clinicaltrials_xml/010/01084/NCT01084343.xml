	<brief_summary>This study is designed to investigate the safety and efficacy of a newly developed vaccine against HIV-1 in female healthy subjects. Safety will be assessed by local and systemic adverse reactions, investigations of blood and urine, and physical exam including vital sign measurements. Efficacy will be assessed in blood, and in vaginal and rectal mucosal samples.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Investigation of the Safety of an HIV-1 Vaccine Given Intra-muscularly and Intra-nasally to Healthy Female Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The current treatment of HIV is aimed at delaying the disease process after the body has been infected with the virus. HIV treatment does not prevent the spreading of the virus to uninfected people. Prevention of HIV infection could be realized by a vaccine. An effective vaccine could slow down the world wide epidemic. None of the potential vaccines investigated in the past 20 years could provide protection to HIV. All these vaccines were aimed at stimulating an immune reaction in the blood. A new theory has been raised that protection against HIV should take place at the site where the virus in most cases enters the body after sexual contacts, in the vagina and rectum. Mymetics Corporation, sponsor of this clinical trial, has developed a new vaccine, based on the so-called virosome technique. This vaccine should be able to induce a local immune reaction in the mucosa of vagina and rectum. Investigations in laboratory animals showed that the newly developed vaccine was safe and well tolerated and a local immune reaction in the mucosa could be established. The next step is to investigate if the concept of mucosal immunity does also apply in the human being. Therefore this trial is being designed to investigate if the newly developed vaccine is also safe and well tolerated in healthy subjects. In addition, it will be investigated if the vaccine can induce an immune response in the mucosa of vagina and rectum. The vaccine will be investigated for the first time in man. The vaccine consists of a very small part of the HIV 1 virus, coupled to a carrier, the virosome. The vaccine also contains two proteins of the influenza virus. These are needed for stability of the vaccine and activation of the immune system in general. There will be two groups of 12 healthy female subjects. In total 24 subjects will participate in this study. The first group will be vaccinated with a low dose of the vaccine (10 microgram of peptide). If the vaccine is assessed as safe during the safety reviews, the second group will be vaccinated with a high dose of vaccine (50 microgram of peptide). Safety and tolerability of the high dose will also be assessed during two safety reviews. Each subject will be vaccinated on four occasions, separated by eight weeks. The first two vaccinations will be given in the muscles and the third and fourth vaccination will be given in the nose in order to enhance the immune response in the mucosa. In both groups, eight subjects will be vaccinated with the real vaccine and four subjects will be vaccinated with the carrier only (placebo). Nor the investigator neither the subject will know which vaccination they receive. It will be a so-called double-blinded study. Safety and tolerability will be assessed by the local and systemic adverse reactions. In addition, blood and urine will be investigated and subjects will have a physical examination including vital signs measurements. At home, subjects will complete a diary card for the registration of local and systemic adverse events. The immune response in blood will be measured. For the investigation of the mucosal immune response, a smear from the mucosa of vagina and rectum will be taken and investigated at four visits. This will be performed with special sponges and it is a painless procedure. Total duration of the study for each subject will be 32-34 weeks. HIV infection due to this vaccination is not possible.</detailed_description>
