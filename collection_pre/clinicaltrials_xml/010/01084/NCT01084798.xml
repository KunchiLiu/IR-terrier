	<brief_summary>This is an observational, non comparative, non-randomised, open-label, retrospective, single centre study planned to collect the data of subjects diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS) as per Poser or McDonald criteria between 1997 and 2007 in Taiwan. The clinical features and annual relapse rate in the first five years after the onset of disease have been compared between conventional and optico-spinal MS in the earlier studies. This study aims to understand the clinical care pathway of MS subjects and facilitate the subject's diagnosis before converting to MS.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Retrospective Study to Understand the Clinical Management of Subjects With Multiple Sclerosis at a Site in Taiwan Over the Last 10 Years</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multiple Sclerosis is a chronic, inflammatory disease of the central nervous system (CNS) and is characterised by areas of demyelination, or plaques in the CNS. The disease is twice as prevalent in women as compared to men and causes considerable disability over time and continues for the lifetime of the subject. Subjects with MS are thought to have a genetic predisposition for the disease, though environmental factors such as geographic location and possibly viral infection also play an important role in the process of development of the disease. OBJECTIVES Primary objective: - To understand the clinical care pathways of MS subjects at the site over the last 10 years in order to raise the medical attention of MS diagnosis Secondary objective: - To review the pattern of MS treatment regimens in MS subjects at a particular site between 1997 and 2007</detailed_description>
