	<brief_title>OTO-104 for Meniere's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Meniere's disease is a debilitating disorder of the inner ear which includes symptoms such as vertigo, tinnitus, hearing loss and aural fullness. Meniere's disease may result from an imbalance of fluid in the inner ear. Several studies have shown that corticosteroids may help manage this imbalance yet the effect does not last very long. OTO-104 is a longer lasting corticosteroid which could provide significant benefit to patients with Meniere's disease.</detailed_description>
