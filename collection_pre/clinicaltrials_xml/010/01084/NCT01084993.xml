	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Transradial coronary stenting is associated with less risk of access site complications and bleeding compared to femoral approach. Major bleeding post-PCI is a strong independent predictor of mortality and MACE. Depending of the antithrombotic regimen and access-site used, bleeding related to access-site represents 50-80% of the cases. Whereas transradial approach minimizes the risks of access-site bleeding, it has no impact on non-access site bleeding. Peri-procedural anemia is also an independent predictor of mortality and MACE. With femoral approach, bivalirudin compared to heparin ± glycoproteins IIb-IIIa has been associated with a significant reduction in access-site and non-access site related bleeding. In a post-hoc analysis of patients treated by transradial approach in ACUITY, there was a trend for non-access site bleeding (organ bleeding) with bivalirudin compared to heparin ± glycoproteins IIb-IIIa. HYPOTHESES: In patients at high-risk of peri-procedural bleeding, bivalirudin ± glycoproteins IIb-IIIa reduces the risk of bleeding compared to heparin ± glycoproteins IIb-IIIa. In patients at high-risk of bleeding and undergoing transradial PCI, bivalirudin significantly reduces the incidence of non-access site bleeding and peri-procedural anemia.</brief_summary>
