	<brief_summary>The aim of this post-marketing observational study (PMOS) was to obtain further data on long-term safety, efficacy, and quality of life outcomes for adalimumab in routine clinical use in participants with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis after unsustainable clinical response to other biologic disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (BDMARDs). There are few data so far showing the effects of switching from other BDMARDs to adalimumab in patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis. This study was designed to evaluate the long-term effectiveness of adalimumab in participants with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis using the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) in participants previously treated with efalizumab, infliximab, or etanercept and who either never achieved satisfactory response, achieved satisfactory response initially but lost it over time, or discontinued treatment due to intolerance/side effect(s) or other reasons, for example after regular stop of etanercept.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Quality of Life in Adalimumab Treated Psoriasis Patients Failing Other Biologic Disease Modifying Anti-rheumatic Drugs</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This was a non-interventional PMOS conducted in a prospective, single-country, multicenter format to assess the quality of life of psoriasis patients taking adalimumab as prescribed by their physician in accordance with the terms of the local marketing authorization with regard to dose, population, and indication. The prescription of adalimumab was clearly separated from the decision to include the participant in this study. No procedures other than standard of care were to have been performed. Visits were non-interventional and timing of participant appointments was left to each physician. After therapy initiation, visits occurred over 12 months usually close to Weeks 4, 12, 24, 36, and 52 for a total of 6 visits (Visits 1 through 6 including Screening). Because participant visits were left to the physician, participant failure to meet the suggested visit weeks did not constitute a breach of the protocol.</detailed_description>
