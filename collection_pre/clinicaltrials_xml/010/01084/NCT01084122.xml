	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of Intravenous Iron Sucrose in Patients With Hip Fracture to Prevent Perioperative Anemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The main objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intravenous iron sucrose in patients with hip fracture and surgical intervention to prevent perioperative anemia. It will also determine whether intravenous iron sucrose administration improve outcomes as Haemoglobin values, transfusional needs, postoperative complications, length of hospital stay and cost-effectiveness.</detailed_description>
