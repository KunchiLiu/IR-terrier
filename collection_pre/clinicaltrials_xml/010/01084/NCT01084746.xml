	<brief_summary>The primary goal of this research project is to conduct a 5-year prospective randomized trial of a theory-based intervention to increase patient completion of colorectal cancer screening (CRCS) among patients ages 50 to 64 years old.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tailored Interactive Intervention to Increase CRCS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Specific Aim 1: Identify behavioral, social, and environmental factors associated with CRCS in male and female patients ages 50 to 64 years old in a primary care practice in Houston, Texas. 1.1. Update literature reviews of CRCS adherence. 1.2. Conduct secondary analysis of relevant data from other projects. 1.3. Conduct focus groups with primary care patients to determine their knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs about CRCS and to gather data to use for development of the educational intervention. Specific Aim 2: Develop a personal computer (PC)-based tailored interactive intervention based on the transtheoretical (stages of change) model to increase CRCS in accordance with American Cancer Society (ACS) CRCS guidelines. Specific Aim 3: Evaluate the effectiveness of the PC-based tailored interactive intervention for increasing CRCS through a randomized controlled trial. Specific Aim 4: Analyze the relationship between a number of predictor variables and CRCS completion in order to develop a more complete conceptual framework for understanding screening adherence. Specific Aim 5: Conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis of the PC-based tailored interactive intervention for increasing CRCS in a primary care setting.</detailed_description>
