	<criteria>Age &gt; 18 years Clinical evidence of stable or unstable angina or a positive functional study Single, stenotic de novo lesion in a native coronary artery, type A or selected B1 (see 4.3.1.1 Definition of lesion types) Diameter stenosis &gt; 70% (visual estimate) Vessel diameter 2.5 3.5 mm Female patients can enter this study if they are postmenopausal for at least two years or have undergone hysterectomy or sterilization Signed patient informed consent form Patient's and treating physician's agree that the patient will return for all required post procedure followup assessments as defined in the clinical protocol Left ventricular ejection fraction of &lt; 30% Visible thrombus proximal to the lesion Expection that treatment with devices other than PTCA will be required for this lesion. Stenosis is within a bypass graft Known hypersensitivity or contraindication to aspirin, heparin, clopidogrel, paclitaxel, or a sensitivity to contrast media which cannot be adequately premedicated Other medical illness (i.e. cancer, liver disease or congestive heart failure) that may require cytostatic or radiation therapy, cause the subject to be noncompliant with the protocol, confound the data interpretation or is associated with limited lifeexpectancy (i.e., less than two years). Acute myocardial infarction within the past 72 hours of the intended treatment (defined as: Q wave infarction having total creatinine kinase (CK) &gt;3 times the upper normal limit, or CK remains elevated above hospital normal at time of treatment) Chronic renal insufficiency with serum creatinine &gt; 2.0 mg% Significant gastrointestinal (GI) bleed within the past six months. History of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy or will refuse blood transfusions Extensive peripheral vascular disease that precludes safe 6 French sheath insertion and / or requires additional antiplatelet and / or anticoagulation treatment. Participating in another device or drug study within the last 6 months which may interfere with the interpretation of results of this study</criteria>
