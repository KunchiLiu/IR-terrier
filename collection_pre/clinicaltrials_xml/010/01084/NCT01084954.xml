	<brief_summary>Validate a simple and cost-effective Nucleic Acid Test for HIV Detection in order to develop a rapid, highly sensitive and specific, one-stage test for the diagnosis of HIV infection. Blood samples collected will be assayed using the BioHelix Corporation helicase-dependent amplification or the Cepheid Xpert HIV-1 Quant Assay. A false negative or false positive rate of &gt;1.0% would make this test unacceptable as a screening test for HIV viremia.</brief_summary>
