	<brief_title>Inspiratory Muscle Training After Gastroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Gastroplasties, like other major abdominal surgeries, induce mechanical changes in the lungs and decreases of the respiratory muscle strength in the post-operative periods. Depending on the occurrence of pre-existing disturbs, obese patients may exhibit severe declines of respiratory function after these surgeries. Post-operative respiratory physiotherapy is a valuable intervention, involving a set of techniques aimed to expand pulmonary volumes and to improve arterial oxygenation, leading to decreases on the development of atelectasis and pneumonias. It induces faster recovery of respiratory function and reduction of lung complications, what may be particularly important in high-risk patients like over-weighted subjects. There are scanty data about the role of respiratory muscle training in the post-operative period. This is particularly true regarding inspiratory muscle training of obese patients submitted to gastroplasties.</detailed_description>
