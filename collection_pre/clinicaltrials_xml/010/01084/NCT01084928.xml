	<brief_summary>The South Asian Community, people with origins in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Maldives, Nepal, Sri Lanka, or Bhutan, are more likely to get diabetes, get diabetes at younger ages, and do worse health-wise once they have diabetes than the general population. This study will test the feasibility and community acceptability of a culturally appropriate lifestyle intervention for the prevention of diabetes in the South Asian community. The outcomes of this project could be used to plan larger interventions to prevent diabetes in South Asians, a rapidly growing segment of the US population.</brief_summary>
