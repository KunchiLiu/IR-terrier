	<brief_summary>Gastric gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) less than 2 cm are usually followed up conservatively. However, little is known about the natural course of small GISTs. The goal of this study was to evaluate the clinical course of the small EUS-suspected gastric GISTs and to determine the size predicting subsequent progression with increased malignant potential.</brief_summary>
