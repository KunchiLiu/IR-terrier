	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: Phase 1: To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/maximum administered dose (MAD) of SAR650984 (Isatuximab). Phase 2 (stage 1): To evaluate the activity of single-agent Isatuximab at different doses/schedules and to select dose and regimen to further evaluate the overall response rate (ORR) of Isatuximab as single agent or in combination with dexamethasone. Phase 2 (stage 2): To evaluate the activity in terms of overall response rate (ORR) of Isatuximab at the selected dose/schedule from stage1, as single agent (ISA arm) and in combination with dexamethasone (ISAdex arm). Secondary Objectives: Phase 1: - To characterize the global safety profile including cumulative toxicities. - To evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of Isatuximab in the proposed dosing schedule(s). - To assess the pharmacodynamics (PD), immune response, and preliminary disease response. Phase 2 (stage 1): to evaluate the following objectives for Isatuximab as single agent: - Safety - Efficacy as measured by duration of response, clinical benefit rate, progression free survival, overall survival. Phase 2 (stage 2): to evaluate the following objectives in each arm (ISA and ISAdex): - Safety - Efficacy as measured by duration of response, clinical benefit rate, progression free survival, overall survival.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 1/2 Dose Escalation and Efficacy Study of Anti-CD38 Monoclonal Antibody in Patients With Selected CD38+ Hematological Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Phase 1 study duration for an individual patient will include a screening period for inclusion of up to 2 weeks, treatment with Isatuximab QW (every week) or Q2W (every 2 weeks) unless discontinued earlier due to safety or disease progression. Patients will be followed for a minimum of 30 days following the last use of study drug or more than 30 days in case of unresolved toxicity, or up to initiation of another anticancer treatment. The Phase 2 study duration for an individual patient will include a screening period for inclusion of up to 3 weeks, then a treatment period and a follow up period. Treatment will continue until disease progression, unacceptable adverse reactions or other reasons for discontinuation. Patients will be followed every 3 months following the last use of study drug until death or study cutoff whichever comes first.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: Phase 1: For dose escalation cohorts, patients with confirmed selected CD38+ hematological malignancies as specified below who have progressed on after standard therapy or for whom there is no effective standard therapy (refractory/relapsed patients). Bcell NonHodgkinlymphoma/leukemia (NHL) patients having at least 1 measurable lesion. Multiple myeloma (MM) patients with measurable Mprotein serum and/or 24hour urine. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients, all types except M3 based on FrenchAmericanBritish (FAB) classification. Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (Bcell ALL) patients. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients. For expansion cohorts, patients with relapsed/refractory MM with measurable Mprotein (serum Mprotein of &gt;0.5 g/dL and/or urine Mprotein of &gt;200 mg (24hr urine)) or elevated serum free light chains (FLC) &gt;10 mg/dL with abnormal FLC ratio) who have progressed on or after standard therapy that includes an iMiD and a proteasome inhibitor and who meet the protocol defined criteria for standard risk or high risk. Phase 2: Patients must have a known diagnosis of multiple myeloma with evidence of measurable disease, and have evidence of disease progression based on International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria: Serum Mprotein ≥1 g/dL, or urine Mprotein ≥200 mg/24 hours or in the absence of measurable mprotein, serum FLC ≥10 mg/dL, and abnormal serum immunoglobulin kappa lambda FLC ratio (&lt;0.26 or &gt;1.65). Patients must have received at least three prior lines of therapy for MM and must include treatment with an Immunomodulatory drug (IMiD) (for ≥2 cycles or ≥2 months of treatment) and a proteasome inhibitor (PI) (for ≥2 cycles or ≥2 months of treatment) OR patients whose disease is double refractory to an IMiD and a PI. For patients who have received more than 1 type of IMiD and PI, their disease must be refractory to the most recent one. Patients must have achieved a minimal response or better to at least one prior line of therapy. Patients must have received an alkylating agent (≥2 cycles or ≥2 months) either alone or in combination with other MM treatments. Stage 2 only: Patients must have evidence of disease progression on or after the most recent prior regimen based on IMWG criteria. Exclusion criteria: Phase 1: Karnofsky performance status &lt;60 Poor bone marrow reserve Poor organ function Known intolerance to infused protein products, sucrose, histidine, polysorbate 80 or known hypersensitivity to any of the components of the study therapy that is not amenable to premedication with steroids and H2 blockers Any serious active disease (including clinically significant infection that is chronic, recurrent, or active) or comorbid condition, which, in the opinion of the investigator, could interfere with the safety, the compliance with the study or with the interpretation of the results Any severe underlying medical conditions including presence of laboratory abnormalities, which could impair the ability to participate in the study or the interpretation of its results Phase 2: Patients with multiple myeloma immunoglobulin M (IgM) subtype Previous treatment with any antiCD38 therapy Patients with concurrent plasma cell leukemia Patients with known or suspected amyloidosis Karnofsky performance status &lt;60 (stage 1)/ECOG Performance status &gt;2 (stage 2). Poor bone marrow reserve Poor organ function Known intolerance to infused protein products, sucrose, histidine, polysorbate 80 or known hypersensitivity to any of the components of the study therapy that is not amenable to premedication with steroids and H2 blockers Any serious active disease (including clinically significant infection that is chronic, recurrent, or active) or comorbid condition, which, in the opinion of the investigator, could interfere with the safety, the compliance with the study or with the interpretation of the results Any severe underlying medical conditions including presence of laboratory abnormalities, which could impair the ability to participate in the study or the interpretation of its results The above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a patient's potential participation in a clinical trial.</criteria>
