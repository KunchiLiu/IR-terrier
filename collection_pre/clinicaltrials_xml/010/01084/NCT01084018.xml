	<brief_summary>The purpose of this project is to develop and evaluate the effects of a computer-tailored intervention targeting pain barriers and catastrophizing in adults having cardiac surgery. The hypotheses are that in the experimental group, in comparison to the control group, participants will show lower levels of pain, less pain interference in their activities, less attitudinal barriers, and less pain catastrophizing. A pilot-RCT is privileged to assess the preliminary effects of the intervention on the following outcomes: pain intensity, analgesic consumption, pain interference, barriers and pain catastrophizing.</brief_summary>
