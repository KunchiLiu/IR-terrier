	<brief_title>Trial of the Use of Antenatal Corticosteroids in Developing Countries</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One of the United Nations Millennium Summit goals is to reduce the deaths of children &lt;5 years by two-thirds for 2015 (UN, 2000). Given that 38% of all under-five deaths worldwide occur in the first four weeks of life, the goal seems unattainable unless a significant fraction of the neonatal deaths are prevented (Darmstadt et al., 2005). Thus, the provision of health care during the perinatal period in developing countries is a top priority. Preterm birth is a major cause of neonatal mortality, currently responsible for 28% of the deaths overall. As the contribution of preterm birth to neonatal deaths is well above 50% (MacDorman et al., 2005) in middle and high income countries, it is expected that as low income countries improve their development, the relative importance of this cause will increase. One of the most powerful perinatal interventions to reduce neonatal mortality is the administration of antenatal corticosteroids to pregnant women at high risk of preterm birth. The primary objective will be to evaluate whether a cluster-level multifaceted intervention, including components to improve the identification of pregnancies at high risk of preterm birth and providing and facilitating the appropriate use of steroids, reduces neonatal mortality at 28 days of life in preterm newborns, compared with the standard delivery of care in selected populations of six African, Asian, and Latin American countries.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>This is an intenttotreat design and thus all pregnancy outcomes of women who deliver in the study clusters and provide consent will be collected. Clusterlevel inclusion criteria include At least 250 deliveries per year. Birth attendants within the health cluster will be consented to participate Participantlevel inclusion criteria include all pregnant women living in and delivering in the study cluster who: Are between 24 and 36 weeks GA; Present with signs of preterm labor, amniotic fluid leakage, hemorrhage, or hypertension; Provide consent for injection or present to a facility where it is standard of care. There will not be any specific exclusion criteria for clusters or participants.</criteria>
