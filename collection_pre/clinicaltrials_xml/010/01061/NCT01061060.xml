	<brief_title>The Effect of Prostaglandin I2 on the Endothelial Cell Function Disorder in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study plans to include those subjects who have complaint of peripheral microvascular symptoms but have evidences of having neither a coronary arterial disease nor a peripheral arterial disease and show normal findings in the vascular stiffness test (PWV and ABI)) and plethysmography of the legs (PVR)) ,among Type II diabetes mellitus patients of forty-five (45) years old or older, This study is conducted by using a randomized double blind method. These drugs are distributed through a pharmacy in the clinical study center and administered randomly for eight weeks while this study allots patients by using a double blind method. Beraprost Na is administered along with a placebo that was manufactured by the same manufacturer to have the identical exterior look and weight of Beraprost Na. After eight weeks of drug administration, this investigation attempts to verify symptomatic improvement and change in the endothelial function by using VENDYSÂ® and ICG perfusion imaging.</detailed_description>
