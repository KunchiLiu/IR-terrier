	<criteria>Age 18 or greater Bilateral cataracts for which phacoemulsification extraction and posterior IOL implantation has been planned for both eyes Visual potential of 20/25 or better in each eye after cataract removal and IOL implantation Preoperative bestcorrected distance visual acuity (BCDVA) worse than 20/40 Snellen Naturally dilated pupil size (in dim light) &gt; 4.0 mm (with no dilation medications) for both eyes Preoperative corneal astigmatism of 1.0 D or less Clear intraocular media other than cataract Availability, willingness, and sufficient cognitive awareness to comply with examination procedures Use of systemic or ocular medications that may affect vision Acute or chronic disease or illness that would increase risk or confound study results (e.g. diabetes mellitus, immunocompromised, etc.) Subjects with diabetes mellitus Uncontrolled systemic or ocular disease History of ocular trauma or prior ocular surgery Amblyopia or strabismus Known pathology that may affect visual acuity; particularly retinal changes that affect vision (macular degeneration, cystoid macular edema, proliferative diabetic retinopathy, etc.) Diagnosed degenerative visual disorders (e.g. macular degeneration, or other retinal disorders) that are predicted to cause future acuity losses to a level of 20/30 or worse Subjects who may be expected to require retinal laser treatment or other surgical intervention Capsule or zonular abnormalities that may affect postoperative centration or tilt of the lens (e.g. pseudoexfoliation syndrome) Pupil abnormalities (nonreactive, tonic pupils, abnormally shaped pupils, or pupils that do not dilate at least 4.0 mm under mesopic/scotopic conditions) Contact lens usage within 6 months for PMMA contacts lenses, 1 month for gas permeable lenses or 1 week for extendedwear and dailywear soft contact lenses Requiring an intraocular lens &lt; 15.0 or &gt; 26.0 diopters</criteria>
