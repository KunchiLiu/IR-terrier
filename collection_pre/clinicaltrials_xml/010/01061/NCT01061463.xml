	<brief_title>Occupational Cataracts and Lens Opacities in Interventional Cardiology : the O'CLOC Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This cross-sectional study includes cardiologists aged &gt; 40 years: a group of interventional cardiologists (coronary interventionists and electrophysiologists) and a group of unexposed workers (including cardiologists). Individual information, including risk factors of cataracts (age, diabetes, myopia, etc. ...), are collected during a telephone interview. For the exposed group, a specific section of the questionnaire is focused on the occupational history, the description of the procedures (type, frequency, radiation protection tool) and will be used for the classification into "comparable exposure level" groups according to estimates of cumulative dose. For all participants, eye examinations are performed to specifically detect cataracts even in the early stages (lens opacities, LOCS III according to the international standard classification).</detailed_description>
