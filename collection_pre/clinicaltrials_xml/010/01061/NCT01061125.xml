	<brief_summary>This is a randomized pilot study, of post pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) patients to determine the clinical utility of the Implantable Loop Recorder. These type of patients either are monitored with weekly transtelephonic monitoring (TTM) or implantable loop recorder (ILR). The Medtronic Reveal XT loop recorder will be implanted at the time of the PVI or at the 3-4 month PVI follow-up visit and patient care will be managed based on randomization to a blinded or unblinded group. Outcome measures will be compared to aid in decision making regarding anticoagulation and overall post ablation clinical management.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Implantable Loop Recorders in Post-atrial Fibrillation (AF) Ablation: RPAF-A</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized pilot study, of post pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) patients to determine the clinical utility of the Implantable Loop Recorder. The Medtronic Reveal XT implantable Loop Recorder is a market released device indicated for patients with clinical syndromes or situations at increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias, and patients who experience transient symptoms that may suggest a cardiac arrhythmia. These type of patients either are monitored with weekly transtelephonic monitoring (TTM) or implantable loop recorder (ILR). Neither approach has been shown to be superior. As both approaches are currently being performed based on physician preference, the investigators propose to study and compare both approaches in a randomized fashion for evidence based practice. The Medtronic Reveal XT loop recorder will be implanted at the time of the PVI or at the 3-4 month PVI follow-up visit and patient care will be managed based on randomization to a blinded or unblinded group. Outcome measures will be compared to aid in decision making regarding anticoagulation and overall post ablation clinical management.</detailed_description>
