	<brief_summary>Primary Objectives: Part A (dose ranging study): To demonstrate that sarilumab (SAR153191/REGN88) on top of methotrexate (MTX) is effective on reduction of signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis at 12 weeks. Part B (pivotal study): To demonstrate that sarilumab added to MTX is effective in: - reduction of signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis at 24 weeks - inhibition of progression of structural damage at 52 weeks - improvement in physical function at 16 weeks Secondary Objectives: Part B: To demonstrate that sarilumab added to MTX is effective in induction of a major clinical response at 52 weeks To assess the safety of sarilumab added to MTX To document the pharmacokinetic profile of sarilumab added to MTX in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis who are inadequate responders to MTX therapy.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The total study duration for a patient is 16-22 weeks (Part A) and 56-62 weeks (Part B) broken down as follows: - Screening: Up to 4 weeks - Treatment: 12 weeks (Part A) and 52 weeks (Part B)* - Follow-up: 6 weeks (for patients who will not continue in the long-term extension study). '*' Patients successfully completing their treatment period will be offered the opportunity to enter the long term extension study LTS11210 (EXTEND).</detailed_description>
