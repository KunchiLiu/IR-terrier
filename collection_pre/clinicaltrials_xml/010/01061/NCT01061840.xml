	<brief_summary>Autologous Vigil™ vaccine expresses rhGMCSF and bi-shRNAfurin from the Vigil™ plasmid. The GMCSF protein is a potent stimulator of the immune system, recruiting immune effectors to the site of intradermal injection and promoting antigen presentation. The furin bifunctional shRNA blocks furin protein production at the post transcriptional and translational levels. This decrease in furin in turn decreases the conversion of the proforms TGFβ1 and TGFβ2 proteins. Also, reduced furin protein levels have a negative feedback inhibition on TGFβ1 and TGFβ2 gene expression, decreasing the levels of their mRNAs. The resulting decrease in TGFβ1 and TGFβ2 proteins reduces the local immunosuppression they cause and promotes tumor surface antigen and MHC protein display.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial of Bi-shRNA-furin and Granulocyte Macrophage Colony Stimulating Factor (GMCSF) Augmented Autologous Tumor Cell Vaccine for Advanced Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Preliminary studies with a variety of vaccines suggest target accessibility (potential immunogenicity) in a variety of solid tumors to immune directed approaches. In an effort to overcome limitations of immunostimulatory cancer vaccines, we have designed a novel autologous vaccine to address inability to fully identify cancer associated antigens, antigen recognition by the immune system (i.e. antigen to immunogen), effector potency, and cancer-induced resistance. We have completed clinical investigations using two different gene vaccine approaches to induce enhancement of tumor antigen recognition which have demonstrated therapeutic efficacy. Specifically, both the use of a GMCSF gene transduced vaccine (GVAX®) and a TGFβ2 antisense gene vaccine (Lucanix®), in separate trials, have demonstrated similar beneficial effects without any evidence of significant toxicity in advanced cancer patients. The GMCSF transgene directly stimulates increased expression of tumor antigen(s) and enhances dendritic cell migration to the vaccination site. TGFβ2 blockade following intracellular TGFβ2 antisense gene expression reduces production of immune inhibiting activity at the vaccine site. This appears to be one of the primary mechanisms of inhibition of immune responsiveness in glioblastoma and lung cancer. In a subsequent Phase I trial we combined both active principles in one autologous vaccine, TAG. TAG vaccine has an excellent safety profile in the first nineteen patients treated (enrollment open to any solid tumor) with one documented CR (melanoma). However, TGFβ1 is the dominant TGFβ family inhibitory effector in the majority of other solid tumors. We describe a unique method of inhibiting both TGFβ1 and TGFβ2 through RNA interference with Furin. We will harvest autologous cancer cells from patients with advanced refractory cancer. We have constructed a bi-shRNAfurin / GMCSF (Vigil™) expression vector plasmid and have successfully demonstrated preclinical activity of the vector function following transfection by electroporation and irradiation of ex vivo autologous tumor cells.</detailed_description>

Pediatric patients must sign an assent with a parent or legal guardian sign a written informed consent. 1. Histologically confirmed advanced or metastatic noncurable solid tumor (if limited to a single lesion may not be a candidate for curative surgery or radiation therapy). Successful vaccine manufacture has resulted from tissue/fluid obtained from the following major organ systems: digestive, endocrine, reproductive, respiratory, and urinary.Individuals manufactured under CLPTL 105 (Phase II Ovarian) may be eligible for enrollment without advanced or metastatic disease. 2. Patients with well differentiated thyroid cancer are eligible for protocol as follows: 1. Surgically unresectable locally recurrent disease and/or metastatic disease following RAI ablation (if locally recurrent and ultrasound (US) positive, baseline FDGPET or MRI will be obtained). 2.
