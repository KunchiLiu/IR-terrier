	<brief_title>Efficacy of Alpha Tocopherol for Prevention of Contrast-induced Nephropathy in Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) increases the likelihood of patient morbidity and mortality following coronary procedures. Contrast agents cause an acute deterioration in renal function via the generation of reactive oxygen species. Vitamin E (alpha tocopherol)was demonstrated to be anti-oxidant and anti-inflammation. The present study was designed to evaluate the administration of antioxidant vitamin E (alpha tocopherol) as a means of preventing CIN in these patients.</detailed_description>
