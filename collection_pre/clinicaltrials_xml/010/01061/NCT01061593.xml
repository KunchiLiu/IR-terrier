	<brief_summary>Dzherelo (Immunoxel) is an oral immunomodulating botanical agent available over-the-counter in Ukraine. After many years of laboratory and clinical testing the formulation was approved in 1997 by the Ministry of Health of Ukraine as a dietary herbal supplement, which enhances immunity against viral and infectious diseases. The goal of this study is to conduct confirmatory clinical trial in Ukraine and Mongolia for TB indications.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Adjunct Immunotherapy With Immunoxel in Patients With TB and TB/HIV</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Phase III, placebo-controlled trial, aimed to seek the therapeutic benefit of Immunoxel in combination with standard of care anti-TB therapy (ATT) at the end of the 1-month period (p&lt;0.05) among subjects with sputum-positive pulmonary TB. The results will be compared to standard ATT therapy + placebo. The trial will consist of one stage with laboratory evaluation after one month. Two cohorts or arms of at least 150 subjects each (total 300) with pulmonary TB positive for sputum AFB smear will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive once-daily, honey lozenge of Immunoxel in combination with standard ATT for 1 month. Patients who receive standard ATT + placebo preparation will be used as a group of comparison.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects who are at least 18 years and are willing and capable of providing informed consent. Both men and nonpregnant women will be included. One group of at least 30 patients will have HIV. Another group of at least 30 patients will have MDRTB. Another group of at least 30 patients will have XDRTB Remaining patients will have drugsensitive TB. They will be randomly assigned to placebo at 1:1 ratio. TB infection documented prior to Study Entry by sputum smear positive staining for acidfast bacilli (AFB). Agreement to participate in the study and to give a sample of blood for HIV testing if required. Readily available home or other address where patient can be easily found at followup studies. Subjects who have already taken Immunoxel in prior trials and those without sufficient baseline data. Those who met inclusion criteria can be retrospectively enrolled. Those who are retreated and relapsed will be eligible as long as they are on the same drug regimen as the rest of patients. Pregnant or breastfeeding women are excluded. Subjects who have taken antiretroviral drugs or immunomodulatory therapies within 2 months prior to Entry: systemic corticosteroids, immune globulin (IV gamma globulin, IVIG), interferons, interleukins, pentoxifylline (Trental), thalidomide, filgrastim (GCSF), sargramostim (GMCSF); dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB), thymosin alpha 1 (thymosin alpha), thymopentin, inosiplex (Isoprinosine), polyribonucleoside (Ampligen), ditiocarb sodium (Imuthiol), any locally available immune modulators, and any other therapeutic or preventive vaccine. Subjects requiring concurrent participation in another experimental research treatment study, or who received an experimental agent within four weeks prior to Study Entry. History of angina, cardiac arrhythmias, clinically significant electrocardiogram abnormalities, or congestive heart failure. Evidence of active or acute cardiac disease, concomitant hypertension, epilepsy, or serious forms of extrapulmonary tuberculosis. History of malignancy, other than minimal Kaposi sarcoma or other localized skin cancer (e.g. &lt;10 cutaneous lesions, no evidence of visceral KS, etc.), or who have had prior cancer chemotherapy. Medical conditions that in the opinion of the local investigator, may obscure the proper observation of the safety or activity of the study treatment; including any acute medical condition of unknown etiology or recent surgery prior to Entry. Medical conditions such as active alcohol or substance abuse, or psychological issues that in the opinion of the local investigator, would interfere with adherence to the requirements of this study.</criteria>
