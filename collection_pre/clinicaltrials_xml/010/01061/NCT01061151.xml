	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to examine effective methods of preventing the transmission of HIV from mother to child during pregnancy, labor and delivery, and breastfeeding. This is one part of the three-part PROMISE study and will be conducted at locations in Africa and other parts of the world where women typically receive a short course of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) during pregnancy and where breastfeeding is common.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluating Strategies to Reduce Mother-to-Child Transmission of HIV Infection in Resource-Limited Countries</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The incidence of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV has decreased in recent years in the United States, Europe, and other resource-advantaged countries. Several factors have contributed to this decrease, including the administration of HAART during pregnancy, caesarean section delivery methods, and the use of formula instead of breastfeeding to feed infants. However, in resource-limited countries, the incidence of pediatric HIV infection remains high. Many pregnant women in these countries do not receive an adequate course of HAART, and the majority breastfeed their children. The PROMISE study is evaluating effective methods of preventing the transmission of HIV from a mother to her baby during pregnancy, labor and delivery, and breastfeeding. This version of the PROMISE study will be conducted at research sites in eastern and southern Africa and other parts of the world where breastfeeding is common. This study is divided into three components (Antepartum, Postpartum, and Maternal Health Components). Each component includes three steps (Steps 1, 2, and 3). Following is a description of each component of the study, and the three steps within each component: 1. Antepartum Component: This part of the study will compare the safety and effectiveness of different HAART regimens at preventing the transmission of HIV during pregnancy, labor, and delivery. Pregnant HIV-infected women will be randomly assigned to one of the following three groups: Arm A: Participants will receive zidovudine (ZDV) + single dose nevirapine (sdNVP) + emtricitabine-tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (Truvada [TRV]) tail. Participants will receive ZDV from study entry through delivery, sdNVP and TRV intrapartum, and TRV postpartum for 7 days or through the Week 1 visit, whichever is later. Arm B: Participants will receive lamivudine (3TC)-zidovudine (ZDV) + lopinavir (LPV)-ritonavir (RTV). Participants will receive the triple ARV study drug regimen from study entry through the Week 1 visit (6-14 days postpartum). Arm C: Participants will receive TRV/LPV-RTV. Participants will receive the triple ARV study drug regimen from study entry through the Week 1 visit (6-14 days postpartum). Fixed-dose FTC-TDF-RPV (Complera) may be used as an alternative first-line regimen for mothers who are not able to tolerate or adhere to LPV-RTV or ATV-RTV. The FTC-TDF-RPV regimen is not defined in the protocol and should be determined at the discretion of staff at the study sites. All infants born to women enrolled in this study will receive NVP once a day through 42 days of age or until the Week 6 study visit, whichever is later, regardless of which study arm their mother is enrolled in. Should women need HAART or to switch HAART regimens for their own health, they will be moved into Step 2 or Step 3 of this part of the study. During pregnancy, participants will attend study visits at study entry, 2 and 4 weeks after entry, and then every 4 weeks until labor and delivery. Women and infants will be monitored during labor and delivery and will attend a study visit 6 to 14 days after delivery. Study staff will discuss the other three parts of the study with participants and decide if they are eligible to enroll. Follow-up visits will occur at Weeks 1, 6, 10, and 14. Thereafter, they will be once a month for infants and every 3 months for women. Each study visit will include a medical history review, questionnaires, interviews, physical exam, blood collection, and a breast milk collection (during breastfeeding). 2. Postpartum Component: This part of the study will compare the safety and effectiveness of different HAART regimens at preventing HIV infection in infants who are being breastfed by an HIV-infected mother. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two arms: Arm A: Women will receive LPV-RTV plus TRV from the Week 1 postpartum visit through the end of maternal follow-up (2 to 5 years). Infants will receive NVP once a day through 6 weeks (42 days) of age. Arm B: Infants will receive NVP once a day from 6 (up to 14) days of age until there is no longer a risk of MTCT or until the end of follow-up (104 weeks). Until infants are 6 months of age, study visits will occur once a month. After that, study visits will occur once every 3 months. Study visits will include a medical history review, questionnaires, physical exam, blood collection, and a breast milk collection. Should women need HAART or to switch HAART regimens for their own health, they will be moved into Step 2 or Step 3 of this part of the study. If a woman initiates HAART, NVP for her infant should be discontinued when the mother has been on HAART for 12 weeks or when her viral load has been suppressed to undetectable levels, whichever comes first. As part of an optional substudy, study researchers may collect hair samples from women and infants at some study visits to measure antiretroviral drug concentrations present in the hair. Another optional substudy will examine antibody responses in plasma and breast milk in some participants. No additional study visits or procedures will be required for this substudy. 3. Maternal Health Component: This part of the study will examine if women who received a triple ARV regimen during pregnancy and while breastfeeding have better health outcomes than women who discontinue a triple ARV regimen. Participants will include women who were receiving the triple ARV regimen in the Postpartum Component or receiving the triple ARV regimen in the Antepartum Component and were ineligible for the Postpartum Component. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two study arms: Arm A: Participants will continue to receive the triple ARV regimen (TRV and LPV-RTV). Arm B: Participants will discontinue the triple ARV regimen. Study visits will occur at Weeks 4 and 12 and then every 3 months thereafter. Study visits will include a medical history review, questionnaires, physical exam, and blood collection. Should women need a triple ARV regimen or to switch triple ARV regimens for their own health, they will be moved into Step 2 or Step 3 of this part of the study. As part of an optional substudy, study researchers may collect hair samples from some women at certain study visits to measure antiretroviral drug concentrations present in the hair. The total duration of the three study components is 5 years. Women will remain in the study for follow-up for 2 to 5 years, depending on when they enroll. Infants will remain in the study through 74 to 104 weeks of age. Follow-up for all women and infants will be completed by the end of September 2016. As of October 1, 2014, participants are no longer being enrolled in any of the three components of this study. Women who have completed one of the Antepartum Component regimens should be referred for care according to the standard of care for postpartum women in their country. Study-supplied drugs may be provided to these women if the drugs are not available as a country's standard of care and if a woman and her health care provider decide that continuing the study drugs would be in her best interest.</detailed_description>
