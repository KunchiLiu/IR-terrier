	<brief_title>Pregabalin and Radicular Pain Study (PARPS)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The treatment of neuropathic pain is clinically challenging, and pain from cervical spondylosis (CS) is a common variant. This may result from degenerative spinal canal/cord stenosis (cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM)) or lateral recesses compromise, leading to nerve root compression (cervical spondylotic radiculopathy (CSR)). Pregabalin is a newly registered drug for the treatment of neuropathic pain. Its efficacy has been proven in randomised, placebo-controlled trials for post-herpetic neuralgia and diabetic neuropathy. However, its efficacy in CS with underlying CSR or CSM has not been established. Additionally, there are no data to date on its use in Asian patients. In this study, we prospectively evaluate its efficacy for treating neuropathic pain in degenerative CSR/ CSM 60 patients in an open-labelled, add on fashion. Self-evaluation and investigator rated scoring will be implemented. The results will be of value in the non-operative management of CS.</detailed_description>
