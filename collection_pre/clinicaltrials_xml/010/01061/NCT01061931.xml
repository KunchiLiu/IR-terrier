	<brief_summary>The purpose of this prospective randomized single-center trial is to compare efficiency and safety of two pulmonary vein ablation systems in patients with symptomatic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation using the Arctic Front® versus the HD Mesh Ablator® catheter.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mesh Ablator Versus Cryoballoon Pulmonary Vein Ablation of Symptomatic Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary objective: • Efficacy of pulmonary vein isolation defined by achieving an exit block for all pulmonary veins per patient. Secondary objectives: - Detecting (silent) cerebral thromboembolism using neuro(psychological) tests and brain MRI prior and within 2 days after PV ablation. - Detecting (silent) cerebral thromboembolism using neuro(psychological) tests and brain MRI within 6 months after PV ablation. - Determination of spontaneous recurrence rate of atrial fibrillation using a subcutaneously implanted loop recorder (Reveal XT®). - Characterization of non-neurological major complications (death, atrial-esophageal fistula, pulmonary vein stenosis, pericardial tamponade) - Rate of iatrogenic interatrial septal defects after transseptal puncture for PV ablation.</detailed_description>
