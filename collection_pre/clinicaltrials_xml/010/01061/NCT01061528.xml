	<brief_summary>The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of a new type of exposure- and acceptance-based smoking cessation treatment vs. standard behavioral smoking cessation treatment, in conjunction with the use of the transdermal nicotine patch. In both treatments, participants will receive one 60-minute individual session, seven 2-hour group sessions and two individual brief telephone contacts over an eight-week period. Both treatments include 8 weeks of transdermal nicotine patch, which will begin at the time of quitting smoking and will continue after the treatment sessions have ended. Participants will provide follow-up data with regard to their smoking status through a one-year follow-up period.</brief_summary>
