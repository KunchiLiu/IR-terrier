	<brief_summary>Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) continues to be the primary therapy prescribed for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Although effective, adherence to CPAP is suboptimal in many patients, making alternative therapies desirable. Recently, a novel device (Provent™) has been developed for the treatment of snoring and OSA. The purpose of the current study is to examine how well the Provent™ device treats OSA with particular attention to the how the it may treat sleep apnea and who may most likely benefit from the use of this treatment.</brief_summary>
