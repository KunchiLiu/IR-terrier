	<brief_title>Bioavailability Study of Long Chain Omega-3 Fatty Acids From a Gastric Stable Emulsion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The present study comprises the design of as well as the effect of pre-emulsification of ω-3 fatty acids on the bioavailability of docosahexaenoic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid. In-vitro studies have shown that long-term steric stabilization of an o/w-emulsion is obtained by arresting the oil droplets in a gelatin continuous gel matrix. The emulsion was also stable upon dissolution of the gel matrix at physiological conditions in-vitro and is hence referred to as a gastric stable emulsion (GSE). In the bioavailability study, healthy young students were recruited and presented two different single-dose treatments of fish oil containing 5 grams of ω-3 fatty acids; one group receiving the fatty acids in traditional soft gel capsules, whereas the other group received the fatty acids using the GSE technology. Time resolved (2 - 26 hours) blood plasma analysis after intake of this single dose ω-3 fatty acids revealed significantly increased AUC0-26h and Cmax of EPA and EPA + DHA when administered as GSE compared to traditional soft gel capsules.</detailed_description>
