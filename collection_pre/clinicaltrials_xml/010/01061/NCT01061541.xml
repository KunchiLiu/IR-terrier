	<brief_summary>In order to reduce the amount of thiomersal in its vaccines, GSK Biologicals has developed a DTPw-HBV vaccine with low thiomersal content (Tritanrix™- HepB low thio). This vaccine is to be used in combination with a Hib low dose vaccine containing 2.5µg of PRP antigen (Hib 2.5). The purpose of this study is to generate clinical data with Tritanrix™-HepB low thio vaccine when extemporaneously mixed with Hib 2.5 vaccine. The control group will receive Tritanrix™-HepB/Hiberix™. Subjects received primary vaccination in study 208108/091 (double blind). Of these subjects 50% were randomised to participate in the PRP challenge study (208108/092) (open), and all subjects will be invited to participate in a booster study DTPWHBV=HIB2.5-093 (101477).</brief_summary>
