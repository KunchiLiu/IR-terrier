	<criteria>Male or female subjects, 21 years of age or older Written, informed consent and HIPPA Authorization Has 20/40 or better best corrected visual acuity in the surgical eye at the Day 1 postop visit (Visit 3) Has undergone cataract surgery in only one eye and has received a Tecnis multifocal intraocular lens in the study eye. Patients not currently using any artificial tears regularly, or using low viscosity tears for symptom relief (Refresh Tears, Visine Tears, Tears Naturelle, etc.) Likely to complete the entire course of the study. Use of systemic or ocular medications that may affect vision Acute or chronic disease or illness that would increase risk or confound study results (e.g. diabetes mellitus, immunocompromised, etc.) Subjects with diabetes mellitus Uncontrolled systemic or ocular disease History of ocular trauma or prior ocular surgery Amblyopia or strabismus Known pathology that may affect visual acuity; particularly retinal changes that affect vision (macular degeneration, cystoid macular edema, proliferative diabetic retinopathy, etc.) Diagnosed degenerative visual disorders (e.g. macular degeneration, or other retinal disorders) that are predicted to cause future acuity losses to a level of 20/30 or worse Subjects who may be expected to require retinal laser treatment or other surgical intervention Capsule or zonular abnormalities that may affect postoperative centration or tilt of the lens (e.g. pseudoexfoliation syndrome) Pupil abnormalities (nonreactive, tonic pupils, abnormally shaped pupils, or pupils that do not dilate at least 4.0 mm under mesopic/scotopic conditions) Contact lens usage within 6 months for PMMA contacts lenses, 1 month for gas permeable lenses or 1 week for extendedwear and dailywear soft contact lenses A subject whose bestcorrected visual acuity is worse than 20/40 in their surgical eye A subject with any UNCONTROLLED systemic disease. A potential subject in whom therapy for a systemic disease is not yet stabilized will not be considered for entry into the study A subject that required the use of any artificial tear supplements, vasoconstrictor and/or redness reliever ocular drops 28 days prior to or during the study period A subject that required the use of cyclosporine ocular drops 3 months prior to or during the study period A subject with active ocular inflammation or corneal edema beyond what is expected on Day 1 after cataract surgery in the study eye A subject with a history of conjunctivitis or ocular infection in the study eye within the past 3 months, or a history of keratorefractive surgery in the study eye within the past 6 months of entry in to the study A subject that has punctual plug(s), intracanalicular plug(s) or a history of punctual cautery in the study eye</criteria>
