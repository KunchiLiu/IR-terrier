	<brief_summary>JJ ureteral stent represents an advance in the management of the upper urinary tract obstruction as it allows the patient to resume his activities although he is stented between the kidney and the bladder. However, in many cases, this JJ stent is not well tolerated and can even be unbearable. This trial evaluates the benefit of tamsulosin (an alpha-blocker) in improving the tolerance of JJ stents compared to low-doses of phloroglucinol.</brief_summary>
