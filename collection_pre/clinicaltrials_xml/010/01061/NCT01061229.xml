	<brief_summary>The main aim of the study is to determine whether a homeopathic drug in the potency C12 provokes more characteristic homeopathic proving symptoms after three weeks compared to a placebo in healthy volunteers. Secondary aims are to develop and to test a qualitative analysis methodology on which to base a definition for drug-specific (characteristic) symptoms and to compile a profile of characteristic homeopathic proving symptoms of the drug being trialled for therapeutic purposes. This study protocol adapts the traditional homeopathic drug proving methodology to a modern clinical trial design.</brief_summary>
