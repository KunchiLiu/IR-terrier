	<brief_summary>This study is being done to identify if certain sequences (patterns) of key genes (called polymorphisms) may predict a response to fertility medications. The investigators will also determine if the individual response to fertility medications affects pregnancy rates in in-vitro fertilization.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) Receptor Polymorphisms in In-Vitro Fertilization Cycles.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All IVF patients who meet inclusion criteria and not exclusion criteria will be asked to participate in this study. Upon consent, a blood sample will be obtained in 2 EDTA containing lavender topped tubes before, during or within 3 months after their IVF cycle. Genomic DNA will be extracted and saved for genotyping. The Investigators will collect data on each individual's age, ethnic background, and estradiol levels on the day of hCG administration, total gonadotropin amount, clinical pregnancy rates, basal FSH levels, and occurrence of OHSS. The Investigators will then analyze all samples from all patients for their FSH receptor genotypes. Patients will be compensated $75 via a check within 6-8 weeks of their blood drawn.</detailed_description>
