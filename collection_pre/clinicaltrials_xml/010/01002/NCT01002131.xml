	<brief_title>Exact Localisation of Impacted and Supernumerary Teeth by Cone Beam Computer Tomography</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An exact localisation of impacted teeth is often difficult to assume by using conventional radiological techniques like OPT or dental films. In contrast to these two-dimensional imaging methods the Cone Beam Computer Tomography (CBCT) respectively the Digital Volume Tomography (DVT) offers a three-dimensional imaging of the maxillofacial region, providing the opportunity to study objectives in all standard plans with 3D-reconstruction in multisection views. A preoperative radiological investigation using CBCT on patients who are supposed to undergo surgery for impacted and supernumerary teeth in the frontal maxilla shall clarify the certainty and safeness of this 3D-imaging method. Therefore a comparison between the findings on the CBCT, on eventually former conventional x-rays and the intraoperative finding as gold standard is done.</detailed_description>
