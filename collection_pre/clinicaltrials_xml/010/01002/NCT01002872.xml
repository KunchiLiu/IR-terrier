	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to assess the effects of the drug lanthanum carbonate (a phosphorus binder drug) on c-terminal and on FGF23 levels in patients with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD). Targeting FGF23 measurement in CKD patients may impact both the progression of kidney disease and patient mortality.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect of Lanthanum Carbonate on Fibroblast Growth Factor 23 ( FGF23) in Chronic Kidney Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a double blind randomized placebo controlled pilot study. Subjects with Chronic Kidney Disease ( CKD) stages 3-5 who are not undergoing renal replacement therapy and have not been started on phosphate binders will be randomized to either lanthanum carbonate 1500 mg daily or placebo for a 60 day treatment period. Patient doses will be increased up to a maximum dose of 3000 mg if the serum phosphate is greater than 5.5 mg/dL.</detailed_description>
