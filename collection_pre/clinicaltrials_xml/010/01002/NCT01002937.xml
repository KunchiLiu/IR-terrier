	<detailed_description>Renal cancers have different clinical outcomes. The principal research objective is to study tumour tissue from renal cancer patients and try and understand why some cancers progress more rapidly than others. Further, another key aim of this study is to try and understand why some patients respond to treatment and others do not.</detailed_description>
