	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to evaluate the role of clindamycin and artesunate as possible combination partners for fosmidomycin to protect it from its susceptibility to recrudescent infections when used as monotherapy for acute Plasmodium falciparum malaria while retaining its excellent safety profile</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fosmidomycin With Clindamycin or With Clindamycin Plus Artesunate</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The scientific rationale for the use of this combination is to inhibit the ability of the parasite to synthesise isoprenoids, as precursors of many essential compounds including sterols, carotenoids and ubiquinones. This is effected through blockade of the non-mevalonate pathway by fosmidomycin as a potent inhibitor of 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate reductoisomerase coupled with targeting of protein biosynthesis by azithromycin through binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit. This mode of action contrasts with the ability of the human host to utilise the mevalonate pathway for isoprenoid synthesis and accounts for the safety profiles of both drugs through the mechanism of selective toxicity. Moreover it affords protection against cross resistance with existing chemotherapeutic agents.</detailed_description>
