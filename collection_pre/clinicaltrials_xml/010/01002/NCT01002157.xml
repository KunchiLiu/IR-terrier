	<brief_summary>Both Coronary Artery Calcification (CAC)and its annual progression are a strong predictors of cardiovascular events. The development of arterial calcification results from imbalance between calcification promoting and inhibiting factors. An important inhibitor of calcification is Matrix Gla Protein (MGP): a protein present in the vascular wall where it is synthesized by Vascular Smooth Muscle Cells (VSMC). MGP requires Vitamin K-mediated carboxylation to function properly. Deficiency of Vitamin K has been demonstrated to cause arterial calcification and a diet containing large amounts of Vitamin K2 was associated with lower CAC and cardiovascular risk. In animal studies, active supplementation of Vitamin K2 caused regression of existing arterial calcification. Therefore, the aim of this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial is to investigate whether daily supplementation of Vitamin K2 (Menaquinone-7) to patients with established CAC will lead to a decreased progression-rate of CAC after 24 months of follow-up in comparison to placebo.</brief_summary>
