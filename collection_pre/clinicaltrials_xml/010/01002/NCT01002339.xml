	<brief_summary>New onset diabetes after renal transplantation (NODAT) is a common and severe complication negatively influencing graft and patient survival. Cyclosporine (CsA) and Tacrolimus are the basis of modern immunosuppression. Tacrolimus is superior to CsA in terms of acute rejection and graft function. However, Tacrolimus increases 2 times the risk of NODAT as compared to CsA.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>New onset diabetes after renal transplantation (NODAT) is a common and severe complication negatively influencing graft and patient survival. CsA and Tacrolimus are the basis of modern immunosuppression. Tacrolimus is superior to CsA in terms of acute rejection and graft function. However, increases 2 times the risk of NODAT as compared to CsA. Objectives: a) To compare the incidence of NODAT and glucose intolerance with 3 different regimes: Tacrolimus with rapid steroid withdrawal; Tacrolimus with steroids minimization; and CsA with steroid minimization; b) To compare acute rejection rate, renal function and graft and patient survival between different regimes; and c) to investigate the influence of different regimes on subclinical atheromatosis. A total of 210 patients will be randomized. The primary efficacy variable will be NODAT or glucose intolerance at 1 year; secondary efficacy variables will be acute rejection, renal function, and changes of carotid intima-media thickness over time.</detailed_description>
