	<brief_summary>Cardiovascular disease and mortality is the largest comorbidity within the dialysis population. Nearly 50% of hemodialysis patients will have congestive heart failure at initiation. According to the most recent United States Renal Data System (USRDS), 40% of incident dialysis patients will have a cardiovascular event or die within the first 9 months of dialysis. It has been postulated that Omega-3 fatty acids could provide beneficial cardioprotection in hemodialysis patients. The investigators propose to evaluate Omega-3 fatty acid doses on cardiovascular parameters in an incident hemodialysis population. Initially, this will be a pilot study. Ultimately, the information will be used to adequately plan for a larger intervention trial using Omega-3 fatty acids in incident hemodialysis patients.</brief_summary>
