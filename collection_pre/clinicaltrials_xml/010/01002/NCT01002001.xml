	<brief_summary>Sleep disturbance and sexual dysfunction are common complaints of patients with cirrhosis . The term sleep disturbance describes insomnia, poor quality sleep, circadian rhythm disorders and obstructive sleep apnea and is associated with reduced health-related quality of life (HRQoL) score indices. Sleep and sexual disorders have only been formally evaluated in small studies in these patients and to date, no studies have objectively assessed these patients. In addition, no studies have been performed in these patients after liver transplantation. The investigators' hypothesis is that sleep and sexual disturbance is commonly seen in patients with advanced cirrhosis and improves after liver transplantation. However, despite this, HRQoL remain impaired because of residual sleep disturbance.This study will be unique in providing cross-sectional follow-up of patients with cirrhosis at baseline and after liver transplantation (&gt; 6 months).</brief_summary>
