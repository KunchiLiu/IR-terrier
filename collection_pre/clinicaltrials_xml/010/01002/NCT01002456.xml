	<brief_summary>The overall objective of the proposed pilot study is to begin evaluation of two methods for promoting adherence to guidelines for beta-blocker therapy in heart failure. The design includes site level baseline measurement, feedback, remeasurement after six months, and randomized (by site) comparison samples. The setting is VA sites, with intervention directed at the pharmacy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Beta-Blockers in Heart Failure: Pharmacy-level Intervention Comparison</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Current evidence-based guidelines in VA recommend one of three beta-blockers (carvedilol, metoprolol succinate, or bisoprolol) that have been shown to reduce mortality in heart failure patients with systolic dysfunction, with recommended target doses. However, Pharmacy Benefits Management (PBM) data indicate that prescribing for beta-blockers in heart failure patients that is not in accordance with guidelines is substantial, both in terms of the agent selected and the dose. Sites will be recruited and randomized to two different intensities of intervention to promote adherence to guidelines.</detailed_description>
