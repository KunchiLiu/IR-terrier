	<brief_summary>Plasmodium falciparum isolates display a wide genetic diversity with possibly different properties to induce immune responses. These properties could directly influence the ability to induce protective efficacy. Since 1998 an experimental human malaria infection model at the Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Center (RUNMC) has been very successful in answering questions with regards to immunological mechanisms of human Pf infection. To date only the NF54 strain of Pf has been deployed in this Nijmegen model. However, investigation of heterologous Pf challenge is not only highly informative for our basic understanding of induction of immune responses but also provides an essential model for protective capacity testing in the clinical development of candidate malaria vaccines. Recently, the parasite culture laboratory of the RUNMC has been able to overcome technical hurdles to produce infectious mosquitoes of two genetically different isolates from different geographical regions to increase the portfolio for Phase IIa trials. These isolates, PfA and PfB will be compared with the NF54 strain for parasitic, immunological and clinical features in humans.</brief_summary>
