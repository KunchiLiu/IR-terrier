	<brief_summary>Alzheimer's Dementia (AD) contributes to poor balance, impaired gait and functional status, thereby, increasing the risk of falls. AD is an independent risk factor for hip fractures. Those with balance problems and gait impairments are at higher risk for long term placement and death related to falls. Gait impairments in those with dementia include shortened step length, increased double support time, step to step variability, and decreased gait speed. These gait impairments worsen with dual tasking probably due to common brain areas involved in gait and other cognitive tasks. Exercise interventions improve gait and balance in the elderly. In subjects with existing AD, physical activity has shown to prevent further cognitive decline and improve quality of life and prevent falls. However, it is difficult to engage patients with AD in long term exercise programs. The expense of physical therapy limits its easy accessibility. Use of everyday technology might bridge this gap by providing high level of engagement via the use of multimedia while providing a cost effective alternative. Wii Fit is one such multimedia platform. Wii fit is a Nintendo gaming console used for aerobics, strength training and balance activities. This device includes a balance board that senses weight and shifts in movement and balance. Virtual trainers talk the user through the activity while tracking the user's progress. Although some skilled nursing facilities have started using Wii game system adjunct to routine physical therapy, there have not been any studies. Anecdotal reports note improvement in balance and social benefits using the Wii Fit program. Physical therapists report the ability to customize Wii for each patient. Wii Fit can be successfully used in a cognitively impaired population. A unique feature of this approach is the enjoyment and enthusiasm that many patients derive which is reflected in high levels of engagement. The invesitgators propose an 8 week prospective randomized study with the treatment group receiving the exercise program delivered by Wii-Fit system and the comparison arm receiving a walking exercise program in a community dwelling setting. Subjects in each arm will participate for 30 minutes daily five days a week.</brief_summary>
