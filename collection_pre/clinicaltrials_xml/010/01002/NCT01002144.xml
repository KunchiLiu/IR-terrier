	<brief_summary>Background: Increased serum high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) has been associated with airway inflammation in asthma and may serve as a surrogate marker for the presence of airway hyper-responsiveness (AHR) in this set-up. This study was designed to evaluate the predictive value of hs-CRP for AHR assessed by metacholine challenge test (MCT), in adults with suspected Asthma.</brief_summary>
