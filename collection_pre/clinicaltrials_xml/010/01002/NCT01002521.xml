	<brief_title>Wound Healing In Diabetes (WHy) Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diabetes is linked with vascular complications of the eye, kidney and foot. Barbadians suffer from an unusually high prevalence of diabetic foot complications, which can cause difficult-to-heal foot ulcers and even lead to amputations of the toes or feet.Studies from the CDRC have indicated alarmingly high rates of amputation and mortality due to diabetic foot in Barbados. The goal of this study is to improve early detection of persons at risk of the vascular complications of diabetes through non-invasive scanning and genetic susceptibility tests. The general hypothesis to be tested in this study is that persons with diabetes (PWD) and non-healing foot ulcers are more likely to have a disturbed mechanism for wound-healing than PWD without this particular complication. If the hypothesis is proven correct, this will empower patients and physicians with the diagnostic tests to make early interventions towards avoiding the complications of diabetes.</detailed_description>
