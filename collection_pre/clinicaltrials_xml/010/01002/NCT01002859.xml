	<brief_title>Effect of Preliminary Administration of Cyclosporine (Sandimmun ®) on Different Markers of Cardiac Ischaemia Induced by Cardiopulmonary Bypass</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The coronary artery bypass surgery, in spite of substantial improvements during the last years, is still associated to a post-operative mortality and morbidity: myocardial infarction, heart failure, cardiac arrhythmia, renal failure, Stroke. These complications are often due to ischaemia - reperfusion injury event. Recent studies showed that in case of cellular stress (in particular during the reperfusion after ischaemia) a not specific pore, called Mitochondrial permeability transition Pore (MPTP), could be opened. That caused the loss of ion homeostasis, then cell death as well as by apoptosis as by necrosis. Prevent the opening of this MPTP during the myocardial reperfusion after coronary bypass, for example, is an important objective to improve the cardioprotection. The Cyclosporin A, prevents the MPTP from opening. Several studies have shown an cytoprotection led by cyclosporin A, after ischaemia reperfusion in several models as isolated rats heart, in vivo rats heart and ex vivo myocardial ( atrial ) human tissues. Recently, a multicentric study performed in humans, during the acute phase of myocardial infarction, showed a reduction of infarct size by approximately 40% in the cyclosporine group compared to control group.</detailed_description>
