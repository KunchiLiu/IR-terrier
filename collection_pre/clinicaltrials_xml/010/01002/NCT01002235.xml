	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of injecting VM202 in the leg muscle in patients with painful diabetic neuropathy (DPN). The study will also assess the potential of VM202 to reduce the pain associated with DPN.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Peripheral neuropathy is a serious complication of diabetes. This form of neuropathy carries a high risk of pain, trophic changes and autonomic dysfunction. Currently, there are no approved drugs or interventional strategies known to halt or reverse the progression of DPN. Treatments target pain reduction, physical function improvement, reduction of psychological distress, and quality of life improvements. There is currently no effective treatment for diabetic neuropathy, and good glycemic control is the only way to minimize the risk of occurrence. Clearly, it would be desirable to prevent, impede, or reverse the disrupting and often life-threatening manifestations of peripheral neuropathy by stimulating growth or regeneration of peripheral nerve axons.</detailed_description>

Patients with family history of colon cancer in any first degree relative unless they have undergone a colonoscopy in the last 12 months with negative findings; Elevated PSA unless prostate cancer has been excluded; Subjects requiring &gt; 81 mg daily of acetylsalicylic acid; If &gt; 81 mg are taken at screening, subjects may be enrolled if willing/able to switch to another medication; Major psychiatric disorder in past 6 months; History of drug or alcohol abuse / dependence in the past 2 years; History of recent tobacco abuse (within past 5 years); BMI &gt; 38 kg/m2; Use of an investigational drug or treatment in past 12 months; and Unable or unwilling to give informed consent.</criteria>
