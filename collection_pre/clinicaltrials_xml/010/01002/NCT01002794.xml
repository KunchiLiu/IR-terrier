	<brief_summary>This study is conducted as a collaboration between NAR, Orthopedic Department, Oslo University Hospital,Ullevaal, Hjelp24Nimi Oslo, Norway, and University of Southern Denmark, Odense, Denmark. The investigators hypothesize that exercise is more effective than arthroscopic partial meniscectomy: a) on self-reported outcomes, functional performance and muscle strength in middle-aged patients subsequent to arthroscopic partial meniscectomy for a degenerative meniscus tear, and b) in preventing further development of knee osteoarthritis (OA).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Surgical or Exercise Therapy on Patients With Degenerative Meniscus Tears</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aims of the study are: 1. At 3 months, to investigate the effect of arthroscopic partial meniscectomy versus exercise therapy on muscle strength and knee function in middle-aged patients with degenerative meniscus lesions. 2. At 2 years, to investigate the effect of arthroscopic partial meniscectomy versus exercise therapy on self-reported outcomes in middle aged patients with degenerative meniscus lesions. 3. At 5 years, to describe radiographic changes in knee osteoarthritis development after arthroscopic partial meniscectomy or exercise therapy in middle-aged patients with degenerative meniscus lesions. Patients included in the study will be randomized into one of two groups. The interventions are: arthroscopic partial meniscectomy and supervised neuromuscular- and strength training. Subjects will be tested before and after intervention, at 12 months, 24 months and finally at five years.</detailed_description>
