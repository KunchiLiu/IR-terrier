	<criteria>Patient was previously diagnosed with multiple myeloma based on standard diagnostic criteria. Patients must have relapsed (progressed &gt; 60 days) after their last dose of bortezomibbased therapy. In addition, patients may be relapsed or refractory to other nonbortezomibbased therapies. Patient has received at least 1 but not more than 4 prior antimyeloma regimens and has progressive disease after the most recent treatment regimen. Patients must have adequate organ and marrow function. Patients must not be refractory to any bortezomibcontaining regimen. History of allergic reactions or intolerance attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to perifosine (miltefosine or edelfosine), bortezomib or dexamethasone or any of their components. Prior treatment with perifosine or an investigational proteasome inhibitor. Chemotherapy or other therapy experimental or proven that is or may be active against myeloma within two weeks (14 days) prior to Cycle 1 Day 1.</criteria>
