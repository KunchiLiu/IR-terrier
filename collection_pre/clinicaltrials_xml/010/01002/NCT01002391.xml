	<detailed_description>Surgical site infections (SSI) are wound infections that occur after invasive procedures.Particularly in plastic surgery procedures, to minimize the risk of SSI is imperative, since even minor infections are able to complicate the healing process and harm the cosmetic result. Reduction mammaplasty is an effective and well established procedure performed for the relief of physical pain and discomfort associated with macromastia, which significantly decreases patients' quality of life.Breast reduction has provided long-term relief for most patients, with high patient satisfaction. The demand for this kind of plastic surgery is high.Reduction mammaplasty was the fifth most commonly surgical procedure performed by plastic surgeons in women of United States.Since reduction mammaplasty is associated with a high incidence of wound problems,all effort to minimize the risk of SSI is valid.</detailed_description>
