	<brief_summary>Several studies have shown that there is an increased risk of heart disease in people with HIV. In this study the investigators are looking at the effect of Lovaza (Omega-3 fatty acid) on improving endothelial function and decreasing inflammation which may contribute to this increased risk. The investigators will also be doing studies to analyze coagulation and inflammation markers.</brief_summary>
