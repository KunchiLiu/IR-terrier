	<brief_summary>Primary Objectives: - Study part 1: To determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and the Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) of cabazitaxel administered as a 1-hour infusion in combination with gemcitabine, every 3 weeks in patients with advanced solid malignancies. - Study part 2: To determine the antitumor activity of cabazitaxel in combination with gemcitabine, in an additional extended cohort of 15 patients with advanced solid malignancies treated with the defined MTD, as assessed by objective response rate (ORR) according to the revised guideline for Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST 1.1 criteria). Secondary Objectives: - To assess the safety profile of the combination regimen of cabazitaxel with gemcitabine. - To assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) of cabazitaxel, gemcitabine and its metabolite 2',2' difluorodeoxyuridine (dFdU) when given in combination. - To determine Time to Progression (TTP), Objective Response Rate (ORR), and Duration of Response (DR), in the extended cohort of patients treated at the MTD in Part 2 of the study and the patients who received the MTD in Part 1 component. For study part 1, dose levels were to be escalated according to predefined dose escalation decision rules. The Maximum Administered Dose (MAD) was reached at the dose level when at least 2 patients developed a DLT during the first 3 weeks of treatment. There was no further dose escalation when this dose was achieved. The MTD was defined as the highest dose at which 0 or 1 of 3 to 6 patients, respectively, experienced DLT during the first 3 weeks of treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dose-Escalation, Safety, Pharmacokinetics Study of Cabazitaxel With Gemcitabine In Patients With Solid Tumor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study consisted of a screening phase (maximum length of 21-day), a treatment phase with 21-day treatment cycles and a 30-day follow-up visit after the last dose of study medication. The cut-off date for study part 1 was when last participant completed the first treatment cycle and the subsequent 30 days follow-up. The cut off date for study part 2 was when all participants experienced disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, consent withdrawal or the last participant had completed 26 weeks or 6 cycles on study treatment, whichever came first. Participants could continue to be treated on study as long as they were benefiting from study treatment and had not met study withdrawal criteria. After withdrawal from study treatment, further treatment, if any, was at the discretion of the Investigator.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: Histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced solid malignancy that is metastatic or unresectable, and for which standard curative measures do not exist. Exclusion criteria: Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) &gt; or =2 Anticipation of need for a major surgical procedure or radiation therapy during the study treatment Absence of completion of all prior chemotherapy, biological therapy, targeted noncytotoxic therapy &gt; or = 3 weeks; and radiotherapy &gt; or = 4 weeks prior to registration. For part 2 only, prior treatment with radiotherapy, chemoembolization therapy, or cryotherapy is allowed if these therapies are not directed to the areas of measurable disease being used for the purposes of this protocol. (4 weeks of washout period is required prior to start the treatment in Part 2) Concurrent treatment in another clinical trial or with any other cancer therapy or patients planning to receive these treatments during the study Other concurrent serious illness or medical condition, including active infection or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease History of any other malignancy with the exception of adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, or in situ carcinoma of the cervix uteri Patients without resolution of all clinically significant toxic effects (excluding alopecia) of any prior therapy to grade &lt; or = 1 by National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCICTCAE), version 3.0 or to within the limits listed in the specific inclusion/exclusion criteria Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition, or significant laboratory abnormality requiring further investigation that may cause undue risk for the patient's safety, inhibit protocol participation, or interfere with interpretation of study results, and in the judgment of the investigator would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study Symptomatic brain metastases or leptomeningeal disease. Patients with asymptomatic or stable brain metastases are allowed Women of childbearing potential not protected by highly effective contraceptive method of birth control. All patients of childbearing potential that do not have a negative pregnancy test within the 7 days prior to registration Patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding For part 2, absence of measurable disease as defined by the most current version of the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1. For the Part 1 component, patients with nonmeasurable disease are accepted Inadequate bone marrow or liver or renal organ function Any condition which is considered a contraindication to gemcitabine in the local labelling Prior treatment with cabazitaxel within the last 2 years History of severe hypersensitivity grade 3 or 4 to taxanes, Polysorbate80, or to compounds with similar chemical structures The above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a patient's potential participation in a clinical trial.</criteria>
