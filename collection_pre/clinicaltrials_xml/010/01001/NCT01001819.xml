	<criteria>Affected patients: Two or more of the following symptoms should be present for 12 weeks or more: anterior mucopurulent drainage, posterior mucopurulent drainage; nasal obstruction; and facial painpressurefullness. Signs of nasal inflammation such as discolored mucus, edema of the middle meatus or ethmoid area should be documented by endoscopy. The symptoms of rhinosinusitis have failed to resolve or have recurred after a treatment course with antibiotics and nasal and/or oral steroids. The diagnosis of rhinosinusitis should be confirmed with a CT scan. Patients deny recent (within one year) cigarette smoking or exposure to inhaled substances that are potentially harmful to respiratory epithelium Patients were not previously diagnosed with reactive airway disease or aspirin sensitivity. Patients also must meet the standard criteria for endoscopic sinus surgery and scheduled to undergo their procedure at MMC. Unaffected Patients: Patients undergoing elective nasal surgery at MMC. Patients deny symptoms of allergic rhinitis such as nasal congestion, nasal discharge, itching, sneezing. Patients deny symptoms of chronic or acute rhinosinusitis such as nasal obstruction, facial painfullnesspressure, anosmia, anterior and/or posterior mucopurulent drainage. Nasal endoscopy showed no evidence of nasal inflammatory disease, such as erythema, edema, polyps, or discolored mucus. Patients do not have history of prior sinus surgeries and were not previously diagnosed with CRS. 1. Patients deny recent (within one year) cigarette smoking or exposure to inhaled substances that are potentially harmful to respiratory epithelium. 2. Patients were not diagnosed with reactive airway disease or aspirin sensitivity. The absence of evidence of inflammation, such as inflammatory infiltrate or epithelial dysplasia on histopathologic exam of nasal mucosa obtained during surgical procedure.</criteria>
