	<brief_summary>Introduction: Narrowing of the draining vein occurs in &gt;50% of hemodialysis fistula and left untreated will lead to loss of access. The narrowing is due to excessive growth of tissue in the vessel wall (intimal hyperplasia). The standard treatment is balloon dilatation. However, narrowing will inevitably recur in 2-3 months hence requiring further dilatation. Intimal hyperplasia also occurs in the heart and leg circulation. The drug paclitaxel has been used with great success in preventing intimal hyperplasia in these vessels following balloon dilatation. Administer locally, paclitaxel inhibits excess tissue growth in the vessel wall. The investigators believe that this drug will have similar effect in hemodialysis access.. Objective: To assess the effect of paclitaxel in hemodialysis access with narrowing. Paclitaxel is delivered by a paclitaxel-coated balloon. This balloon dilates the narrow segment and simultaneously delivers paclitaxel to the vessel wall. Methodology: Patients with narrowed hemodialysis access are dilated with the paclitaxel-coated balloon or conventional balloon in randomized manner. The patency of the two groups are evaluated and compared at 6 months follow-up. Potential benefit: Decrease number of balloon dilatations and hence hospital admissions, improve dialysis fistula function, and decrease overall economic cost.</brief_summary>
