	<brief_summary>The objective of the study is to investigate the drug interaction between LC15-0444 and pioglitazone by comparing the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of LC15-0444 and pioglitazone are administered concomitantly and each alone in healthy male subjects.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetic Drug Interaction Between LC15-0444 and Pioglitazone After Oral Administration in Healthy Male Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a randomized, open-label, three-treatment, three-period, three-sequence and crossover design in healthy volunteers to evaluate tolerability, safety and pharmacokinetics after the multiple administration of LC15-0444 and pioglitazone concomitantly or each alone. Eligibility for participation of this study will be determined by demographic information, medical history, physical examination, electrocardiogram (ECG) and clinical laboratory tests within 3 weeks(-21 d ~ -2 d) before drug administration(1 d). Eligible subjects will be randomized to one of three sequence groups. According to the characteristics of anti-diabetic drugs, it is expected to be administered with other anti-diabetic drugs. Therefore, Drug-Drug Interaction with Pioglitazone should be identified in this trial.</detailed_description>
