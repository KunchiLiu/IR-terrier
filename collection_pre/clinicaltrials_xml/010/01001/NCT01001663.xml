	<brief_summary>Is the FemoSeal速 closure device safer and more comfortable than manual compression for femoral artery access closure after coronary angiography?</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of the FemoSeal速 Arterial Closure Device to Manual Compression After Coronary Angiography</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Access site complication after coronary angiography is still a challenge in everyday practice. The FemoSeal速 closure device has proven very safe as shown in the swedish SCAAR registry. This study is aimed to investigate, in a randomized design, if the FemoSeal速 has an advantage in safety and efficacy over manual compression.</detailed_description>
