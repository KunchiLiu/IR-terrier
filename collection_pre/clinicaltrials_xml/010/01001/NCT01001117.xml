	<brief_title>Laser Treatment of the Crystalline Lens</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of the LensAR laser system to surgically intervene within the crystalline lens. The primary goal of this initial study is to establish safety parameters as compared with conventional phacoemulsification procedures, and to evaluate the ability to provide an accurate and consistent anterior capsular opening (capsulotomy).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects must sign and be given a copy of the written informed consent form. Subjects must have elected to undergo lens extraction and foldable monofocal IOL implantation (ideally of the same type), and then elect to have the LensAR laser surgery. Subjects must be willing and able to return for scheduled followup examinations for a minimum of 12 months after surgery. Central 8 mm of clear cornea without vascularization. Subjects with prior anterior segment or vitreoretinal surgical intervention in the eye to be treated. Subjects with lenticular cataracts with nuclear grading greater than Grade 4 on the LOCS III scale. Subjects who cannot attain ocular dilation of 7.0 mm. Subjects with anterior segment pathology in the eye to be treated that is not directly improved by lens extraction and IOL implantation. Subjects with residual, recurrent, active ocular or uncontrolled eyelid disease or any corneal abnormalities (including endothelial dystrophy, guttata, recurrent corneal erosion, etc.) in the eye to be treated. Subjects with ophthalmoscopic signs of keratoconus (or keratoconus suspect) in the eye to be treated. Subjects with a history of severe dry eye not responding to therapy. Subjects with macular degeneration, history of retinal detachment, or any other fundus findings that would pose a risk to safety or an acceptable visual outcome in the eye to be treated. Subjects with a history of herpes zoster or herpes simplex keratitis. Subjects who have a history of steroidresponsive rise in intraocular pressure, glaucoma, or are a glaucoma suspect. Subjects with diabetic retinopathy, autoimmune disease, connective tissue disease, pseudoexfoliation syndrome, or clinically significant atopic syndrome. Subjects on chronic systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive therapy that may affect wound healing, and any immunocompromised subjects. Subjects who are using ophthalmic medication(s) other than artificial tears for treatment of ocular pathology including ocular allergy. Subjects using systemic medications with significant ocular side effects. Subjects who are pregnant, lactating, or of childbearing potential and not practicing a medically approved method of birth control. Subjects with known sensitivity to planned study concomitant medications. Subjects who are participating in any other ophthalmic drug or device clinical trial during the time of this clinical investigation.</criteria>
