Primary Objective: - To describe the yearly persistence of humoral immune response to Japanese encephalitis after a single dose of JE-CV</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Long-term Follow-up of Immunogenicity of a Single Dose of Japanese Encephalitis Chimeric Virus Vaccine in Toddlers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Immunogenicity persistence will be determined in a subset of participants that previously received a single dose of Japanese encephalitis chimeric virus vaccine at age 12 to 18 months in Study JEC02 (NCT 00735644). No vaccination will be given in this study.</detailed_description>
