	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to investigate the use of a new FDA-approved non-invasive bio-impedance cardiac monitor, ICON, to detect hemodynamic effects during sedation in children undergoing radiology procedures. The purpose of the study is to determine the ability of the ICON monitor to identify the anticipated and documented hemodynamic changes in children which occur in response to Dexmedetomidine sedation. The investigators postulate that if the ICON device can trend hemodynamic changes, if any, during dexmedetomidine (DEX) sedation in children the investigators can delineate changes in cardiac output, stroke volume, and systemic vascular resistance associated with observed changes in heart rate and blood pressure.</brief_summary>
