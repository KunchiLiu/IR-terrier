	<brief_summary>For end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients, cardiovascular disease remains the single most common cause of excess morbidity and mortality. Among the examined nontraditional risk factors, an increase in oxidative stress as well as inflammation are postulated to contribute to excessive cardiovascular risk in this population. Flavonoids are naturally occurring substances that possess various pharmacological actions and therapeutic applications. Some due to their phenolic structures have antioxidant effect and inhibit free radical-mediated processes, as well as anti-inflammatory effects. Silymarin,a mixture of three isomeric flavonolignans, is isolated from milk thistle (Silybum marianum) seeds, and is proven to have anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, cell regenerating, and antifibrotic action. In this study, the effect of silymarin on oxidative stress and inflammation (2 major risk factors for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in hemodialysis patients)is evaluated, and compared to vit E, a well known antioxidant.</brief_summary>
