	<brief_summary>To investigate the biosynthesis of PGD2 during percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) procedure.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PGD2 Formation in Vascular Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A) To determine whether biosynthesis of PGD2 is altered in response to vascular injury in humans B) Patients will be grouped base on their aspirin using status. There groups of no aspirin but an alternative anti-platelet medicine, low dose (81 mg) aspirin, high dose 325 mg aspirin will be enrolled.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients with existing CAD admitted for elective PTCA: 1. Treated with any dose of aspirin daily for at least 5 days, with special interest in those treated with 81 mg aspirin daily or 2. Treated with an alternative antiplatelet therapy, such as clopidogrel, due to aspirin hypersensitivity or PMDs preference or 3. No aspirin therapy at all Patients presenting to the ER with Acute Coronary Syndrome(ACS)who will have a PTCA Patients with stable angina or positive stress tests scheduled for a cardiac catheterization History of unstable diabetes (hgb A1c&gt;8 or FBS&gt; 200) Uncontrolled hypertension (SBP &gt; 180, DBP &gt;100) History of an acute confounding disease as judged on clinical screen that according to the investigator may interfere with interpretation of the study results, or compromise the safety of a potential subject. Patients who have taken NSAIDS or COX2 inhibitors other than aspirin, for at least 10 days prior to PTCA</criteria>
