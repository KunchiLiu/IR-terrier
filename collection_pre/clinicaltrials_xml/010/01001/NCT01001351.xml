	<brief_summary>PRT-201 is a recombinant human type-I pancreatic elastase intended for local, long-lasting dilation of the AVG venous anastomosis and outflow vein. The goal of the treatment is to improve primary patency and long-term survival of AVGs and thereby provide patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) a reliable and durable vascular access site for hemodialysis. Recent data indicate that up to three quarters of patients have loss of graft patency at one year, indicating a substantial need for new therapies. This clinical trial will explore the safety and dilatory effect of topically administered PRT-201 on the outflow vein of a newly placed upper extremity AVG.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Age of at least 18 years. 2. Chronic kidney disease with anticipated start of hemodialysis within 3 months or current hemodialysis dependence. 3. Planned creation of a new upper extremity AVG or "jump" graft 1. Patients for whom this is the only potential site for an upper extremity vascular access. 2. Creation of a new AVG or "jump" graft in an upper extremity previously treated with an investigational gene or cell based therapy, or locally with an investigational pharmacological agent. 3. On physical examination or by other means, suspected proximal vein stenosis, occlusion, lack of continuity with the subclavian vein, central venous stenosis or central venous occlusion. 4. History or presence of an arterial aneurysm. 5. Previous treatment with PRT201.</criteria>
