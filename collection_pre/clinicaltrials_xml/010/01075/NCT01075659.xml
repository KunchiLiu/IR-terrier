	<detailed_description>This study compares a new oral Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT) product with NiQuitin™ lozenge 2 mg and 4 mg, respectively, after 5 hours of witnessed nicotine abstinence with respect to urges to smoke during the first 5 minutes after start of treatment. Single doses of each treatment are given during separate treatment visits scheduled in a crossover setting with randomized treatment sequences. The study will include 200 healthy smokers between 19-55 years, who have been smoking at least 10 cigarettes daily during at least one year preceding inclusion, and who smoke within 30 minutes of waking up. Subjects, study personnel and monitor will be aware of what type of product is administered at a given visit, but not of the administered dose of the lozenge.</detailed_description>
