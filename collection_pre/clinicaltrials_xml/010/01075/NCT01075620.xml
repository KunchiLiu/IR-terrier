	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if there are any clinical or radiographic differences in non-posterior stabilized rotating mobile bearing design versus a posterior stabilized rotating mobile bearing designs.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Nonposterior- and Posterior-Stabilized Mobile-Bearing Total Knee Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Out comes measures were to determine 1. whether the knee and function scores and the radiographic results of the knees with a PFC Sigma RP knee prosthesis would be better than those with an LCS RP prosthesis. 2. whether the patients with a PFC RP knee prosthesis would have a better range of knee motion than those with an LCS RP prosthesis. 3. whether patient satisfaction and preference would be better in the patients having a PFC Sigma RP knee prosthesis than those of patients having an LCS RP knee prosthesis 4. whether complication rate would be less in the knees with a PFC sigma RP knee prosthesis than in the knees with an LCS RP prosthesis.</detailed_description>
