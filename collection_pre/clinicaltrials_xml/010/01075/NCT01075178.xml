	<brief_summary>Retrospective medical record review study of specific adverse events in children with congenital heart disease who received palivizumab for prophylaxis of serious respiratory syncytial virus infection and control subjects that did not receive palivizumab</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Retrospective Palivizumab Study in Children With Hemodynamically Significant Congenital Heart Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an observational, non-interventional, retrospective cohort study of infants with hemodynamically significant congenital heart disease (HSCHD) who were less than 24 months of age when the first dose of palivizumab was administered (CASES), and infants who were diagnosed with hemodynamically significant congenital heart disease but did not receive palivizumab in a historical respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) season during the first 24 months of life (CONTROLS). CASES are matched to CONTROLS based on RSV season, age, type of cardiac lesion, and type of prior corrective cardiac surgery. Subject medical records are reviewed for occurrences of the clinical end points of infection, arrhythmia, and/or death that meet criteria for serious adverse events. The groups will be compared for number and percent of subjects who experience these primary serious adverse events (both individually and collectively) during a defined 8-month chart review period.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Subject must have documented hemodynamically significant congenital heart disease (Note: Children with uncomplicated small atrial or ventricular septal defects or patent ductus arteriosus are not eligible). 2. Subject must have unoperated or partially corrected congenital heart disease. 3. Subject must have received at least one dose of palivizumab for prophylaxis during the Respiratory Syncytial Virus season September 1 through April 30 (CASES), or would have been considered eligible for palivizumab prophylaxis (CONTROLS). 4. Subject must be &lt; 24 months of age at the time of the first dose of palivizumab prophylaxis (CASES) or &lt; 32 months of age at the end of the assigned Respiratory Syncytial Virus season in which they would have been eligible to receive palivizumab if the drug had been approved in the European Union (CONTROLS). 5. Subject's parent, guardian, or legal representative has voluntarily signed and dated a Release of Information Form to allow the review of medical records and collection of pertinent study data. 1. Subject was contraindicated for treatment with palivizumab according to the current European product label. 2. Subject had full correction of Congenital Heart Disease. 3. Subject received palivizumab before approval for use in Congenital Heart Disease (CASES), or subject received palivizumab at any time (CONTROLS). 4. Subject has already been included in this study in a prior Respiratory Syncytial Virus season.</criteria>
