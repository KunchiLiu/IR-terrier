	<brief_summary>To date, only a small handful of studies have assessed the effects of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) on cognitive function in healthy adults. The results from these studies are mixed, and have differed greatly in terms of methodology as regards sample size, treatment formulation and duration of the intervention. In order to address these issues, the present study aims to assess the effects of two different formulations of fish oil in parallel, and at doses consistent with the current recommended daily intake of oily fish, across a range of cognitive domains. The aim of the present investigation is therefore to specifically evaluate the effects of 12 weeks supplementation of DHA-rich fish oil and EPA-rich fish oil dietary supplements on cognitive function in healthy young adults maintaining a regular diet containing oily fish not more than once a week. Self-report mood assessments will form the secondary part of this investigation.</brief_summary>
