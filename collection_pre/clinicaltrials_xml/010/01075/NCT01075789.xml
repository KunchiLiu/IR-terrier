	<brief_summary>Nasogastric tube insertion is one of the most common invasive procedures performed in children's hospitals, and has long been recognised as one of the most traumatic and painful. As a once off procedure, a nasogastric tube insertion is extremely distressing but the repeated procedures that many children endure as a necessary part of treatment for a chronic disease can be so traumatic that psychological damage may occur. There have been a limited number of studies carried out which have looked at methods to reduce the pain and trauma associated with this procedure, but most of these have been carried out in the adult population. The investigators propose to carry out a research project in a paediatric setting to definitively investigate the use of local anaesthetic spray, in combination with local anaesthetic gel, to numb the nasal passages and the back of the throat, with the aim of reducing or removing the unpleasant sensation of the nasogastric tube placement. If the study shows a benefit from the use of local anaesthetics, it would be an inexpensive and easily incorporated intervention that could be inserted into the routine procedure for nasogastric tube insertion.</brief_summary>
