	<brief_summary>DHA has previously been shown to increase regional cerebral blood flow response to tactile stimulation in aged monkeys; modulation of cerebral blood flow in humans has yet to be demonstrated. Given that the brain relies on a constant supply of blood-borne metabolic substrates (e.g. glucose, oxygen), increasing regional cerebral blood flow may also have an impact on cognitive function. The current study aims to investigate the effects of two doses of DHA-rich fish oil on task-related cerebral hemodynamic response and cognitive performance in healthy adults.</brief_summary>
