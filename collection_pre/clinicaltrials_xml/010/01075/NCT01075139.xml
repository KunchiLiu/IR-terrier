	<brief_summary>Research has shown that a high percentage of college students do not meet recommended national guidelines for physical activity or fruit/vegetable intake. The purpose of this study was to pilot test the short-term efficacy of a one-on-one, brief motivational intervention (BMI) designed to increase physical activity and fruit/vegetable intake. It was hypothesized that participants in the BMI condition would report greater physical activity and fruit/vegetable intake at follow-up than those in an education-only control condition.</brief_summary>
