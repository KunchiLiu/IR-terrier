	<brief_summary>Many cases of male infertility are poorly understood and regarded as unexplained. Therefore, a etiological treatment for this condition can not be offered in most cases. A beneficial effect on sperm motility was found in trails using antioxidants such as carnitine, zinc and folic acid. However, most studies lacked a sufficient power to detect a significant effect on pregnancy rates. In this study, infertile men with abnormal sperm quality parameters will be randomized to receive either carnitine-based food supplement (Porimore) or folate and Zinc Tablets.</brief_summary>
