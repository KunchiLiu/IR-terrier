	<brief_summary>Ophthalmology ,cornea Autologous serum has long been known to be effective to promote corneal epithelial wound healing in a variety of ocular surface disorders. However, its effectiveness for corneal epithelial defects due to pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) for diabetic retinopathy and penetrating keratoplasty has seldom been reported. In this study, we plan to perform a prospective study to determine the effectiveness of topical autologous serum as a primary treatment for corneal epithelial defect in patients undergoing vitrectomy for diabetic retinopathy and penetrating keratoplasty. All patients enrolled in this study have received corneal epithelial debridement at the end of the ocular surgeries, namely PPV for diabetic retinopathy and penetrating keratoplasty. The patients were grouped into two treatment groups. In the control group, the patients receive conventional postoperative eye drops including topical steroid, antibiotic and mydriatics. In the experimental group, the patients receive topical autologous serum eye drops in addition to conventional postoperative eye drops. The duration for cornea surface to completely re-epithelize, the incidence of corneal complications due to delayed surface re-epithelization (e.g. infectious corneal ulcer, corneal melting, sterile corneal ulcer, corneal neovascularization), and the incidence of recurrent epithelial break down after initial epithelization will be compared between these two groups. Patients undergoing PPV for diabetic retinopathy and penetrating keratoplasty will be compared separately</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Topical Autologous Serum Application for the Treatment of Corneal Epithelium Defect After Ocular Surgeries</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Purpose: To evaluate the treatment effect of autologous serum eye drops for promoting corneal epithelium wound healing in patients receiving pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) for diabetic retinopathy and penetrating keratoplasty. Background: During PPV for diabetic retinopathy retinopathy and penetrating keratoplasty, removal of the edematous corneal epithelial layer was usually required in order to obtain a better surgical view or enhance the postoperative epithelial wound healing process. However, delayed epithelial healing was frequently found in these patients after surgeries. In addition, corneal epithelial defect is also frequent found in diabetic patients after PPV even corneal epithelial debridement is not performed during the operation. Autologous serum, the fluid component of full blood after blood clotting, contains a large variety of growth factors, vitamins, and immunoglobulins. These epitheliotropic factors are thought to be responsible for the therapeutic effect of serum observed on ocular surface disorders. The effects of serum to promote epithelial wound healing have been well documented in cell culture system in a variety of epithelial cell types including corneal epithelial cells. Autologous serum eye drops have also been demonstrated to be beneficial in the treatment of persistent corneal epithelial defects. In this study, we planned a prospective study to determine the effectiveness of autologous serum tears as a primary treatment in corneal epithelial defect following vitrectomy in diabetic patients and penetrating keratoplasty.</detailed_description>
