	<criteria>Subjects aged 18 to 45 years with moderatetosevere dental pain as assessed by verbal rating scale (VRS) and confirmed by a score of at least 50 mm out of 100 mm using a visual analogue (VAS) following the surgical removal of up to two mandibular third molars. If only one mandibular third molar is removed, it must be a full bony impaction. If two mandibular third molars are removed, both may be partial bony impactions OR there may be a combination of one full bony impaction with the second tooth being erupted, soft tissue impaction, or partial bony impaction. Ipsilateral maxillary third molars may be removed at the surgeon's discretion, regardless of impaction level.
