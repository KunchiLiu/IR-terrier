	<brief_summary>This pilot phase II study is designed as a test and retest study to investigate [F 18]HX4 as a reliable non-invasive PET imaging marker for detection of tumor hypoxia regions and to establish a threshold for [F 18]HX4 uptake in the tumor. The study will evaluate the relationship between hypoxia biomarkers (HIF1α and CA-IX) by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and tumor uptake of [F 18]HX4 by PET imaging.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of [F 18]HX4 Positron Emission Tomography (PET) as a Tool to Detect Hypoxia in Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A Pilot Phase II Study The primary objectives for this study are: - To test the reproducibility of [F-18] HX-4 uptake in tumors by imaging the same patient on sequential days in a test-retest protocol - To test and confirm the relationship between hypoxia in tumors measured by hypoxia related biomarkers (HIF1α and CA-IX) with immunohistochemistry (IHC) and regional [F-18 HX-4] uptake in tumors with PET/CT. The secondary objectives for this study are: - To continue safety evaluation by the collection of safety data from all patients - To establish the threshold for hypoxia uptake in [F- 18]HX4 PET imaging - To collect data to test [F-18]HX4 PET imaging as a predictor of response in a subgroup of patients receiving treatment - To gain experience with [F-18]HX4 PET/CT in order to improve the study design to conduct future studies Design: An open label, non-randomized, uncontrolled, single group assignment, pilot efficacy study Procedures: Informed consent, collection of demographic information, medical history, blood labs, physical examination, vital signs, ECGs, two or three sets of [F-18]HX4 dosing and imaging scans including two pretreatment, and one mid-treatment if [F-18]HX4 tumor/background ratio ≥ 1.3 from pre-treatment scans, one pre-treatment [F-18]FDG, one mid-treatment if [F- 18]HX4 tumor/background ratio ≥1.3 from pre-treatment scans, concomitant medication collection, adverse event monitoring, and assessment of tumor response to treatment Patients: Approximately forty (40) patients who have diagnosis confirmed by histopathological examination of tumor tissue from head/neck, lung, liver, rectal or cervical cancers and will receive chemotherapy, radiation therapy or chemoradiotherapy. This allows for approximately 30 evaluable patients to complete this study at approximately six sites.</detailed_description>
