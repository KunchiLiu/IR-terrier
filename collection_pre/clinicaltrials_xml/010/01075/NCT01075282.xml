	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if LY2189265 is effective in reducing hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and safe, as compared to Insulin Glargine in participants with Type 2 Diabetes. Participants must also be taking metformin and glimepiride.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study in Participants With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (AWARD-2)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rescue therapy refers to 1 of 2 types of additional therapy, each given for a different reason: any additional therapeutic intervention in participants who developed persistent, severe hyperglycemia despite full compliance with the assigned therapeutic regimen, or initiation of an alternative antihyperglycemic medication following study drug discontinuation. Participants who received rescue therapy were included in the analysis population, but only measurements obtained prior to the beginning of rescue therapy were included in specified efficacy analyses.</detailed_description>
