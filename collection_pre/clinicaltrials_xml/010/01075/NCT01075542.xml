	<brief_title>Astigmatism Management in Cataract Surgery With the AcrySof Toric Intraocular Lens</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A recent innovation in cataract surgery consists of the introduction of toric intraocular lenses (IOLs) that can correct corneal astigmatism. It offers the opportunity for patients with substantial astigmatism to achieve optimal distance vision without using spectacles. Good near vision may subsequently be achieved with low-cost reading glasses. The current practice of non-toric IOL implantation in astigmatic patients warrants the use of expensive bifocal or multifocal spectacles with cylinder correction to achieve good distance and near vision. Objective: The primary objective of this study is to compare spectacle independence for distance vision following toric IOL implantation and monofocal intraocular lens (IOL) implantation. The secondary objectives are to compare uncorrected distance vision, residual refractive astigmatism, quality of vision, wavefront aberrations, contrast sensitivity, complication profile, costs of postoperative spectacles and cost-effectiveness. Study design: Multi-centre randomised clinical trial. Study population: 160 patients with regular corneal astigmatism of at least 1.25 diopters in both eyes who require bilateral cataract surgery. Intervention: Cataract surgery with implantation of a toric IOL (AcrySof model SN60TT) or an monofocal IOL (AcrySof model SN60AT).</detailed_description>
