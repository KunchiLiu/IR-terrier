	<criteria>Histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate. Testosterone &lt; 50 ng/dL. Patients must continue primary androgen deprivation with an LHRH analogue if they have not undergone orchiectomy. Progressive nonmetastatic or metastatic disease after androgen deprivation. Patients must have EITHER: 1. Progression as defined by RECIST criteria. OR 2. Progressive PSA documented within 4 weeks of enrollment. PSA evidence for progressive prostate cancer consists of a PSA level of at least 5 ng/ml which has risen on at least 2 successive occasions, at least 2 weeks apart. If the confirmatory PSA value is less than the first documented rising PSA value, then an additional test for rising PSA will be required to document progression. Patients who are receiving an antiandrogen as part of primary androgen ablation must demonstrate disease progression following discontinuation of antiandrogen. 1. Disease progression after antiandrogen withdrawal is defined as 2 consecutive rising PSA values, obtained at least 2 weeks apart, or documented osseous or soft tissue progression. 2. For patients receiving flutamide, at least one of the PSA values must be obtained 4 weeks or more after flutamide discontinuation. 3. For patients receiving bicalutamide (Casodex) or nilutamide, at least one of the PSA values must be obtained 6 weeks or more after antiandrogen discontinuation. Karnofsky Performance Status ≥ 60%. Patients receiving any other hormonal therapy, including any dose of megestrol acetate (Megace), Proscar (finasteride), any herbal product known to decrease PSA levels (e.g., Saw Palmetto and PCSPES), or any systemic corticosteroid must discontinue the agent for at least 4 weeks prior to enrollment. Patients on stable doses of bisphosphonates may continue on this medication; further, patients may initiate bisphosphonate therapy at the time of ketoconazole initiation. Prior radiation therapy completed ≥ 4 weeks prior to enrollment. Liver function tests (ALT, AST, and Bilirubin) must be within normal limits. ANC &gt;1500/µl, Platelet count &gt; 100,00/µl, Creatinine &lt;1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN), Hemoglobin &gt; 8 mg/dl. Prior chemotherapy for prostate cancer is not allowed with the exception of cases in which chemotherapy has been administered in a neoadjuvant or adjuvant fashion AND &gt;1 year has elapsed since the administration of this therapy. No prior ketoconazole, abiraterone, aminoglutethimide or corticosteroids for treatment of progressive prostate cancer. No supplements or complementary medicines/botanicals are permitted while on protocol therapy, except for any combination of the following: (conventional multivitamin supplements, selenium, lycopene, soy supplements) No prior radiopharmaceuticals (strontium, samarium) within 8 weeks prior to enrollment. No "currently active" second malignancy, other than nonmelanoma skin cancer. No serious intercurrent infections or nonmalignant medical illnesses that are uncontrolled. No psychiatric illnesses/social situations that would limit compliance No active or uncontrolled autoimmune disease. No adrenal insufficiency as demonstrated by a baseline ACTH stimulation test demonstrating a peak cortisol &gt;18 µg/dL.</criteria>
