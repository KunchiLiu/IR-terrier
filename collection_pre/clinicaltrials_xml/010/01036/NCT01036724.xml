	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the change in median radiation exposure time and median procedure time following guided radiofrequency (RF) ablation among subjects undergoing treatment for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with either the CARTO® 3 or the NavX(TM) System. It is hypothesized that described features will reduce the median radiation exposure during the CARTO® 3 system-guided procedures compared to the NavX(TM) system-guided procedures.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>All patients referred for a first radiofrequency ablation procedure for treatment of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF episodes that last less than 30 days and are not terminated via cardioversion) and who are considered eligible for treatment by the physician. There are no study specific exclusion criteria for this observational study. The exclusion criteria will be conditions that, in the physicians opinion, preclude an RF ablation procedure because the procedure risks outweigh any potential benefits for the subject.</criteria>
