	<brief_summary>Physical activity is mainly considered and use for its impact on energy expenditure in the treatment of obesity, and less is known concerning its indirect effects on energy intake. The aim of this work is to clarify the impact of an acute bout of exercise, depending on its intensity (high versus low), on the following energy intake and nutrient utilization, in obese and non-obese boys and men.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Acute Exercise and Energy Balance Regulation: Effect of Intensity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>20 adolescent boys (10 obese and 10 leans) and 20 men (10 obese and 10 lean) will complete a sub-maximal test on a ergo cycle to draw their linear relationship between VO2 and Fc. Then they will enter a metabolic chamber three times, for 24 hours each. A first session will be considered as sedentary, and volunteers will remain inactive. During the second and third session, they will have to complete a cycling test generating an energy expenditure of 400 Kcal, once at low intensity (40%VO2max) and once at high intensity (70% VO2max). Those three sessions will be realized in a randomized order with an interval of at least 7 days and urinary collection over the 24hours will be done during all the sessions. At the beginning of the protocol, blood samples will be taken, body composition assessed by DXA and adiposity location evaluated by MNR.</detailed_description>
