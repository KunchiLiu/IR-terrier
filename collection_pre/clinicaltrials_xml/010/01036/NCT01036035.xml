	<brief_summary>THVD-201 is a novel combination of a muscarinic antagonist (tolterodine) and a muscarinic agonist (pilocarpine).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Novel Combinations of Tolterodine/Pilocarpine on Pharmacokinetics (PK) and Pharmacodynamics (PD) of Tolterodine in Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Because of the limitations of taking two medications separated by a period of time to minimise these adverse events, two novel formulations were developed to improve compliance and ease of administration. This study will evaluate these formulations in terms of their pharmacokinetic profiles and effects on SSF. In addition, the effects of this combination and its entities on urine frequency and safety/tolerability will be assessed.</detailed_description>
