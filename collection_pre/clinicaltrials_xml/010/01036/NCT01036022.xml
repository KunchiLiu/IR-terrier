	<brief_summary>This study is the first-time-in-patient trial of GSK1399686, a novel locally-acting anti-inflammatory compound, aimed at obtaining initial information on the tolerability, safety, pharmacokinetics (including concentrations in colon mucosa) and anti-inflammatory activity of GSK1399686 upon oral dosing in patients with active ulcerative colitis. The study is designed as a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled, sequential dose escalating trial, with an active control (ASACOL) group as internal control. Up to three cohorts (Cohorts 1-3), each consisting of approximately 20 patients with mild-moderately active ulcerative colitis not limited to the rectum, will be included, one for each dose level of GSK1399686 to be tested. Within a cohort, patients will be randomized in a 3:1:1 ratio to receive GSK1399686 (once daily over 4 weeks, followed by 2 weeks dosing with placebo), placebo, or ASACOL (t.i.d. for 6 weeks), respectively. An interim analysis of fecal markers and disease activity data will be performed by the end of Cohort 3. Based upon results, the study may be stopped or continued by recruiting either Cohort 4 (if data on an additional dose level would be warranted to establish or clarify a dose-response relationship) or, in the case of a robust efficacy signal at any dose level previously studied, Cohort 5 (to expand the sample size for given dose level in order to evaluate the efficacy of GSK1399686). The number of patients and randomization allocation ratio may be altered in Cohort 5 and it may not include an active control arm. If Cohort 4 is initiated upon interim analysis, then a second interim analysis may be performed at the end of Cohort 4, to assess whether progression into Cohort 5 (as defined above) would be justifiable.</brief_summary>

Capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with the requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form 1. History of sensitivity to any component of study medications, history of hypersensitivity to ACTH, or a history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the Investigator, contraindicates patient's participation in the study. 2. History of renal sensitivity to 5ASA or presence of nephritis, nephropathia or renal function impairment. 3. Presence or a history of asthma or presence or history of other serious allergic disorder. 4.

Presence of a significant cardiac, pulmonary, metabolic or infectious disease or mental disorder that, in the opinion of the Investigator, represents an unacceptable safety risk for participation in this trial. 9. History of malignant neoplastic disease within the past 5 years other than localized basal cell skin cancer, squamous cell skin cancer or cancer in situ that has been resected. 10. History of regular alcohol consumption within 6 months of the study or presence of recreational drug abuse or dependence. 11.

Treatment with medications known to be strong inducers of CYP3A4/5 (e.g. carbamezipine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifabutin, rifampin, troglitazone) or regular use of St. John's Wort within 14 days prior to Day 1 visit. 21.
