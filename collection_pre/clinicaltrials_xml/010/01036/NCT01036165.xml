	<criteria>1. Male and female subjects, 1865 years of age, inclusive, at the time of informed consent signature 2. RMS diagnosed according to the McDonald criteria 3. Currently receiving Rebif® 44mcg sc tiw using manual injections and/or Rebiject II autoinjector for greater than or equal to twelve weeks 4. Capable of selfinjecting using the RebiSmart™ autoinjector. Self injecting is defined as being able to make 2 of the 3 weekly injections without assistance. 5. Be willing and able to comply with the study procedures for the duration of the trial 6. Have given written informed consent and signed Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Authorization before any study related activities are carried out 7. Female subjects must not be either pregnant or breastfeeding and must lack childbearing potential, as defined by either: Being postmenopausal or surgically sterile, or using a highly effective method of contraception (defined as a method that results in a low failure rate (i.e. less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly, and includes for instance, implants, injectables, combined oral contraceptives*, some intrauterine devices, sexual abstinence or vasectomised partner) Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test at Screening and Study Day 1 to be included in the trial. A urine pregnancy test will also be done at the Week 12/Exit visit Note for subjects using a hormonal contraceptive method: No formal drug interaction studies have been carried out with Rebif®. As interferons have been reported to exert an inhibitory activity on hepatic microsomal enzymes, it is unlikely that the clearance of oral contraceptives would increase and result in decreased efficacy. In over 10,000 patient years of clinical trial experience with Rebif®, there has never been any indication of an interaction with oral contraceptives. 1. Have used any other injectable medications (e.g. for pain) on a regular basis during the week prior to Screening or throughout the duration of the trial (the administration of a single injection for treatment or prophylaxis of a condition unrelated to MS or Rebif® therapy (e.g., influenza or pneumococcus vaccination) will be acceptable) 2. Have received MS therapy other than Rebif® within twelve weeks prior to Screening or at any time during the trial (e.g., other disease modifying drugs, Rebif® New Formulation, combination therapy, immunomodulatory and/or immunosuppressive agents, including but not limited to any other interferon (Avonex/Betaseron/Extavia), glatiramer acetate (Copolymer I), cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine, methotrexate, linomide, azathioprine, mitoxantrone, teriflunomide, laquinimod, cladribine, fingolimod (FTY720), total lymphoid irradiation, antilymphocyte monoclonal antibody treatment (e.g. natalizumab, alemtuzumab/Campath, antiCD4), Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), cytokines or anticytokine therapy) and telbivudine 3. Have inadequate liver function, defined by a alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &gt; 2.5x upper limit of normal (ULN), or alkaline phosphatase &gt; 2.5x ULN, or total bilirubin &gt; 2.5x ULN 4. Have inadequate bone marrow reserve, defined as a total white blood cell count &lt; 3.0x 109/L, platelet count &lt; 75x109/L, hemoglobin &lt; 100g/L 5. Have complete transverse myelitis or simultaneousonset bilateral optic neuritis 6. Have a history of alcohol or drug abuse 7. Have thyroid dysfunction 8. Have moderate to severe renal impairment 9. Have a major medical or psychiatric illness that in the opinion of the investigator creates undue risk to the subject or could affect compliance with the study protocol 10. Have a history of seizures not adequately controlled by treatment 11. Have serious or acute cardiac disease, such as uncontrolled dysrhythmias, uncontrolled angina pectoris, cardiomyopathy, or uncontrolled congestive heart failure 12. Have, in the opinion of the investigator, major visual, physical or cognitive impairment that would preclude the subject from selfinjecting with the RebiSmart™ autoinjector 13. Have a known hypersensitivity or allergy to interferonbeta or any of the excipients 14. Have participated in another clinical trial within the past thirty days 15. Are pregnant or attempting to conceive 16. Have previously used a RebiSmart™ autoinjector</criteria>
