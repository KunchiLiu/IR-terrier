	<brief_summary>Objectives and perspective: 1. To estimate the prevalence of hand eczema in a cohort of health care workers and assess exposures in the hospital environment that can lead to hand eczema . To investigate the knowledge of skin protection among health care workers. 2. To classify subtypes of hand eczema, assess severity of hand eczema and quality of life in health care workers with hand eczema 3. To evaluate the effect of a combination of classification of hand eczema and individual work-related counseling in skin protective behavior. The overall perspective of the trial is to develop new strategies for prevention of occupational hand eczema in health care workers. Hypotheses: - Irritant contact dermatitis is more common than allergic contact dermatitis. - The combination of precise classification (subtyping of HE) and individual counseling will have a positive impact on the prognosis of hand eczema. - The positive impact on the prognosis of hand eczema will have a positive impact on quality of life (QoL). - The knowledge of protective behavior will increase. - Education in a skin care program will have a positive impact on skin protective behavior.</brief_summary>
