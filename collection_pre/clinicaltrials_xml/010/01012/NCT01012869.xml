	<brief_summary>Chronically total occlusions (CTO) are difficult to treat and have high risk for restenosis. Although everolimus-eluting stents (EES) [(Xience, Abbott Vascular) or Promus (Boston Scientific)] are very promising for the treatment of CTOs due to their low late loss and excellent deliverability, there are currently no published data on EES implantation in CTOs. The specific aim of this proposal is to examine the 8-month incidence of binary angiographic in-stent restenosis (defined as a stenosis of &gt; 50% of the minimum lumen diameter of the target stent) after implantation of the EES in CTO. It is the investigators hypothesis that EES-treated CTO lesions will have â‰¤ 20% 8-month in-stent binary angiographic restenosis rate.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Age &gt; 18 years old 2. Successful treatment of a native coronary artery CTO (defined as a lesion with 100% angiographic stenosis that is at least 3 months old as estimated by clinical information, sequential angiographic information, or both) using everolimuseluting stents 3. Able and willing to return for angiographic followup after 8 months and to be followed clinically for 12 months 4. Agree to participate and provide informed consent 1. Planned noncardiac surgery within the following 12 months 2. Recent positive pregnancy test, breastfeeding, or possibility of a future pregnancy 3. Coexisting conditions that limit life expectancy to less than 12 months 4. Patients who have a creatinine above 2.5 mg/dL (unless they require hemodialysis, in which case they are eligible to participate) 5.
