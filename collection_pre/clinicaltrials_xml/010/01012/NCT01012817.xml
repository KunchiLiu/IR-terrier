	<brief_summary>This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of veliparib and topotecan hydrochloride and to see how well they work in treating patients with solid tumors, ovarian cancer that has come back or does not respond to treatment, or primary peritoneal cancer. Veliparib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as topotecan hydrochloride, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading . Giving veliparib with chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Veliparib and Topotecan Hydrochloride in Treating Patients With Solid Tumors, Relapsed or Refractory Ovarian Cancer, or Primary Peritoneal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose of the combination of ABT-888 (veliparib) and weekly topotecan (topotecan hydrochloride) in adult patients with advanced solid tumors. (Phase I) II. To identify any anti-tumor activity of this treatment combination, as assessed by objective response in patients with advanced solid tumors. (Phase I) III. To assess the confirmed response rate for patients with epithelial ovarian cancer, fallopian tube cancer or primary peritoneal carcinoma treated with the combination of ABT-888 and weekly topotecan. IV. To assess the progression free response (PFS) for patients with epithelial ovarian cancer, fallopian tube cancer or primary peritoneal carcinoma treated with the combination of ABT-888 and weekly topotecan. (Phase II) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To identify any pharmacokinetic interactions between ABT-888 and topotecan. (Phase I) II. To determine whether topotecan stimulates adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-ribose polymer formation in circulating peripheral blood mononuclear cells. (Phase I) III. To determine whether ABT-888 inhibits basal or topotecan-stimulated ADP-ribose polymer formation. (Phase I) IV. To assess differences in the toxicity and/or efficacy of this regimen based on BRCA 1/2 mutational status. (Phase II) V. To determine whether pretreatment tumor cell levels of topoisomerase I, poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP), BRCA1, BRCA2, XRCC1, tyrosyl-deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) phosphodiesterase 1 (TDP1), P-glycoprotein or breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) predict response to this regimen. (Phase II) VI. To identify, in an exploratory manner, any transcriptional profiles that may predict response to this regimen. (Phase II) OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of veliparib and topotecan hydrochloride followed by a phase II study. Patients receive veliparib orally (PO) on days 1-3, 8-10, and 15-17 (veliparib is omitted on days 1-3 of course 2) and topotecan hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 2, 9, and 16. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3 months (Phase I) or every 3 or 6 months for 5 years (Phase II).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>PHASE I: Adult patients with histologically confirmed solid tumor malignancy that is metastatic or unresectable and for which standard curative measures or other therapy definitely capable of extending life expectancy does not exist PHASE II: All patients enrolled in the Phase II portion of this trial must have a history of biopsyproven ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer Patients must have received &lt; 3 lines of prior therapy and have relapsed less than a year from their last platinum regimen; regimens that are used twice (for example carboplatin and paclitaxel) can be counted as one; if a regimen is changed during the course of treatment due to side effect profile or allergy, the course of therapy is counted as one regimen; (for example, if docetaxel is substituted for paclitaxel due to a reaction during the initial course of adjuvant therapy, this is considered one regimen) Patients must have measurable disease with at least one lesion whose longest diameter can be accurately measured as &gt;= 2.0 cm with conventional techniques or as &gt;= 1.0 cm with spiral computed topography (CT); if spiral CT is used, it must be used for both pre and post treatment tumor assessments Absolute neutrophil count &gt;= 1500/mcL Hemoglobin &gt;= 9.0 g/dL Platelets &gt;= 100,000/mcL Total bilirubin =&lt;

2.5 x ULN in the absence of hepatic metastasis; SGPT (ALT) =&lt; 3 x ULN or SGOT (AST) =&lt; 5 x ULN in the presences of hepatic metastasis Creatinine =&lt; 1.5 x ULN International normalized ratio (INR) =&lt;

this is part of the mandatory correlative research component; these specimens include: PHASE I: peripheral blood for plasma pharmacokinetic analysis and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) polymer assessment from 024 h after drug administration on days 1 and 2 of cycle 1 as well as day 2 of cycle 2; urine for assessment of ABT888 renal clearance for 24 h after administration of drugs on days 1 and 2 of cycle 1 as well as day 2 of cycle 2; and a pretreatment peripheral blood sample for possible sequencing of the BRCA1, BRCA2 loci as well as possible pharmacogenomic analysis Negative urine or serum pregnancy test done =&lt;
