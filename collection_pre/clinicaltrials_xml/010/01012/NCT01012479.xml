	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of Candesartan Cilexetil Plus Hydrochlorothiazide in Subjects With Severe Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Medical data show a link between blood pressure and the risk of heart disease (cardiovascular disease) such as stroke and heart attack. Clinical trials have shown that lowering blood pressure in patients with high blood pressure (hypertension) reduces the number of cardiovascular events. Many people still have untreated hypertension. There are many reasons why target blood pressure is not reached. One is that most patients need more than one antihypertensive drug in order to lower high blood pressure. Other reasons include poor patient compliance with taking their drugs. Combining drugs that lower high blood pressure and have similar ways of working in the body may help high blood pressure and lower the risk for medication-related side effects. One of several drug combinations recommended for the treatment of high blood pressure is an angiotensin receptor blocker and a thiazide diuretic. Guidelines also note that combination tablets may improve patient compliance with taking their drugs. Candesartan is an angiotensin type-1 receptor blocker. Hydrochlorothiazide is a diuretic with blood pressure-lowering effect. This study will combine both of these drugs in one pill and see how it works in people taking part in this study.</detailed_description>
