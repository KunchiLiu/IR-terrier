	<brief_title>Study of Pazopanib and Ixabepilone in Patients With Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Treatment with ixabepilone will be given at an assigned dose as a 3 hour intravenous infusion on day 1 of a 21 day cycle. Treatment with pazopanib will be given at an assigned dose by mouth once a day, beginning on day 1 and continuing daily. Disease assessment will be done every 2 cycles (6 weeks) with treatment continuing until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or patient refusal.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Diagnosis of advanced nonhematologic solid tumor malignancy, including, but not limited to breast, lung, colon, pancreatic, head and neck, kidney or sarcoma that has failed or become intolerant to standard therapy and is no longer likely to respond to such therapy Effective with the August 2011 version of the protocol, enrollment is limited to squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (refer to section 1.4 for rationale). Note: Patients with a primary diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma will be eligible for enrollment into dose level 1 or 2 only, provided they met all other inclusion/exclusion criteria the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for pazopanib monotherapy in patients with hepatocellular cancer was found to be 600 mg daily. Measureable or evaluable disease per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Prior systemic chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or biological therapy is allowed; however prior use of either pazopanib or ixabepilone alone or in combination is not allowed. At least 14 days must have elapsed since 1) previous systemic therapy (28 days for bevacizumab) before the 1st dose of study drug, 2) last dose of radiation therapy or surgery (28 days for major surgery).
