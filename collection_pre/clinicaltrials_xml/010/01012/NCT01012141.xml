	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as docetaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Dietary supplements, such as phytochemicals, may stop or delay the development of prostate cancer.</brief_summary>
