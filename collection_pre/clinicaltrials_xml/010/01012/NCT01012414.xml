	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if vitamin D supplementation changes the results of certain tests associated with inflammation in the body using an oral, synthetic form of vitamin D called paricalcitol.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Vitamin D Supplement on Inflammation Markers in High-Risk Cardiovascular Patients With Chronic Kidney Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Vitamin D deficiency is common and has been associated with an increased risk of heart disease. In patients with the combination of kidney disease and heart disease, inflammation is thought to contribute to a high rate of cardiac events. Less is known about the effects of vitamin D supplementation on certain tests associated with inflammation in the body.</detailed_description>
