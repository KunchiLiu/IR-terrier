	<brief_summary>This study assessed the efficacy, safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of two different formulations of indacaterol, one administered via the Concept1 device and one administered via the Simoon device. The study aimed to determine whether the novel formulation (Simoon) had a similar profile to that of the established formulation (Concept1).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy, Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics of Indacaterol Maleate Via Concept1 or Simoon Devices</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study was double-blind with regards to the Concept1, where placebo for the lactose-blended indacaterol was available. However, with regards to the Simoon, neither the subject nor the investigator was blinded due to lack of a placebo to the PulmoSphere formulation. Hence, the overall designation of the study was partially-blind.</detailed_description>
