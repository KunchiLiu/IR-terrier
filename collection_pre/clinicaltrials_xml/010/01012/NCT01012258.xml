	<brief_summary>Primary objective: to assess the antitumor activity and safety profile of cetuximab when given in combination with radiotherapy (RT) for the treatment of locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) in Chinese subjects. Secondary objective: to assess the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile and immunogenicity of cetuximab in Chinese subjects. Further objective: to identify for cetuximab potential predictive biomarkers of response and safety.</brief_summary>
