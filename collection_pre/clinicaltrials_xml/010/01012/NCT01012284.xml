	<brief_title>A Study of TMC207 in Patients With Moderately Impaired Hepatic Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase I, open label (all people know the identity of the intervention) study of TMC207. The study consists of a screening period and a 4-weeks treatment period. Sixteen participants will be enrolled in two panels. Panel A will include 8 patients of moderate hepatic impairment and Panel B will include 8 healthy participants.
