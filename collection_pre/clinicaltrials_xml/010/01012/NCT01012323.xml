	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy of NewGam in preventing serious bacterial infections and to determine the pharmacokinetic profile of NewGam. The safety of NewGam and its effect on quality of life were also evaluated.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of NewGam, Human Immunoglobulin 10%, in Patients With Primary Immunodeficiency Diseases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>NewGam is a new 10% human normal immunoglobulin (IVIG) solution developed by Octapharma for intravenous administration. It is supplied as a liquid formulation ready to use. The primary therapeutic use of immunoglobulins is to provide antibodies to prevent viral and bacterial diseases (replacement therapy). IVIG has proved to be useful in a variety of clinical conditions other than for replacement of immunoglobulins; IVIG exhibits an immunomodulatory effect. Children and adults with a Primary Immunodeficiency Disease (PID) have an increased risk of recurrent bacterial and viral infections that typically attack the respiratory tract (sinusitis, bronchitis, pneumonia) but can also affect the gastrointestinal tract (gastroenteritis). Theses diseases can be severe and can lead to substantial morbidity. Responses to antibacterial therapy are often poor. At present, most primary immune deficiencies are not curable, but IVIGs have been shown to decrease the total number of severe infections and the duration of hospitalization.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age of ≥ 2 years and ≤ 75 years. Confirmed diagnosis of common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) or Xlinked agammaglobulinemia (XLA). Previously treated with a commercial immune globulin intravenous (human) every 2128 days for at least 6 infusion intervals at a constant dose between 200 and 800 mg/kg body weight. Acute infection requiring intravenous antibiotic treatment within 2 weeks prior to and during the screening period. Exposure to blood or any blood product or derivative, other than commercially available intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), within the past 3 months prior to enrollment. Ongoing history of hypersensitivity or persistent reactions to blood or plasma derived products, or any component of the investigational product. Requirement of any routine premedication for IVIG infusion. Severe liver function impairment (alanine aminotransferase [ALAT] 3x &gt; upper limit of normal). Presence of renal function impairment (creatinine &gt; 120 μmol/L), or predisposition for acute renal failure (eg, any degree of preexisting renal insufficiency or routine treatment with known nephritic drugs). History of autoimmune hemolytic anemia. History of diabetes mellitus. Congestive heart failure New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III or IV. Noncontrolled arterial hypertension (systolic blood pressure &gt; 160 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure &gt; 90 mmHg). History of deep vein thrombosis or thrombotic complications of IVIG therapy. A positive result at screening on any of the following viral markers: human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis B virus (HBV). Treatment with steroids (oral or parenteral, longterm, ie, 30 days or more, not intermittent or burst, daily, ≥ 0.15 mg of prednisone or equivalent/kg/day), immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory drugs. Planned vaccination during the study period. Treatment with any investigational agent within 3 months prior to enrollment. Known or suspected to abuse alcohol, drugs, psychotropic agents or other chemicals within the past 12 months prior to enrollment. Pregnant or nursing women.</criteria>
