	<brief_title>Recto Anal Repair or Milligan Morgans Operation of Grade 3 and 4 Symptomatic Haemorrhoidal Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An estimated 4% of the adult population suffers from haemorrhoidal disease. In 1937 E. T. Milligan and C. N. Morgan described a method for operating piles that still is regarded "the gold standard" in the treatment of severe haemorrhoidal disease. This procedure is followed by a prolonged and painful recovery. To overcome the long recovery often combined with long sick leaves, less invasive methods for treating piles have been introduced during the last decade. However, few studies have compared patient benefits and the long term outcome of these techniques, and the choice of treatment is often based on the skills and experience of the individual surgeon. A new and promising mini invasive approach utilizes doppler-guided ligation of the haemorrhoidal arteries. All haemorrhoidal arteries are identified and then ligated approximately 2 cm above the anal canal. Thereafter the rectal mucosa with the piles is repositioned and fixed in the rectum with running sutures. This procedure is termed Recto Anal Repair (RAR) and leads to shrinking of the piles and restored anatomy of the anus and the rectum. The investigators want to execute a randomized, consecutive, prospective, controlled study with long term follow up to compare the RAR procedure to Milligans operation for the treatment of severe haemorrhoidal disease. The primary goals are evaluation of pain and sick leave 7, 14 and 21 days after surgery and reported reduction of pile symptoms after 3, 6 and 12 months. In addition the investigators want to compare the overall satisfaction with the two procedures.</detailed_description>
