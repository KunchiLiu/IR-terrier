	<brief_title>Hydrocodone/Acetaminophen for Acute Pain Following Bunionectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The bunionectomy was performed under regional anesthesia and propofol sedation. Perioperative anesthesia was standardized for all participants. Upon completion of surgery, designated study personnel ensured continued eligibility per the selection criteria of the protocol. After an appropriate period of time following bunionectomy, participants who had a pain intensity score of â‰¥ 40 mm on a 100 mm visual analog scale (VAS) and moderate or severe pain intensity per the categorical pain intensity scale were eligible for randomization, in equal numbers, into 1 of 5 treatment arms. In order to maintain the single-blind nature of the study, all participants were dosed with study drug (active and/or placebo) every 6 hours.</detailed_description>
