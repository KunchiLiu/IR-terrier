	<brief_summary>The main objective of this study is to assess the extent and trend in time of antiproteinuric effect as well as that antihypertensive effect of aliskiren 300 mg / d versus ramipril 10 mg daily in hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria. The investigators will also evaluate: 1. Average of 24 hours, as determined by ABPM, systolic and diastolic blood pressure checks at various visits 2. Average daytime, as determined by ABPM, systolic and diastolic blood pressure checks at various visits 3. Average night, as determined by ABPM, systolic and diastolic blood pressure checks at various visits</brief_summary>
