	<brief_title>An Open Label Trial of Memantine in the Treatment of Bulimia Nervosa and Body Dysmorphic Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective of this clinical trial is to test the hypothesis that treatment with Memantine, an anti-glutamatergic drug, will significantly improve the core symptoms of those suffering from either bulimia nervosa, purging type or suffering from body dysmorphic disorder. We will test this hypothesis by performing a 13-week open label study investigating the use of memantine, at a dose of 10-40mg daily, as a treatment for patients with either bulimia nervosa or body dysmorphic disorder. Improvement for patients with bulimia nervosa will be assessed using the Frequency of binge eating and vomiting as recorded in diary card, Eating Disorder Evaluation (EDE), and the Yale-Brown-Cornell Eating Disorders Scale (YBC-EDS). Improvement for patients with body dysmorphic disorder will be assessed using the the Yale-Brown-Cornell Eating Disorders Scale (YBC-EDS) and Brown Assessments of Beliefs Scale. In addition both groups will also receive the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) Severity and Improvement Scales (clinician rated), Patient Global Impression of Improvement (PGI-Improvement), Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A), Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS), Version 11, Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS), and Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS).</detailed_description>

Participants must exhibit a score of ≥ 20 on the Body Dysmorphic Disorder Version of the Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (BDDYBOCS) at a score of ≥ 5 on the first three items of the BDDYBOCS, which are the items that assess the DSMIV criteria for Body Dysmorphic Disorder.
