	<brief_summary>Observational studies have shown that consumption of grapes and grape products such as red wine is associated with reduced cardiovascular risk. The mechanisms accounting for this benefit remain incompletely understood. Resveratrol is a component of grapes and red wine that has favorable effects on endothelial function in diabetic and obese animals. Resveratrol is available to people over-the-counter in health food stores and the internet as a dietary supplement. The endothelium plays a central role in the control of blood vessel function. When healthy, the endothelium prevents vasospasm, blood clot formation, and the development of atherosclerosis. Endothelial function is abnormal in patients with diabetes mellitus and this abnormality contributes to the development of cardiovascular disease. The present pilot study is designed to test the hypothesis that resveratrol (90 mg/day and 270 mg/day for one week each) will have favorable effects on endothelial function in patients with diabetes mellitus.</brief_summary>
