	<brief_summary>The Primary Objective is to evaluate the progression-free survival (PFS). The secondary objectives are: - To compare the disease control rates of different doses of Docetaxel+Cisplatin as first-line treatment according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria; - To evaluate the overall response rate (ORR); - To evaluate the time to disease progression (TTP); - To evaluate the overall survival (OS); - To evaluate the toxicity.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tax First-line Chemotherapy With Different Doses and Then Maintenance Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study consists in: - A first line treatment phase: participants receive 4 cycles of chemotherapy (each cycle contains 3 weeks) with either docetaxel (75 mg/m2) plus cisplatin (75 mg/m2) or docetaxel (60 mg/m2) plus cisplatin (75 mg/m2) , - A maintenance treatment phase: participants with disease control (complete response [CR], partial response [PR] or stable disease [SD]) after the initial treatment receive up to 6 cycles of chemotherapy with docetaxel (60 mg/m2) or best supportive care (BSC). - A follow-up period from the end of study treatment until participant death or end of study.</detailed_description>
