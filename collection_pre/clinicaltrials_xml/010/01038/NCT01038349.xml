	<brief_summary>The goal of this study is to enable the study sponsor to assess the impact of a marketed or validated blood test has on physicians' clinical treatment decision making when treating RA patients who have been taking methotrexate. Ultimately, the blood test will allow treating physicians to modify current methotrexate therapy in partially responding Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) patients' therapy, on an individualized basis, as a means of improving clinical outcomes. The study requires a blood sample from RA patients who have been on methotrexate therapy for a minimum of 3 months and are having an inadequate response to therapy. Physicians will then be provided with the results of the test indicating the methotrexate polyglutamate (active metabolites of methotrexate) levels in the patient's red blood cells as a means to help determine whether a patient's exposure to methotrexate has been optimized.</brief_summary>
