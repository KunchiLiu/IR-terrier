	<brief_summary>The main purpose of this study is to compare two types of treatment-standard palliative care (which usually is given towards the end of life) and integrated palliative care (which is given soon after diagnosis) to see which is better for improving quality of life of participants with advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Palliative care is care that tries to lessen the symptoms of a disease. Although many people with advanced lung cancer receive palliative care or hospice toward the end of their disease, the entire course of their disease is often complicated by physical and emotional difficulties. Palliative care may be useful when it is started soon after diagnosis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Integrated Versus Standard Palliative Care in Patients With Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Participants with advanced small-cell lung cancer, will be asked to fill out some quality of life questionnaires that help to measure their quality of life (QOL), mood and understanding of their illness. They will also be asked to identify an important person in their life, either a relative or friend, who they count on for help and support. The research staff will contact that individual and ask them to if they want to participate in the caregiver part of this study. - Lung cancer participants will then be randomized into one of the two study groups: integrated palliative care or standard palliative care. - Participants assigned to the Standard palliative care group will be referred to the Palliative Care Team at their doctor's or their request at any time. At that time the Palliative Care Team (PCT) will follow and treat the participant as they would any other cancer patient. Research staff will request the participant to fill out QOL, mood &amp; illness understanding questionnaires about 12, 18 and 24 weeks after they sign the consent form. Their caregiver will be asked to fill out the FamCare form at 12, 18 and 24 weeks. - Participants assigned to the Integrated Palliative Care group will have an appointment with the Palliative Care Team within 3 weeks of being randomized. The palliative care physician will formulate a care plan based on the participant's and caregiver's issues and needs. The PCT will meet with the participant on a regular basis, a minimum of every 6 weeks. These visits wil vary with the participant's needs and may include individual or group meetings with the physicians, nurse practitioners, social workers or chaplains. Research staff will ask you to fill out QOL, mood &amp; illness understanding questionnaires about 12, 18 and 24 weeks after they sign the consent form. Their caregiver will be asked to fill out the FamCare form at 12, 18 and 24 weeks. - Participants will be in this research study for about 24 weeks or 6 months. After this 6 month period is over, care by the Palliative Care Team my continue but the participants will not be asked to fill out more questionnaires.</detailed_description>
