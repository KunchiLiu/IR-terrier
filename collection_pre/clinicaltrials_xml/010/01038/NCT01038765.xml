	<brief_title>Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy for Recurrent Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) is a 8 session group intervention and is well described by several authors. Previous studies showed Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) to be effective to prevent relapse in patients with recurrent depression and 3 or more previous depressive episodes. Study aims are: 1. to replicate previous findings in The Netherlands, by a research team which did not develop the intervention 2. to investigate if MBCT is applicable for patients with recurrent depression and current depressive symptoms 3. to examine possible mediators of treatment effect and predictors of relapse in the year following the treatment In this study, patients are randomly assigned to a MBCT intervention group or a waiting list control group. Patients allocated to the waiting list control condition will receive the MBCT course three months later. All patients who participated in a MBCT training will be assessed during the year following the completion of the MBCT course. We aim to include about 220 patients.</detailed_description>
