	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if the Childsmile programme (www.child−smile.org) with the additional maternal use of xylitol is more effective at reducing dental decay in children than a Childsmile program alone. The children will be compared in the two groups at age two, to determine how the interventions affected the early colonization of mutans streptococci, an important risk factor of tooth decay. At three and at five years the investigators will also examine the amount of tooth decay in these children. Using MIDAS (Scotland's national health service dental data) records, the investigators will follow the oral health of the children until the age of 5 years. Main hypothesis: The maternal consumption of xylitol reduces early childhood caries</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Maternal Consumption of Xylitol to Reduce Early Childhood Decay (MaXED Study)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Xylitol has been shown to decrease mutans streptococci transmission between mother and child. Such maternal consumption of xylitol studies have, however not been tested in a Scottish population. Sign 83, (www.sign.ac.uk/pdf/sign83.pdf) a Scottish government publication states that carrying out research in this area is needed. Childsmile (www.child-smile.org) is a Scottish government programme that promotes oral health from birth, particularly amongst people living in priority areas. Parents of newborn children who are assessed to be at risk of developing tooth decay are referred to the programme by their Health Visitor. Parents are visited at home by a Dental Health Support Worker. The dental health support worker will give more information, advice and arrange regular visits for participants to their local Dental Practice. This research study will compare two groups; one group randomised into the childsmile preventative programme, the other group randomised into the childsmile preventative programme plus consuming 5 grams of xylitol per day. We will be testing the mutans streptococci of the mother, at start of the study, and testing the mutans streptococci of mother and child at (child) aged two, in both groups- We will then be testing the dental decay of children in both groups The research study will use existing NHS fife funding. NHS Fife currently employs approximately 15 dental health support workers, of which part of their role will be to support this project Recruiting of study is planned to start in January 2010.</detailed_description>
