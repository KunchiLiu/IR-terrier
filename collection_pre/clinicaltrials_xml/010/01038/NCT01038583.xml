	<brief_summary>The ASPREE study will examine whether the potential benefits of low dose aspirin (particularly preventing heart disease, stroke, certain cancers and dementia) outweigh the risks (particularly bleeding) in people over age 65. ASPREE will determine whether taking a daily low-dose aspirin will extend the length of a disability-free life in healthy participants aged 65 years and above.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Aspirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Low dose aspirin therapy has been shown to reduce the risk of vascular events, largely in middle-aged people. There is also some evidence of its potential to reduce the rate of intellectual decline and certain types cancers in older participants. However, part of the benefit of aspirin may be offset by adverse effects, such as those related to its potential to cause bleeding. The balance of risks and benefits of low dose aspirin has not been established in older persons. Previous studies on the effects of aspirin in primary prevention have mainly focused on cardiovascular outcomes. In the elderly, these alone may not be the most appropriate measure of benefit associated with aspirin treatment. Prolonging a life free of functional disability in a healthy aging population would be the most desirable benefit of aspirin as a preventative medicine. ASPREE will determine whether taking a daily low-dose aspirin will extend the length of a disability-free life in healthy participants aged 65 years and above.</detailed_description>
