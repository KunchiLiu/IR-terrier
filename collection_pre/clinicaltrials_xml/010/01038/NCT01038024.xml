	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the basis for the reported good effects of antioxidant supplementation. A blood test using Mass Spectrometry will measure DNA damage which is expected to decrease with antioxidant administration and therefore decrease the risk of cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study for the Liquid Chromatography-mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) Assessment of Oxidative DNA Damage in Relation to Antioxidant Usage</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this pilot study, the overall purpose is to establish the molecular basis for the hypothesis that oxidative stress is a risk factor for cancer. This will be achieved by establishing base line levels of oxidative DNA damage in a population of healthy individuals before and after taking antioxidant and mineral supplements for 8 weeks.</detailed_description>
