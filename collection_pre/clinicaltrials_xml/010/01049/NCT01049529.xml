	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate if enteral docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) administration attenuates the inflammatory cytokines and improve clinical outcomes in neonates who underwent cardiovascular surgery</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Docosahexaenoic Acid on the Inflammatory Response and Clinical Outcomes From Surgical Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Severe sepsis and organ failure are leading causes of death in surgical patients. Several studies indicate that a causal relationship exists between the surgical or traumatic injury and the predisposition to develop septic/infectious complications and multiple organ failure; this is attributable to uncontrolled inflammatory response. Since neonates have an immature immune system, they are in a higher risk to develop uncontrolled inflammatory response and adverse clinical outcomes. N-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (L-PUFAs) such as docosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids (EPA and DHA) have been shown to reduce the inflammatory response by reducing cytokines, infection rates and length of hospitalization in patients with abdominal surgery. Therefore, acute and enteral administration of DHA may improve clinical outcomes in neonates with cardiovascular surgery</detailed_description>
