	<brief_title>Cognitive Problems in Veterans With Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Heart failure (HF) is a costly, chronic, and complex condition that impacts veterans' quality of life, morbidity, and mortality. In the VA population up to 20% of patients are readmitted for HF within 30 days. Non-adherence to prescribed medication and self-care regimens in patients with HF is known to lead to increased morbidity, including readmissions. Cognitive impairment (CI) has been shown to predict nonadherence in elderly people without HF, however, this link has not been studied in HF populations. In the non-veteran population, HF patients are known to have an increased prevalence of cognitive impairment (CI), however, no existing study has determined the extent and type of CI in veterans with HF. This pilot study was designed as a descriptive cross-sectional study as a pre-implementation effort with following goals: (1) determine the prevalence of CI in veterans with all-cause HF in an outpatient setting; (2) quantitatively describe the extent of CI in this population; (3) qualitatively describe neuropsychological domains affected by CI; (4) evaluate the association of CI with medication adherence and other clinical variables. All consenting eligible outpatients in our VA HF clinic underwent a simple screening test for CI (Saint Louis University Mental Status Exam). Demographic and clinical variables were collected by patient interviews and chartg reviews, and included Geriatric Depression Scale and questionnaires about medication-taking behaviors. All subjects were invited back for 30-day direct pill count of all their routinely prescribed medications. Subjects who screened positive for CI were invited back for a modified battery of neuropsychological tests to determine the cognitive domains affected. Subjects will also be followed after the 12-month study period to collect data on hospital readmissions.</detailed_description>
