	<brief_summary>This is a two-phase study that is designed to test a novel behavioral intervention to treat depression in Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) adolescents and young adults. Four Adolescent Trials Network (ATN) sites will be assigned to either the Combination Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and Medication Management (COMB) treatment group or the Treatment as Usual (TAU) group. Phase I involves pilot testing of a 24-week intervention consisting of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Medication Management (MM) manuals at sites assigned to the COMB treatment group. Participants enrolled at TAU sites will receive treatment for depression that is typical at that site, which may include medication management, psychosocial therapy, or a combination of the two. Psychopharmacological and psychosocial interventions will not be standardized and participants may receive any depression treatment recommended by the site clinicians while on study. Study coordinators and site clinicians, regardless of group assignment, will document depression symptoms and treatment regimens for all participants for 24 weeks. In addition, site staff and participants at COMB sites will participate in an exit interview. The findings from these interviews will be used to revise both CBT and MM intervention manuals at the end of Phase I. Phase II is a feasibility study of the revised CBT and MM manuals. Phase II involves similar procedures as Phase I; sites assigned to COMB will implement the revised CBT and MM manuals. Participants at TAU sites will receive treatment for depression that is typical at that site. As in Phase I, psychopharmacological and psychosocial interventions will not be standardized and participants may receive any depression treatment recommended by the site clinicians while on study. Depression symptoms and treatment regimens for all participants will be documented for 24 weeks. Additionally, all Phase II participants will have 2 follow-up visits at weeks 36 and 48. Again, site staff and participants at COMB sites will participate in an exit interview. The findings from these interviews will be used to revise both CBT and MM manuals at the end of Phase II.</brief_summary>

For participants at COMB sites only, ongoing CBT for treatment of depressive symptoms at time of study enrollment (e.g., teaching cognitive restructuring using roleplay, identification of cognitive distortions, automatic thoughts, dysfunctional attitudes); and NOTE: Youth who received CBT in the past may be considered for enrollment. Any cases that are uncertain require Protocol Team approval. For participants at COMB sites only, continuing antidepressant management by a site clinician who is not trained in COMB.</criteria>
