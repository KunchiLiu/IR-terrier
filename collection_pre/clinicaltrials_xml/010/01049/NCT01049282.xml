	<brief_summary>The study has the following objectives: Primary objective To evaluate the safety profile of an adjuvanted TB subunit vaccine administered in different antigen/adjuvant formulations at 0 and 2 months Secondary objective To determine the immunogenicity profile of an adjuvanted TB subunit vaccine administered in different antigen/adjuvant formulations at 0 and 2 months.</brief_summary>
