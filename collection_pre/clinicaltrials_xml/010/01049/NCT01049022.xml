	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to describe the pharmacokinetics of moxifloxacin in children to see what the best dose should be for children in the future. Pharmacokinetics is to see how the body absorbs, distributes, breaks down and gets rid of the study drug. The pharmacokinetics of certain drugs may be altered in children due to developmental differences in various organ functions responsible for drug elimination, as well as in general distribution characteristics. The safety of moxifloxacin in children with infections will also be looked at. Results from this study will be used to guide dosing strategies of the larger clinical trial planned for children</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Males or females, ages 3 months through 14 years inclusive Receiving antibiotics for suspected or proven infection Body weight greater than 45 kg Patients taking antiseizure medications within 30 days of moxifloxacin dosing Known or suspected allergy to quinolones History of tendon disease/disorder related to quinolone treatment Severe, lifethreatening disease with a life expectancy of less than 48 hours and/or known rapidly fatal underlying disease (death expected within 2 months) Abnormal musculoskeletal evaluation at baseline assessment; or chronic musculoskeletal disease (eg, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis); or chronic illness with high risk for chronic or recurrent arthritis or tendinitis (eg, cystic fibrosis, chronic inflammatory bowel disease) Cardiac arrhythmia Evidence of renal or hepatic disease, based on laboratory findings (serum creatinine, total bilirubin, or ALT, &gt; 1.5 times upper limit of normal) and physical exam Patients receiving Class IA (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic agents Patients taking any medication known to increase the QT interval, eg, amiodarone, astemizole, bepridil, chloroquine, chlorpromazine, cisapride, disopyuramide, dofetilide, droperidol, halofantrine, haloperidol, ibutilide, levomethadyl, mesoradazine, methadone, pimozide, procainamide, quinidine, sotalol, terfenadine Pregnancy Clinically relevant findings in the ECG Participation in another clinical study during the preceding 30 days1 (last treatment from previous study to first treatment of new study) Criteria which in the opinion of the investigator preclude participation for scientific reasons, for reasons of compliance, or for reasons of the patient's safety Patients taking another fluoroquinolone at the time of planned moxifloxacin dosing</criteria>
