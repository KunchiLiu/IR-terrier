	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to describe patients, 75 years old or older, with Non ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI) especially regarding the following variables: cardiovascular risk, co-morbidity and frailty. The investigators hypothesize that the degree of frailty influences the benefit from coronary angiography and the possible invasive treatment which can follow.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Frailty as an INstrument for Evaluation of Elderly Patients With Non ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The term frailty denotes a multi-dimensional syndrome characterized by increased vulnerability and decreased physiologic reserves. Frailty stratification predicts a patient's risk of death and need for institutional care. The construct is well validated, but there is not one single accepted operational definition. The CSHA Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) is a 7-point scale relying on clinical judgement. It is a global clinical measure of biological age, and it mixes co-morbidity, disability and cognitive impairment.Though frailty instruments so far mainly have been used in a geriatric context, it has been pointed out as relevant for cardiologic patients as well, e.g. regarding risk stratification for elderly patients with NSTEMI. The purpose of this study is to describe patients, 75 years old or older, with Non ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI) especially regarding the following variables: cardiovascular risk, co-morbidity and frailty. The investigators hypothesize that the degree of frailty influences the benefit from coronary angiography and the possible invasive treatment which can follow.</detailed_description>
