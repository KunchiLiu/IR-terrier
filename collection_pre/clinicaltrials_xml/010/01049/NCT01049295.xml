	<brief_title>Omega-3 Fatty Acids and Chemotherapy-induced Neuropathy and Inflammation in Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women. Chemotherapy with taxanes in patients with breast cancer causes some complications and neuropathy is one of the most frequent that is dose limiting and even may cause to stop the therapy. n-3 fatty acids have very significant role in improvement the function of the neurons.n-3 fatty acids decrease the demyelination and toxicities resulting from taxanes. They also lower the level of of the neurotoxic inflammatory agents. So,n-3 fatty acids improve the quality of life in this patients. 52 patients with invasive breast cancer will be randomized in a double-blind placebo-controlled manner to receive either 640 mg oil fish pearls( 54% DHA, 10% EPA) 3 times a day or placebo( corn oil pearls) for 3 months(during the chemotherapy with taxanes). Neuropathy (using EMG-NCV test)and the level of IL-1,IL-6, TNF-alpha, hs-crp and serum level of EPA and DHA fatty acids will be measured before chemotherapy with taxanes and at the end of the therapy (after 3 months).</detailed_description>
