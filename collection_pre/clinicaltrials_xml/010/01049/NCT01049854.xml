	<brief_summary>CD34+ stem cell selection in children, adolescents and young adults receiving partially matched family donor or matched unrelated adult donor allogeneic bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell transplant will be safe and well tolerated and be associated with a low incidence of serious (Grade III/IV) acute and chronic graft versus host disease (GVHD).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CD34+Selection for Partially Matched Family or Matched Unrelated Adult Donor Transplant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The selection of CD34+ cells is associated with the simultaneous depletion of T cells that are responsible for severe acute and chronic graft versus host disease (GVHD). Successful engraftment is reported in adult patients with malignant and non-malignant disease who received CD34+ selected stem cells from HLA-matched or mismatched mobilized peripheral blood (PBSC) or bone marrow. Study Design: Selected patients defined in the eligibility criteria will enrolled on this study. Patients will receive one of either full intensity or reduced intensity regimen based on the patient's disease status, organ function and performance and determined by the PI and will have peripheral blood undergo CD34 selection.</detailed_description>
