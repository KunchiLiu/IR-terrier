	<brief_summary>Surgical site infection is common in colorectal surgery leading to increased postoperative pain, longer hospital stay, delayed wound healing and increased re-operation rates. Hence, reducing the wound infection rate is a major aim in abdominal surgery. Wound protectors were invented for retracting the abdominal wall and keeping the abdominal wall sterile in order to reduce bacterial colonialization of the wound and wound infections. This is a prospective-randomized trial comparing use of wound protectors versus woven drapes in laparoscopic colon resections with minilaparotomy.</brief_summary>
