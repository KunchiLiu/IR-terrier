	<brief_summary>The apelin-APJ system is a relatively new discovery. It has generated interest in part due to it's apparent ability to counteract the renin-angiotensin system, which is frequently overactive in many cardiovascular disease. Apelin improves that pumping ability of the heart and we wish to know if this action persists in the presence of increased levels of angiotensin II.</brief_summary>
