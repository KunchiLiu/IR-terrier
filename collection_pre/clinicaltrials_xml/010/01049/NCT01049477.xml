	<brief_title>The Effects of Music Therapy on Women's Anxiety Before and During Cesarean Delivery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Music has been suggested and evaluated as a therapeutic intervention to reduce preoperative anxiety for surgical patients. Music intervention in the immediate preoperative period may be effective in lowering anxiety levels during Cesarean delivery. If this investigation shows that music intervention before and after Cesarean delivery reduces anxiety levels, this intervention can be integrated into future operative care for women having scheduled or emergency Cesarean deliveries. Music therapy could be expanded to included patients undergoing other surgical procedures under regional anesthesia. The effect of reducing anxiety levels could aid in lactation initiation and improve infant bonding in new mothers, but it could also shorten postoperative recovery time for all surgical patients.</detailed_description>
