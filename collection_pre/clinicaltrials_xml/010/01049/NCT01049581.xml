	<brief_summary>Aquatic intervention had been applied in children with neuromotor impairment for years, yet there has been little progress toward objective identifications of therapy goals, interventions, and outcomes. Thus, we attempt to design aquatic intervention activity for children with cerebral palsy to evaluate the effect of hydrotherapy. Purpose: To evaluate the effects of pediatric aquatic therapy on motor performance, daily activity and social participation in children with spastic cerebral palsy. Method: The study enrolled 27 children with spastic cerebral palsy aged from 4 to 12 years old.These children were dived into two groups: traditional rehabilitation therapy (control group), and hospital based pediatric aquatic therapy program. We evaluate the motor performance, daily activity and social participation before and after the intervention and compared the difference in improvement between groups. The measurements include modified Ashworth score, Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM -66), Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale (VABS) , and Cerebral Palsy Quality of Life Questionnaire for Children (CPQOL). Expect effect: We suppose pediatric aquatic therapy in spastic cerebral palsy children could improve motor function and daily activity.Children could improve self-esteem and we hypothesize this could improve social participation.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- We conducted a well-designed study to investigate the effectiveness of PAT on motor function, activities of daily living (ADL),and health related quality of life(HRQOL) perspectives for children with CP. - A convenience sample of 27 children was recruited for the study from the outpatient clinics of the Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation of two tertiary hospitals: Chang Gung Memorial Hospital and Taipei Veterans General Hospital. - The study was designed as a single blinded, prospective, case control study. - The pediatric aquatic therapy group got more improvementon motor performance measured by GMFM-66.</detailed_description>
