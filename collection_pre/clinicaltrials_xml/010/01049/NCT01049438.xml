	<brief_title>A Prospective Trial of Nasal Mupirocin, Hexachlorophene Body Wash, and Systemic Antibiotics for Prevention of Recurrent Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus Infections</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Staphylococcus aureus is a ubiquitous pathogen, and causes infections of the skin, lung, bloodstream, and other body parts. Over the past decade,community-acquired methicillin resistant S. aureus (CA-MRSA) infections, which were previously extremely rare, are occurring commonly worldwide. CA-MRSA is the most common cause of skin infection in many locales in the U.S. CA-MRSA strains are notable for their ability to spread in closed settings and cause recurrent infections among healthy persons. Management of recurrent CA-MRSA infection is challenging and optimal prevention strategies are undefined. Many experts recommend topical agents that decontaminate the body and/or anterior nares. However, there are no data that quantify the efficacy and safety of this approach. We conducted a prospective non-comparative clinical trial to quantify the efficacy and safety of body decolonization regimens in the prevention of CA-MRSA infection from an Infectious Diseases private practice group in Northern California. The study population comprised of persons suffering from recurrent CA-MRSA infection. For this clinical trial, all subjects will be given: nasal mupirocin (Bactroban Nasal, twice daily), topical 3% hexachlorophene body wash (Phisohex, daily), and an oral anti-MRSA antibiotic. The choice of oral antibiotic was based on investigators choice and antibiotic susceptibility of prior MRSA isolates in a given patient. Patients were interviewed in person baseline and by phone at 2 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months using a standardized questionnaire. The baseline survey, based on a previously developed instrument used for an epidemiologic investigation of MRSA asked about MRSA risk factors and health-related quality of life. Follow up surveys asked about adverse drug effects, especially gastrointestinal and dermatologic side effects (2 week visit only) and incident skin and MRSA infections.</detailed_description>
