	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the optimal vaccination schedule for a Quadrivalent Meningococcal (A, C, Y and W-135) Tetanus Protein Conjugate Vaccine (TetraMen-T) in order to provide an effective protein conjugate quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine in the population with the highest incidence of disease. Objectives: - To describe the safety profile of TetraMen-T vaccine administered at 5 different schedules and concomitantly with routine pediatric vaccinations. - To describe the immunogenicity profile of TetraMen-T vaccine administered at 5 different schedules and concomitantly with routine pediatric vaccinations. - To describe the immunogenicity profiles of selected licensed pediatric vaccines (Pentacel, Prevnar, M-M-RII and Varivax) when administered either concomitantly with or without TetraMen-T vaccine.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Participants will receive study vaccinations beginning at age 2, 6, or 12 months, depending on the assigned schedule in their randomized groups. All participants will undergo safety and immunogenicity assessments according to the schedule for their assigned group.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria : Groups 1, 2, 3, 6, and 7: Aged 42 to 89 days on the day of inclusion; Group 4: Aged 6 months (180 days ± 14 days) on the day of inclusion; Group 5: Aged 12 months (365 days + 14 days) on the day of inclusion Born at full term of pregnancy (≥ 37 weeks) and with a birth weight ≥ 2.5 kg Informed consent form has been signed and dated by the parent or other legally acceptable representative Participant and parent/guardian are able to attend all scheduled visits and to comply with all trial procedures Group 4 only: Prior receipt of Pentacel and Prevnar at 2 and 4 months; 1 or 2 doses of rotavirus vaccine; and 2 or 3 previous doses of hepatitis B vaccine Group 5 only: Prior receipt of Pentacel and Prevnar at 2, 4, and 6 months; 2 or 3 doses of rotavirus vaccine; and 3 previous doses of hepatitis B vaccine Exclusion Criteria : Participation in another clinical trial investigating a vaccine, drug, medical device, or medical procedure in the 4 weeks preceding the first trial vaccination Planned participation in another clinical trial during the present trial period Receipt of any vaccine in the 4 weeks preceding the first trial vaccination Planned receipt of any vaccine in the 4 weeks following any trial vaccination, with the exception of influenza vaccine, which may be received 14 days before or after TetraMenT vaccine Previous vaccination against meningococcal disease with either the trial vaccine or another vaccine Receipt of blood or bloodderived products in the past 30 days, which might interfere with assessment of the immune response Known or suspected congenital or acquired immunodeficiency; or receipt of immunosuppressive therapy such as anticancer chemotherapy or radiation therapy; or longterm systemic corticosteroid therapy (prednisone or equivalent for more than 2 consecutive weeks) Known personal or maternal seropositivity for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B vaccine, or hepatitis C, as reported by the parent/guardian History of meningococcal infection, confirmed either clinically, serologically, or microbiologically At high risk for meningococcal infection during the trial Known systemic hypersensitivity to any of the vaccine components, or history of a lifethreatening reaction to the vaccines used in the trial or to a vaccine containing any of the same substances Thrombocytopenia, as reported by the parent/guardian Bleeding disorder, or receipt of anticoagulants in the 3 weeks preceding inclusion, contraindicating intramuscular vaccination History of seizures Personal or family history of GuillainBarré Syndrome (GBS) Chronic illness that, in the opinion of the investigator, is at a stage where it might interfere with trial conduct or completion Temporary contraindications to be resolved before vaccination: Febrile illness (temperature ≥38.0°C [≥100.4°F]) or moderate or severe acute illness/infection (according to investigator judgment) on the day of vaccination Group 5 only: Receipt of oral or injected antibiotic therapy within the 72 hours prior to the study blood draw. Topical antibiotics or antibiotic drops are not included in this exclusion criterion. (Note: This does not apply to the other groups at this time, as they will not be having a blood draw within 30 days of the initial visit.)</criteria>
