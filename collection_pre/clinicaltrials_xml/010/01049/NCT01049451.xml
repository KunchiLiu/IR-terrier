	<brief_summary>We hypothesize that corticotropin or adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH), administered as Acthar GelÂ® (MANUFACTURER NAME) is effective in the control of clinical disease activity as a pulse therapy for relapsing-remitting MS when added to standard treatment with beta-interferon. We wish to determine whether ACTH, when administered as clustered monthly intramuscular injections (monthly pulse therapy) as add-on to beta-interferons, may be a safe and effective alternative to monthly pulse therapy with MP. In addition, we hypothesize that pulse therapy with ACTH alters immune function to favor a regulatory, rather than a pro-inflammatory T cell environment.</brief_summary>
