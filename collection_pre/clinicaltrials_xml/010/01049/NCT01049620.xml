	<brief_summary>It is expected that RAD001 works in gastric cancer by inhibiting PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and Hif1A (hypoxia inducible factor 1, alpha subunit), a key player in angiogenesis and the growth of tumors like renal cell carcinoma.However, RAD001 alone looks not enough to control gastric cancer. By the mechanisms above, RAD001 can show additive or synergistic effect in combination with conventional chemotherapy. In this study, XELOX was selected as a conventional combination chemotherapy because it was proven very active and safe in gastric cancer. Combination of XELOX and RAD001 has been never tried for the treatment of cancer patients yet. So, the optimal dose will be first determined in this phase I study</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>For the first cohort of this phase I study, each drug of capecitabine, oxaliplatin, and RAD001 will be started at one or two dose below the ordinary full dose of each drug as a single agent.</detailed_description>
