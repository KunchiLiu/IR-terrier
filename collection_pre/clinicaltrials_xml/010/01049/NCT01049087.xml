	<brief_summary>The purpose of the present study is to compare plasma volume determination by 99mTc-labeled albumin with 125I-labeled albumin. Fifteen subjects will be enrolled. The hypothesis is that plasma volume determined by the different methods are the same.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Plasma Volume Determination by 99mTc-labeled Albumin and 125I-labeled Albumin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For many years, radioiodinated albumin has been "the golden standard" for measurement of plasma volume. There are a number of clinical situations in which a nuclide with a shorter half-life would be preferred. Furthermore, due to periodic lapses in the availability in the delivery of 125I-labeled albumin, there is a need to evaluate another nuclide as a tracer for plasma volume determination. 99mTc-labeled albumin is easily prepared by a simple and reproducible method with a high labeling efficiency and short half-life. In this study, we want to compare plasma volume determined by 99mTc-labeled albumin with plasma volume determined by 125I-albumin (golden standard). In both procedures, plasma volume is estimated from multiple postinjection samples for accurate zero-time extrapolation in order to correct for leakage of labeled albumin from the vascular compartment.</detailed_description>
