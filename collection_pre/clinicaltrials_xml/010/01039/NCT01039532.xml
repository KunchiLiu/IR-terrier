	<brief_summary>It is a proven fact that Basal Bolus insulin regimen is the near- physiological regimen &amp; Thrice daily Biphasic Insulin Aspart is a comparable alternative for glycemic control in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients. In this study the investigators evaluated whether Biphasic Human Insulin can be used in a thrice daily regimen in place of BIAsp. As the regimen is less expensive and one prick less than the basal-bolus regimen, it can be a good alternative for a diabetics in India. This is a 12 week Open labelled parallel-Randomised controlled pilot study - 50 patients with type 2 Diabetes mellitus was selected after satisfying the inclusion and exclusion criteria's .Metformin and pioglitazone were continued and they are randomised into 2 groups at base line and was allotted into any of the two regimens. 1. Basal detemir + bolus aspart or 2. Thrice Daily Biphasic Human Insulin Regimen. The two regimens were compared by the following variables: Primary endpoint: Glycaemic control Secondary endpoint: Weight gain, Hypoglycaemic episodes, Adverse effects and Cost effectiveness</brief_summary>
