	<brief_title>Tai Chi for Osteopenic Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Osteopenia is a serious and growing public health concern for women. Osteopenic women are at greater risk for fractures than women with normal bone mineral densities (BMD). Low BMD-related fractures are associated with significant long-term impairment, high morbidity rates and high medical costs. Optimal preventive and sustainable interventions for osteopenic women are not yet well-defined. Tai Chi, a mind-body exercise that is growing in popularity in the U.S., shows may be an effective, safe and practical intervention for women with low bone density. Preliminary studies suggest Tai Chi can reduce rates of BMD decline in post-menopausal women. While suggestive, these studies have numerous design limitations. We propose a pilot randomized controlled trial to assess the efficacy and feasibility of Tai Chi as an adjunct to standard care for post-menopausal osteopenic women. Eight-six osteopenic women ages 45-70 will be recruited from a large multi-specialty group practice. Our primary aim is to assess the feasibility for recruiting and retaining osteopenic women into a randomized controlled trial of 9 months of Tai Chi. Our secondary aim is to collect preliminary data on the efficacy of Tai Chi in reducing rates of bone loss in osteopenic women using sensitive markers of bone turnover and dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. The results of this study will inform the design of a future trial evaluating the benefits and safety for Tai Chi for osteopenic women, as well as the physiological and biomechanical mechanisms through which Tai Chi may impact BMD and fracture risks associated with osteopenia.</detailed_description>
