	<brief_summary>In Parkinson's disease, treatment mainly aims to improve motor functions. However, other dysfunctions are often observed in Parkinson's patients, and may have important consequences on the quality of life of patients. Cognitive and neuropsychological troubles may be observed, as memory impairment or anxiety for example. As this kind of troubles is worrying for the patient himself (herself) and his/her family, treatment needs to take into account those troubles in addition to motor difficulties. In our centre, we have already used continuous Apomorphine infusions among Parkinson's patients and it seems to have good results. The present study aims to objectively assess the efficacy of continuous Apomorphine infusions on cognitive and neuropsychological functions in Parkinson's disease using clinical and positron emission tomography (PET)-scan measures.</brief_summary>
