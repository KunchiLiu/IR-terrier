	<brief_title>A Study Evaluating STA-9090 in Patients With Metastatic and/or Unresectable Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor (GIST)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Planned: - Stage 1: 23 patients. If â‰¥4 patients had clinical benefit, an additional 32 patients were to be enrolled. Up to 3 additional patients with platelet-derived growth factor receptor, alpha polypeptide (PDGFRA) mutation were to be enrolled, regardless of the total study enrollment. - Stage 2: 55 patients. Progressing to this stage was dependent on Stage 1 results. Analyzed: - Stage 1: 27 patients were enrolled and analyzed. The study was not expanded to Stage 2 due to insufficient efficacy.</detailed_description>
