	<brief_summary>This phase II trial studies how well rilotumumab works in treating patients with ovarian epithelial, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer that has failed to respond to other therapies (persistent) or has returned after a period of improvement (recurrent). Rilotumumab is a type of drug called a monoclonal antibody, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread by targeting certain cells and blocking them from working.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Rilotumumab in Treating Patients With Persistent or Recurrent Ovarian Epithelial Cancer, Fallopian Tube Cancer, or Primary Peritoneal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To estimate the proportion of patients who survive progression-free for at least 6 months and the proportion of patients who have objective tumor response (complete or partial) in patients with persistent or recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal carcinoma. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the frequency and severity of adverse events associated with treatment with AMG 102 (rilotumumab) as assessed by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE). II. To determine the duration of progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To explore the association between a panel of biomarkers (as assayed by immunohistochemistry and mutation analysis) and measures of response to treatment with AMG 102 (rilotumumab) and clinical outcome in archived tumor tissue. II. To evaluate circulating pre- and post-treatment levels of hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor and markers of angiogenesis and their association with response to treatment with AMG 102 (rilotumumab) and clinical outcome. OUTLINE: Patients receive rilotumumab intravenously (IV) over 30-60 minutes on days 1 and 14. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must have recurrent or persistent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal carcinoma; histologic confirmation of the original primary tumor is required via the pathology report All patients must have measurable disease as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1; measurable disease is defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded); each lesion must be &gt;= 10 mm when measured by computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or caliper measurement by clinical exam; or &gt;= 20 mm when measured by chest xray; lymph nodes must be &gt;= 15 mm in short axis when measured by CT or MRI Patient must have at least one "target lesion" to be used to assess response on this protocol as defined by RECIST 1.1; tumors within a previously irradiated field will be designated as "nontarget" lesions unless progression is documented or a biopsy is obtained to confirm persistence at least 90 days following completion of radiation therapy Patients must not be eligible for a higher priority Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) protocol, if one exists; in general, this would refer to any active GOG Phase III protocol for the same patient population Patients who have received one prior regimen must have a GOG performance status of 0, 1, or 2 Patients who have received two prior regimens must have a GOG performance status of 0 or 1 Recovery from effects of recent surgery, radiotherapy, or chemotherapy Major surgical procedures must have taken place &gt; 30 days before enrollment; minor surgical procedures must have taken place &gt; 14 days before enrollment; central venous catheter placement is allowed at any time prior to enrollment provided the patient has recovered and any surgical would has healed Patients should be free of active infection requiring antibiotics (with the exception of uncomplicated urinary tract infections [UTI]) Any hormonal therapy directed at the malignant tumor must be discontinued at least one week prior to registration Any other prior therapy directed at the malignant tumor, including immunologic agents, must be discontinued at least three weeks prior to registration Patients must have had one prior platinumbased chemotherapeutic regimen for management of primary disease containing carboplatin, cisplatin, or another organoplatinum compound; this initial treatment may have included intraperitoneal therapy, highdose therapy, consolidation, noncytotoxic agents or extended therapy administered after surgical or nonsurgical assessment Patients are allowed to receive, but are not required to receive, one additional cytotoxic regimen for management of recurrent or persistent disease according to the following definition: Cytotoxic regimens include any agent that targets the genetic and/or mitotic apparatus of dividing cells, resulting in doselimiting toxicity to the bone marrow and/or gastrointestinal mucosa Note: Patients on this noncytotoxic study are allowed to have received prior cytotoxic chemotherapy for management of recurrent or persistent disease, as defined above; however, patients are encouraged to enroll on secondline noncytotoxic studies prior to receiving additional cytotoxic therapy Patients who have received only one prior cytotoxic regimen (platinumbased regimen for management of primary disease), must have a platinumfree interval of less than 12 months, or have progressed during platinumbased therapy, or have persistent disease after a platinumbased therapy Patients must NOT have received any noncytotoxic therapy for management of recurrent or persistent disease; patients are allowed to receive, but are not required to receive, biologic (noncytotoxic) therapy as part of their primary treatment regimen Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater than or equal to 1,500/mcl Platelets greater than or equal to 100,000/mcl Hemoglobin &gt;= 9 g/dL Creatinine less than or equal to 1.5 x institutional upper limit normal (ULN) Bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 x ULN Serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) (aspartate aminotransferase [AST]) less than or equal to 3 x ULN Alkaline phosphatase less than or equal to 2.5 x ULN PTT (partial thromboplastin time) =&lt;

patients are also excluded if their previous cancer treatment contraindicates this protocol therapy Patients who have received prior radiotherapy to any portion of the abdominal cavity or pelvis OTHER THAN for the treatment of ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer within the last three years are excluded; prior radiation for localized cancer of the breast, head and neck, or skin is permitted, provided that it was completed more than three years prior to registration, and the patient remains free of recurrent or metastatic disease Patients who have received prior chemotherapy for any abdominal or pelvic tumor OTHER THAN for the treatment of ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer within the last three years are excluded;
