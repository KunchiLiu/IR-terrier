	<brief_summary>The Division of Kidney Urology and Hematology Disease (DKUHD) of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) funded a cooperative agreement (UO1) for a consortium of participating clinical centers (PCCs) and a data coordinating and imaging analysis center (DCIAC) to develop and implement studies to test whether imaging techniques can provide accurate and reproducible markers of progression of renal disease in patients with polycystic kidney disease. The awarded participating clinical centers are Emory University, University of Kansas, and Mayo Foundation (with a subcontract to the University of Alabama). The awarded DCIAC is Washington University in St. Louis. Due to the relocation of the DCIAC P.I. from Washington University to the University of Pittsburgh, the DCIAC for CRISP II is located at the University of Pittsburgh.</brief_summary>
