	<brief_summary>The relationship between WM lesions (WM) and Postural Instability Gait Disorders (PIGD-PD)in Parkinson's disease patients is largely unknown. We hypothesize that sub-clinical WM pathology may be a major contributing factor to PIGD-PD. We will compare two groups of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD): those with PIGD and patients with dominant tremor (n=120)to assess the role of brain WM changes.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>To compare brain WM burden using MRI in PD patients with and without PIGD. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) analysis techniques will be applied.We will quantify PIGD-related symptoms including cognitive function, balance and gait and their associations with MRI findings.</detailed_description>
