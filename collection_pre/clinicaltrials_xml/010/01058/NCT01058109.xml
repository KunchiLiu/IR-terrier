	<brief_summary>The aim of this experimental study was to test the effect of increasing dietary calcium intake to 1500 mg/day on increases in bone quality in adolescent females. The hypothesis to be tested is: adolescent females who consume a high calcium diet will have a greater increase in bone quality, as measured by densitometry and ultrasound, than adolescent females who consume their usual dietary calcium intake.</brief_summary>
