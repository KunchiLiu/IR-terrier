	<brief_summary>Single site study: The goal of the study is to determine the incidence of new onset atrial fibrillation (AF) in patients with severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) syndrome through the use of a Medtronic Reveal XT implantable Loop recorder (ILR). The ILR device is approved for use in Canada, for the assessment of atrial fibrillation.</brief_summary>
