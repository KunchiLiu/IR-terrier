	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to demonstrate the efficacy of a single embryo transfer at blastocyst stage (Day 5) after co-culture on Autologous Endometrial Cell Culture (AECC) versus transfer of a single embryo at Day 3 after culture in conventional medium. Efficacy will be assessed in terms of clinical pregnancy rate 5 to 8 weeks after embryo transfer.</brief_summary>
