	<brief_summary>Juvenile onset recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (JORRP) is a rare, difficult to treat, benign tumor of the pediatric airway. Current therapy is mainly surgical, but in a significant portion of patients adjuvant therapy is required to control the disease process. Although multiple adjuvant medical therapies have been tried, success has been limited. We have seen some success in a limited amount of patients using orally administered propranolol. Our goal is to enroll a larger cohort of patients to determine the effectiveness of propranolol as an adjuvant therapy for JORRP.</brief_summary>
