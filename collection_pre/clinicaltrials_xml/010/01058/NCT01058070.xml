	<brief_title>An Observational Clinical Feasibility Study of the Magnetic Esophageal Sphincter</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this feasibility study is to collect preliminary performance and safety information and develop procedural optimization for the Torax Medical Inc. Magnetic Esophageal Sphincter device (MES) in reinforcement of Esophageal Sphincter function to treat Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD). The information from this study will be used to support the design and conduct of an expanded clinical trial.</detailed_description>
