	<brief_title>Study to Evaluate the Clinical Performance of SynergEyes A2 Hybrid Contact Lenses</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hybrid contact lenses have been previously shown to be a safe and effective method to correct refractive errors with and without astigmatism. The hybrid contact lens design may provide greater visual acuity and comfort than other soft or rigid gas permeable (RGP) lenses currently available. The purpose of this study is to confirm the design of the SynergEyes A2 lens by evaluating clinical performance and, if necessary, modify certain lens parameters in order to optimize lens performance. Objective and subjective parameters will be used to evaluate the lens.</detailed_description>
