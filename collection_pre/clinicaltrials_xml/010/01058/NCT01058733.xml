	<brief_summary>Background - Various kinds of interactive online communication systems have been introduced for long-term diabetes management, and their importance in managing patients is increasing. The investigators investigated the amount of physician time needed to maintain such a system, and the investigators developed software to maximise the cost effectiveness. Methods - The investigators conducted a prospective, randomised, controlled trial to investigate the efficacy and safety of a semi-automatic response system (SARS) for online glucose monitoring over a 24-week period of patients with type 2 diabetes. In the SARS group, the "SARS" software filtered the recorded self-monitoring of blood glucose data automatically to reduce the physicians' time, and the physicians managed patients regularly but only manually in the control (manual) group. The investigators measured the time spent by the physicians for online management and compared the HbA1c levels at enrolment and follow-up.</brief_summary>
