	<brief_summary>Study outline: Deferasirox (Exjade®) is regularly used in severe iron overload in order to avoid organ damage of liver, heart and other organs. It has been proposed, that iron overload may not only impose damage to other organs but also to the bone marrow and thus worsen hematopoietic insufficiency in patients with MDS. Patients presenting with low or INT-1 risk MDS with only mild iron overload will be treated with deferasirox in this study. It will be analyzed if hematological improvement can be observed during this treatment.</brief_summary>
