	<brief_summary>This study investigates potential protective effect of atorvastatin pre-treatment in patient with stable coronary artery disease undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) on chronic statin therapy. Patients are randomized into two groups: atorvastatin pre-treatment group (80mg atorvastatin seven days before PCI) and control group (PCI without atorvastatin pretreatment, chronic statin treatment). Endpoint is myocardial infarction measured by troponin I and creatine kinase myocardial band.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This randomized study investigates potential protective effect of high dose atorvastatin pre-treatment in patient with stable coronary artery disease undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and chronic statin therapy. Two arms: 1. atorvastatin pre-treatment group (80mg atorvastatin for seven days) 2. control group (without atorvastatin pre-treatment, chronic statin treatment) Primary endpoint: Periprocedural myocardial infarction measured by troponin I level (time frame 24 hours) Secondary endpoint: Periprocedural myocardial infarction measured by creatine kinase myocardial band (time frame 24 hours)</detailed_description>
