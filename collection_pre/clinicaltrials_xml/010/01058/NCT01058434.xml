	<criteria>1. Cytopathologically or histologically confirmed diagnosis of multiple myeloma previously requiring systemic treatment. 2. Evidence of relapsed or refractory disease as documented from the prior treatment history. (Refractory myeloma is defined as disease that is nonresponsive while on salvage therapy, or progresses within 60 days of last therapy. Relapsed myeloma is defined as previously treated myeloma which after a period of being offtherapy requires the initiation of salvage therapy. Detailed definitions provided in the PTS1) 3. Have received at least 2 prior treatment regimens for multiple myeloma including chemotherapy, autologous transplantation, immunotherapy, or other investigational agents. Preplanned induction, followed by transplant and maintenance should be considered as one regimen. 4. Presence of measurable disease as defined by at least one of the following; Serum Mprotein ≥ 1g/dL (measurable disease) Urine Mprotein ≥ 200mg/24 hours by protein electrophoresis (measurable disease) 1. Patients with nonsecretory, or oligosecretory, multiple myeloma. 2. Patients with symptomatic amyloidosis, or with plasma cell leukemia. 3. Patients who have received allogeneic stem cell transplantation and who show evidence of active graftversushost disease that requires immunosuppressive therapy. Other protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply</criteria>
