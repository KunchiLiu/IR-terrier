	<brief_title>The Impact of Short Message Services (SMS) on ARV Adherence in Western Kenya</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Several studies have shown that proper adherence to treatment regimens is essential for the effectiveness of ARV therapy (e.g Wools-Kaloustian et al. 2006). There is also evidence in that in some treatment programs in Africa, adherence rates are not always high (Gill et al. 2005). Even in settings where adherence levels are found to be high, numerous factors have been identified as being relevant, although the causal effects are unknown (Castro, 2006). As ARV treatment programs are scaled up in Africa, it is essential to understand the socio-economic determinants of adherence to ARV treatment, as well as the impact of interventions to support high levels of adherence. A secondary objective of this study is to understand the socio-economic impacts of higher adherence.</detailed_description>
