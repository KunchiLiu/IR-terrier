	<brief_summary>The present project aims at evaluating the diagnostic potential of high-field MRI (3 Teslas) for joint disease. At this field, given that isotropic image resolution of 400 microns can be obtained, one could expect an early detection of joint abnormalities. The additional aim of this project will be to develop a quantitative analyse of the corresponding high-resolution images.</brief_summary>
