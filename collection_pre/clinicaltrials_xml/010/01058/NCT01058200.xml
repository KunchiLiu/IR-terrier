	<brief_title>a Randomized Multicenter Trial Comparing Vacuum Assisted Delivery With the New Device "iCUP" Versus the Reference Cup.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently, instrumental extractions are used in about 10% to 15% of the 860 000 annual deliveries in France and the use of vacuum extractors increases from year to year. In addition to sterilizable vacuum extractors several different types of vacuum extractor have been developed, in particular the single use Kiwi cup or the so-called 'soft' cup extractors. However, studies evaluating these new cups have not shown their superiority in comparison to the conventional metallic vacuum extractor. Accordingly, it is legitimate to assess the new vacuum extractor iCup, an innovative "mix" of metallic cup and 'soft' cups that should combine the advantages of both; and to compare the iCup vacuum extractor with the sterilizable metallic cup extractor, the most effective vacuum extractors available to date.</detailed_description>
