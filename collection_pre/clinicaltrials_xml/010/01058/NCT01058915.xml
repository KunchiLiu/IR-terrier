	<brief_summary>In patients with ST-segment elevation acute myocardial infarction (STEMI) increased LDL-cholesterol reduction (rosuvastatin 40 mg) will provide incremental plaque stabilization (changes in plaque composition) and plaque regression over 12 months beyond the benefit of moderate LDL-cholesterol reduction (rosuvastatin 5 mg) (assessed by IVUS and VH).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>ST segment elevation acute myocardial infarction 20% &lt; angiographic diameter stenosis &lt; 50% on a not previously revascularized native coronary artery Statin na√Øve Pharmacologic lipid lowering treatment before index hospitalization Atrial fibrillation, not well ratecontrolled Ventricle frequency variation with more than a factor 2 over 1 minute Unconscious patients Total cholesterol &gt; 7.0 mmol/l History of statin induced myopathy, or serious hypersensitivity reaction to other HMGCoA reductase inhibitors (statins) including rosuvastatin Pregnant women, women who are breast feeding, and women of childbearing potential who are not using chemical or mechanical contraception or have a positive serum pregnancy test (a serumhuman chorionic gonadotrophin [BetaHCG] analysis) History of malignancy (unless a documented disease free period exceeding 5years is present) with the exception of basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, or in the case of a study designed to investigate antineoplastic properties of rosuvastatin. Women with a history of cervical dysplasia would be permitted to enter the study provided they had 3 consecutive clear Papanicolaou (Pap) smears Uncontrolled hypothyroidism (TSH &gt; 1.5xULN) Abnormal LFT's History of alcohol or drug abuse within the last 5 years (this may affect compliance) Current active liver disease (ALT/SGPT &gt;2xULN or severe hepatic impairment (to protect patient safety as directed on the labels of currently approved statins) Unexplained creatine kinase (CK &gt; 3xULN) (To protect patient safety) (will be increased at baseline because of acute ST segment elevation myocardial infarction a few days before enrolment) Serum creatinine &gt;176mmol/L (2.0mg/dL) (unless the protocol specifically aims to investigate a chronic renal disease population) Participation in another investigational drug study less than 4 weeks before enrolment in the study, or according to subjects local ethics committee requirements where a larger period is stipulated (to avoid potential misinterpretation of overlapping adverse events) Treatments with cyclosporine Treatment with gemfibrozil</criteria>
