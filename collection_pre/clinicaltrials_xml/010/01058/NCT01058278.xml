	<brief_summary>The present study's main objective is to assess if there is a significant difference between either of the treatments frequently used in post-op, namely a topic cortisone-based treatment, an non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) or simply a placebo, in order to gain the best long term (6 months) efficacy of the SLT.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Impact Post-operative Treatment on Intraocular Pressure Post-SLT on Patients With Primary Open-angle Glaucoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The selective laser trabeculoplasty (SLT) is the laser treatment of choice for treating glaucoma. A There is however a controversy regarding the use of drops post-treatment. Indeed, some would prefer not to pharmacologically modulate the post-op inflammatory response which can be an integral part of the treatment by favouring the mobilisation of the macrophages which participate to the trabeculae "cleaning". Others will prefer to calm the inflammatory reaction and choose an anti-inflammatory drug (either steroidal or non-steroidal).</detailed_description>
