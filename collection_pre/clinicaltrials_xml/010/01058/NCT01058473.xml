	<brief_summary>Historically, sickle cell disease has not been viewed in the chronic pain paradigm because of its recurrent nature. Patients with sickle cell disease may be hospitalized for extended periods of time. As the hospital stay progresses, patients with SCD pain are often observed by clinicians to have improvements in function in areas such as self-care, mobility, and recreation despite continued self-report of high pain scores. This pattern of functional improvement with continued report of high pain intensity scores is common in patients with recurrent and chronic pain. A functional assessment tool that can assess function in the acute inpatient setting is needed. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the Inpatient Pediatric Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPPAQ), as a measure of daily function in children with sickle cell disease hospitalized with vasoocclusive pain.</brief_summary>
