	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy of an Inactivated and Non Adjuvanted Vaccine Against Influenza A in Renal Transplant Recipients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>120 renal transplant recipients under triple immunosuppression will be immunized against influenza H1N1v. The primary endpoint will be the humoral immunity assessed 21 days after each injection on day 0 and day 21: - seroprotection rate, defined as the percentage of patients with an antibody title against Hemaglutinin ≥ 1/40e after immunization - seroconversion rate, defined as the the percentage of patients with an antibody title against Hemaglutinin &lt; 1/10e before immunization and ≥ 1/40e after or with a prevaccine title ≥1/10e increasing at least 4 fold after immunization - seroconversion factor, defined as the ratio between pre and post vaccine geometrical means of the antibody titles. Secondary endpoints will be: - Seroconversion rate, seroprotection rate and seroconversion factor on day 182 - Percentage of patients with an antibody title &gt; 1/40e on day 182 (Immune memory) - Number and severity of clinical and biological adverse events - Number of cases of pandemic H1N1v influenza virologically confirmed - Study of associated parameters influencing the results of H1N1v vaccination in terms of seroprotection, seroconversion and seroconversion factor - Assessment of the cellular immune response against H1N1v - Assessment of the H1N1v vaccination on graft function and on humoral anti-HLA response.</detailed_description>
