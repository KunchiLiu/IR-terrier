	<brief_summary>Proof of concept, of RYGBP and its capabilities to cure type 2 diabetes (DM 2) and sleep apnea has already been recognized in the reports on weight loss surgery. The investigators project aims to prove that RYGBP also recovers the beta cell function (BCF) Clamp tests, the gold standard for testing IS and BCF, will be performed preoperative and early postoperatively. Aims &amp; methodology: Analysis of the short-term effect of gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy on insulin sensitivity and beta cell function. Preoperative baseline insulin sensitivity and beta cell function will be assessed with euglycemic and hyperglycemic clamp tests. These results will be compared with the results of the same tests carried out 3 weeks postoperative. To determine if the duodenal exclusion is causing this effect. The results of the clamp tests 3 weeks postoperative will be compared</brief_summary>
