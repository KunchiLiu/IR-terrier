	<brief_summary>Prospective multicentre randomized (1:1) investigator initiated study, in which consecutive patients undergoing percutaneous revascularization of small coronary vessels will be assigned to one of the two study arms: 1. Treatment Arm: IN.PACT Falcon™ paclitaxel drug-eluting balloon (DEB) dilatation and provisional spot bare-metal stenting (BMS). 2. Control Arm: paclitaxel-eluting stent (PES) implantation as per standard practice. Eligible subjects with coronary artery disease in a small vessel (reference diameter&lt;2.8mm) will be consecutively screened and enrolled based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria The objective of the study is to assess the non-inferiority of the DEB to the PES as regards to primary endpoint of mean late lumen loss (LLL) at 6 months, defined as the difference between postprocedural minimum luminal (MLD) diameter and follow-up MLD, as assessed by quantitative coronary angiography and is based on the following assumptions: 1. The means of LLL in the 2 groups are precisely equal 2. A standard deviation in LLL of 0.5mm in both groups as demonstrated in the ISAR-SMART 3 and PEPCAD II trials 3. A non-inferiority margin of 0.25mm between groups is clinically unimportant Based on these assumptions: 1. Null hypothesis (N0): mean LLL in DEB group is ≥0.25mm than that in the PES group (i.e. PES is superior to DEB) 2. Alternative hypothesis 1 (H1): mean LLL between DEB and PES is &lt;0.25mm (i.e. DEB is non-inferior to PES) 3. Alternative hypothesis 2 (H2): mean LLL between DEB and PES &lt;0 (i.e. DEB is superior to PES) Based on the above calculations, a sample size of 77 patients will be required in each group to show non-inferiority of DEB vs. PES with an α error of 0.025 (one-sided Z test) and a power of 80%. To account for a 20% rate of withdrawal, lost to follow-up or not presenting for follow-up angiography, a total of 182 patients (91 in each group) will be randomized.</brief_summary>

Patients with any known allergy, hypersensitivity or intolerance to acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), Clopidogrel or Ticlopidine, Paclitaxel. Any known allergy to contrast medium that cannot be pretreated. Angiographic exclusion criteria: &gt;2 epicardial vessels requiring revascularization. Target lesion distance from the ostium of left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD)/left circumflex coronary artery (LCX)/right coronary artery (RCA) is &lt; 5 mm. Target lesion is located in either a venous or arterial graft. Target vessel contains a previously implanted stent. Angiographic evidence of thrombus at the target site. Chronic total occlusions. Restenotic lesions. Bifurcation lesions which the operator decides a 2stent technique as intentiontotreat is required OR bifurcations with side branches ≥ 2.5mm.
