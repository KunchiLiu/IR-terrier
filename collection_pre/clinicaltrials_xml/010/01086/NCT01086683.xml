	<brief_title>Rehabilitation of Cancer Survivors in Denmark: The Effect of a Psychosocial Rehabilitation Course</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Worldwide, the number of cancer survivors is increasing. In the Danish population of 5.4 million people, more than 300 000 are cancer survivors. Given the range of physical, psychological and social late effects of cancer and its primary treatment many survivors need tailored rehabilitation interventions. This randomized study evaluates the effect of a multi-focused, psychosocial 6-day residential rehabilitation course at the Dallund Rehabilitation Centre in Denmark. We hypothesize that individuals in the intervention group will experience better psychosocial well-being and more adaptive health behaviour changes as compared to individuals in the control group.</detailed_description>
