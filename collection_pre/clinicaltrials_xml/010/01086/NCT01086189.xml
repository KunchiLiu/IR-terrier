	<brief_summary>Green tea consumption could lower the risk of type II diabetes, as suggested by epidemiological studies. There is also evidence from intervention studies that green tea can decrease blood glucose levels and contribute to weight loss. The aim with this study is therefore to examine the postprandial effects of green tea on glycemic index, insulin levels and satiety in healthy individuals after the consumption of a meal.</brief_summary>
