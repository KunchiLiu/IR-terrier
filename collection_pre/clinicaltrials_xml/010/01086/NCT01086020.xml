	<brief_summary>Atherosclerosis is a progressive disease. Lipid lowering therapy was the standard treatment for patients with coronary artery disease. Studies indicated that coronary artery plaque progression had positive relationship with the plasma cholesterol level, and could be halted or reversed by intensive statin therapy (such as 20-40 mg/d atorvastatin). Ezetimibe plus statin could further lowered blood cholesterol level. Here the investigators hypothesize that same cholesterol lowering level by routing dose of atorvastatin or lower dose of atorvastatin plus ezetimibe could achieve the same effect on coronary artery plaque cessation or regression.</brief_summary>
