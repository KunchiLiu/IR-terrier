	<brief_summary>Rhinosinusitis disorders are almost regularly associated to Cystic Fibrosis (CF). The basic defect in CF is a dysfunction of chloride channels in exocrine glands which equally concerns upper airway mucosa. It leads to retention of secretions and consecutive chronic inflammation with bacterial superinfection. In CF rhinosinusitis can restrict quality of life, give cause to repeated ear, nose, and throat (ENT) surgery and accelerate disease progression by bacterial acquisition into the airways. The multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, prospective clinical trial aims at the evaluation of a sino-nasal inhalation of sodium chloride 6% compared to isotonic saline with respect to ENT-related quality of life which is influenced by mucus retention and the resulting inflammation.</brief_summary>
