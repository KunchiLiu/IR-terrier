	<mesh_term>Respiratory Aspiration</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Nostril types I and II (Interaxial angle below 41 degrees = type I; interaxial angle from 41 to 70 degrees = type II) Nasal Congestion: Have chronic nocturnal nasal congestion ('always or almost always') for at least the last year. Sleep: Reports trouble with sleep Allergy/Intolerance: Known or suspected intolerance or hypersensitivity to latex. Known or suspected intolerance or hypersensitivity to the study materials (or closely related compounds), allergy or atopic reaction to adhesive bandages or latex. Subject has a chronic skin condition or eczema on the face or nose. Subject has visible open sores, sunburn, irritation on the face or nose immediately prior to treatment. Subject has severe obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome with an AHI score &lt;30 events/hour at the Baseline visit. Subject has had a diagnosis of another major sleep disorder (i.e. primary insomnia, i.e. regularly sleeping less than 6 hours per night, sleep insufficiency, i.e. sleeping &gt;2 hours more on nonwork days as compared to work days, narcolepsy, or periodic limb movement disorder). Subject has a nontypical sleep schedule (e.g. shiftwork). Subject plans travel involving timezone changes during the study period. Subject takes medication known to have a significant effect on sleep. Use of any substance with psychotropic effects or properties known to affect sleep/wake, including but not limited to: neuroleptics, morphine/opioid derivatives, sedative antihistamines, stimulants, antidepressants, clonidine, barbiturates, anxiolytics, thalidomide, hypnotics and sedatives. Use of over the counter sleep promoting agents including diphenhydramine, doxylamine, tryptophan, valerian root, kava kava, melatonin, St John's Wort and Alluna. Use of over the counter alertness aids including caffeine and guarana. Subject currently uses any topical nasal decongestants (nasal sprays, drops, etc). Subject must have discontinued use of topical decongestants at least 7 days prior Baseline. Subject is experiencing an acute upper respiratory tract infection at during qualification phase and at Baseline visit. Subject abuses alcohol (regularly drinks more than 3 drinks per day) or has a recent history (within last 2 years) of substance or alcohol abuse. Regular consumption of xanthinecontaining beverages (i.e. tea, coffee, or cola) comprising usually more than 5 cups or glasses per day. Subject has a positive drug of abuse screening result. Subject has severe, unstable disease states (e.g. myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, diabetes, cirrhosis, cancer, epilepsy, or stroke), pain syndromes, (e.g. fibromyalgia) or any medical or surgical condition that places the subject at unacceptable risk if he/she were to participate in the study or confounds the ability to interpret data from the study or who in the judgement of the principal investigator would not be suitable for entry into this study. Severe nasal obstruction caused by structural abnormality that renders the subject unsuitable for the study in the opinion of the investigator, i.e. nasal polyps, severe deviated septum. Subject is unwilling to be videotaped or recorded during the PSG studies. Current Treatment for Sleep Disordered Breathing a) Subject currently uses devices prescribed for sleep disordered breathing including Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP), mandibular advancement devices, tongue displacement devices. b)Overthecounter products such as chin straps, pillows, internal/external nasal dilators are acceptable provided usage is discontinued at least 28 days prior to Baseline.</criteria>
