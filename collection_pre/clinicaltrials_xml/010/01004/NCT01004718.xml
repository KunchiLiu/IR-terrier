	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Imaging procedures, such as positron emission tomography or computed tomography, may help in detecting differences between Hodgkin lymphoma or diffuse large B-cell lymphoma cancer cells. PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying positron emission tomogaphy and computed tomography in determining differences in Hodgkin lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Detection and Quant of Differences in Hodgkin Lymphoma and Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma Using Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography (PET/CT)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the feasibility of detection and quantification of differences in the temporal and spatial distribution of FDG uptake between lesions of HL and DLBCL. OUTLINE: Patients undergo fludeoxyglucose F18 (FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography scans 60 and 180 minutes after FDG administration. After completion of study, patients are followed for 24 hours.</detailed_description>
