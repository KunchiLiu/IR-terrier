	<brief_title>Effectiveness Study of Community-Based, Peer-Led Education on Weight Loss and Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Weight loss can prevent diabetes and eliminate racial and ethnic disparities in incident diabetes among overweight adults with pre-diabetes. However, proven effective interventions have not been sustained or disseminated in community settings. A community-academic partnership aims to employ community-based participatory research to conduct a randomized controlled trial to test the effectiveness of a culturally tailored, peer-led diabetes prevention intervention that promotes weight loss. People who develop diabetes go through a period when they have "pre-diabetes". In clinical settings, overweight adults with pre-diabetes who reduce their weight by 5-10% can reduce their risk of developing diabetes by 55-60%. To date, there are no studies testing the effectiveness of peer-led, community-based programs in achieving diabetes prevention through weight loss. We will identify and enroll 400 overweight (BMI &gt; 25) adults with pre-diabetes in East Harlem and randomized half into a community-based, peer-led lifestyle education program that teaches simple ways to lose weight.</detailed_description>
