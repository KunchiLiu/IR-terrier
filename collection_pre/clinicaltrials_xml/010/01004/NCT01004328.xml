	<brief_summary>The incidence of drug-induced injury is high in the ambulatory geriatric population, especially for elders with complex healthcare needs during high risk transitions to the ambulatory setting. In a previous study funded by the National Institute on Aging and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality [AHRQ] (AG 15979), the investigators determined that drug-related injuries occur at a rate of more than 50 per 1000-patient years in older adults in the ambulatory setting and that 28% are preventable. Independent risk factors for adverse drug events among older adults in the ambulatory setting included advanced age, multiple comorbid conditions, and the use of medications requiring close monitoring. In this project, Using HIT to Improve Transitions of Complex Elderly Patients from SNF to Home (1 R18 HS017817), the investigators are testing the use of an electronic medical record (EMR)-based transitional care intervention for complex elderly patients transitioning from subacute care in a skilled nursing facility (SNF) to the ambulatory setting. The growing trend for physicians and other healthcare providers to restrict their practices to single settings and not follow complex patients as they move between settings leaves older patients discharged from subacute care particularly vulnerable. This transition is uniquely challenging because of the complex healthcare needs of this population, who often require outpatient primary care physicians to coordinate with visiting nurses in order to manage complex medication regimens and fluctuating clinical status. To facilitate high-quality transitions from the subacute to the ambulatory setting and support interdisciplinary communication, the investigators will use the EMR to assure that physicians in the ambulatory setting receive key health information and alerts.</brief_summary>
