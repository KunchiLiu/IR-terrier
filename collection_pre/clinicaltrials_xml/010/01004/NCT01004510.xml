	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether the addition of the bisphosphonate Zometa (zoledronic acid) used along with standard regimens of chemotherapy, will help to control the need for palliative intervention of malignant pleural effusions due to non-small cell lung cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Zometa Adjuvant Treatment of Malignant Pleural Effusion Due To Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Malignant pleural effusions are common in late stage non-small cell lung cancer and can lead to significantly increased morbidity in this patient population. The majority of patients are symptomatic due to their malignant effusions. The recurrence rates are thought to be quite high overall and may approach 100% without any further treatment.Currently there is no available non-invasive, medical means for controlling the effusions other than systemic chemotherapy.Zoledronic acid has been shown in a mouse model of malignant pleural effusion to decrease fluid accumulation and tumor dissemination while prolonging survival.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically documented nonsmall cell lung cancer, Stages 3B, 4 or recurrent Pleural effusion cytologically proven to be malignant 0 or 1 prior chemotherapy regimens for nonsmall cell lung cancer (adjuvant chemotherapy post resection, or concurrent chemoradiation therapy counts as one regimen regardless of number of agents used.) Planning to start chemotherapy for nonsmall cell lung cancer (treatment regimen at discretion of treating physician but must include one or more of the following agents:cisplatin,carboplatin,docetaxel,paclitaxel, pemetrexed,gemcitabine,vinorelbine) Patients may receive antiangiogenesis agents (bevacizumab) in addition to chemotherapy, but patients treated solely with tyrosine kinase inhibitors or growthfactor receptor blockers are not eligible. Prior radiation therapy is permitted. Performance status 0,1,2 Serum creatinine less than 2.0 or estimated creatinine clearance over 30cc/min by Calcroft/Gault equation Estimated life expectancy over 3 months Signed informed consent Age greater than 18 years Patients who have clinical indication for Zometa treatment such as lytic bone metastases or hypercalcemia can be included Pregnant or lactating Patient with concurrent medical or psychiatric illness which would, in the opinion of the investigator, prevent compliance with the study Patients who undergo any procedure other than thoracentesis for drainage of effusion.Patients may have had more than one thoracentesis prior to study. Patients who have large bore chest tube placement, permanent transthoracic catheter (Pleurex), medical pleurodesis or thoracoscopy are excluded. Current active dental problems including infection of the teeth or jawbone (maxilla or mandibular);dental or fixture trauma, or a current or prior diagnosis of osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ), of exposed bone in the mouth, or of slow healing after dental procedures. Recent (within 6 weeks)or planned dental or jaw surgery (e.g.extraction, implants).</criteria>
