	<brief_title>A Safety, Tolerability, And Pharmacokinetic Trial With CVX-241 In Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study was prematurely discontinued on 14 September 2011 due to no significant pharmacological effects (safety/PD/efficacy) through 25 mg/kg cohort, the T1/2 based on VEGF binding was shorter than expected and the current and/or higher doses were not considered feasible for further development. There were no safety concerns associated with the decision to terminate the program/study.</detailed_description>
