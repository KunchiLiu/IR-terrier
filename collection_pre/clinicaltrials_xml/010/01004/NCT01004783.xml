	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Studying samples of tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer. PURPOSE: This clinical trial studies biomarkers in tumor tissue samples from young patients with very low risk Wilms tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Biomarkers in Tumor Tissue Samples From Young Patients With Very Low Risk Wilms Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - To validate the utility of CUGBP2, HMGA2, and MEIS2 mRNA expression and 11p15 methylation to define a population of pediatric patients with very low risk Wilms tumor (VLRWT) that have virtually no risk of relapse. - To validate the utility of WT-1 mutation and 11p15 loss of heterozygosity analysis to determine a population of VLRWT that have a higher risk of relapse when not treated with chemotherapy. - To validate the utility of NFYA, STRA6, TOB2, PDCD4, and SP3 mRNA expression to predict relapse in VLRWT. - To investigate the feasibility of broadening the definition of VLRWT through analysis of stage I and II epithelial differentiated tumors registered on clinical trial COG-Q9401 (NWTS-5) for CUGBP2, HMGA2, MEIS2, and 11p15 methylation. OUTLINE: Previously banked tumor tissue samples are analyzed for mRNA expression of CUGBP2, HMGA2, and MEIS2 via reverse-transcriptase (RT)-PCR and are classified as loss of heterozygosity (LOH), loss of imprinting, or neither via 11p15 analysis. Samples are also analyzed for WT-1 mutation via quantitative PCR and 11p LOH using 11p15 methylation analysis and expression of NFYA, STRA6, TOB2, PDCD4, and SP3 via quantitative RT-PCR</detailed_description>
