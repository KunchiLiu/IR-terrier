	<brief_summary>The aim of this work was to test the Echelon foot efficiency to offer enhanced safety, comfort and function over a wide range of walking surfaces, inclines and stairs, thereby improving the quality of life for amputees. Ten individuals with a unilateral trans- tibial amputation will participate in two test sessions- one while using their own prosthetic foot, the other while using the Echelon foot.</brief_summary>
