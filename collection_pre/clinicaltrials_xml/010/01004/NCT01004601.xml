	<brief_summary>Docetaxel and pemetrexed have been validated for previously treated advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC); however, tolerability is a concern with the docetaxel (tri-weekly 75 mg/m2 schedule). The investigators conducted this study to compare the efficacy and toxicity of weekly low-dose docetaxel versus tri-weekly pemetrexed for previously treated advanced NSCLC.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Low Dose Weekly Docetaxel Versus Pemetrexed in Previously Treated Advanced Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We have been following a schedule of weekly low dose docetaxel (30 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8 every 3 weeks; 60 mg/m2 accumulated dose for each cycle) at our hospital in an effort to achieve better tolerability. We therefore performed an exploratory study, by statistical analyses, to investigate the efficacy and toxicity of such a low dose docetaxel schedule compared to that of pemetrexed in patients with NSCLC who have failed previous chemotherapy.</detailed_description>
