	<brief_summary>Clomiphene citrate (CC) is the first-line therapy for infertile women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Unfortunately, at least 20% of PCOS results are not responsive to CC. Structured exercise training (SET) and diet has been successfully employed to restore ovarian function and to improve reproductive outcomes in obese and overweight women with PCOS. The current study was aimed to test the hypothesis that a short-term SET program plus diet intervention can improve the ovarian response to CC in CC-resistant PCOS patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Short-term Structured Exercise Training Program Plus Diet Intervention in Patients With Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ninety-six PCOS patients considered CC-resistant because not responsive to 150 mg daily of CC were randomized in three arms (group A, B, and C). Group A underwent SET program plus hypocaloric diet for two months, group B had one month of observation followed by one-cycle of CC therapy, and group C underwent SET program plus hypocaloric diet for two months and received one-cycle of CC for one cycle. CC was always given at the maximal dose previously used. Clinical, hormonal and metabolic data were assessed at baseline and after intervention. Ovulation was monitored by ultrasound and confirmed by plasma progesterone assay.</detailed_description>
