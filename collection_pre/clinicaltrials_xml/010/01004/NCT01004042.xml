The secondary objective of this study are: - to elaborate a description of the muscles involved in the Veraguth Fold - to evaluate depressive symptoms using Beck Depression Inventory before and after Botox速 injections. - to elucidate that depression is not a contraindication for botulinum toxin injections.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of Quality of Life and Self-steem After Botox速 in Depressed and Non-depressed Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study consists of two groups: one with diagnosis of depression (diagnostic criteria from DSM-IV-TR and MINI International Neuropsychiatric Interview - Brazilian version 5.0) and other without diagnosis of depression. Subjects with depression will be part of group 1. They must be using a therapeutic dose of antidepressant for at least 2 months before the intervention prescribed by a psychiatrist. Subjects with no diagnosis of depression will be part of group 2. Subjects included in the study will receive injections of 20 U (as minimal dose) to 40 U (as maximum dose) of BTX-A (BOTOX速/Allergan, USA) diluted in 0.9% saline, according to standard injections of 4U in 5 points of glabellar area as the treatment. Four visits will be scheduled. Visit 0 (baseline), Visit 1 (intervention), visit 2 (4 weeks), visit 3 (8 weeks) visit 4 (12 weeks). The scales for the assessment of depressive symptoms, Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), will be applied at visits 1,2,3,4; WHOQOL BREF will be applied at baseline visit and 4. Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale will be applied in all visits. Photographs will be taken as well as the dermatological evaluation of the wrinkles and folds will be assessed using a 4-points validated Severity Wrinkles Scale, and psychiatric evaluation as well, in both groups.</detailed_description>
