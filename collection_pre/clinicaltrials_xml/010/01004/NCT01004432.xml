	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of switching rheumatoid arthritis (RA) participants who have an inadequate response to their current treatment with either etanercept + methotrexate or adalimumab + methotrexate to treatment with golimumab 50 milligram (mg) subcutaneous (SC) injection (a needle inserted under the skin in the back of upper arm, upper thigh or stomach area) every 4 weeks + methotrexate. This study is also designed to evaluate the benefit and safety of switching participants from treatment with golimumab 50 mg subcutaneous injection every 4 weeks + methotrexate to golimumab 2 milligram per kilogram (mg/kg) intravenous every 8 weeks + methotrexate, for those who do not achieve a marked improvement of their RA at Week 16.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Golimumab in Rheumatoid Arthritis Participants With an Inadequate Response to Etanercept (ENBREL) or Adalimumab (HUMIRA)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study consists of a main study and a voluntary, open-label (participants and researchers are aware about the treatment participants are receiving), 24-week study extension. The main study includes a Screening Run-in Period (Week -6 to Week 0), an Open-label Treatment Period (Week 0 to Week 16), an Open-label or Double-blind Treatment Period (Week 16 to Week 52). The main study also includes a Follow-up Period from Week 52 through Week 64 for those participants who will not participate in the 24-week study extension. Participants, participating in 24-week extension (at Week 52), will receive open-label golimumab SC injections every 4 weeks from Week 52 up to Week 72 and will be followed-up up to Week 88. All eligible participants will initiate the treatment with open-label golimumab SC injection every 4 weeks up to Week 12. At Week 16, depending upon the treatment response either participants will continue to receive open-label golimumab SC injection every 4 weeks up to Week 48 or participants will be randomly assigned to receive following 2 treatments: 1- golimumab 50mg SC injection every 4 weeks along with placebo intravenous infusion every 8 weeks through Week 48; 2- Placebo SC injection every 4 weeks along with golimumab 2mg/kg intravenous infusion every 8 weeks through Week 48. At Week 52, participants who choose to participate in the 24-week study extension will receive open-label golimumab 50 mg SC injections every 4 weeks through Week 72. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.</detailed_description>
