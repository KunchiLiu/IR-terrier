	<brief_summary>The POST-conditioning during coronary angioplasty in Acute Myocardial Infarction (POST-AMI) trial will evaluate the usefulness of postconditioning in limiting infarct size and microvascular damage during the early and late phases after AMI.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>POSTconditioning During Coronary Angioplasty in Acute Myocardial Infarction Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>POST-AMI is a single-center, prospective, randomized trial, with a planned inclusion of 78 patients with ST-elevation Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI). Patients will be randomly assigned to postconditioning arm (primary angioplasty (PA) and stenting followed by brief episodes of ischemia-reperfusion performed during the first minutes of reperfusion) or non-postconditioning arm (PA and stenting without additional intervention). All patients will be treated medically according to current international guidelines, including glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors before PCI. The primary end point is to evaluate whether postconditioning, compared to PA without additional intervention, reduces infarct size estimated by magnetic resonance at 30±10 days after the AMI. Secondary end points are microvascular obstruction observed at magnetic resonance, ST-segment elevation resolution, persistent ST-segment elevation, angiographic myocardial blush grade &lt;2 and non sustained/sustained ventricular tachycardia in the 48 hours following PA. Further secondary end points are enzymatic infarct size, left ventricular remodeling and left ventricular function at magnetic resonance performed at 6±1 months, and the reduction of major adverse cardiac events at 30 days and 6 months.</detailed_description>
