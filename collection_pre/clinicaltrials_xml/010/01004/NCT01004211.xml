	<brief_summary>To date, fluorescence and narrow band imaging cystoscopy have been tested in many prospective within patient trials but only as an "add on" procedure. This results in a bias that does not allow to determine the real impact of such innovative technologies on bladder cancer management. Hereby we propose the first prospective randomized trial which compares narrow band imaging trans urethral resection as a stand alone procedure versus white light transurethral resection. The primary end point is to assess the recurrence rate of bladder cancer lesions with each treatment modality. The study is designed to disclose an inferior recurrence rate (estimated 10%) in the group treated by narrow band imaging transurethral resection respect to the control group, treated by standard transurethral resection.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>All patients must be older than 18 years of age and female patients who are pregnant, breast feeding or not on adequate contraceptive measures will be excluded. All patients will provide a written informed consent prior to the study. Consecutive patients from 2 centers in Liguria (National Institute for Cancer Research Genova and Centro Urologico di Eccellenza ASL 1 Imperia) with overt or suspected non muscle invasive bladder cancer, including Cis detected by mean of random biopsies or a positive urinary cytology, will be included in the study and randomized to 2 treatments A, B arms. Patients with muscle invasive bladder cancer will be excluded. Patients submitted to immediate radical cystectomy after transurethral resection, irrespective of the clinical stage, will be excluded.</criteria>
