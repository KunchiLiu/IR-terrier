	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to obtain blood or saliva samples to define genes for migraine and pain diseases.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Migraine and Pain Study GeneBank at Scripps Clinic Registry (MAPS)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It is estimated that over one-third of the world's population suffers from persistent or recurrent pain. Migraine is highly heritable and the majority of juveniles who suffer from the disorder have a mother or father who also have the disease. The blood or saliva samples will go through DNA analysis and be sequenced for candidate genes or subjected to whole-genome sequencing. By creating a MAPS GeneBank from these patients' blood/saliva donations we will ultimately be able to define genes for migraine and pain diseases.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Family members (genetic duo or trio), consisting of an adolescent 10 to 18 years of age and at least one of their biologic parents willing to be participate in trial 2. Adolescent and at least 1 biologic parent with Migraine diagnosis confirmed by Dr. Christy Jackson 3. Is reliable, cooperative and willing to comply with all protocolspecified procedures and/or substudy if consented 4. Able to understand and grant informed consent 1. Patient has been previously enrolled in the MAP GeneBank at Scripps Clinic Registry 2. Has a significant chronic medical condition (i.e.chronic meningitis or a secondary origin/cause of headache) which, in the investigator's option, may interfere with the patient's optimal participation in the study 3. Treatment with any investigational agents or devices within 30 days preceding enrollment in the study 4. Has undergone ECT within 90 days preceding enrollment in the study</criteria>
