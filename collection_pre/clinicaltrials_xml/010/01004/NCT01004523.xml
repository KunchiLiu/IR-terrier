	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Studying samples of tumor tissue and blood from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer. It may also help doctors predict how patients will respond to treatment. PURPOSE: This research study is looking at tissue and blood samples from patients with low-grade glioma.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic relevance of alterations of specific chromosomes and chromosomal regions including 7, 9p, 10p, 10q, 13q, 17p, 17q, 19q, 22q, X, and Y, using PCR analysis of microsatellite repeats and FISH. - Evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic relevance of DNA ploidy by flow cytometric analysis; compare with ploidy determination by FISH. - Assess the diagnostic and prognostic relevance of various markers of cellular proliferation and cellular function including flow cytometric determination of %S-phase, %G2M, and immunohistochemical evaluation of PCNA, Ki-67, and p53.</detailed_description>
