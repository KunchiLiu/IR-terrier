	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to determine how well the combination of bevacizumab and carboplatin works in treating breast cancer that has spread to the brain. Bevacizumab is an antibody (a protein that attacks a foreign substance in the body) that is made in the laboratory. Bevacizumab works differently from the way chemotherapy drugs work. Usually chemotherapy drugs attack fast growing cancer cells in the body. Bevacizumab works to slow or stop the growth of cells in cancer tumors by decreasing the blood supply to the tumors. When the blood supply is decreased, the tumors don't get the oxygen and nutrients they need to grow. Carboplatin is in a class of drugs known as platinum-containing compounds and has been approved for use in the treatment of ovarian cancer. Information from other research studies suggests that the combination of bevacizumab with carboplatin may be effective in treating breast cancer.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- Participants will receive bevacizumab and carboplatin intravenously. In addition to bevacizumab and carboplatin, participants whose cancer is positive for HER2 will receive Herceptin intravenously. Herceptin is a standard treatment for patients with HER2-positive breast cancer. - The first treatment cycle lasts four weeks. Participants will receive bevacizumab on Day 1 and carboplatin on Day 8. After the first treatment cycle, each treatment cycle thereafter lasts three weeks and participants will receive bevacizumab and carboplatin together on Day 1 of each cycle. - Physical exams and vital signs will be performed and collected at multiple time points during the participants first treatment cycle and at the beginning of each cycle thereafter. - Participants will have a brain MRI and MRA between days 2-4 of the first treatment cycle and again at the end of the second treatment cycle for research purposes only. These scans are mandatory and must be performed at the Massachusetts General Hospital-Charlestown Navy Yard facility. A brain MRI will be performed every other cycle after that (the end of cycles 2, 4, 6, 8, etc.). Participants will also have CT or MRI scans of their body at the enof of every other treatment cycle. - MUGA or ECHO scans will be done every 4 treatment cycles. - Participants will have blood tests done on Day 8 of the first treatment cycle and at the beginning of every treatment cycle thereafter to check blood cell counts and how well their organs are functioning. - A urine test will be done every other cycle (at the beginning of cycles 3, 5, 7, etc.)</detailed_description>
