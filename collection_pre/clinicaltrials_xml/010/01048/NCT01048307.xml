	<brief_summary>Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of Prontosan® Wound Irrigation Solution in the treatment of hard-to-heal venous leg ulcers compared to wound irrigation with saline solution Methodology: Randomised, controlled multi-centre, prospective clinical trial Planned number of subjects: 20 patients in experimental group (Prontosan® Wound Irrigation Solution) 8 patients in control group (wound irrigation with saline) Products under investigation: Prontosan® Wound Irrigation Solution Study Duration: 3-4 weeks</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Investigational product, dose and administration: Prontosan® Wound Irrigation Solution (experimental group) and saline solution (control group) will be applied at inclusion and reapplied after dressing changes. The treatment scheme is as follows: 1. Prontosan® Wound Irrigation Solution (experimental group): - cleansing the wound bed at dressing change with Prontosan® Wound Irrigation Solution; a sterile gauze dressing impregnated with the Prontosan® solution will be placed on the immediate wound in the form of a moist compress and removed after approximately 15 minutes; - placing the primary dressing (Profore® WCL): the dressing will be impregnated with Prontosan® Wound Irrigation Solution; - fixing the dressing to the wound using multilayered elastic compression bandaging (Profore® bandaging system). 2. Saline (control group): - cleansing the wound bed at dressing change with saline; a sterile gauze dressing impregnated with the saline will be placed on the wound in the form of a moist compress and removed after approx.15 minutes; - placing the primary dressing (Profore® WCL): the dressing will be impregnated with saline; - fixing the dressing to the wound using multilayered elastic compression bandaging (Profore® bandaging system). Dressings will be changed and the treatment procedure will be repeated in the clinic 2x/weekly or more. The efficacy of the treatment procedure will be evaluated on the basis of a 2 week observation period. Treatment efficacy assessment: - Assessment of clinical signs and symptoms at entry to the study and after one and two weeks. - Quantitative and qualitative microbiological analysis at entry to the study and after two weeks. - Wound planimetry using PictZar® CDM at entry to the study and after two weeks. Primary aim: - clinical signs assessed by: 1. reduction of slough and necrotic tissue 2. control of exudate 3. presence of granulation tissue - reduction of inflammatory signs (surrounding skin) - reduction in wound size (assessed by wound planimetry) - reduction of bacterial load (quantitative and qualitative microbiological Secondary aim: - tolerance and safety assessment: 1. adverse drug reaction 2. adverse events 3. early withdrawal from the study</detailed_description>
