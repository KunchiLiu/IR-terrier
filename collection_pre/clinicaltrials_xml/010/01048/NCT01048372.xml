	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: To determine the mechanism of Cytolin's effect on HIV replication from blood drawn from HIV-positive and HIV-negative individuals after exposure to Cytolin.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Observational Study of Blood Treated With Cytolin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The initial phase of this in vitro study regarding the potential mechanisms of action of Cytolin was completed in January 2011. Given the data set to date, a decision has been made to extend the study.
