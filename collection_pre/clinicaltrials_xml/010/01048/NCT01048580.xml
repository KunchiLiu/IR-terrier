	<brief_title>Study of Perifosine + Capecitabine for Colon Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a Phase I trial. A total of 3 ‐ 9 patients will be enrolled. Three patients will initially be enrolled. There will be no dose escalation in this study as only one dose for perifosine (50 mg) in combination with one dose of capecitabine (1000 mg/m2 BID) will be evaluated. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is defined in which fewer than 33% of patients experienced DLT attributable to the study drug(s), when at least six patients have been treated at that dose and are evaluable for toxicity. Pharmacokinetic (PK) data will also be evaluated from all enrolled patients.</detailed_description>
