	<brief_summary>The main research objective is to work out the optimal doses of the novel combination of gemcitabine, oxaliplatin and imatinib mesylate (glivec) in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer that has progressed during or after treatment with first-line gemcitabine.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gemcitabine and Oxaliplatin (Gem-Ox) Plus Glivec in Gemcitabine-refractory Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Using the phase I study design, the dose of gemcitabine will be escalated in several steps to identify the highest tolerable dose that can be given safely. Based on pre-defined dose-limiting toxicity, the maximum tolerated dose of the combination will be identified and a safer dose for further evaluation of this regimen in pancreatic cancer selected. The primary objectives are therefore based around safety of the drug combination.</detailed_description>
