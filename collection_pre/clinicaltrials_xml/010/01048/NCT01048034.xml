	<brief_summary>Azacitidine has proved prolonged overall survival in patients with high-risk MDS. Minor pilot studies have shown that treatment with Azacitidine can induce transfusion independency in previous transfusion dependent patients with low-risk MDS. This study will evaluate the effect of Azacitidine in transfusion dependent patients with low-risk MDS (IPSS low or int-1) or low risk CMML. Included patients should first have failed, or considered not being eligible to, treatment with EPO +/- G-CSF. Our hypothesis is that Azacitidine can lead to transfusion independency in this group of patients. Those patients who do not respond to treatment with Azacitidine alone, will be given treatment with the combination of Azacitidine and EPO where our hypothesis is that Azacitidine can restore sensitivity to EPO.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Must be 18 years of age at the time of signing the informed consent form MDS at IPSS Low or Int1, or mixed MDS/MPD; either CMML with &lt; 10% marrow blasts or RARST Patients with high or intermediate probability for response according to the predictive model (see HellstromLindberg et al, Br J Haematol 99:34451 1997)should be refractory to EPO / darbepoetin (equivalent to &gt; 60 000 U of EPO / week for &gt; 8 weeks) followed by EPO + GCSF for &gt; 8 weeks, or biosimilar drugs in equipotent doses, or EPO + GCSF upfront for 8 weeks. Patients with low probability for response according to the predictive model, could be included without prior EPO/GCSF treatment Transfusion need &gt;4 units over the last 8 weeks, or &gt;8 units over the last 26 weeks. Subject has signed the informed consent document. Men and women of childbearing potential must use effective contraception during, and for up to 3 months after treatment. Pregnant or lactating females. Patients who are eligible for curative treatment Expected survival less than 24 weeks. Symptomatic thrombocytopenia / active bleeding Patients with JAK2 positive RARST if eligible for new investigational drugs Serum biochemical values as follows 1. Serum creatinine &gt;2.0 mg/dL (177 micromol/L) 2. Serum aminotransferase (AST)/serum glutamicoxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) or alanine transaminase (ALT)/serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT) &gt;3.0 x upper limit of normal (ULN) 3.
