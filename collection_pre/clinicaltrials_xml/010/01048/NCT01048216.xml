	<brief_summary>This study is designed to treat tumors in the liver that cannot be removed surgically and chemotherapy cannot control these tumors, using radiation therapy and a more precise delivery than has been used before.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Partial Liver Radiotherapy for Unresectable Liver Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to evaluate safety and feasibility of conformal radiation therapy in patients with metastatic colorectal liver cancer. This study would also evaluate local control rate within irradiated area and to assess failure patterns and survival of patients treated with conformal liver radiation.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>liver metastases unequivocally seen on contrast enhanced CT and/or MRI from colon or rectal cancer, previously confirmed pathologically as adenocarcinoma either 1) the tumor must be unresectable, 2) the patient must be medically inoperable, or 3) extrahepatic metastases are present (making hepatic surgery an inappropriate treatment option) good performance status (01) Age &gt; 18 years. Adult patients of all ages, both sexes and all races will be included in this study. Female patients within reproductive years may not be, nor become, pregnant during participation in this study life expectancy &gt; 3 months patients with active hepatitis or clinically significant liver failure patients receiving anticoagulation treatment with warfarin or heparin prior radiation therapy to the right upper abdomen, precluding reirradiation of the liver clinically apparent ascites central nervous system metastases</criteria>
