	<brief_title>Glucose-dependent Insulinotropic Polypeptide - New Role as Blood Glucose Stabilizer?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of the study is to investigate the effect of GIP on the glucagon secretion during hyper-, eu- and hypoglycemia in healthy volunteers, patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. From this, we will evaluate GIP's role as blood sugar stabilizer.</detailed_description>
