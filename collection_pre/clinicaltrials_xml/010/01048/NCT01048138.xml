	<brief_summary>There is no AED or medication that has been demonstrated to affect the development of post-traumatic epilepsy. Biperiden is a cholinergic antagonist, acting in the muscarinic receptor, that is widely used as an anti Parkinson drug. The investigators data with animal models of epilepsy indicate that anti-muscarinic agents might affect the natural course of the disease in the case of post-traumatic epilepsy.</brief_summary>
