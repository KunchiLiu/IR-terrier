	<detailed_description>Multidisciplinary Approach to Reduce Injury and Substance Abuse is a randomized clinical trial evaluating the effectiveness of brief advice (BA), brief motivational intervention with feedback (BMI), and brief motivational intervention with feedback and booster (BMI+B) in injured patients with drug problems. The setting is a level 1 Trauma Department, which serves a large and diverse patient population. Injured patients are screened for eligibility in the project based on a positive toxicology screen or self reported drug use in the past 90 days. The primary outcome of interest will be patients' subsequent drug use. Other outcomes of interest include: HIV-related risk behaviors, improved health outcomes (including injury reduction), increased employment, decreased engagement in illegal behavior, increased substance abuse treatment utilization, and enhanced quality of life at three, six, and twelve month follow-ups. This study will also examine the potential moderating and mediating effects of patient readiness to change, use of experiential and behavioral processes of change and decisional balance considerations. In addition, this project will examine implementation factors at the organizational level and the cost effectiveness of BA, BMI, and BMI+B. Study participants and their related identifying information will be collected during the time they are admitted to the recruitment hospital trauma department. Study participants must be 18 years or older, speak English or Spanish, have been admitted to the recruitment hospital trauma department, and test positive for illegal drugs or admit to illegal drug use when verbally screened. Additional information will be collected from participants in the in-person assessment interviews at three, six, and 12 month follow-up periods.</detailed_description>
