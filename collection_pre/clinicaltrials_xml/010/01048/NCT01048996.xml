	<brief_summary>Acute Lung Injury (ALI) and the more severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) are a significant problem in Pediatric Intensive Care Units, affecting up to 16 of every 1000 children admitted to these units. These disorders carry with them high mortality rates as well as numerous long-term effects for the surviving children. As the effects of these diseases have significant social and economic ramifications for affected children and their families, research on the development of ALI/ARDS could significantly change how physicians understand the disease and treat patients. There are a wide range of problems which make certain PICU patients more likely to develop either ALI or ARDS. This research aims to determine which of these children are at the greatest risk for ALI/ARDS by examining differences in plasma biomarkers and in DNA of a large number of PICU patients. We are hypothesizing that significant differences in the level of specific plasma biomarkers or in the frequency of specific DNA variants exist in children who develop ALI/ARDS.</brief_summary>
