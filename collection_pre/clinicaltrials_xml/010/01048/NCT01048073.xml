	<brief_summary>Acute respiratory infection (ARI) constitutes a leading cause of morbidity, hospitalization and mortality worldwide. The most common etiologic agents of ARI's, especially in children, are viruses. The study objective is to determine the viral and bacterial etiologies of ARIs in patients with lower respiratory tract infection in South East Asia. This is a laboratory based surveillance study, in which the archival specimens from hospitalized patients will be tested for respiratory pathogens other than influenza viruses Standard descriptive statistics will be used to present the findings</brief_summary>
