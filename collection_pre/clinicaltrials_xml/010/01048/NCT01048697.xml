	<brief_summary>This study is designed to measure drug concentrations in the blood of healthy volunteers administered a single dose of ethambutol. Our hypothesis is that volunteers with a body mass index (BMI) 25-40 kg/m2 will remove ethambutol more quickly from the blood than leaner volunteers, and those with a BMI &gt; 40 kg/m2 will have even greater clearance than those who are leaner.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Male and female volunteers, age 18 years of age or older, of all racial and ethnic origins. English and/or Spanish speaking volunteers are eligible to participate. We are recruiting 6 normal weight (BMI &lt;25 kg/m2), 6 obese (BMI 2540 kg/m2), and 6 extremely obese (BMI &gt; 40 kg/m2) for this study. Half of each group will be male, the other half will be female. Creatinine clearance &lt; 70 ml/min as estimated by the CockcroftGault equation. Pregnant or nursing or unwilling to use a reliable contraception method during the study period. The effects of ethambutol on pregnancy are unknown. In addition, the metabolic changes that accompany pregnancy may alter the concentrationtime profile of ethambutol, so that the pregnancy and postpartum state would be a confounding variable. Abnormal liver function tests: transaminases &gt;10 time the upper limit of normal, alkaline phosphatase &gt; 5 time the upper limit of normal, total bilirubin &gt;5 time the upper limit of normal. History of allergy to ethambutol. Ethambutol is contraindicated for any reason. Suspected or documented mycobacterial infection. History of gout.</criteria>
