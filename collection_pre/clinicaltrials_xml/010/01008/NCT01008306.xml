	<brief_summary>Renal transplantation of children started in Norway in 1970.Since the beginning, &gt;80% of renal transplants are provided from Living Donors(mainly parents), short pre-transplant dialysis time( median 4 months) and 50% of transplantations are performed before dialysis is needed.This gives good premises for graft survival and avoidance of detrimental effects of dialysis. However, renal transplanted children are subjected to an increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in adulthood due to consequences of chronic renal failure and immunosuppressive treatment.Cardiovascular death comprises 30-40% of death causes. In this cross-sectional study we evaluate cardiovascular risk factors in childhood- and also in young adults renal transplanted in childhood. Focus is cardiorespiratory fitness using treadmill testing,24h BP measurements, anthropometrics including waist circumference,echocardiography,intima media thickness of carotids, glucose intolerance test.Participants are also requested to fill out physical activity recalls and Quality of life questionnaires.</brief_summary>
