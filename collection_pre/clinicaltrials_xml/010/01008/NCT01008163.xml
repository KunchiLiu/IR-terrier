	<brief_title>A Dose-Finding, Efficacy and Safety Study of YY-351 in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ginseng has been widely studied for treatment of diabetes, dyslipidemia and obesity. Interestingly, in addition to ginseng root, ginseng berry and leaf were also shown to reduce blood glucose in diabetic models. In our recent study, ginsam, vinegar extraction from Panax ginseng, which is enriched in the ginsenoside Rg3, has distinct beneficial effects on glucose metabolism and body weight control in an obese animal model of insulin resistance by changing the expression of genes involved in glucose and fatty acid metabolism. Our group has also published that Rg3 improves insulin signaling and glucose uptake primarily by stimulating the expression of IRS-1 and GLUT4. Thus, we have evaluated the efficacy, dose-response relationships and safety of a ginsam, a vinegar extract from Panax ginseng.</detailed_description>
