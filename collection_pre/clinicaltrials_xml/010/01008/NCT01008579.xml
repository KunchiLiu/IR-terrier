	<brief_summary>Patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) are assessments of health status or health-related quality of life. The EuroQol-5D (EQ5D) is an example of a generic instrument to assess health-related quality of life. The investigators will use the EQ5D in the Falls Prevention Clinic as part of routine clinical assessment at baseline, 6 months and 12 months to track patient care in a cohort of 300 older adults who are at high-risk of falls.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessing Patient Care Through Routine Use of Patient-Reported Outcomes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1. Purpose: We will use the EQ5D in the Falls Prevention Clinic as part of routine clinical assessment at baseline, 6-months and 12-months to track patient care in a cohort of 300 older adults who are at high-risk of falls. 2. Objectives: O1: Our primary objective is to use a routinely administered patient reported outcomes measure, the EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D), in older adults at high risk of falls to determine patients self-reported health status over a 12-month followup period. O2: Our secondary objective is to develop an explanatory model and a predictive model of covariates that explain significant gains or losses in health related quality of life.</detailed_description>
