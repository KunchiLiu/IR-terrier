Presence of a temperature &gt;= 38.0ºC (&gt;=100.4ºF) by any route or method, or acute symptoms greater than "mild" severity on the scheduled date of first vaccination. NOTE: The subject may be vaccinated at a later date, provided symptoms have resolved, vaccination occurs within the window specified by the protocol, and all other eligibility criteria continue to be satisfied.

Women who are diseasefree 3 years or more after treatment for breast cancer and receiving longterm prophylactic tamoxifen are excepted and may enrol. Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition based on medical history and physical examination (no laboratory testing required). Chronic administration (defined as more than 14 days in total) of immunosuppressants or other immune modifying drugs within 6 months of study enrolment or planned administration during the study period. For corticosteroids, this will mean a dose equivalent to 10 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent when administered for &gt; 2 weeks. Topical, intraarticular or inhaled and topical steroids are allowed. Receipt of any immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within 3 months of study enrolment or planned administration of any of these products during the study period. Any significant disorder of coagulation or treatment with warfarin derivatives or heparin.

Persons receiving prophylactic antiplatelet medications, e.g., lowdose aspirin, and without a clinicallyapparent bleeding tendency, are eligible. An acute evolving neurological disorder or history of GuillainBarré syndrome within 6 weeks of receipt of seasonal influenza vaccine.

Seasonal influenza vaccine may be administered up to 14 days prior to study vaccination. Planned administration of any vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol from vaccination up to blood sampling at Day 21 including seasonal influenza vaccine or a monovalent pandemic H1N1 vaccine other than the study vaccine. Use of any investigational or nonregistered product (drug or vaccine) other than the study vaccine(s) within 30 days preceding the receipt of study vaccine, or planned use during the study period.
