	<brief_summary>The primary purpose of the trial is to demonstrate that at least a 40% drop of recurrence rate can be achieve in hepatocellular carcinoma patients treated with no touch multipolar radiofrequency ablation technique compared to those treated with usual intranodular multipolar technique.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Multipolar Radiofrequency Ablation for Hepatocellular Carcinoma Using Extra Nodular Versus Intranodular Technique</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>206 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma(s) including up to three nodules measuring up to four cm in diameter, will be randomized in two therapeutic legs: multipolar no touch radiofrequency versus multipolar intra nodular radiofrequency. Patients previously treated for hepatocellular carcinoma will not be enrolled in the study. Diagnostic of hepatocellular carcinoma will be based on American Society of Liver Diseases guide line. Early response to the treatment will be assessed one month after the radiofrequency ablation procedures (up to three in case of incomplete necrosis) with dynamic contrast medium enhanced CT or MRI liver examinations. For the follow up dynamic contrast medium enhanced CT or MRI liver examinations will be performed every three months. The trial will last for 73 months including 45 months for the recruitment of patients. The main criteria of judgement will be the 2-years recurrence rate.</detailed_description>
