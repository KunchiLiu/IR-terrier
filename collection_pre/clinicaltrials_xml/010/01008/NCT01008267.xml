	<brief_summary>SWL is widely used in the treatment of patients with renal and ureteral calculi. Several factors determine the success of extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (SWL) for kidney stones: stone size, stone location within the collecting system, stone type, and the SWL machine used. Moreover, in some cases it is very difficult to focus on the stone because of its movement as a results of breathing. In order to prevent stone movement we want to use a bronchial blocker, processing a selective ventilation of the opposite side of stone location.</brief_summary>
