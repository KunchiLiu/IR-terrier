	<brief_summary>The goal of this cross-sectional study is to gain an understanding of the knowledge and attitudes regarding end of life issues and hospice care among a sample of residents of South Florida recruited through time and space sampling. This study is being conducted by OMS3 COM research fellow Heather Ruff as part of the research fellowship requirements. Participants will complete a paper and pencil questionnaire that measures 4 domains of interest (advanced care planning; end of life care; hospice care and death and dying) as well as demographic factors (age, marital status, education etc.). It is estimated that the survey will take 15 minutes to complete. Data will be collected anonymously, with no personal identifying information. The instructions on the questionnaire state that by completing the questionnaire, the participant is providing consent to participate in the study. We will use time and space sampling methods to recruit up to 250 participants at community venues (i.e., beaches, street corners, parks, pedestrian malls, and other public venues were people congregate) in South Florida. At each venue, we will define a specific area; persons who enter the defined area will be approached, screened for eligibility (18 years of age or older and a resident of South Florida), and if eligible, invited to participate by trained research staff. Sampling intervals will be determined by traffic flow at each venue. If a person agrees to participate they will be given a paper and pencil copy of the survey to complete on the spot. Participants will be given $1.00 as a token of appreciation. Data entry and data analyses will be done using SPSS.</brief_summary>
