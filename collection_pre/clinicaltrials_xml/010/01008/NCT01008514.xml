	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Internal radiation therapy uses radioactive material placed directly into or near a tumor to kill tumor cells. It may also cause less damage to normal tissue. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well partial-breast radiation therapy works in treating women with early-stage breast cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Partial-Breast Radiation Therapy in Treating Women With Early-Stage Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To examine the efficacy of MammoSite® Radiation Therapy System (RTS) in delivering partial-breast irradiation to women with early-stage breast cancer. Secondary - To assess the toxicities associated with MammoSite® RTS in these patients. - To evaluate the cosmetic results in the breast after brachytherapy with the MammoSite® RTS. - To correlate the cosmetic results with the use of chemotherapy, volume of the implant, and distance from the implant to the skin. - To correlate the local recurrence rate with time between surgery and implant. OUTLINE: Patients undergo placement of the MammoSite® Radiation Therapy System (RTS) device into the cavity where the tumor was removed either at the time of surgery or percutaneously under ultrasound guidance after surgery. Within 2-5 days after the device implant, patients undergo partial-breast irradiation delivered by MammoSite® RTS twice daily for 5 days. After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up periodically for 5 years.</detailed_description>
