	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate efficacy and safety of fentanyl in opioid-naive participants with osteoarthritis (disorder, which is seen mostly in older persons, in which the joints become painful and stuff) or low back pain who cannot obtain a sufficient analgesic effect by the treatment of non-opioid analgesics (drug used to control pain).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Confirmatory Study of Fentanyl in Participants With Osteoarthritis or Low Back Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multi-center (conducted in more than one center), double-blind (neither the participant nor the physician knows the assigned study drug), randomized (participants assigned study drug by chance), withdrawal study in opioid-naive participants with osteoarthritis or low back pain. The study will consist of titration period (10-29 days) and double-blind period (12 weeks) and the visits will include Day 5-7, 8, 15, 29 in titration period and Day 2-4, 8, 15, 22, 29, 43, 57, 71 and 85 in double-blind period. All the eligible participants will receive one-day adhesive transdermal patch (patch containing a drug that is put on the skin so the drug will enter the body through the skin) of either fentanyl at the dose ranging from 12.5 to 50 microgram per hour (mcg/hr) or matching placebo. Efficacy will be evaluated primarily by time to withdrawal due to insufficient analgesic efficacy. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants whose pain because of osteoarthritis or low back pain is continuing for at least 12 weeks prior to informed consent Participants who are continuously taking a nonopioid analgesic at the normal highest dose or more for at least 14 consecutive days prior to informed consent, or participant at a certain dose (except the use on an asneeded base) on consecutive days Participants showing insufficient therapeutic efficacy of the nonopioid analgesic currently being used, and requiring a continuous opioid analgesic as per the investigator or subinvestigator Participants with an average pain intensity of 50 millimeter or more on the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) in 24hour daily living prior to informed consent Participants who can be hospitalized to the 4th day after the initiation of titration period In cases of low back pain, participants with severe pain of lower extremities due to radiculopathy (a problem in which one or more nerves are affected) than that of low back pain, or participants with disc herniation (a medical condition affecting the spine due to trauma, lifting injuries, or idiopathic [unknown] causes) requiring an operation In cases of low back pain, participants with pain due to compression fracture Participants who had an operation that may affect the assessment within 30 days before informed consent Participants whose main cause of the pain to be assessed is considered attributable to psychogenic pain (physical pain that is caused, increased, or prolonged by mental, emotional, or behavioral factors) Participants with asthma, bradyarrhythmia (slow irregular heart beat) and severe respiratory function disorders</criteria>
