	<brief_summary>This research is being done to test the effectiveness of two treatments aimed at increasing language and social skills in children with autism spectrum disorder. If children show improvement in these treatments, we hope that the availability of public services for minority and low income families will be increased. Minority and low income families with children between 22 and 33 months of age with Autism Spectrum Disorders may join.</brief_summary>
