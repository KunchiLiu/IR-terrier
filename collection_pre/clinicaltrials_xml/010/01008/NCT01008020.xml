	<brief_title>Effects of Tea Catechin Consumption on the Prophylaxis of Influenza Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Catechins are the major components of tea flavonoids and are reported to possess physiological activities such as antiviral effects. Recent experimental studies have revealed that tea catechin extracts prevent influenza infection, but few studies have been conducted on the clinical effects of tea catechin consumption on the prophylaxis of influenza infection. Based on these backgrounds, we designed a prospective randomized controlled study to evaluate the effects of 5 months tea catechin consumption on the prophylaxis of influenza infection.</detailed_description>
