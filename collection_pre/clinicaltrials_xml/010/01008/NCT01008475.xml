	<criteria>Subjects with histologically confirmed kras wildtype (WT) colorectal carcinoma (CRC) with documented distant metastasis Prior oxaliplatin/fluoropyrimidinecontaining regimen for the firstline treatment of metastatic disease Failed an oxaliplatin regimen for metastatic colorectal carcinoma (mCRC). Failure is defined as either progressive disease (PD) (clinical or radiologic) within 6 months of the last dose of any agent of an oxaliplatinbased regimen or intolerance to an oxaliplatin regimen. Intolerance to an oxaliplatin regimen is defined as discontinuation due to any of the following: severe allergic reaction, persistent severe neurotoxicity, or delayed recovery from toxicity preventing retreatment At least 1 radiographically documented measurable lesion in a previously non irradiated area according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST, Version 1.0), i.e., this lesion must be adequately measurable in at least 1 dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 2 centimeter (cm) by conventional techniques or &gt;=1 cm by spiral computed tomography (CT) scan Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 or 1, or Karnofsky performance status (KPS) &gt;= 80 percent (%) Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) &gt;=1.5 x 10^9/Liter Platelets &gt;=100 x 10^9/Liter Hemoglobin &gt;=9 gram per deciliter (g/dL) (without transfusions) Bilirubin less than or equal to (&lt;=) 1.5 x upper limit normal (ULN) Aspartate transaminase (AST) &lt;=5 x ULN and alanine transaminase (ALT) &lt;=5 x ULN Serum creatinine &lt;=1.25 x ULN and/or creatinine clearance &gt;=50 milliliter per minute (mL/min) International Nationalized Ratio (INR), and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) within normal limits Sodium and potassium within normal limits or &lt;=10% above or below (supplementation permitted) Previous treatment with any inhibitor of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) Known brain metastasis and/or leptomeningeal disease Radiotherapy (except localized radiotherapy for pain relief), major surgery, or any investigational drug in the 30 days before the start of trial treatment entry; planned major surgery during the trial Concurrent chronic systemic immune or hormone therapy not indicated in this trial protocol (except for physiologic replacement; steroids up to 10 mg of prednisone equivalent or topical and inhaled steroids are allowed) Clinically relevant coronary artery disease (New York Heart Association [NYHA] functional angina classification III/IV), congestive heart failure (NYHA III/IV), clinically relevant cardiomyopathy, history of myocardial infarction in the last 12 months, or high risk of uncontrolled arrhythmia Uncontrolled hypertension defined as systolic blood pressure &gt;=160 millimeter of mercury (mmHg) and/or diastolic blood pressure &gt;=100 mmHg under resting conditions History of coagulation disorder associated with bleeding or recurrent thrombotic events History of recent peptic ulcer disease (endoscopically proven gastric, duodenal or esophageal ulcer) within 6 months of trial treatment start Chronic inflammatory bowel disease, or acute/chronic ileus Active infection (requiring i.v. antibiotics), including active tuberculosis, active or chronic Hepatitis B or C, or ongoing HIV infection</criteria>
