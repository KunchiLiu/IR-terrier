	<brief_summary>CP-675,206 (tremelimumab) is a fully humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to activated T lymphocytes and by enhancing their activation may produce a stimulation of the immune response against tumoral or viral antigens. In this clinical trial, the ability of tremelimumab to produce tumor responses among hepatitis C virus-infected patients with hepatocellular carcinoma not amenable to other therapies will be explored. Besides, the effect on the replication of the virus will be analysed.</brief_summary>
