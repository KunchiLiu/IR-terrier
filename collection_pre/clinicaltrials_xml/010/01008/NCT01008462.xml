	<brief_summary>This phase II trial studies autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplant followed by donor bone marrow transplant in treating patients with high-risk Hodgkin lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, multiple myeloma, or chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Autologous stem cell transplantation uses the patient's stem cells and does not cause graft versus host disease (GVHD) and has a very low risk of death, while minimizing the number of cancer cells. Peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) transplant uses stem cells from the patient or a donor and may be able to replace immune cells that were destroyed by chemotherapy. These donated stem cells may help destroy cancer cells. Bone marrow transplant known as a nonmyeloablative transplant uses stem cells from a haploidentical family donor. Autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplant followed by donor bone marrow transplant may work better in treating patients with high-risk Hodgkin lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, multiple myeloma, or chronic lymphocytic leukemia.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Event-free survival (EFS) at 1-year after autograft. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Relapse rates at 1-year after autograft. II. Overall survival (OS) at 1-year after autograft. III. Incidence of grades II-IV acute GVHD and chronic extensive GVHD. IV. Non-relapse mortality (NRM) at 200 days and 1 year after allograft. V. Donor engraftment at day +84. VI. Incidence of infections. OUTLINE: CONDITIONING REGIMEN 1 (lymphoma, Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia, or chronic lymphocytic leukemia [CLL] with no dose limiting radiation or significant comorbidities: Patients receive cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) on days -6 and -5. Patients undergo high-dose total body irradiation (TBI) twice daily (BID) on days -3 to -1. CONDITIONING REGIMEN 2 (lymphoma, Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia, CLL, with prior dose-limiting radiation, or significant comorbidities): Patients receive carmustine IV on day -7, etoposide IV BID on days -6 to -3, cytarabine IV BID on days -6 to -3, and melphalan IV on day -2. CONDITIONING REGIMEN 3 (multiple myeloma or plasma cell leukemia, with no significant renal insufficiency or other significant comorbidities): Patients receive high-dose melphalan IV on day -2. CONDITIONING REGIMEN 4 (multiple myeloma or plasma cell leukemia, with significant renal insufficiency or other significant comorbidities): Patients receive lessened dose of melphalan IV on day -2. PBSC TRANSPLANTATION: All patients undergo autologous PBSC transplantation on day 0. WAITING INTERVAL: Between 40 and 120 days. NONMYELOABLATIVE CONDITIONING REGIMEN: Patients receive fludarabine phosphate IV once daily (QD) on days -6 to -2 and cyclophosphamide IV QD on days -6 to -5 and day 3. Patients infused with donor's peripheral blood stem cells will additionally receive cyclophosphamide IV on day 4. Patients undergo low-dose TBI on day -1. ALLOGENEIC BONE MARROW TRANSPLANTATION: Patients undergo donor bone marrow transplantation on day 0. GRAFT VERSUS HOST DISEASE PROPHYLAXIS: Beginning on day 4, patients receive tacrolimus orally (PO) or IV and taper beginning on day 86 if no graft-versus-host disease. Patients also receive mycophenolate mofetil PO thrice daily (TID) on days 4 - 35. PERIPHERAL BLOOD COUNT SUPPORT: Patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) IV or subcutaneously (SC) beginning from day 4 and continue till blood counts recover. ALLOGENEIC PERIPHERAL BLOOD MONONUCLEAR CELLS (PBMC) TRANSPLANTATION: Patients undergo donor PBMC transplantation on day 0. GRAFT VERSUS HOST DISEASE PROPHYLAXIS: Beginning on day 5, patients receive tacrolimus orally (PO) or IV and taper beginning on day 86 if no graft-versus-host disease. Patients also receive mycophenolate mofetil PO thrice daily (TID) on days 5 - 35. PERIPHERAL BLOOD COUNT SUPPORT: Patients receive filgrastim IV or SC beginning from day 5 and continue till blood counts recover. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up annually for 5 years.</detailed_description>
