	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the length of time to achieve ovulation and pregnancy with a traditional protocol administration of clomiphene citrate versus a stair step administration. Our hypothesis is by using a stair-step approach in which a period is not induced between administrations of escalating doses of clomiphene citrate, the time to ovulation and pregnancy may be reduced.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Traditional Clomiphene Citrate Administration vs. Stair-step Approach</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The traditional administration of clomiphene citrate for ovulation induction involves taking clomiphene citrate for 5 days. If ovulation does not occur within 14 days, a progestin pill (such as Provera) is prescribed for 10 days to induce a period (which normally occurs within 1 week of stopping the pill). Then a higher dose of clomiphene citrate will be prescribed. The stair-step administration of clomiphene citrate for ovulation induction also involves taking clomiphene citrate for 5 days. In contrast, if ovulation does not occur within 7-9 days, a progestin pill (such as Provera) would NOT be taken to induce a period. The dose of clomiphene will then be increased. Therefore, this would do away with the 10 days of taking the progestin pill, and also do away with waiting for a period (usually 3 to 7 days) for a total of up to a 20 day difference between clomiphene citrate dosing cycles.</detailed_description>
