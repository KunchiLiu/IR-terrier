	<brief_summary>Management of primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP) remains unclear. Primary therapeutic goals for PSP include removal of air from the pleural space an prevention of recurrences. The absence of generally accepted and methodologically sound recommendations may account for the extensive variation in practice for air evacuation techniques. Air evacuation may be achieved by simple aspiration (exsufflation) or conventional chest tube drainage. Chest tube thoracotomy remains the most popular technique.Aspiration is a more simple technique, that allows possibility of ambulatory management. The purpose of the present study is to compare simple aspiration performed with a specific thoracentesis device, versus conventional chest tube drainage. Comparison will be performed on immediate efficacity of resolution of the pneumothorax.The hypothesis is that simple aspiration performed with a specific device is not inferior to chest tube drainage for management of a first episode of large size primary spontaneous pneumothorax. A second goal is to measure the efficacy at one week, and the recidive at one year. The trial is randomized, controlled and will include 200 patients for each group. The patients will be enrolled in 29 hospitals in France. Emergency department, thoracic surgery and pulmonary departments of each hospital were primarily contacted for agreement to participate to the study.</brief_summary>
