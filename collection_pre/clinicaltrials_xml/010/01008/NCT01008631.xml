	<brief_title>The Pharmacologic Profile of Sodium Thiosulfate in Renal Failure and Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Two single shot applications of i.v. sodium thiosulfate will be given to dialysis patients. One application will be given immediately before a dialysis session and the second dose will be given after the consecutive dialysis session.
