	<brief_title>A Study of the Safety and Effectiveness of Ustekinumab (Stelara) in Chinese Patients With Psoriasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this study, 220 patients will be divided into two groups randomly (by chance), like flipping a coin. Each group will receive a different treatment. The results for each group are compared to each other. There are 2 treatment groups in this study, Group 1 and Group 2. Group 1 will receive placebo at Weeks 0 and 4, ustekinumab 45 mg at Weeks 12 and 16. Group 2 will receive ustekinumab 45 mg at Weeks 0, 4, and 16 and placebo at Week 12. All patients in the study will eventually receive ustekinumab after Week 12. The patients will be in the study for about 36 weeks, with study visit approximately 10 times. Effectiveness evaluations will be conducted throughout the study and include the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI), Physician's Global Assessment (PGA) and Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI). Safety assessments will also be performed throughout the study and include obtaining and evaluating laboratory tests, vital signs (e.g., blood pressure) and the occurrence and severity of adverse events. GROUP 1: Placebo at Weeks 0 and 4, ustekinumab 45 mg at Weeks 12 and 16. GROUP 2: Ustekinumab 45 mg at Weeks 0, 4, and 16. Placebo at Week 12</detailed_description>
