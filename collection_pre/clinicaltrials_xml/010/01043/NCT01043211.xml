	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to generate further insight into the role and effectiveness of the amide local anesthetic lidocaine as an adjuvant postoperative analgesic after adult spine surgery. The effect of perioperative intravenous lidocaine infusion on postoperative rehabilitation and the inflammatory response will also be examined.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Analgesic Efficacy of Intravenous Lidocaine for Postoperative Pain Following Adult Spine Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Inadequate pain control after spine surgery in adults can result in increased patient morbidity and length of hospital stay, whereas improved postoperative pain control has been demonstrated to have numerous physiologic benefits and to reduce postoperative complications. When administered systemically, the amide local anesthetic lidocaine has potent anti-inflammatory properties, including inhibition of the arachidonic acid cascade and production of eicosanoids and prostaglandins. Previous studies have confirmed that the continuous intravenous administration of lidocaine during and after abdominal surgery in adults improves patient rehabilitation (specifically, pain intensity, duration of ileus, incidence of nausea and vomiting), and shortens hospital stay. The beneficial anti-inflammatory properties versus untoward side effects of the local anesthetics appear superior to steroids and the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Moreover, concern and controversy exists regarding the adverse effects of NSAIDs on bone healing, particularly in adults undergoing spine surgery. No study to date has investigated the efficacy of a continuous perioperative lidocaine infusion in the adult spine surgery population. Therefore, in this prospective, randomized, controlled trial, we will evaluate the analgesic efficacy, anti-inflammatory properties, and rehabilitation pattern with a continuous, perioperative intravenous infusion of lidocaine versus a normal saline placebo in adult patients undergoing a decompressive lumbar laminectomy for spinal canal stenosis. Subjects enrolled in this study will receive a standardized general anesthetic that is consistent with our present clinical practice. The study participants will be randomized to receive both a perioperative bolus (2 mg/kg) and subsequent intravenous infusion (3 mg/kg/hr) of the amide local anesthetic lidocaine or a normal saline placebo at an equal volume per hour. The study infusion will be continued for 90 minutes after surgery. All patients will receive ample and adequate intravenous doses of an opioid (morphine sulfate) to reduce their pain intensity to acceptable levels. Pain intensity, opioid requirements, opioid-related side effects, and both the immediate and sustained rehabilitation pattern will be assessed. In addition to plasma lidocaine levels in the active drug group, plasma C-reactive protein, cortisol, and cytokine levels (e.g., IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-Î±) will be obtained at a series of perioperative time points in all study patients. Postoperative cytokine levels will also be measured in the surgical drainage fluid.</detailed_description>
