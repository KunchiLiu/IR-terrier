	<brief_summary>Transvaginal hybrid procedures are of interest as an available NOTES-Procedure for the clinical routine. Few authors have demonstrated the feasibility and safety of such procedures (e.g. cholecystectomy) in selected patient collectives. In 2008 Lacy at al. published the experience with a transvaginal sigmoidectomy as a first in human report. The aim of this prospective data collection is to evaluate the feasibility and safety of the transvaginal hybrid anterior resection in the clinical routine. Therefore all patients giving the informed consent to the transvaginal hybrid anterior resection will be included and assessed concerning feasibility to perform the transvaginal approach and complete the operation transvaginally.</brief_summary>
