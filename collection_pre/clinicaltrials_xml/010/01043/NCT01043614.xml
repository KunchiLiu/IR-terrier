	<brief_summary>Project PEER utilizes a randomized controlled study design to investigate the combined effects of an exercise and nutrition intervention that is based on self-efficacy principles and delivered primarily by peer educators to reduce the risk for obesity in female college freshman over one academic year (N = 300). The control group will receive minimal interaction from the research team, paralleling the typical freshman experience on the UIUC campus. Recruitment will take place in two waves (consecutive fall terms with n = 150). During the final year (Fall 2010) of the project, a General Education course will be offered that targets weight management. Importantly, the discussion groups for this course will be taught by peer educators trained using the peer resources further refined during the PEER project. In addition to conventional measures of content knowledge assessed in the college classroom when obtaining class credit, personal physical activity and nutrition behaviors along with behavioral determinants (self-efficacy, self-regulatory skills and outcome expectations) will also be assessed. Primary Aim 1: To determine the effectiveness of a peer-delivered self efficacy-based behavioral intervention to enhance nutrition and physical activity behaviors and subsequently weight management success in female university freshman over one academic year. We hypothesize that freshmen randomized to the intervention group will be more successful in losing or maintaining weight than the control group through a combination of diet and physical activity strategies. Primary Aim 2: To examine the role played by social cognitive factors in changing nutrition and physical activity behaviors across one academic year. We hypothesize that self-efficacy will have both a direct influence on behavior and an indirect effect through its influence on self-regulatory skills and outcome expectations.</brief_summary>
