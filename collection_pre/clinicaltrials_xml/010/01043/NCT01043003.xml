	<brief_title>Bilingual Breast Cancer Educational Intervention for Hispanic Women With Stage I, Stage II, or Stage III Breast Cancer and Their Families or Caregivers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Test the effects of the Bilingual Breast Cancer Education Intervention (BBCEI) on outcomes of breast cancer survivors (BCS) and family caregivers at 1, 3, and 6 months post intervention. II. Test the effect of influencing demographic and treatment variables on outcomes of the BBCEI at 1, 3, and 6 months post intervention. III. Examine the perceived quality of the BBCEI. OUTLINE: Patients and caregivers are randomized to 1 of 2 intervention arms. ARM I: Patients and caregivers undergo the Bilingual Breast Cancer Educational Intervention (BBCEI) comprising teaching sessions over 50-65 minutes about 4 specific domains (i.e., physical, psychological, social, and spiritual well being) once weekly during month 1 and also undergo evaluation sessions at months 1, 4, and 7. ARM II: Patients and caregivers undergo usual care comprising evaluation sessions at months 1, 4, and 7. Patients and caregivers may undergo the 4 BBCEI teaching sessions during month 7. All patients and caregivers receive reinforcement telephone calls every other week.</detailed_description>
