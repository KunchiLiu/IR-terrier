	<brief_title>Multicenter Cross Sectional Study of Primary Intestine Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Intestine is the one of commonly involved extranodal sites of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Thus, small and large Intestine account for approximately 30-40% of primary gastrointestinal tract lymphoma. More than 70% of intestinal lymphoma presents as localized disease, and surgery such as bowel resection is performed in many patients with intestinal lymphoma for diagnosis and treatment. However, it is still unclear whether surgical resection followed by chemotherapy is superior to systemic chemotherapy alone in terms of treatment outcome and quality of life (QOL). Thus, we analyze the clinical features and treatment outcome of patients with NHL of intestine, and at the same time perform a multicenter cross-sectional study about the QOL in survivors of intestine NHL. We evaluates the treatment outcomes of patients with intestine NHL from hospitals affiliated with the Consortium for Improving Survival of Lymphoma (CISL) in Korea. We assess the QOL of survivors who completed their treatment using the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Primary intestine lymphoma. Definition of primary intestine lymphoma: 1. Dominant site should be small and large intestine with or without regional lymph node involvement 2. Distant lymph node involvement can be allowed if the intestine lesion is the presenting site 3. Contiguous involvement of other organs such as liver, spleen can be allowed Intestine involvement as a dissemination process in stage IV nodal lymphoma</criteria>
