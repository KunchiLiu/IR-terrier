	<brief_title>The Reversal Intervention for Metabolic Syndrome Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>People who have a combination of risk factors termed metabolic syndrome are at increased risk of developing diabetes, heart disease and strokes. Metabolic syndrome is a major public health concern requiring urgent action because 25% of the adult UK population fulfil the criteria, and this will increase as people continue to be less active and levels of overweight and obesity rise. The aim of our study is to see if people with metabolic syndrome who attend a structured group education programme based on lifestyle changes (dietary and increased physical activity) can lessen their risk of having diabetes and cardiovascular disease in the future. Overall, we hope to show that this type of education reduces the number of people who have metabolic syndrome. Subjects recruited with metabolic syndrome will be randomised to intervention or control arms. The intervention arm will receive group education and the control group will receive routine care. The results will inform primary prevention strategies in people from varied ethnic backgrounds who are at high risk of developing type-2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.</detailed_description>
