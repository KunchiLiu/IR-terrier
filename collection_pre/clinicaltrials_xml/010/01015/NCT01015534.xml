	<brief_summary>RATIONALE - Fractionated radiotherapy uses high-energy photons to kill, or damage tumor cells. High daily dose temozolomide combined with fractionated radiotherapy may make tumor cells more sensible to treatment. PURPOSE - This randomized phase II trial, assess in patients with brain metastases from solid tumors, whether the whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) plus temozolomide is able to improve the results obtained with WBRT.</brief_summary>
