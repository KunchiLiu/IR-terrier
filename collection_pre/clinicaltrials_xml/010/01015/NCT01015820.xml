	<brief_summary>Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer death in the United States and is associated with a poor prognosis. The average life expectancy after diagnosis is approximately 5 to 8 months. At present, successful surgical resection is the only curative therapy that can improve long-term survival. However, it can be achieved only when a tumor is detected at an early stage. Unfortunately, due to non-specific symptoms associated with pancreatic cancer, it is commonly detected in the later stages of the disease. The investigators hypothesized that pancreatic cancer could be detected by measuring the changes in the early increase in blood supply (EIBS) found in the surrounding normal-appearing duodenal tissue. The investigators tested a device called Four-dimensional Elastic Light-Scattering Fingerprinting (4D-ELF). The device used in this study is considered investigational, which means it has either not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for routine clinical use or for the use described in this study. However the FDA allowed the use of this device in this research study.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Early Increase in Blood Flow (EIBS) in the Duodenum in Patients With Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>According to field effect theory, by detecting microvasculature changes in the early increase of blood supply in the surrounding tissue neoplastic lesions can be identified from a distance. The objective of this study was to determine the feasibility and efficacy of a fiberoptic probe containing novel Polarization Gating Spectroscopy (PGS) technology to identify patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAC) by field effect theory. EIBS markers, deoxyhemoglobin concentration (DHb), and average blood vessel radius (BVR) were evaluated in patients with PAC versus controls. During the subjects' esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with upper endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), the new optic probe was inserted inside the endoscope and advanced to the tip of the endoscope prior to the scope being withdrawn. As the scope was withdrawn, the light optic probe was used to examine approximately 5 sections of the small bowel: 1) directly on the ampulla, 2) approximately 5 mm proximal from the ampulla, 3) approximately 5 mm distal from the ampulla, 4) 1 cm proximal from the ampulla, and 5) 1 cm distal from the ampulla. Spectroscopy measurements were obtained four times in each of these five peri-ampullary locations. The rest of the EGD and upper EUS endoscopy procedures were then completed as clinically indicated. During the procedure, all visualized mucosal abnormalities were recorded and photographed.</detailed_description>
