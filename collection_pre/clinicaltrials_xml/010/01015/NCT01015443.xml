	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether the cancer vaccine tecemotide (L-BLP25) in addition to best supportive care is effective in prolonging the lives of Asian subjects with unresectable stage III non-small cell lung cancer in comparison to a placebo plus best supportive care (a so-called placebo controlled study).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Histologically or cytologically documented unresectable stage III nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) Documented stable disease or objective response, according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Version 1.0 (RECIST v1.0) after primary concomitant chemoradiotherapy for unresectable stage III disease, within four weeks (28 days) prior to randomization Receipt of concomitant chemoradiotherapy. The chemotherapypart must have been platinumbased, must have been administered with a minimum of two cycles overlap with radiotherapy (one cycle lasts either 3 or 4 weeks depending on the chemotherapy regimen), and a minimum of two platinumbased chemotherapy administrations must have been given during radiotherapy. Purely radio sensitizing doses of chemotherapy are not acceptable. Radiotherapy must have delivered a radiation dose of &gt;= (greater than or equal to) 50 Gray (Gy). Induction or consolidation chemotherapy is allowed and if given, should be accounted as part of primary thoracic chemoradiotherapy. Subjects must have completed the primary thoracic chemoradiotherapy at least four weeks (28 days) and no later than 12 weeks (84 days) prior to randomization. Subjects who received prophylactic brain irradiation as part of primary chemoradiotherapy are eligible Geographically accessible for ongoing followup, and committed to comply with the designated visits An Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1 A platelet count &gt;= the lower limit of normal for the site or &gt;= 100 x 10^9 per liter (/Liter) (whichever is greater); white blood cell (WBC) &gt;= 2.5 x 10^9/Liter and haemoglobin &gt;= 90 gram per liter (g/L) &gt;=18 years of age (or minimum age of legal consent consistent with local regulations, if minimum is greater than [&gt;] 18 years of age) Other protocol defined inclusion criteria could apply PreTherapies*: Prior sequential chemoradiotherapy Lungcancerspecific therapy (including surgery) other than primary chemoradiotherapy Immunotherapy (e.g., interferons, tumor necrosis factor [TNF], interleukins, or biological response modifiers [granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor {GMCSF}, granulocyte colony stimulating factor {GCSF}, macrophagecolony stimulating factor {MCSF}], monoclonal antibodies) within four weeks (28 days) prior to randomization Investigational systemic drugs (including offlabel use of approved products) within four weeks (28 days) prior to randomization Disease Status: Metastatic disease Malignant pleural effusion at initial diagnosis and/or at trial entry Past or current history of neoplasm other than lung carcinoma, except for curatively treated nonmelanoma skin cancer, in situ carcinoma of the cervix, or other cancer curatively treated and with no evidence of disease for at least 5 years Autoimmune disease A recognized immunodeficiency disease including cellular immunodeficiencies, hypogammaglobulinemia or dysgammaglobulinemia; subjects who have hereditary or congenital immunodeficiencies Any preexisting medical condition requiring chronic steroid or immunosuppressive therapy (steroids for the treatment of radiation pneumonitis are allowed) Known active Hepatitis B infection and/or Hepatitis C infection Signs and symptoms suggestive of transmissible spongiform encephalopathy, or of family members who suffer(ed) from such Physiological Functions: Clinically significant hepatic dysfunction Clinically significant renal dysfunction Clinically significant cardiac disease Splenectomy Infectious process that in the opinion of the investigator could compromise the subject's ability to mount an immune response Standard Safety: Pregnant or breastfeeding women, women of childbearing potential, unless using effective contraception as determined by the investigator Known drug abuse or alcohol abuse Participation in another clinical trial (excluding purely observational studies) within the past 28 days Requires concurrent treatment with a nonpermitted drug Known hypersensitivity to any of the trial treatment ingredients Legal incapacity or limited legal capacity Any other reason that, in the opinion of the investigator precludes the subject from participating in the trial</criteria>
