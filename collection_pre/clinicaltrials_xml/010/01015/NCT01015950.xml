	<brief_summary>The objectives of the study are to assess the impact of different dietary strategies for the management of children with MAM on: the children's continued participation in the nutritional rehabilitation program and their physical growth, recovery from MAM, and change in micronutrient status and body composition. The specific dietary regimens that will be compared are: 1) a ready-to-use, lipid-based supplementary food (Plumpy'Sup, Nutriset, Inc.), providing ~500 kcal/d for 12 weeks; 2) specially formulated CSB for malnourished children, providing ~ 500 kcal/d for 12 weeks; 3) Misola, a locally produced, micronutrient-fortified, cereal-legume blend, providing ~500 kcal/d for 12 weeks; or 4) packaged, home available foods (millet and cowpea flour, sugar, vegetable oil) and a multiple micronutrient powder ("Mix Me") for 12 weeks, as is currently recommended by the national CMAM protocol when special foods are not available.</brief_summary>
