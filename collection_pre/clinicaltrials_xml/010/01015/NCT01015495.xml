	<brief_title>Ranibizumab Therapy for Choroidal Neovascularization (CNV) Asociated With Angioid Streaks</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Choroidal neovascularization is a hallmark of angioid streaks, and presumably VEGF-driven. Ranibizumab has been shown to be effective in CNV secondary to age-related macular degeneration. Therefore, we hypothesize that ranibizumab may be efficacious in the treatment of CNV secondary to angioid streaks</detailed_description>
