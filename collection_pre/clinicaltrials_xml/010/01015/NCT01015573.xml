	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to create a database of quantified finger movements. Using the evaluation system with magnetic sensors, the movements of finger tapping are measured and assessed by various indices, such as finger tapping interval, maximum amplitude of finger taps, and so on. In this study, the investigators will accumulate the data from healthy subjects for the purpose of applying this evaluation system to diagnosis support of nervous diseases in the future.</brief_summary>
