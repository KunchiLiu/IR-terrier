	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to assess the therapeutic activity and safety of the combination of Bendamustine and Rituximab in MALT lymphomas. Primary endpoint: - Event-free-survival (EFS) (failure or death from any cause) for all patients. Secondary endpoints: - Complete and partial remission rates for all patients - Response duration (time to relapse or progression) for responder patients - Progression-free-survival (PFS) (disease progression or death from lymphoma: for all patients - Overall survival for all patients - Acute and long-term toxicity</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Histologically proven diagnosis of CD20positive marginal zone Bcell lymphoma of MALT type arisen at any extranodal site (WHO classification) 2. Any stage (Ann Arbor IIV) 3. The novo disease en any extranodal site. For primary gastric or cutaneous lymphoma, local/specific previous treatment is accepted, just following the below criteria: 1. Cutaneous lymphoma: recurrent lymphoma after local therapy 2. Gastric lymphoma: b1. H. pylorinegative cases, either de novo (non pretreated) or at relapse following local therapy (i.e., surgery, radiotherapy or antibiotics). b2. H. pyloripositive cases at diagnosis, who failed antibiotic therapy, including patients with: clinical (endoscopic) and histological evidence of disease progression at any time post H. pylori eradication; stable disease with persistent lymphoma at 1 year post H. pylori eradication; relapse (without H. pylori reinfection), after a remission; patients who failed either first line antibiotics or further local treatment (surgery or radiotherapy) 4. No evidence of histologic transformation to a high grade lymphoma 5. Measurable or evaluable disease 6. Age &gt;18 and &lt;85 7. ECOG performance status 02 8. Life expectancy of at least 1 year 9. Written informed consent given according to national/local regulations 1. Prior chemotherapy or prior immunotherapy with any antiCD20 monoclonal antibody 2. Prior radiotherapy in the last 6 weeks 3. Corticosteroids during the last 28 days, unless prednisone chronically administered at a dose &lt;20 mg/day for indications other than lymphoma or lymphomarelated symptoms 4. Major impairment of renal function (serum creatinine &gt; 2,5 x upper normal) or liver function (ASAT/ALAT &lt;2,5 x upper normal, total bilirubin &lt;2,5x upper normal), unless due to lymphoma involvement. 5. Impairment of bone marrow function (WBC &lt;3.0x109/L, ANC &lt;1.5x109/L, PLT &lt;100x109/L), unless due to lymphoma involvement 6. Evidence of clinically significant cardiac, neurological or metabolic disease, unless due to lymphoma involvement 7. Evidence of symptomatic central nervous system (CNS) disease 8. Active HBV and/or HCV infection 9. Known HIV infection 10. Prior diagnosis of neoplasm within 5 years, except cervical intraepithelial neoplasia type 1 (CIN1) or localized nonmelanomatous skin cancer 11. Any psychiatric disease potentially hampering compliance with the study protocol and followup schedule 12. Potential to attend regular visits to the hospital, on an outpatient regimen 13. Hypersensibility to any compound of the study medication. 14. Non appropriate contraceptive method in women of childbearing potential or men 15. Treatment with any drug under research within 30 days previous to start the study medication.</criteria>
