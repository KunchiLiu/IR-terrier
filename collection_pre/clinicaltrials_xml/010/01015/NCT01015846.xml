	<brief_summary>This study evaluates the ability of the transverse abdominis (TrA) to contract during and after two different types of exercise - either sling based exercise or traditional core stability exercise. The TrA is measured by real time ultrasound imaging. The investigators hypothesized that the sling based exercise would activate the TrA to a greater degree and that there would be a greater activation after the exercise.</brief_summary>
