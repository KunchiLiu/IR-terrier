	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the relationships between prostanoids and various outcomes such as sleep disturbance, hypertension and arteriosclerosis in patients with sleep apnea syndrome(SAS). In the patients introduced to continuous positive airway pressure(CPAP) treatment, the effects of CPAP are also evaluated.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Roles of Prostanoids in Patients With Sleep Apnea Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>SAS is characterized by abnormality during sleep and hypoxemia from apnea and hypopnea, followed by systemic inflammation and organ dysfunction like cardiovascular diseases. Systemic inflammation causes the activation of arachidonic acid metabolism, producing prostaglandins (PGs) and leukotrienes (LTs). In addition, significant relationships between PGD2 and PGE2 and sleep, PGF2Î± and hypertension, PGI2 and thromboxane and platelet aggregation and so on are reported. Therefore, it is hypothesized that many prostanoids affect the pathophysiology of SAS. However, the relationships between prostanoids and clinical outcomes in patients with SAS are unknown. Although CPAP is the major treatment of SAS, the effects of CPAP on prostanoids are not known, either. Thus, the purpose of this study is to evaluate those relationships.</detailed_description>
