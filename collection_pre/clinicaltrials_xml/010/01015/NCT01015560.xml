	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such MLN1202, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well MLN1202 works in treating patients with bone metastases.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>S0916, MLN1202 in Treating Patients With Bone Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To assess the urinary n-telopeptide (uNTX) response to anti-CCR2 monoclonal antibody MLN1202 in patients with bone metastases. Secondary - To assess the feasibility of performing cross-disease site trials within the Southwest Oncology Group. - To explore the effect of anti-CCR2 monoclonal antibody MLN1202 on markers of tumor cell proliferation, monocytes/macrophage trafficking, and osteoclast maturation. - To estimate allele frequencies of defined SNPs occurring in the CCL2 and CCR2 genes in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive anti-CCR2 monoclonal antibody MLN1202 IV over 1 hour on days 1, 15, and 29 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo urine and blood sample collection at baseline and on days 15, 29, and 43 for correlative biomarker and polymorphism studies. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for ≥ 30 days.</detailed_description>
