	<brief_summary>Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Inhibitors (EGFRI) are associated with skin toxicities. Clinical experience suggests that skin toxicities interfere with health related quality of life (HRQL) and may interfere with treatment adherence. No systematic investigations of EGFRI-associated dermatologic toxicities and impact on HRQL have been reported. No patient-reported outcome measures exist to capture the unique concerns of oncology patients who experience EGFRI-associated dermatologic toxicities. The purpose of this study is to develop a patient-reported outcomes measure to assess dermatologic-related symptoms burden and health-related quality of life among patients receiving an EGFRI, and to develop a grading system for EGFRI-associated dermatologic toxicities.</brief_summary>
