	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate whether a fixed dose combination (FDC) capsule of esomeprazole 20 mg and acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) 81 mg has equivalent therapeutic efficacy compared to each of 2 free combinations of ASA tablet 81 mg plus esomeprazole 20 mg in patients at risk of gastrointestinal events using low dose ASA for cardiovascular protection.</brief_summary>
