	<brief_summary>1. Phase I: To estimate the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of RAD001 in combination with cetuximab and cisplatin for treatment of metastatic squamous cell cancer of the head and neck (SCCHN). 2. Phase II: To estimate the progression free survival (PFS) of RAD001 at MTD in combination with weekly cetuximab and cisplatin on days 1 and 8 of each 28 day cycle in patients with recurrent or metastatic SCCHN, Secondary Objectives 1. To estimate the complete and partial response rate of RAD001 at MTD in combination with weekly cetuximab and cisplatin on days 1 and 8 of each 28 day cycle in patients with recurrent or metastatic SCCHN, 2. To explore if the clinical activity of this regimen correlates with markers of the EGF-R/mTOR pathway in tumor tissue by serial sampling of tumor. 3. To explore the role of FDG PET imaging as an early indicator of response to this combination.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, with recurrent or metastatic disease. 2. Patients must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as &gt;20 mm with conventional techniques or as &gt;10 mm with spiral CT scan. See Section 11 for the evaluation of measurable disease. 3. Patients must have had no prior monoclonal antibodies or small molecule tyrosinekinase inhibitors for the treatment of recurrent or metastatic SCCHN. In addition, no prior chemotherapy for the treatment of recurrent or metastatic SCCHN is allowed. 4. If the patient has had previous radiation to the marker lesion(s), there must be evidence of progression since the radiation. Patients must be greater than or equal to 12 weeks from completion of prior curative intent therapy including surgery, radiation, or systemic anticancer therapy. If palliative radiation therapy is given for recurrent or metastatic disease, patients must be greater than or equal to four weeks from treatment. 5. No concurrent malignancy except curatively treated basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or carcinoma in situ of the cervix. Patients with prior history of malignancies must be disease free for greater than or equal to two years. 6. Age &gt;18 years. 7. Life expectancy of greater than 4.5 months. 8. ECOG performance status &lt;2 (Karnofsky &gt;60%; see Appendix A). 9. Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below: leukocytes &gt;3,000/mcL absolute neutrophil count &gt;1,500/mcL platelets &gt;100,000/mcL total bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 X institutional upper limit of normal or within normal institutional limits. or AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) &lt;3.0 X institutional upper limit of normal creatinine within normal institutional limits OR creatinine clearance &gt;60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for patients with creatinine levels above institutional normal 3.1.8 10. As the investigational agent RAD001 requires enteral administration, patients must be able to receive adequate enteral nutrition by mouth or through a Gtube device. 11. The effects of RAD001 on the developing human fetus at the recommended therapeutic dose are unknown. For this reason and because agents used in this trial are known to be teratogenic, women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. 12. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document. 1. Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier. 2. Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents. 3. Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events. 4. History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to RAD001 or other agents used in the study. 5. Patients receiving any medications or substances that are inhibitors or inducers of the isoenzyme CYP3A are ineligible. Lists including medications and substances known or with the potential to interact with the CYP3A isoenzymes are provided in the appendix. 6. Patients receiving chronic treatment with systemic steroids or other immunosuppressive agents are ineligible. 7. Patients with a known hypersensitivity to RAD001 (everolimus) or other rapamycin (sirolimus, temsirolimus) or its excipients. 8. Impairment of gastrointestinal function or gastrointestinal disease that may significantly alter the absorption of RAD001 (e.g. ulcerative disease; uncontrolled nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea; malabsorption syndrome or small bowel resection). 9. Patients with active bleeding diathesis or patients on oral antivitamin K agent (excluding low dose warfarin). 10. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, severely impaired lung function or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements Severely impaired lung function is defined as spirometry and DLCO that is 50% of the normal predicted value and /or O2 saturation that is 88% or less on room air. 11. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because RAD001 is a mTOR inhibitor with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with RAD001, breastfeeding should be discontinued. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study. 12. HIVpositive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with RAD001. In addition, these patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrowsuppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.</criteria>
