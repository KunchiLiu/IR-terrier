	<brief_summary>Exposure to trauma, especially when it manifests as Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), results in numerous negative consequences for patients, families, and society. Some of the most frequent, disturbing, and treatment resistant symptoms of PTSD are nightmares and insomnia. This study will examine whether treatments specifically targeted at those sleep disorders can improve clinical outcomes and increase health-related quality of life in individuals recently exposed to war-related trauma. Hypotheses are that treating nightmares and insomnia will improve both nighttime and daytime symptoms of PTSD, as well as quality of life.</brief_summary>
