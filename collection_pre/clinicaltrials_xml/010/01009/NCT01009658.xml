	<detailed_description>Amino acids such as monosodium glutamate are known to stimulate both endocrine and exocrine secretion. In addition, there is a report that oral intake of glutamate evokes the activation of vagal afferent nerves in the rat. Thus, such amino acids are thought to be influential in the process of digestion and absorption. . To investigate the effect of monosodium glutamate on gastrointestinal motility, we planned a single-blind randomized study. The participants will take either monosodium glutamate or sodium chloride before the first examination of upper GI motility and the other agent before the second examination. The order of intake will be randomized by the envelope method.</detailed_description>
