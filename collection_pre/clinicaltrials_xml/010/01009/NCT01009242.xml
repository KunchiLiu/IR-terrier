	<brief_summary>The primary objectives are to determine the relationship between blood levels of CDP6038 and suppression of C-reactive Protein (CRP) following single doses given as intravenous (IV) infusion or subcutaneous (SC) injection to Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) patients. The safety of CDP6038 will also be evaluated.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The secondary objectives of the study include determination of the absolute bioavailability of CDP6038 given via sc administration compared with iv infusion; assessment of the immunogenicity potential of single dose CDP6038 and assessment, on an exploratory basis, of other relevant systemic biomarkers and changes in clinical response.</detailed_description>
