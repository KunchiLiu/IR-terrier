	<brief_summary>A specific group of neurons in the brain produces hypocretin, a peptide which has been established as an important regulator of sleep and wakefulness. Activation of these neurons (increased hypocretin) stabilizes wakefulness; impairing or blocking these neurons (decreased hypocretin) promotes sleep. Evidence suggests that these neurons may be involved in the hypnotic properties of several anesthetics, and play a role in the induction and emergence from anesthesia. In humans there is a considerable inter-individual variability in hypocretin levels. This study aims to investigate how hypocretin levels affect the anesthetic care and recovery of patients undergoing elective hip surgery.</brief_summary>
