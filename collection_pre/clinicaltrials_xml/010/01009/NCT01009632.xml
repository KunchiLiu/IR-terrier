	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to explore quantitatively the hypothesis that "resonant voice," may enhance recovery from acute laryngeal phonotrauma, based on molecular assays from human laryngeal secretions and secondarily, clinical tests.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The objective is to use the following operationalized question: Does a voicing mode shown to correspond to high-amplitude, low impact vocal cord oscillations, "resonant voice," improve the amount and time-course of recovery from acute phonotrauma, compared to vocal rest or spontaneous speech, as measured with molecular assays (primarily) and with behavioral and clinical tests (secondarily)?</detailed_description>
	<criteria>males and females who have had voice training and feel they are able to produce loud voice safely; ages 1849; generally healthy; normal hearing bilaterally at 20 dB to 8,000 Hz; and demonstrated ability to produce "resonant voice" during training as determined by the examiner perceptually. current chronic voice problems; current medications that are determined to possibly influence voice (e.g. diuretics, decongestants); heightened gag reflex; small nasal passage; deviated septum; and known or suspected allergy to anesthetics.</criteria>
