	<brief_summary>This study assessed the effect of different InterStim rate settings on voiding diary outcomes. Specifically, the study evaluated how 3 different rate settings affected the number of urinary incontinent episodes per day collected through a voiding diary. The study also evaluated how the 3 different rate settings affected other voiding diary measures including number of voids per day, degree of urgency before each void, number of pads used per day, and number of fecal incontinent episodes, questionnaires, and adverse events.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Implanted with either Neurostimulator Model 3023 (InterStim) or Neurostimulator Model 3058 (InterStim II) for at least 3 months Implanted with tined lead models 3889 or 3093 Tined lead is located in S2, S3, or S4 Diagnosis before InterStim implant included urgency frequency (an average of 8 or more voids per day) and any amount of urinary urge incontinence over the voiding diary reporting period. The diary reporting period must be at least 2 days. Able to tolerate (ie, no complaint of pain or discomfort) acute high InterStim rate setting Able to tolerate (ie, no complaint of pain or discomfort) acute medium InterStim rate setting Able to tolerate (ie, no complaint of pain or discomfort) acute low InterStim rate setting Must be willing to maintain their current regimen (dosage and frequency) of any overactive bladder medication (anticholinergic or antimuscarinic) or tricyclic antidepression medication over the study duration Female subject 18 years of age or older Willing and able to accurately complete voiding diaries and questionnaires, attend visits, and comply with the study protocol that includes maintenance of InterStim programming settings over the course of the study. Able to consent to participate by signing the Informed Consent Form Multiple sclerosis Reiter's syndrome Exclude diabetics unless the subject's diabetes is wellcontrolled with diet or medication History of spinal cord injury or a cerebral vascular accident (CVA) Active symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI) Stress incontinence as the primary diagnosis Pelvic pain of uncertain etiology that is not associated with a voiding dysfunction or where pelvic pain is the primary complaint/diagnosis Interstitial cystitis as the primary diagnosis Urinary retention as the primary diagnosis Treatment of urinary symptoms with botulinum toxin in the past 12 months or any plan to have botulinum toxin treatment during the study Bilateral lead placement Have other implantable neurostimulator, pacemaker, or defibrillator Have knowledge of planned MRIs, diathermy, microwave exposure, high output ultrasonic exposure, or RF energy exposure Have an anticipated system modification within the next 1 month Women who are pregnant or planning to become pregnant or women of childbearing potential who are not using a medicallyacceptable method of birth control. Women of childbearing age potential must undergo a pregnancy test, with a clear negative result, no more than 7 days prior to randomization visit. Subjects who frequently use the patient programmer to change device program settings. "Frequently" is defined as at least once a day and does not include shutting off the device for safety purposes. Characteristics indicating a poor understanding of the study or characteristics that indicate the subject may have poor compliance with the study protocol Study site personnel will contact the Medtronic Study Manager to determine if a potential subject who plans to enroll in another investigational device or drug trial, or is currently enrolled in an investigational device or drug trial is eligible for this study.</criteria>
