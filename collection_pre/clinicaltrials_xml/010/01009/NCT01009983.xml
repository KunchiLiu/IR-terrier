	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel and carboplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as panitumumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Other find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Giving panitumumab together with paclitaxel and carboplatin may be a better way to block tumor growth. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects and how well paclitaxel and carboplatin together with panitumumab works in treating patients with metastatic triple negative breast cancer.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: I. To determine the response rate to the combination of carboplatin, paclitaxel and panitumumab in women with ER-, PR- and Her-2 negative metastatic breast cancer. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the tolerability and toxicities of the combination of paclitaxel, carboplatin and panitumumab. II. To determine the markers that co-occur with EGFR expression in the triple negative breast cancer. III. To assess the association between tumor biomarkers and clinical outcomes (response and survival). IV. To examine the effect this regimen has on time to progression and survival. OUTLINE: Patients receive paclitaxel IV and carboplatin IV on days 1, 8, and 15. Patients also receive panitumumab IV on days 1 and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.</detailed_description>
