	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to develop an approach to provide personalized medicine to individuals who have hypertension (high blood pressure). The investigators plan to use people's genetic characteristics (traits) to determine what medication they should use to lower their blood pressure most effectively. The investigators will give individuals one of two medications to treat hypertension (lisinopril or atenolol). The investigators believe that depending on the individuals genetic background one medication will work better in lowering their blood pressure.</brief_summary>
