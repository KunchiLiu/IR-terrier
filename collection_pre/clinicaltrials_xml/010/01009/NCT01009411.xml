	<brief_summary>Objective of the study: to obtain new data on the dynamics of the labor process, cervix dilatation and head station on the labor process and to develop a new progress indices. Background: the best method used today to supervise the labor process is to follow cervix dilatation and head station. Today, the physician or the midwife use manual examination to estimate cervix dilatation and head station. This examination is perform many times in a normal labor process, and even more if there is any delay. The information from these examinations is inaccurate and non-continuous. In case of delay in the labor process, the delay will diagnosed late, because the frequency of the manual examination is about once an hour. With the assistance of the BirthTrack device we can get continuous data on the labor process and get indices to estimate the labor process progress without the use of vaginal (manual) examination. 40 women in an active labor will take part in the study. Method: by connecting sensors to the woman abdomen, to the cervix and to the baby head we follow the cervix dilatation and the fetus head station.</brief_summary>
