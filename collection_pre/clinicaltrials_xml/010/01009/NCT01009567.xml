	<brief_title>Compare the Efficacy of Human Albumin With Cabergoline to Prevent Ovarian Hyper Stimulation in Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) Program</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) is a iatrogenic potentially life threatening complication of assisted reproduction technologies due to gonadotropin and human chorionic gonadotropin administration. Its severe form has been reported in 1-10% of in vitro fertilization cycles. Different strategies have been proposed for the prevention of OHSS in high-risk patients, but these approaches do not offer complete protection against the development of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). Among the selected preventive methods, discontinuing (coasting) gonadotropin therapy and i.v. albumin were by far the most popular choices. Several previous studies have shown that cabergoline is a safe drug, both for mother and conceptus, for the treatment of macroadenoma hyperprolactinemia. We think that this kind of therapy may be safe both for mother and conceptus (as previously shown by several studies on dopamine agonists treatment of hyperprolactinemia during pregnancy), easier, cheaper and probably, more effective than previous OHSS treatments (albumin, steroids, dopamine). There is an urgent need to test cabergoline efficacy in OHSS prevention in high risk patients with a large multicenter study. The proposal of This study approved by our institutional review boards and institution's ethical committee, and all Participants will sign a written consent before enter to study. Patients entering the intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) / IVF program in Royan institute and infertility research center in Valieasr hospital in Iran. We use a downregulation protocol with a GnRH agonist (buserelin acetate) as a long protocol for ICSI/ IVF-ET. We evaluate patients for high risk factors of severe OHSS. The inclusion criterion was the collection of &gt;20 oocytes during oocyte retrieval. They allocate by a series of computer-generated random into two groups after the oocytes retrieval. 30 minutes after oocytes retrieval patients in A Group , receive human albumin 20% infusion and in B group receive cabergoline tablet (0/5 mg) daily until 6 days after oocytes retrieval then women in all groups will informed about the signs and symptoms of OHSS and counsel to contact with our institute if OHSS develops. Patients will monitor routinely 6days after ET by ultrasonographic examination for ovarian size and for detection of ascites. Moderate to severe OHSS patients hospitalize and evaluate routinely by haematological and biochemical tests. OHSS patients diagnose and classify according to Golan et al 1989.we compare incidence of OHSS and severity of OHSS patients in two groups. Pregnant patients follow until the 12th gestational week.</detailed_description>
