	<brief_summary>Cervical epidural steroid injections - The hanging drop (HD) technique is commonly used for identifying the cervical epidural space. - The hanging drop (HD) technique is using the negative pressure in the epidural space. - The subject of debate whether the epidural space exhibits negative pressure. - In a previous study, EP might be influenced by body position - No report or peer-reviewed literature to demonstrate the cervical epidural pressure (CEP) now. The hypothesis of this study - There is a difference in the cervical epidural pressure between in the prone and sitting positions - To evaluate this hypothesis, CEPs in the prone and sitting groups were measured and compared in the two groups. - Using a closed pressure measurement system - Under fluoroscopic guidance.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cervical epidural steroid injections (CESIs) - For the conservative management of head, neck, and upper extremity pain - Important to identify the epidural space for minimizing the chance of a dural puncture injection - Dural puncture injection makes CESIs prone to rare but catastrophic complication like permanent spinal cord injury The hanging drop (HD) technique - Commonly used for identifying the cervical epidural space - Using the negative pressure in the epidural space - The subject of debate whether the epidural space exhibits negative pressure In previous studies using a closed pressure measurement systems - The epidural pressure (EP) was commonly positive at the thoracic level in the lateral decubitus position. - EP was consistently negative only in the sitting position. - EP might be influenced by body position. - The patient should be sitting for using the HD technique. No report or peer-reviewed literature to demonstrate the cervical epidural pressure (CEP) now. The hypothesis of this study - There is a difference in the cervical epidural pressure between in the prone and sitting positions - To evaluate this hypothesis, CEPs in the prone and sitting groups were measured and compared in the two groups. - Using a closed pressure measurement system - Under fluoroscopic guidance.</detailed_description>
