	<brief_summary>This study is conducted in the United States of America (USA). The aim of this observational study is to collect data concerning the treatment outcomes and safety for children and adults who are prescribed Norditropin®. Specific objectives include: 1) developing models defining the relationship of Norditropin dose to changes in insulin-like growth factor (IGF-I) and treatment outcomes, accounting for independent factors such as age, gender and puberty and 2) determining the relative predictive values of peak growth hormone (GH) and IGF-I levels and other factors before treatment to clinical outcomes.</brief_summary>
