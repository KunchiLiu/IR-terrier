	<brief_summary>This randomized, double-blind, parallel group study will assess the safety, disease remission, and prevention of structural joint damage in patients with early moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis treated with tocilizumab as monotherapy or in combination with methotrexate, versus methotrexate alone. Patients will be randomized to receive either (A) tocilizumab (8 mg/kg iv every 4 weeks) plus placebo, (B) tocilizumab (8 mg/kg iv every 4 weeks) plus methotrexate (7.5-20 mg po weekly), (C) tocilizumab (4 mg/kg iv every 4 weeks) plus methotrexate (7.5-20 mg po weekly), or (D) placebo plus methotrexate (7.5-20 mg po weekly). Patients in groups C and D who have not achieved low disease activity at week 52 can receive tocilizumab 8 mg/kg iv every 4 weeks. Anticipated time on study treatment is 104 weeks.</brief_summary>
