	<brief_title>Use of Wii Fit (TM) to Increase Compliance With Home Exercises in Treating Patellofemoral Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patellofemoral syndrome (PFS) is a very common diagnosis amongst adolescents and young adults. Symptoms can be chronic in nature and interfere with sporting activity and activities of daily living. Current treatment consists of home exercises to increase muscular strength and flexibility. Adolescents are known to have poor compliance with treatments for chronic illnesses. There is a paucity of published literature surrounding the Wii TM Interactive Video Game. There has been one published report of the use of Wii Fit TM in rehabilitation where participants used the Wii Fit TM to train proprioception after ankle injury. Individuals that participated in the Wii Fit TM group found improvement in their balance on objective measures as well as increased enjoyment with their treatment plan. One anecdotal report used the Wii TM video game in physiotherapy treatments of a college athlete and found a dramatic increase in attendance compliance after introduction of the video game. This randomized controlled study will determine if using the Wii Fit TM for home exercise completion will increase compliance and subsequently improve symptoms related to patellofemoral syndrome in adolescent females.</detailed_description>
