Standard of care for diagnosis of DVT includes a combination of a clinical pre-test probability rule known as Well's criteria, D-dimer blood testing, and Radiology department ultrasound. The purpose of this study is to determine whether Emergency Physicians can safely rule out deep vein thrombosis using Well's criteria and D-dimer blood testing combined with Emergency department bedside ultrasound.</brief_summary>
