	<brief_summary>The proposed study will investigate the effect of chronotherapeutic alteration of anti-hypertensive medication on nocturnal hypertension and end-organ injury in pediatric renal transplant recipients who are non-dippers. Additionally, the investigators aim to examine the association between response to intervention, serum adiponectin levels and adiponectin gene polymorphisms. The investigators hypothesize that (1) evening administration of anti-hypertensive medication will convert subjects from non-dipper to dipper status, improve mean nocturnal blood pressure (BP), and improve nocturnal BP load, (2) evening administration of anti-hypertensive medication will reduce albuminuria, left ventricular mass index (LVMI), rate of decline of glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and will decrease pulse wave velocity (PWV), and (3) lower adiponectin levels and presence of adiponectin gene polymorphisms will be associated with less of a response to the intervention.</brief_summary>
