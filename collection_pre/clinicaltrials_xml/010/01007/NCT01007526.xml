	<brief_summary>This study is to evaluate the efficacy of risk-adapted treatment strategy for stage I/II extranodal NK/T cell lymphoma. The risk stratification is based on the Korean NK prognostic index. Thus, the group I/II will receive concomitant chemoradiation followed by VIDL chemotherapy. The group III/IV will receive high dose-chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation after the completion of VIDL chemotherapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Concomitant Chemo-radiotherapy Plus VIDL Chemotherapy in NK/T-cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1. Concomitant chemo-radiotherapy: Radiotherapy 36-44 Gy/18-22 fractions + weekly cisplatin 30 mg/m2 for 4 weeks 2. Rest period: 3 weeks 3. VIDL combination chemotherapy: (total 2 cycles) VP-16 (etoposide) 100mg/m2 I.V. D1-3 Ifosfamide 1.2g/m2 I.V. D1-3 Dexamethasone 40mg/day D1-3 L-asparaginase 4000IU/m2 IM D8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20 Repeated every 28 days 4. Peripheral blood stem cell mobilization G-CSF 400ug/m2/day or 10ug/kg/day S.C. or I.V. for 4-6 days followed by stem cell collection (Minimum requirement of CD34+ cells &gt; 2Ã—106/kg) 5. High-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplantation Busulfex 3.2mg/kg/day from day -7 to day -5 Etoposide 400mg/m2/day on day -5, -4 Cyclophosphamide 50mg/kg/day on day -3, -2 Followed by stem cell infusion</detailed_description>

	<criteria>patients were required to have a biopsyproven diagnosis of nasal ENKTL at least 18 years old Ann Arbor stage IE or IIE measurable disease Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 02 life expectancy greater than 12 weeks adequate hematologic (hemoglobin &gt; 9.0 g/dL, absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1,500/uL and platelets &gt; 100,000/uL) renal (serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 mg/dL, creatinine clearance &gt; 50 mL/min) hepatic (total bilirubin &lt; 2 times of upper limit of normal and aspartate transferase &lt; 3 times of upper limit of normal) function Diagnosis of ENKTL is based on the presence of histological features and immunophenotypes compatible with ENKTL (e.g., cytoplasmic CD3+, CD20, CD56+, positive for cytotoxic molecules, positive for EBV by in situ hybridization). Informed consent prior or concomitant malignant tumors any coexisting medical problems of sufficient severity to prevent full compliance with the study protocol. ENKTL with nonnasal sites such as skin or gastrointestinal tract was excluded even if it is localized. Other subtypes of nonHodgkin lymphoma (NHL), including myeloid/NK cell precursor acute leukemia, blastic NK cell lymphoma/precursor NK cell lymphoblastic leukemia, aggressive NK cell leukemia, and peripheral T cell lymphoma, unspecified, were excluded.</criteria>
