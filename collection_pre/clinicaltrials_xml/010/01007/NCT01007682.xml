	<brief_summary>This study aims at identifying risk factors for the development of intrusive reexperiencing symptoms. In particular, the investigators examine the influence of working memory capacity and thought suppression on the occurrence of unpleasant memories of a negative experience. Hypothesis: People with high working memory capacities (HWMC) are able to successfully suppress memories of an unpleasant experience (presentation of a distressing movie). In contrast, in people with low working memory capacities (LWMC), attempts to suppress memories of an unpleasant experience inadvertently lead to an increase of these memories. Study phase one: Assessment of working memory capacity in 200 healthy participants by means of a computerized task. Selection of 50 participants with HWMC and of 50 participants with LWMC who participate in study phase two. Study phase two: Presentation of a distressing movie and subsequent assessment of memories of the movie during several days in the daily life of participants. Comparison of 4 groups regarding the frequency of instructions in daily life:(group 1: HWMC participants who are instructed to suppress thoughts of the movie, group 2: LWMC participants who are instructed to suppress thoughts of the movie, group 3: HWMC participants who are instructed to allow the occurence of thoughts of the movie, group 4: LWMC participants who are instructed to allow the occurence of thoughts of the movie)</brief_summary>
