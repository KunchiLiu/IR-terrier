	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to evaluate whether use of TRMDU in addition to medication review leads to improved outcomes and reduced health care costs for patients when compared with medication review alone. The study will be conducted in patients assigned to Department of Defense (DOD) Warrior Transition Units (WTU's), similar DOD units, and VA polytrauma centers.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Telepharmacy Robotic Medicine Delivery Unit "TRMDU" Assessment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The military has been witnessing an increased number of patients with combat related impairments such as traumatic brain injury, post traumatic stress disorder and polytrauma which has lead to sub optimal medication self management. TRMDU is a medical device developed by INRange Systems Inc. that delivers medications and emits a sound alert to assist the patient. It can be used in a hospital, clinic, or residential setting. It can be remotely accessed by the health care professionals, and it allows physicians and other prescribers to remotely change scheduling or adjust prescriptions. Use of TRMDU in hospital settings is expected to improve outcomes by improving medication self management, increasing adherence, reducing medication errors, and thereby associated costs. Further, it may contribute to overall improvement in a patient's psychological well-being and quality of life.</detailed_description>
