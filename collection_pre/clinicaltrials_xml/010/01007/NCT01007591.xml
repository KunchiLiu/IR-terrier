	<criteria>Clinical diagnosis of psoriasis vulgaris involving the face Clinical signs of psoriasis vulgaris on the trunk and/or on the limbs, or earlier diagnosed with psoriasis vulgaris on the trunk and/or limbs. The extent and severity of psoriasis vulgaris on trunk and/or limbs should be amenable to topical therapy with any of the allowed medications An extent of psoriatic involvement of the face of at least 5 cm2 (the sum of all facial lesions) Treatment areas (the face and the intertriginous areas) amenable to topical treatment with a maximum of 30 g (6 to 11 years) or 45 g (12 to 17 years) of ointment per week Disease severity graded as mild, moderate or severe according to the investigator's global assessment of disease severity of the face Aged 6 to 17 years Systemic treatment with therapies other than biologicals with a potential effect on psoriasis vulgaris within the 4week period prior to randomisation Systemic treatment with biological therapies (marketed or not marketed) with a possible effect on psoriasis vulgaris within 4 weeks (etanercept), 2 months (adalimumab, alefacept, infliximab), 4 months (ustekinumab) or 4 weeks/5 halflives (whichever is longer) for experimental biological products prior to randomisation PUVA therapy or Grenz ray therapy within the 4week period prior to randomisation UVB therapy within the 2week period prior to randomisation Topical treatment of psoriasis vulgaris lesions on the face or on the intertriginous areas within the 2week period prior to randomisation Topical treatment with very potent WHO group IV corticosteroids within the 2week period prior to randomisation Initiation of or expected changes to concomitant medication that may affect psoriasis vulgaris (e.g., beta blockers, antimalaria drugs, lithium and ACE inhibitors) during the treatment phase of the study Current diagnosis of erythrodermic, exfoliative or pustular psoriasis</criteria>
