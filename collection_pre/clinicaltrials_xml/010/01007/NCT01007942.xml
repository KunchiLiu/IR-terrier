	<brief_summary>This phase III, double-blind, placebo-controlled multinational study will assess the combination everolimus, vinorelbine, and trastuzumab compared to the combination vinorelbine and trastuzumab with respect to progressive-free survival and over survival in HER2/neu positive women with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer who are resistant to trastuzumab and have been pre-treated with a taxane.</brief_summary>
