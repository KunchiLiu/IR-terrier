	<brief_summary>Life-style intervention with dietetic and exercise therapy is an important fundamental approach to patients with metabolic syndrome (MetSyd) which may cause endothelial dysfunction leading to cardiovascular events. We investigated whether the life-style modification by dietetic and exercise instruction could improve endothelial dysfunction assessed by a new non-invasive and automatic device; digital reactive hyperemia peripheral arterial tonometry (RH-PAT).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Outline of methods RH-PAT was measured in high-risk patients under 70 years old. The MetSyd was defined according to guidelines of the National Cholesterol Education Program Third Adult Treatment Panel (NCEP - ATP III). We instructed all MetSyd patients about the dietetic and exercise therapy according to the Japan Atherosclerosis Society Guidelines for Prevention of Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Diseases. we conducted a questionnaire survey of the self-assessment for dietetic and exercise instruction program, respectively.</detailed_description>
