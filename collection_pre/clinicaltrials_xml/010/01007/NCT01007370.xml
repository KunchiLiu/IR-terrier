	<brief_summary>The investigators aim to compare two different types of supraglottic devices for tracheal intubation in patients undergoing elective surgery under general anesthesia. Our hypothesis is that the use of the I-gel supraglottic airway will result in a higher first attempt success rate of blind tracheal intubation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of LMA-Fastrach and I-gel for Blind Tracheal Intubation.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Supraglottic airway devices such as LMA-Fastrach and I-gel provide patent airways during general anesthesia. The LMA-Fastrach is designed to provide a conduit for blind or fiberoptically guided tracheal intubations. However, the success rate of tracheal intubation on the first attempt through this device varies between 50 and 87%. The I-gel is a newer device for airway management which, with its wide bore, allows direct passage of a tracheal tube. Recent studies suggest that the I-gel is easy to insert and that limited experience is needed before a high success insertion rate is obtained. In this prospective and randomized study, we will evaluate the performance of both devices for tracheal intubation in patients undergoing elective surgery under general anesthesia.</detailed_description>
