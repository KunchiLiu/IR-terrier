	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to determine if cytidine 5'diphosphocholine (CDP-choline, a naturally occurring chemical in your body) has efficacy in reducing the methamphetamine craving of the subjects with methamphetamine dependence craving and helping them maintain the abstinence. In addition, investigators will measure the brain N-acetyl aspartate (a biologic marker for neuronal viability) level of participants to determine if brain deficits induced by methamphetamine may recover by taking CDP-choline.</brief_summary>
