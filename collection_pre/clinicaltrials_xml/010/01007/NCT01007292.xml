	<brief_title>A Study of YM155 Plus Rituximab in Subjects With Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma Who Have Received Prior Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an outpatient study. All subjects enrolled in this study will receive YM155 and rituximab given during 14 day cycles. Each subject will be assessed at the end of each cycle to determine if he or she may continue to the next cycle. Each subject will be eligible to continue receiving the combination regimen in this study until one of the discontinuation criteria is met. If a subject discontinues treatment without progressive disease (PD) that subject will complete follow-up visits every 12 weeks for 1 year or until initiating another systemic anti-lymphoma treatment, exhibiting PD, or death. Each subject will be contacted by the study site every 12 weeks for survival following the End of Treatment Visit. The contacts will continue until death or for no more than 1 year.</detailed_description>
