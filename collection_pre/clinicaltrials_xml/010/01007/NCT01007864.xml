	<brief_summary>The purpose of this clinical trial is to investigate the effects of the non-ergot dopamine agonist piribedil on vigilance and cognitive performances in patients with Parkinson's disease in comparison with other oral non-ergot dopamine agonists. It should be tested whether piribedil is superior to continued pramipexole or ropinirole treatment regarding improvement of reduced vigilance and cognitive performance in patients with Parkinson's disease.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Influence of Piribedil (Clarium®) on Vigilance and Cognitive Function in Patients With Parkinson's Disease Compared to Other Non-Ergot Dopamine Agonists</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Treatment of motor symptoms associated with PD by non-ergot dopamine agonists has been proven to be effective, both as monotherapy and in combination with levodopa. Non-motor symptoms like cognitive or sleep-related disorders and disturbed vigilance, however, are common in PD and can significantly worsen health and quality of life of the patient and family members. Some of these non-motor symptoms may also be caused by the antiparkinsonian medication per se. The Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products (CPMP) initiated a review of dopamine agonists in relation to episodes of sudden onset of sleep already in 2000 which resulted in special warnings of somnolence and sudden sleep attacks in the non-ergot dopamine agonists' summary of product characteristics. Beneficial effects of piribedil on parameters of vigilance and cognition have been described in several studies. But, as it seems, no study has been performed so far to identify such effects in the setting of a comparative study with different oral non-ergot dopamine agonists in patients with PD, and utilizing vigilance and cognitive parameters as primary and main secondary objective. The neuropsychological tests being applied in this study are validated and routinely used tests in studies investigating different aspects of attention or vigilance and cognition.</detailed_description>
