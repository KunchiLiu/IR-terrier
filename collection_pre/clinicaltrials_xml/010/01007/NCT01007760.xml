	<brief_title>Dose-dependent Effects of Second-hand Smoke on Vascular Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Second-hand smoke remains a significant public health threat. Despite evidence to suggest that secondhand smoke contributes to adverse cardiovascular outcomes, little is known about the dose-dependent vascular effects of brief secondhand smoke exposure at low doses commonly encountered in the community. This study will investigate the acute vascular effects and dose-dependent biological mechanisms of secondhand smoke on endothelial function and oxidative stress.</detailed_description>
