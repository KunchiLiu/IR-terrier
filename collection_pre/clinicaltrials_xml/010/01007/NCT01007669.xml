	<brief_title>Effects of Specified Work Site Physical Activity Intervention Among Employees With Physical Heavy Work</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Studies regarding company adjusted intervention have shown positive effects regarding work related neck and shoulder symptoms among workers with monotonous repetitive work.

The aim of this randomized controlled intervention project is 1. Through Health check to outline the extent musculoskeletal disability in workers with heavy work load in relation to physical and metabolic fitness. Includes is also assessment of physical general activity and working conditions. 2. To evaluate the effect of individual adjusted exercise programs on muscle strength, aerobic capacity, musculoskeletal disability, pain, work ability and sick absenteeism</detailed_description>
