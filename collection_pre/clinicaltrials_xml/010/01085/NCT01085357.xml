	<brief_title>Study of an Implantable Device for Lowering Intraocular Pressure in Glaucoma Patients Undergoing Cataract Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a modified and expanded protocol based on acceptable safety results from an earlier feasibility study. The trial is conducted using a 3:1 randomization (treatment to control) in which patients are screened for eligibility, randomized at time of surgery and followed for 24 months postoperatively.</detailed_description>
