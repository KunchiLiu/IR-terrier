	<brief_summary>Simvastatin has been reported to promote osteoblastic activity and inhibit osteoclastic activity by enhancing the expression of BMP2. There have been many studies demonstrating the bone-promoting effect of local application various animal models including after application into socket of teeth in a rat. the purpose of the study is to investigate the effect of slow release topical simvastatin in socket of mandibular teeth on bone remodeling in the socket</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Of Simvastatin On Bone Remodeling In Socket Of Mandibular Teeth</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>after extraction of mandibular single root teeth 10 mg of slow release simvastatin would be inserted to the socket. observation will be at 1 week, 4 weeks and 3 months.after 3 months the patients will have dental CT as done routinely in our clinic before placing dental implants and the bone density and height will be measured on this data. during the procedure of inserting a dental implant a trephine will be taken for histology.</detailed_description>
