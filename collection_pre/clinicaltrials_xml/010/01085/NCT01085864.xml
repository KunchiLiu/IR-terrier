	<brief_summary>A need exists for non-invasive testing to aid in clinical decision-making for Computerized Tomography (CT) scan detected lung nodules of indeterminate etiology. The investigators hypothesize that biomarkers detectable in blood, sputum or urine may be useful for guiding clinical decisions in the setting of CT detected lung nodules to determine which nodules are malignant and which are benign. The investigators also hypothesize that these biomarkers will decrease in concentration to the normal range after successful surgical treatment of malignant lung nodules.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Biomarkers for Diagnosis of Lung Nodules</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Biomarkers for Diagnosis of Lung Nodules Study is a prospective study of a cohort of 500 individuals with lung nodules of indeterminate etiology that are identified by CT scans. Either biopsy or repeat CT scans must be clinically indicated to determine the etiology of the nodule. Patients will be asked to allow investigators access to CT scan images and spirometry data, and provide blood, sputum, urine, and exhaled breath samples over the course of the study. Patients will also be asked to allow investigators to access pathology records if a biopsy or surgical excision of the nodule is clinically indicated.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Adult 1885 years of age 2. Patients referred to pulmonologists, oncologists, or thoracic surgeons for the evaluation of peripheral lung nodules found on CT scan. 3. Repeat CT scans, biopsy or surgical excision are clinically indicated to determine the etiology of the nodule. 4. One or more lung nodules must be between 8 mm and 30 mm in the greatest diameter. 5. Patients must be fully informed of the investigational nature of the procedure and sign an informed consent. 1. Lung nodules or masses greater than 30 mm in the greatest dimention. 2. Lung nodules that have solid calification. 3. Lung nodules or masses with CT evidence of partial or complete obstruciton of a lobar bronshus, mainstem bronchus or the trachea. 4. No prior cancer with the exception of nonmelanoma skin cancer. 5. Life expectany of &lt; 6 months 6. Any indifidual who does not give oral and written consent for participation</criteria>
