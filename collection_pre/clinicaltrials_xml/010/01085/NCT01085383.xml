	<brief_summary>Antipsychotic medicines are used routinely in people with severe mental illness or learning disability. Antipsychotics often induce hyperprolactinemia (high prolactin level) and in almost all women, and some men, this causes hypogonadism (impaired ovarian or testicular function)often with osteoporosis, partly explaining psychiatric patients' high fracture risk. Reducing prolactin by changing antipsychotic or adding a dopamine agonist often worsens psychosis. Adding aripiprazole to current antipsychotic normalizes prolactin in adult schizophrenic patients, without serious side effects. We thus plan a study of add-on aripiprazole in people with antipsychotic induced hyperprolactinemia. Our main hypothesis is that aripiprazole will normalize or reduce prolactin sufficiently to restore normal ovarian and testicular function. Our secondary hypothesis is that restoration of normal ovarian and testicular function will improve bone mineral density in patients in whom this was reduced at the time of entry into the study.</brief_summary>
