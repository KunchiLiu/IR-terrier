	<brief_summary>The incidence of skin and soft tissue infections has increased dramatically over the last decade, in part due to increased prevalence of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA). Incision and drainage (I&amp;D) is considered the primary intervention, however some clinicians prefer ultrasound guided needle aspiration (US Asp). The investigators performed a randomized trial comparing US Asp to I&amp;D for uncomplicated skin and soft tissue abscesses, with a subgroup analysis of patients with CA-MRSA.</brief_summary>
