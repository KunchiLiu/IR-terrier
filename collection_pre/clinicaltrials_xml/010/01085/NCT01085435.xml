	<brief_summary>The EFFORTLESS ICD Registry is an observational, standard of care evaluation designed to demonstrate the early, mid and long-term clinical effectiveness the Cameron Health S-ICD System. In addition, analysis of resource utilization and costs will be performed to document treatment costs for periods defined by Registry endpoints. Protocol DN 15627 (Aug 06, 2010) restricts enrolment to patients over 18 years of age while protocol amendment DN 15677 (Aug 30, 2010) allows all patients to be included.

	<detailed_description>EFFORTLESS is an observational, post market, standard of care, Registry to be conducted at approximately 50 centers worldwide in patients requiring an ICD for the treatment of ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Patients included in the registry will have been implanted with the S-ICD system since its CE mark(commercial regulatory approval) and will be followed for up to 60 months. The patients' perception of their therapy will be evaluated using Quality of Life assessments and the Registry will include an exploratory analysis of resource utilization and costs based on measures of clinical outcome such as complication rates, unscheduled hospitalizations and length of stay. The objective will be to enable comparison of costs of the S-ICD system versus a standard transvenous system.</detailed_description>
