	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if blood flow to the clitoris is increased by topically applying a cream that causes increased blood flow. This will be measured with a sonogram.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessing the Effects of a Topically Applied Cream to Clitoral Blood Flow</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>On the first office visit the patient will have their baseline clitoral and uterine blood flow measured quantitatively by the same sonographer using the General electric Voluson 700 unit. Clitoral blood flow will be accessed utilizing the 12 megahertz linear probe. With light pressure, the probe will be applied sagittally and proximal to the clitoral hood with an angle less than 20 degrees. Peak clitoral artery systolic and end diastolic velocity will be measured and resistive index values will be recorded. Then utilizing the 7.5 megahertz vaginal probe baseline uterine artery flow measurements will also be obtained and recorded. The patient will then be placed in an exam room and the same nurse practitioner will apply the GRAS cream or the placebo to the patients' clitoral hood with minimal manipulation. Ten minutes later the sonographer will repeat the two scans and record the same measurements as before. The patient will then come back another day to repeat the above process. Patients will be coded to assure that which ever cream they received the first visit they will get the opposite the second time. The creams will be blinded to the nurse practitioner, the patient, the sonographer, and the principle investigator. GRAS cream is arginine 20%, nicotinamide .01%, niacin.1%, in LipodermPG 50%,</detailed_description>
