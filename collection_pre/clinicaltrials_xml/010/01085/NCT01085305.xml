	<brief_title>The Effectiveness of Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Behaviour problems, i.e. symptoms of oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) and conduct disorder (CD) are among the prevalent psychiatric disorders in children and one of the leading causes of help-seeking for mental health problems in children. There are several efficacious treatments for such problems in young children. However, most of these require that parents meet in groups. This is not always feasible. It is therefore a need to develop treatments that can deal with parents and families individually. Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT) is such an individually based treatment. Efficacy studies indicate symptom reduction greater that in treatment as usual (TAU). However, there is a need to study its effectiveness in ordinary clinical practise. This trial will study its effect in ordinary psychiatric clinics in the middle of Norway and compare it to the regular treatment (TAU) provided to young children with behavior problems in these clinics.</detailed_description>
