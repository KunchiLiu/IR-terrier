	<brief_summary>This study is designed to collect information about melanoma using a research probe, a device placed only on the skin. This study will investigate whether using the probe to examine skin lesions could improve the accuracy of identification pre-cancerous melanoma lesions or to predict the risk melanoma in the skin of subjects. Ultimately, we would see this technique used routinely as a non-invasive device during subjects' skin examination to aid dermatologists to identify pre-cancerous (melanoma) lesions without taking tissue samples of the skin. Alternatively, this technique would, in the future, also be used to screen patients at risk for melanoma.</brief_summary>
