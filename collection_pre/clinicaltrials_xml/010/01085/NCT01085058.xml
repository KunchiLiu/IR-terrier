	<brief_summary>This investigator initiated trial was a prospective, open, single-arm, diagnostic-prognostic study. Patients who received high-dose therapy with autologous stem cell transplantation for the treatment of their lymphoproliferative disease were included into the study. After completion of the high-dose therapy (day -2 with respect to the stem cell transplantation) the first blood sample A for the cytocapacity test with determination of leukocytes and neutrophils was taken in the evening of day -1. Directly thereafter the study medication was administered. The second blood sample B for the cytocapacity test with determination of leukocytes and neutrophils was taken in the morning of day 0, 12-14 hours after administration of the study medication. Thereafter the stem cell re-infusion was performed. The primary objective of this study was to show that the cytocapacity test with lenograstim is a useful predictive tool with respect to the risk of post-transplant complications and prolonged myelosuppression, typically occurring after high-dose chemotherapy. The primary variables were: - the rate of patients with documented infections - the time to platelet engraftment</brief_summary>
