	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Pemetrexed disodium may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying how well pemetrexed disodium or observation works in treating patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma without progressive disease after first-line chemotherapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pemetrexed Disodium/Observation in Treating Patients W/ Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma w/Out Progressive Disease After 1st Line Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To determine if maintenance therapy with pemetrexed disodium versus observation improves progression-free survival of patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma who have at least stable disease after completion of first-line therapy comprising pemetrexed disodium with cisplatin or carboplatin. Secondary - To determine the overall survival of patients treated with this regimen versus observation. - To evaluate the frequency of responses in patients treated with this regimen. - To assess the toxicity of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to first-line chemotherapy regimen (cisplatin/pemetrexed disodium vs carboplatin/pemetrexed disodium), histologic subtype (epithelioid vs other) and number of courses received (&lt; 6 vs 6). - Arm I: Patients receive pemetrexed disodium IV over 10 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. - Arm II: Patients undergo observation until disease progression. After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up every 6 months for 3 years.</detailed_description>
