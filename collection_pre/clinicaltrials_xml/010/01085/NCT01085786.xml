	<brief_summary>Primary: To evaluate efficacy of 14 day 2-phase sequential therapy given in two forms. One in which the first component consists of a proton pump inhibitor and amoxicillin given for 7 days followed by the PPI, clarithromycin and metronidazole for 7 days. The alternate will be similar with the exception that the amoxicillin will be continued throughout the 14 days. The secondary endpoint is to evaluate the effectiveness of therapy in relation to antibiotic resistance.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to test whether the 14-day sequential therapy ( esomeprazole plus amoxicillin dual therapy for 7 days followed by triple therapy with esomeprazole, clarithromycin, and metronidazole for 7 days) or 14-day hybird therapy (esomeprazole plus amoxicillin dual therapy for 7 days followed by quadruple therapy with esomeprazole, amoxicillin, clarithromycin, and metronidazole for 7 days) can achieve an eradication rate equal to or more than 95%. A total of 240 subjects will be asked to participate in this study. H. pylori-infected patients are randomized to either a 14-day sequential therapy (esomeprazole 40 mg and amoxicillin 1 g twice daily for 7 days followed by esomeprazole 40 mg, clarithromycin 500 mg and metronidazole 500 mg twice daily for 7 days) or a hybrid therapy (esomeprazole 40 mg and amoxicillin 1 g twice daily for 7 days followed by esomeprazole 40 mg, amoxicillin 1 g, clarithromycin 500 mg and metronidazole 500 mg twice daily for 7 days). Eradication efficacy is assessed by a follow-up endoscopy with rapid urease test and histological examination eight weeks after the end of anti-H. pylori therapy. The eradication rates of the two study groups will be compared. A successful regimen is defined as a regimen achieving an eradication rate equal to or more than 95%.</detailed_description>
