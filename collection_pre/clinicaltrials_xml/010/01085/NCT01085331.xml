	<brief_summary>The research trial is testing the experimental treatment pimasertib (MSC1936369B) in combination with FOLFIRI, as second-line treatment in metastatic K Ras mutated colorectal cancer subjects. The study will be run in two parts: Part 1, or Safety Run-in Part: Will determine the maximum tolerated dose and the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of pimasertib combined with FOLFIRI as second-line treatment in subjects with metastatic K Ras mutated colorectal cancer. Part 2 or Phase 2 Randomised Part: Will assess the anti-tumor activity of pimasertib combined with FOLFIRI compared to FOLFIRI with placebo as second-line treatment in metastatic K Ras mutated colorectal cancer subjects. Phase I which Is an open label dose escalation "3+3" cohort, non-randomized, safety Phase II which is a double blind randomized safety/efficacy</brief_summary>
