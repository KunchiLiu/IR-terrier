	<brief_title>Longitudinal Study of Asymptomatic Rotator Cuff Tears</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fifty subjects with an asymptomatic rotator cuff tear were identified in an earlier study. Clinical, sonographic and MRI reexamination of these subjects is performed after an interval of three years. Findings of interest include: (1) the symptomatic status of the subjects (still asymptomatic or symptomatic); (2)tear size on sonography and MRI (unchanged or increased); (3)degree of muscle atrophy on MRI (unchanged or deteriorated); (4)degree of fatty muscle degeneration on MRI (unchanged or deteriorated). We want to analyze whether a change in these tear characteristics is associated with a change of the symptomatic status of these subjects.</detailed_description>
