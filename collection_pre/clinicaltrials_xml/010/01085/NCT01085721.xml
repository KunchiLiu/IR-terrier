	<brief_summary>Patients with allergic rhinitis frequently present exacerbation of the atopic symptoms during viral infections of the upper respiratory tract. Also, allergic rhinitis makes the mucosa more reactive to infectious agents and potentiates mucus production. The combination of dexchlorpheniramine, pseudoephedrine and guaifenesin elicits antihistaminic, decongestant and expectorant effects. The study hypothesizes is that this product is superior to dexchlorpheniramine alone in the relief of allergic symptoms and in promoting mucus elimination in atopic patients with viral infections of the upper respiratory tract.</brief_summary>
