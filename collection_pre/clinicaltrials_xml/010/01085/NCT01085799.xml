	<brief_summary>To efficiently control soil-transmitted helminths (Ascaris, Trichuris, and hookworm), WHO, PAHO, and others recommend the inclusion of an education strategy in school-based deworming programs. However, the effectiveness of such a strategy on the rate of STH re-infection and on education indicators, such as absenteeism, remains to be fully understood. The proposed research aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a post-deworming education intervention targeted to Grade 5 school children enrolled in Belén's schools using a cluster-randomized trial design. Results will be used to inform school-based deworming programs in Peru and other similar endemic areas in Latin America and, indeed, around the world.</brief_summary>
