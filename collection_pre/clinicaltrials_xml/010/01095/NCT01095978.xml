	<brief_title>Evaluation of the Treatment With Klacid SR in Patients With Acute Tracheitis, Tracheobronchitis and Bronchitis, Acute Exacerbation of Chronic Bronchitis and Mild Community-acquired Pneumonia in Common Clinical Practice in Ukraine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The postmarketing observational study is observational in nature. Its follow-up is not interventional and is left to the judgment of each physician during the observational period, which defines the survey for each patient. Follow-up of patients should enable two patient visits during this period. The screening/inclusion visit (Visit 1) will be performed when the decision for Klacid SR therapy in a daily dose of 1000 mg is made. The second visit of the patient will occur 10 - 16 days from the screening/inclusion Visit (upon physician's decision). The physician can change the numbers and time of the visits. As a result, failure to meet these suggested dates will not constitute a breach of the protocol.</detailed_description>
