	<brief_title>Post-preeclampsia Renal Project: Study of Nephroprotection in Women Having Suffered Preeclampsia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Several epidemiological studies suggest that the risk of death from cardiovascular causes among women with preeclampsia may be increased, and that preeclampsia contrary to what has been long thought, is not cured with delivery. Preeclampsia has long been considered a 2-stage disease, stage one corresponding to an impaired placental perfusion resulting from abnormal spiral artery remodeling, and stage two corresponding to the maternal manifestations of disease, characterized by hypertension and proteinuria. However, preeclampsia might include an additional, 3rd stage, that of the post-partum period (Gammill &amp; Roberts, 2007) This phase deserves to be investigated. In particular, it is crucial to determine whether the changes that occur in renal hemodynamics during preeclampsia are reversible after more than 6 weeks, and whether PEC women are salt-sensitive after delivery. The link between chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular mortality is well established. An independent, graded association exists between a reduced GFR and the risk of death, cardiovascular events, and hospitalization (Go et al, 2004). Besides, salt-sensitivity is associated with an increased cardiovascular and renal risk (Franco &amp; Oparil, 2006). The Renal Post PEC study aims at establishing if the renal dysfunctions that occur in PEC women can be reversed by the administration of inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system that are known to improve cardiovascular and renal risk profiles in hypertensive patients. By virtue of their potent renal vasodilatory properties and favourable remodelling of the GBM, ACE inhibitors may improve salt-sensitivity, endothelial function, renal plasma flow and GFR, and general renal prognosis in women who experienced from preeclampsia.</detailed_description>
