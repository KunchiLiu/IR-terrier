	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Ritonavir and lopinavir may stop the growth of gliomas by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving ritonavir together with lopinavir works in treating patients with progressive or recurrent high-grade glioma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ritonavir and Lopinavir in Treating Patients With Progressive or Recurrent High-Grade Glioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the 6-month progression-free survival in patients with recurrent or progressive high grade gliomas treated with ritonavir and lopinavir. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the toxicity of ritonavir and lopinavir in this patient population. OUTLINE: Patients receive oral ritonavir and lopinavir twice daily in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically.</detailed_description>
