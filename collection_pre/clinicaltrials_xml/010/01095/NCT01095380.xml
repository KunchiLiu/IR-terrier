	<brief_summary>Background: Body weight supported (BWS) locomotor training improves overground walking ability in individuals with motor-incomplete spinal cord injury (SCI). While there are various approaches available for locomotor training, there is no consensus regarding which of these is optimal. The purpose of this ongoing investigation is to compare outcomes associated with these different training approaches. Subjects and Methods: Subjects with chronic motor-incomplete SCI have completed training and initial and final testing. Subjects were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 different BWS assisted-stepping groups, including: 1) treadmill training with manual assistance (TM), 2) treadmill training with stimulation (TS), 3) overground training with stimulation (OG), or 4) treadmill training with robotic assistance (LR). Prior to and following participation the investigators assessed: - Walking-related outcome measures: overground walking speed, training speed, step length and step symmetry. - Spinal cord reflex activity - Electromyographic (EMG) associated with walking Hypotheses: In individuals with incomplete spinal cord injury (SCI): 1. A 12-week period of body weight supported treadmill training with TS will produce improvements in walking function that are significantly greater than those produced by training with TM, OG, LR. 2. TS training will be associated with greater changes to spinal reflex activity than will be observed in subjects trained with manual assistance or non-assisted stepping. Changes to spinal reflex activation will be such that this activity more closely resembles that observed in non-disabled (ND) individuals. 3. Following participation in this walking regimen, EMG activity observed during walking in all groups will be more robust, more consistent and better coordinated than EMG measures obtained prior to training.</brief_summary>
