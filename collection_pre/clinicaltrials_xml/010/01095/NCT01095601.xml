	<brief_summary>This study will assess the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of avanafil (Formulation II); determine the relative bioavailability of two avanafil tablet formulations (Formulation I versus Formulation II) and will investigate the dose-proportionality of Formulation II avanafil tablet.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assess the Effect of Food on Avanafil Pharmacokinetic (PK), to Compare 2 Oral Formulations of Avanafil,and Investigate Dose Proportionality in Healthy Male Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this Phase I, single-centre, open-label, randomized, four-period crossover study, each eligible subject will be randomized to receive the 4 treatments in a 4-way crossover fashion. The 4 treatments are as follows: - Treatment A: 2x100 mg Formulation II avanafil tablet, fasted - Treatment B: 2x100 mg Formulation II avanafil tablet, fed - Treatment C: 2x100 mg Formulation I avanafil tablet, fasted - Treatment D: 1x50 mg Formulation II avanafil tablet, fasted Subjects will report to the study site on the evening before each treatment and will remain at the site until the 24-hour PK sample has been drawn. A single oral dose of avanafil tablets will be administered with 240 mL of water. A washout period of at least 5 days will occur between the treatments. Subjects in treatment groups A, C and D will fast at least 10 hours prior to and for at least 4 hours following dosing. Subjects in treatment group B will eat a standardized high fat breakfast 30 prior to dosing. Standard meals will be provided uniformly to all subjects at approximately 4 and 9 hours after dosing, and an evening snack will be provided approximately 12 - 13 hours after dosing. Blood samples for the determination of plasma avanafil and its metabolite concentrations will be obtained from each subject at 0 (30 minutes pre-dose), 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.25, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12, 18 and 24 hours post-dose in each treatment period. Adverse events; laboratory evaluations; color vision testing (Treatment A only), electrocardiogram and physical examination, vital signs will be assessed at various times during the study.</detailed_description>
