	<brief_summary>Women sexual hormones (i.e. estrogen) are involved in the regulation of substrate utilization and storage. Being under oral contraception (OC) may conduct to metabolic and hormonal modifications, but results are confused regarding the impact on substrate utilization. In the present study, the aim is then to explore the effect of hormonal status on substrate utilization during sous-maximal exercise, comparing women with and without OC. We hypothesised that women under OC have a lower Respiratory Exchange Ratio (RER) at exercise than women without contraception underlying a greater reliance on fat oxidation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Substrate Utilization and Hormonal Status in Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>24 healthy young women (12 with OC and 12 without any contraception) will complete a maximal test on an ergometer cycle to obtain their maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max).Their body composition will be assessed by DXA. They will be asked to complete 3 experimental sessions. During a first session the volunteers will remain inactive, and only a breakfast will be offered. During the second session, a breakfast will be offered and they will have to complete a sub-maximal exercise set at 60% of their VO2max 3 hours after breakfast. And the third session will consist in the realisation of exercise on fast state. Those three sessions will be realized in a randomized order. Several blood (catheter) and salivary samples will be collected during the three sessions, throughout the experimental day.</detailed_description>
