	<brief_summary>Hypothesis: - That B cell depletion, rather than reducing acute rejection, will allow minimisation of immunosuppression, which may lead to better graft survival. Aim: - To assess whether the addition of rituximab to a low-dose tacrolimus immunosuppression regime allows a reduction in steroid administration. Objectives: - To assess whether B cell depletion affects graft function, acute rejection and complication rates - To assess whether the T cell response to allotransplantation is impaired by B cell depletion.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Adult patients over 18 years receiving their first living donor renal transplant, or their second if the first was not lost from acute rejection Patients who have given written informed consent Women of child bearing potential taking adequate contraception. Previous other organ transplants lost through acute rejection Patients undergoing antibody incompatible transplantation Patients with other organ transplants Patients previously treated with cyclophosphamide, ATG, OKT3 or rituximab Patients with white cell count below 4.0x10^9/L. Patients with platelet count below 100x10^9/L Patients who are treated with drugs that are strong inhibitors or inducers of cytochrome P450, or treated with terfenadine, astemizole, cisapride or lovastatin Patients who have been involved in any other investigational trial or non protocol immunosuppressive regimen in the previous 90 days prior to transplant Pregnant or breastfeeding women Patients with a documented history of malignancy and its origins and treatment in the last five years. (Localised basal cell carcinoma of the skin is permitted) Patients known to be HIV, Hepatitis B surface antigen or Hepatitis C antibody positive Patients who in the opinion of the Investigator would not be a suitable candidate for study participation Women of child bearing potential not willing to take adequate contraception</criteria>
