	<detailed_description>The objective of the study which we wish to lead consists in looking for, at the patients SII and IBD in forgiveness, the existence of a correlation between the rate of cortisol(Hormone of the stress) and the level of HRV (Heart Rate Variability) to estimate the inhibitive fronto-amygdalien tonus. So we make the hypothesis that the persons affected by digestive pathologies of type SII or IBD would present an emotional and physiological vulnerability more important than unhurt subjects of pathologies.</detailed_description>
