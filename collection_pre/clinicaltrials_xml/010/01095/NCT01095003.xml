	<brief_summary>The increasing use of anthracyclines and taxanes in the adjuvant, neoadjuvant and first-line metastatic settings, led to a raise of patients presenting with metastatic breast cancer after treatment with these agents. Options for the treatment of patients who have progressed after an anthracycline and a taxane are limited. The high level of in-vitro synergy of vinflunine combined with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) together with the good tolerance and the encouraging response rate observed while combining IV vinflunine to oral capecitabine make it a promising combination to investigate further in a phase III trial. This phase III trial will evaluate the effectiveness and the safety profile of such combination for the treatment of patient with advanced breast cancer previously treated with or resistant to anthracycline and taxane resistant.</brief_summary>
