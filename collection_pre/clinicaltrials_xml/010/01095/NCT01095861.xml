	<brief_title>Comparison of Parker Flex-Tip Endotracheal Tube to Standard Endotracheal Tube</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The post-operative complication of a sore throat after endotracheal intubation is unfortunately common, with estimates ranging from 15-50%. Most estimates are in the order of 35-45%.(McHardy 1999, Higgins 2002) There is evidence that many patients do not report sore throat and/or vocal changes unless directly asked because surgical pain is more prominent and many patients may be unaware that intubation completed as part of the general anesthetic. (Harding 1987) The Parker FlexTipÂ® endotracheal tube (ETT) is formulated with a softer plastic at the distal tip as well as a laterally curved profile to reduce trauma during ETT advancement. (Makino 2003) This ETT has been shown to be faster during fibreoptic intubation, but complication of sore throat was not examined. (Kristensen 2003) Our previous study (Jones 2007) demonstrated that modification of anesthetic techniques could reduce the incidence of post-operative sore throat in patients undergoing naso-tracheal intubation. We will now study the Parker Flex-Tip ETT to see if its use can also reduce the incidence of sore throat in patients undergoing oro-tracheal intubation.</detailed_description>
