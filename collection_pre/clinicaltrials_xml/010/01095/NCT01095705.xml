	<brief_title>Hypnosis for Transesophageal Echocardiography</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>TEE is a widely used diagnostic test in cardiovascular medicine. However, the test may be a source of discomfort to the patient. Patient intolerance of the echocardiography probe limits the duration of the procedure and therefore its diagnostic success. Current strategies to reduce patient discomfort involve global anesthesia, which carries its own side effects and risks of adverse events. Hypnosis may reduce patient discomfort without impairing alertness. The main goal of this study is to determine the additive value of hypnosis to improve patient comfort during TEE.</detailed_description>
