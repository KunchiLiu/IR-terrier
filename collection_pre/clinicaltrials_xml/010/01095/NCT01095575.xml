	<brief_summary>Background and Objectives: Neuraxial administration of morphine is an effective way of controlling postoperative pain and reducing analgesic consumption. Several animal models have demonstrated that preemptive administration of neuraxial narcotics reduced pain while others revealed the induction of post-incisional hypersensitivity. There have been no consistent results in clinical setting either. This double blind, randomized study compared the effects of PRE- vs. POST-incisional administration of neuraxial morphine on postoperative pain perception and analgesic requirements over 48 hours following laparotomy for open colectomy under standardized general anesthesia. Methods: Twenty patients received epidural morphine (3 mg) pre-incision and saline after wound closure (MO1 group), and 20 patients received epidural saline before incision and morphine after wound closure (MO2 group). Postoperatively, all patients received boluses of morphine (1.5 mg) via intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (IV-PCA), and rescue doses of intramuscular diclofenac (75 mg) every 6 hours, as needed.</brief_summary>
