	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare outcome of high risk myelodysplasia patients aged from 50 to 70 years with or without HLA compatible (9 or 10 identities / 10) donor. High risk myelodysplasia includes IPSS intermediate 2 and high myelodysplasia and patients with sever thrombocytopenia. Patients are registered when they acquire risk factors.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>50 to 70 years For myelodysplasia other than CMML: patients can be included if they have at least one of these criteria: 1. IPSSintermediate 1 and poor cytogenetics (complex, 3 or 7 abnormality); 2. thrombopenia &lt; 20x10ex9/L: 3. IPSS intermediate 2 or high For CMML: patients can be included if they have at least one of these criteria: 1. 2 of these criteria: hyperleucocytosis &gt; 10x10exp9/L, splenomegaly&gt;18cm, hemoglobin &lt; 10gr/dl, platelet &lt; 100x10ex9/L 2. IPSS intermediate 2 or high Patient not eligible for transplantation (including patients without donor)because of severe comorbidity including: Renal failure with creatinine clearance &lt; 30ml/min Cirrhosis or hepatic failure Respiratory disease with vital capacity &lt; 30% Uncontrolled cardiac failure Uncontrolled neurological disease Poor performance status with karnofsky &lt; or = 60%</criteria>
