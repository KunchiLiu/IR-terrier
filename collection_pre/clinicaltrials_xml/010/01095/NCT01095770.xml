	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is 3 fold:- 1. To compare the efficacy and complication rates of 2 widely used methods, conventional irrigation tip ablation catheter (LASSO) and Ablation Frontiers ablation technology, of AF ablation for PAF. 2. To evaluate the Reveal XT ILR as a long term accurate AF monitoring device as compared to the 'gold standard' DDD pacemaker Holter. 3. To accurately evaluate, by continuous rhythm monitoring for 1 year, the efficacy of AF ablation therapy for PAF.</brief_summary>
