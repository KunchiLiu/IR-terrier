	<brief_summary>This is a multi-center, clinical pilot-study of ProEndoTecc Vascular Grafts (6, 7 or 8 mm Diameter) as superficial femoral artery bypass/interponate. The aim of this study is to demonstrate safety of implantation, patency and durability of a new type of vascular graft.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Female or male patient from 18 to 89 years of age Superficial femoral artery occlusion from 5 to 40 cm in length (above the knee joint), Patient must present with intermittent claudication, with resistance to medical therapy and exercise or critical ischemia, Patient has Rutherford grade 3, 4, or 5 occlusive vascular disease, Women of childbearing age must have negative pregnancy test prior to inclusion Bleeding diathesis Patient has known coagulation disorders including hypercoagulability Presence of one or several previously placed endoprosthesis or grafts in the diseased extremity (below iliacs) Other than 68 mm diameter graft is needed. Patients PAD state is in Fontaine Grade IV, Rutherford Grade 6 (Patient has active infection or pronounced necrosis in the region of graft placement) Patient has an acute embolic arterial occlusion Lifeexpectancy less than 6 month due to comorbidity or other situation that would make the patient an unlikely candidate for followup visits Patient had percutaneous transluminal angioplasty at the implant site within the previous 30 days Participation in another clinical study less than 30 days prior to inclusion Patient is in need of, or is scheduled for, a cardiac surgical procedure or a different vascular surgical procedure Pregnant or breast feeding female patients Multiple graft (implant) needed Patients unable to understand the full meaning of the informed consent Subjects who, in the opinion of the investigator, will be inappropriate for inclusion into this trial or will not comply with requirements of the study Subjects who are imprisoned (according to MPG ยง20.3) Patients who are lawfully kept in an institution Participation in this trial at an earlier stage Current participation in another clinical trial</criteria>
