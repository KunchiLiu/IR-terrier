	<brief_summary>Maternal hypotension is a common problem during cesarian section under spinal anesthesia. The possible explanation for this is combined aortocaval compression by gravid uterus in parturient in addition to reduced systemic vascular resistance by spinal anesthesia. The investigators evaluated if the incidence of hypotension would be decreased by delayed supine positioning, by maintaining lateral position for 6 min after spinal injection, in patients undergoing elective cesarean section.</brief_summary>
