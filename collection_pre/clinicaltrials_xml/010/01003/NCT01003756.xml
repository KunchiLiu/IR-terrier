	<brief_summary>This study is conducted in the Community Hospital in Svendborg (OUH Svendborg Sygehus) in collaboration with University of Southern Denmark and Odense University Hospital. The overall purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of preoperatively delivered neuromuscular exercise on self perceived physical function, pain and Quality of Life in patients undergoing total hip or knee replacement. Secondary area of interest is physical performance, muscle function, and level of physical activity. The project will be conducted in two phases: - A pilot project focusing on the logistics of the upcoming randomized controlled trial (RCT) and determination of test-retest reliability of specific muscle strength variables for the patients of interest - A randomized and controlled trial where the intervention is preoperative neuromuscular exercise and the controls receive standard instructions.</brief_summary>
