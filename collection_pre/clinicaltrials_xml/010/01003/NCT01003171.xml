	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetics of MCS in Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is an open-label, multiple-dose study, whose objective is to examine the pharmacokinetics of MCS and other components after once-daily oral dosing for 21 days. Subjects will undergo a 14-day washout phase and then enter the 21-day treatment phase. During the treatment phase, subjects will receive MCS, once-daily within one hour after the evening meal. After completion of the treatment phase, subjects will enter a post-treatment 42-day washout phase. Throughout each of these phases, blood samples will be collected and assayed for concentrations of MCS and other components. The duration of protocol participation is expected to be 77 days for each eligible subject who completes the study.</detailed_description>
