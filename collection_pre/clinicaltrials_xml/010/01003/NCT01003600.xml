	<brief_summary>We are doing this study to learn more about colon and rectal cancer survivors. We want to know if survivors want more information about life after cancer. Do cancer survivors want to know more about their own cancer? Do cancer survivors want to know about their treatment? Do cancer survivors want to know what health care they should get in the future? We want to know what information to give to cancer survivors when they finish treatment.</brief_summary>
