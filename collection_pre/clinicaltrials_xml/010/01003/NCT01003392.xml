	<detailed_description>Patients will have a wash-out period (21 days) with no coffee or other caffeine-drinks. Then they will be submitted to treadmill test, MAPA, Holter-ECG and vascular reactivity study, biochemical and inflammatory plasma dosages, as basal. Then they will start a period of coffee drinking over 4 weeks; and all exams will be repeated. We will study two types of coffee, arabica and robusta; with two types of toasted beans(regular and soft). Also regular and decaffeinated coffee.
