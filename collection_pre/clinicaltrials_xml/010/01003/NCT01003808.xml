	<brief_title>Safety Study of a Recombinant Protein Vaccine to Treat Esophageal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The prognosis of esophageal cancer is improved with the improvement of surgery, chemotherapy and radiation therapy. However, there are no standard therapies established for recurrent esophageal cancer. NY-ESO-1 antigen is expressed in 33% of patients. NY-ESO-1 protein is applicable without limitation by HLA types, and injected as a complex with cholesteryl pullulan (CHP), forming nano-particles (IMF-001), it can activate both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. In this phase 1 study, the safety and the biological recommended dose will be determined.</detailed_description>
