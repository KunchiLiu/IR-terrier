	<brief_title>Metabolic Effects of Paricalcitol</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Persons with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at markedly increased risk of death, particularly from cardiovascular disease (CVD). A number of metabolic abnormalities may contribute to adverse health outcomes in CKD, including glucose intolerance, altered immune cell function, and oxidative stress. Each of these metabolic stressors is a known complication of CKD. Since these metabolic abnormalities are also known to contribute to the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease, they are important potential therapeutic targets in CKD. This study will test whether oral paricalcitol, an active form of vitamin D, will improve glucose tolerance, immune cell function, and reduce oxidative stress in people with stage 3-4 chronic kidney disease.</detailed_description>
