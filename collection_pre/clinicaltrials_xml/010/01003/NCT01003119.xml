	<brief_summary>The purpose of this grant is to develop and test a proven computer based quality improvement/behavior change e-Health system (CHESS--Comprehensive Health Enhancement Support System) to help prevent relapse in alcohol dependent patients being discharged from residential treatment. The investigators' primary hypothesis is that ACHESS (Addiction CHESS) will improve competence, relatedness and autonomy, which will reduce the days of risky drinking over a 12-month period.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The system to be tested (ACHESS - Addiction CHESS) will be delivered through a new modality (smart-phone rather than PC) to make access more widespread, focus on new patients (alcohol dependent patients leaving residential care), offer optional audio delivery to improve access for those who have literacy challenges and be enhanced with services tailored to relapse prevention. ACHESS will offer: 1) communication with peer support groups and addiction experts; 2) timely monitoring to assess risk of relapse, 3) reminders and alerts to encourage adherence to therapeutic goals; 4) addiction-related educational material and tools tailored to the needs of the particular patient, 5) access to selected Internet based resources and 6) communication with a care manager. Patients randomly assigned to ACHESS will learn to use it prior to discharge from residential care.</detailed_description>
