	<brief_summary>Embryo culture is a cornerstone of in vitro fertilization treatments. Usually, embryos are cultured in microdrops of culture media in incubators with controlled temperature, humidity and atmosphere. However, these culture systems are static, while in vivo the initial growth of the embryo takes place in the uterine tube and they are submitted to a dynamic environment. The aim of this study is to compare the embryo development on days 2 and 3 of culture morphological features of embryos under static and dynamic(microfluidics) systems of culture.</brief_summary>
