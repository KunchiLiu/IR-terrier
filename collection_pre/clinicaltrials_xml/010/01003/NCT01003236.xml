	<brief_summary>There is considerable evidence that increased blood glucose results in the generation of reactive oxygen species, ultimately leading to increased oxidative stress in a variety of tissues. This may lead to the activation of stress-sensitive intracellular signaling pathways, causing cellular damage and late complications of diabetes including renal injury. Although the investigators understanding of how hyperglycemia-induced oxidative stress ultimately leads to tissue damage has advanced considerably in recent years, effective therapeutic strategies to prevent or delay the development of this damage remain limited. The flavonoid complex silymarin, an extract from the milk thistle, and its major pharmacological active component silibinin are free radical scavengers and potent membrane stabilizers by preventing lipid peroxidation. Furthermore, during early stages of diabetes, flavonoids minimize oxidative stress, and inflammation which represent important factors in the development of diabetic nephropathy. In this study the investigators plan to evaluate the renoprotective effect of milk thistle extract on type II diabetic patients with kidney disease.</brief_summary>
