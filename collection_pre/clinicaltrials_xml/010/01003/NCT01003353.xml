	<brief_summary>The study aims to investigate the effects of strength training on maximal strength, walking ability and neural function in chronic stroke patients. The strength training intervention in this study is different to all previous interventions for stroke patients. Maximal Strength Training (MST) involves weights of up to 90% of the participants 1 repetition maximum and has a focus on the explosive development of force. This study will use these principles for unilateral leg press and plantarflexion exercises. Only 2 previous studies have investigated high intensity strength training for stroke patients and they used intensities of 80% 1RM. Previous MST interventions have shown large increases in strength, rate of force development and this has transferred to improved walking economy. The investigators predict that MST will give large increases in strength, improved rate of force development (RFD) and walking economy. The investigators expect that better neural function will account for the improvements. This study could provide evidence for the adoption of a completely different method of strength rehabilitation for stroke survivors.</brief_summary>
