	<brief_title>Promus - Registry Experience at the Washington Hospital Center, Drug-eluting Stent (DES)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Interventional cardiology was revolutionized by the invention of stents, initially with the bare-metal stents (BMS) and recently with the drug-eluting stents (DES). The everolimus eluting stents have shown very promising results in randomized clinical trials, demonstrating a reduction of clinical and angiographic restenosis in comparison to BMS, and comparable clinically-driven target lesion revascularization rates in comparison with sirolimus-eluting stents. While registry data is available from outside of the United States, it will be important to collect "real-world" data regarding the stent usage and outcomes in the United States. In this study we propose to follow patients who received at least one PromusÂ® Stent for at least 1 year post initial stent implantation.</detailed_description>
