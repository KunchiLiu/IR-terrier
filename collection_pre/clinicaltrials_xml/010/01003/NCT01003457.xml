	<brief_summary>In the last decade, several authors proposed ultrasound measurement of Bladder wall thickness (BWT) for the screening of the voiding dysfunction and of the detrusor overactivity (DO). The aims of the investigator prospective study were: - to compare the ultrasonographic measurement of BWT in women with DO vs women with other urodynamic diagnosis in a very large population. - to verify whether the BWT in women with DO can be different in the clinically or urodinamically different forms of DO.</brief_summary>
