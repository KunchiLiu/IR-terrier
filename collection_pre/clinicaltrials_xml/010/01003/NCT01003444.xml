	<brief_summary>Biopsies of the outer thigh muscle and serum samples will be collected from untreated healthy subjects. These biological samples will be provided to the Diabetes Research Unit Translational Biomarker Laboratory for use in developing and validating human muscle malonyl CoA and serum malonate biomarker assays.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This non-drug method study was terminated on November 19, 2009. The decision to terminate was based on safety concerns (biopsy-related pain) observed in the first set of subjects. Four subjects were give a sample and did not tolerate it well. No data was collected to report.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Healthy male and/or female subjects between the ages of 18 and 55 years, inclusive (Healthy is defined as no clinically relevant abnormalities identified by a detailed medical history, full physical examination, including blood pressure and pulse rate measurement, 12 lead ECG and clinical laboratory tests). Female subjects will be of nonchildbearing potential. An informed consent document signed and dated by the subject or a legally acceptable representative. Subjects who are willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plan, laboratory tests, and other study procedures. Evidence or history of clinically significant hematological, renal, endocrine, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, psychiatric, neurologic, allergic, (including drug allergies, but excluding untreated, asymptomatic, seasonal allergies at time of dosing), muscle disease, diabetes, or severe uncontrolled hypertension. Any significant bleeding diathesis which could preclude recovery from the biopsy procedure. ASA, ibuprofen, and any other oral anti platelet agent should be discontinued at least 7 days prior to procedure. Prothrombin time (PT)/INR and/or activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) above the respective local laboratory normal ranges. Abnormal CK as per CRU laboratory ranges. Subjects with either a medical history of or physical evidence of keloid scar formation upon physical examination. 12 lead ECG demonstrating a clinically significant abnormality. Females of child bearing potential, pregnant or nursing females or females less than 6 months postpartum from the scheduled date of collection. Known hypersensitivity to lidocaine or any component of the study procedure. Participation in nonroutine rigorous exercise (eg, road races, heavy lifting, etc.) within one week prior to the muscle biopsy procedures. Professional athletes.</criteria>
