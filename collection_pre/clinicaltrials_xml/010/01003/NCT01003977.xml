	<brief_summary>Single center registry of patients who have received a Xience V everolimus-eluting stent at the Washington Hospital Center, with the primary objective to assess clinical success and safety at 30 days, 6 months and 1 year post-implantation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Registry Experience at the Washington Hospital Center, DES - Xience V</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Interventional cardiology was revolutionized by the invention of stents, initially with the bare-metal stents (BMS) and recently with the drug-eluting stents (DES). The everolimus eluting, Xience V stents have shown very promising results in randomized clinical trials, demonstrating a reduction of clinical and angiographic restenosis in comparison to BMS, and comparable clinically-driven target lesion revascularization rates in comparison with sirolimus-eluting stents. While registry data is available from outside of the United States, it will be important to collect "real-world" data regarding the stent usage and outcomes in the United States. In this study we propose to follow patients who received at least one Xience VÂ® Stent for at least 1 year post initial stent implantation.</detailed_description>
