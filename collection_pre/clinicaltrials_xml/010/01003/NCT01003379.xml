	<brief_summary>Schizophrenia affects approximately 1% of the population worldwide, and in about 80% of cases, it is a lifelong, disabling illness. It is a multi-dimensional disease that is associated with symptoms that have been characterized as positive, negative, and cognitive. CDS is a core feature of schizophrenia, and most individuals with schizophrenia exhibit cognitive impairment. Attention disorders, slow information processing, working memory disorders, and lack of flexibility for adaptive strategies are symptoms of cognitive impairment that have a devastating impact on the function, employment, and social status of patients with schizophrenia. Older typical neuroleptic medications (e.g., haloperidol, fluphenazine) do not improve cognition. In fact, haloperidol has been shown to induce cognitive impairment in schizophrenic patients. Novel atypical antipsychotics, such as risperidone, clozapine, and olanzapine, seem to produce gains in cognition. This improvement may reflect a diminution of extrapyramidal side effects of the typical high potency neuroleptics. Alternatively, it might reflect more effective symptom reduction by the novel antipsychotics, or direct cognitive enhancement through the effects of the newer agents on a variety of neurotransmitters, their receptors, and gene expression. Even when the newer antipsychotic medications improve cognition, they do not normalize it. Presently, there are no approved therapies for CDS. However, in schizophrenic patients, nicotine improves multiple cognitive domains, including working memory and attention. Furthermore, based on a strong body of evidence ranging from genetic mapping to clinical trials, the alpha7 NNR subtype has emerged as a primary therapeutic target relevant to CDS and other core symptoms of schizophrenia</brief_summary>
