	<criteria>Male or female patients aged equal or above 18 years. BCLC stage Category A, B or C that cannot benefit from treatments of established efficacy with higher priority such as resection, liver transplantation, local ablation, chemoembolization or systemic sorafenib. Liver function status ChildPugh class A. Failure to prior treatment with sorafenib (defined as radiological progression under sorafenib therapy) Local or locoregional therapy (eg, surgery, radiation therapy, hepatic arterial embolization, chemoembolization, radiofrequency ablation, percutaneous ethanol injection, or cryoablation) must have been completed = 4 weeks before first dose of BAY734506. ECOG PS of 0 or 1. Adequate bone marrow, liver and renal function Prior systemic treatment with molecular targeted agents for HCC, except sorafenib. Prior chemotherapy treatment is allowed. Known history or symptomatic metastatic brain or meningeal tumors (head CT or MRI at screening to confirm the absence of central nervous system [CNS] disease if patient has symptoms suggestive or consistent with CNS disease). Congestive heart failure NYHA&gt;/= class 2 Unstable angina (angina symptoms at rest, new onset angina within the last 3 months) or myocardial infarction (MI) within the past 6 months before start of study medication. Cardiac arrhythmias requiring antiarrhythmic therapy (beta blockers or digoxin are permitted). Uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure &gt; 150 mmHg or diastolic pressure &gt; 90 mmHg despite optimal medical management). Arterial or venous thrombotic or embolic events such as cerebrovascular accident (including transient ischemic attacks), deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism within 6 months before the start of study treatment.</criteria>
