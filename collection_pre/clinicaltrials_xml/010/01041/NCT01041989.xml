	<brief_summary>This multi-center (6 sites: Helsinki, Kuopio, Oulu, Sein√§joki, Turku, Vantaa) intervention study aims to prevent cognitive impairment, dementia and disability in 60-77 year old persons at an increased dementia risk. The 2-year multi-domain life-style intervention includes nutritional guidance, exercise, cognitive training, increased social activity, and intensive monitoring and management of metabolic and vascular risk factors. The primary outcome is cognitive impairment measured by a sensitive Neuropsychological Test Battery (NTB), and Stroop and Trail Making tests to capture early cognitive impairment typical for both Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia. We hypothesize that the multi-domain intervention will reduce cognitive impairment in the study group compared to the control group during the initial 2-year intervention period and reduce dementia incidence after the 7-year extended follow-up.</brief_summary>
