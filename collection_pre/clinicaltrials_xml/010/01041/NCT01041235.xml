	<brief_title>Safety Study of a Liposomal Docetaxel Formulation in Patients With Solid Tumors Who Have Failed Previous Therapies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The majority of advanced stage human cancers are fatal if not treated promptly and aggressively. Standard treatments include chemotherapy, radiation therapy and surgery. Docetaxel, the active ingredient in ATI-1123 and the FDA approved drug Taxotere, is a chemotherapy given by IV to patients to treat various types of cancers. Docetaxel is a poorly water soluble semi-synthetic taxane analog commonly used in the treatment of a variety of solid tumors including non-small cell lung, prostate, breast, gastric and head and neck cancer. Because of its poor water solubility it is formulated with co-solvents that can potentially contribute to treatment related adverse events such as hypersensitivity. Current taxane formulations often complicate drug delivery and can alter both pharmacokinetic and toxicity profiles. Results from nonclinical evaluations show that ATI-1123 retains the antineoplastic activity of docetaxel while removing the need for unwanted solvents like Tween 80. The administration of ATI-1123 versus other docetaxel chemotherapy formulations is expected to reduce hypersensitivity reactions (redness, swelling, itching at the infusion site), eliminate the requirement for premedications, have a broader therapeutic index, and enhance systemic docetaxel exposure.</detailed_description>

Be ≥ 18 years old. Have a negative pregnancy test (if female of childbearing potential) Demonstrate acceptable hepatic function: Bilirubin ≤ upper limit of normal (ULN) AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) ≤ 2.5 times ULN Demonstrate acceptable renal function: Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN, OR calculated creatinine clearance ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for patients with creatinine levels above institutional normal (Calculated according to the Cockroft and Gault formula) Demonstrate acceptable hematologic status: Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1500/mm3 Platelet count ≥ 100,000/mm3 (measured within 72 hours prior to initial dose) Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL Demonstrate acceptable coagulation status: PT or INR within 1.5x ULN PTT within 1.5x ULN Have recovered from prior treatments (eg, surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, investigational therapies) sufficiently prior to Day 1 so that, in the opinion of the Investigator and/or Medical Monitor, the protocol objectives would not be compromised. Agree to use an effective contraceptive method (hormonal or barrier method; or abstinence) for the duration of the study and for 30 days after the last dose (for men and women of childproducing potential). Have New York Heart Association Class III or IV cardiac disease, myocardial infarction within the past 6 months prior to Day 1, unstable arrhythmia, or evidence of ischemia on electrocardiogram (ECG). Have a seizure disorder requiring anticonvulsant therapy. Have active CNS metastasis. Patients with a history of CNS metastases will be eligible if they have been treated and are stable without symptoms for 4 weeks after completion of treatment, with image documentation required, and must be either off steroids or on stable dose of steroids for ≥ 1 week prior to enrollment. Have severe, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with hypoxemia. Have active, uncontrolled bacterial, viral, or fungal infections requiring systemic therapy. Are pregnant or nursing. Have undergone radiation therapy, surgery, chemotherapy, or investigational therapy within 28 days prior to study entry (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or Mitomycin C). Are unwilling or unable to comply with procedures required in this protocol. Have a known history of infection with HIV, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C. Have a serious nonmalignant disease that, in the opinion of the Investigator and/or the Medical Monitor, could compromise protocol objectives. Are currently receiving any other investigational agent. Have exhibited allergic reactions to docetaxel, or a similar structural compound, biological agent, or formulation.</criteria>
