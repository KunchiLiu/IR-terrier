	<brief_title>Supported Employment: Motivational Enhancement for Entry and Outcome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 85-90% of those with serious mental illness are unemployed (9, 10). This level of unemployment exists despite the finding that, among people who have a psychiatric disability and are unemployed, 55-61% desire employment, with the total reaching 75% when concern about losing benefits was taken into account (1, 2). The rewards of employment for adults with SMI are greater than simply an increase in financial resources. Studies have found that people with serious mental illness who worked competitively scored higher on measures of self-esteem, satisfaction with finances, leisure, and overall life satisfaction compared to those worked little or not at all (11). Supported employment (SE) has been more effective than any other vocational rehabilitation approach for this population (3, 4) and the VA has mandated that SE be integrated into all current VHA Compensated Work Therapy (CWT) programs (VHA Directive 2007-005). Two areas of concern include (a) national utilization of SE services is low (13), and (b) the percentage of SE participants who obtain at least one job during the studies averages 56% even though everyone who enters the program expressed an interest in working (13). Motivational interviewing (MI) is an evidence-based practice that has been effective in enhancing a range of clinical services (6), but has just recently been applied to employment and vocational services by Drebing et al. (7) and Glynn et al (8). The proposed project is a randomized trial of Adapted Motivational Interviewing for Supported Employment (AMI-SE) provided to Veterans and their significant others (family members or key friends) in order to address the internal and external barriers to the Veteran enrolling in supported employment and returning to work.</detailed_description>
