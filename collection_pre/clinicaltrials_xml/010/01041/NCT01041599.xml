	<brief_title>Correlation of Albuminuria With Arterial Stiffness</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CONTEXT: Albuminuria is an important cardiovascular risk factor. Arterial stiffness also gives important information about atherosclerosis. Oscillometric methods may be useful in assessing arterial stiffness in a mainly operator independent way. OBJECTIVE: We aim to investigate the relationship between albuminuria and arterial stiffness measured with an oscillometric device in diabetic patients, hypertensive patients and healthy subjects. METHODS: 152 diabetic patients, 152 hypertensive patients and 152 healthy subjects are planned to be enrolled in this study. The measurements will be done between 9:00 and 13:00. After the measurements, blood and urine samples will be obtained, centrifugated and kept in -80Â°C until assayed. Afterwards, echocardiographic left ventricle mass index will be calculated. The correlation between albuminuria and arterial stiffness will be assessed as the primary outcome measure.</detailed_description>
