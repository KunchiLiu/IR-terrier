	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, open-label, single-arm pilot study designed to investigate the safety and efficacy of the INSTRUCT therapy in the treatment of knee cartilage defects. All patients who meet eligibility criteria and who consent to participate will undergo the implantation of a biodegradable scaffold seeded with autologous primary chondrocytes and bone marrow cells via arthrotomy. Patients will be followed-up for 2 years at regular intervals. Evaluations will include adverse events collection, patient reported outcomes (mostly pain and function), arthroscopic and histologic evaluations and MRIs (including dGEMRIC).</detailed_description>
