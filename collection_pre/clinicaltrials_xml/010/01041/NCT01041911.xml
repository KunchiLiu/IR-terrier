	<brief_title>To Evaluate the Dose Response of 3 Doses of Euphorbia Prostrata in Patients With First and Second Degree Hemorrhoids</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hemorrhoidal disease is a common entity in the general population and in clinical practice. The basic pathological factor in hemorrhoids is the dilation of the anorectal venous plexuses. In the acute bleeding of internal hemorrhoids, one of the pathogenic processes implicated is the stagnation and stasis of blood in the vascular plexuses of the prolapsed anal cushions. Euphorbia prostrata extract is found to have antihemorrhoidal activity and is useful in ameliorating signs and symptoms associated with hemorrhoids.</detailed_description>
