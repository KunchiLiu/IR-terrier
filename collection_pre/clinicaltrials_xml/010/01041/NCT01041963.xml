	<brief_title>The Effect of Enalapril and Losartan on Peritoneal Membrane in Continuous Ambulatory Peritoneal Dialysis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Detailed description: Many peritoneal dialysis patients suffer from uremia due to inadequate dialysis or volume overload caused by failure of peritoneal membrane transport.One of the most important etiologies of peritoneal membrane failure are unavoidable to use high glucose-containing dialysate solution that induce injury to mesothelial cell.Previous data found that injured mesothelial cell produces Angiotensin (Ang) II to induce peritoneal inflammation and fibrosis. Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition(ACEI) or angiotensin receptor antagonism (ARB) play a major role to slow this effect. Although many trials in animal study have proved the benefit of ACEI and ARB in peritoneal membrane transport but clinical evidences in human are controversy. Up to now, all previous trials have limitation. First,The trials have small number of population(less than 20 in prospective randomized controlled trial). Second, The trials have multiple confounders on the study population because of the study include old case (that on peritoneal dialysis for many years) and new case (that just start treatment less than 1 year). Third, short duration of study(less than 3 months) to see the significant effect of RAAS blockade on peritoneal membrane transport. Forth, most study use dialysate albumin loss as an index of peritoneal membrane transport ,that less sensitivity to predict peritoneal membrane function. Fifth,no previous trials are attempted to study the effect of combination between ACEI and ARB. Therefore,we design to study the effect of both ACEI and ARB in a larger number of population, only in new case which are just recently found to be on peritoneal dialysis, our study is taken in longer duration and use both modified peritoneal equilibrium test and dialysate CA125 as an index of peritoneal membrane (physiology and anatomic index).This research will demonstrate efficacy of Enalapril and Losartan on Peritoneal membrane transportation lead to improve quality of life in CAPD patients.</detailed_description>
