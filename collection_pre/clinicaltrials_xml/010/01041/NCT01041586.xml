	<brief_summary>To assess the safety and efficacy of BTVA for the treatment of patients with heterogeneous upper lobe emphysema.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bronchoscopic Thermal Vapor Ablation (BTVA) for Lung Volume Reduction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All subjects meeting the eligibility criteria and who provide written informed consent will be enrolled. Immediately prior to BTVA treatment, an initial bronchoscopy will be performed to evaluate the baseline condition of the airways and to confirm anatomy of the lung segments targeted for BTVA treatment. Up to 3 segments in either the right or left upper lobe will be treated with a vapor dose of 10 calories per gram of lung tissue (10 cal/g). Targeted lobe for treatment will be based on lobar disease severity.</detailed_description>
