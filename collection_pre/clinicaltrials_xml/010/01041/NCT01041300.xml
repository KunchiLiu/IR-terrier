	<brief_summary>Our aim is to Test the influence of a new multichanel Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation stimulator (Multiway) on motor excitation, in comparision to a wildly used Magstim Super Rapid 2 single channel stimulator. Each of the 20 Healthy subjects that are inticipated to inrole to the study wiil undergo 6 simple procedures which are designed to compare the motor threshold obtained by diffrent combination of TMs coils (figure 8, double cone coil,H coil array) and stimulators (Multiway, Super Rapid 2). The entire length of the procedures is about 4 hours and all subjects will be paid for their participation in the study. Our main hypothesis is that the motor threshold obtained by the multichanel stimulator will be significtly lower then the single chanel stimulator.</brief_summary>
