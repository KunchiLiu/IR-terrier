	<brief_summary>The study seeks to determine if the use of omega three fatty acids in individuals infected with HIV and with high triglycerides leads to improved triglyceride levels, better blood vessel function and decrease in the amount of obstruction in blood vessels.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Impact of Omega Three Fatty Acids on Vascular Function in HIV</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>While omega-three fatty acids have been shown to be beneficial for TG and HDL-C levels in HIV uninfected individuals and in some small, short duration studies in HIV-infected individuals, there are no data that extend these observations to determine whether intake of omega-three fats over a more prolonged time period will also have a beneficial impact on functional outcomes such as vascular endothelial function and anatomic surrogate markers of CVD in HIV-infected patients. We propose a randomized, double blind trial of purified omega-three fatty acids in HIV-infected individuals with elevated levels of triglycerides. While the impact of omega-three fatty acids on lipid profiles should be evident early (within 12 weeks); we propose to conduct this trial for a full 24 months to test our overall hypothesis that this intervention will not only improve triglyceride and HDL-C levels, improve HDL-subpopulations, plasma and membrane phospholipids and decrease inflammation, but will also improve brachial artery reactivity testing (BART) as a measure of vascular endothelial function at 24 weeks and 24 months and arterial stiffness measured by a pulse wave velocity test as a surrogate marker of CVD risk at 24 months when compared to controls. The specific aims of this proposal include: 1. To conduct a randomized, placebo controlled trial of omega-three fatty acids over 24 months in HIV-infected individuals with elevated levels of triglycerides (&gt; 150 mg/dl). 2. To demonstrate the impact of omega-three fatty acid intake on TG levels and on HDL-C levels, HDL subpopulations, composition of plasma and membrane phospholipids, and chronic inflammation as measured by CRP, sPLA2 and by levels of arachidonic acid. 3. To demonstrate the impact of omega-three fatty acid intake on BART at 24 weeks and 24 months and on arterial stiffness at 24 months.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>HIVinfected men and women at least 18 years of age, On stable HAART for the previous two months and without anticipated changes in their HAART regimen throughout the duration of the study, Fasting triglycerides &gt; 150 mg/dl and &lt; 2,500 mg/dl Participants may be on lipid lowering therapy; if on lipid lowering therapy, therapy must be stable for 8 weeks and cannot be changed during the course of the study. Participants may be on beta blockers (e.g., Atenolol, Metoprolol, Propranolol), and Estrogens (e.g., Estinyl; Estrace; Estraderm), however therapy with these agents must be stable for 8 weeks before starting the study and cannot be altered while on study unless deemed medically necessary by the participant's medical provider and approved by Dr. Wanke. Female participants of reproductive age must not be pregnant (negative test) or lactating at screening and throughout the trial and agree to use contraception for the course of the trial and 2 months after the trial unless they are surgically sterilized (tubal ligation or hysterectomy), or postmenopausal with no menses for &gt; 1 year.
