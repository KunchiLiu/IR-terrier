	<brief_summary>The overall goal of this research is to elucidate how environmental, healthcare, and patient-level factors and patients' level of perceived control impact sleep duration and quality in hospitalized older patients and to assess whether better in-hospital sleep is associated with improved physical activity and health outcomes. We hypothesize that environment, healthcare disruptions and patient symptoms will be significantly associated with objective and subjective sleep duration and sleep quality in hospitalized older patients. We also hypothesize that a high level of perceived control will be associated with improved sleep duration and quality in hospitalized older patients. We further hypothesize that shorter sleep duration and quality in hospitalized older adults will be associated with adverse health outcomes, namely higher blood pressure and blood sugar.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Understanding Sleep in Hospitalized Older Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research can lead to a better understanding of the effects of inpatient sleep on health outcomes for hospitalized older patients and can help inform the design and evaluation of interventions designed to improve sleep in hospitalized older patients. This work can also form the foundation for understanding the longer term health effects of inpatient sleep loss for older patients that are potentially modifiable.</detailed_description>
