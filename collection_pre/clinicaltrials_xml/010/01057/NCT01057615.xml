	<brief_summary>Combining fish oil and vitamin C supplementation will provide a greater anti-inflammatory effect against developing exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) than either nutritional supplement alone.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Fish Oil and Vitamin C on Exercise-Induced Bronchoconstriction and Airway Inflammation in Asthma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of this study is to extend previous findings that nutritional supplementation or dietary modification can ameliorate exercise-induced bronchoconstriction. It has been shown in separate studies that fish oil and ascorbic acid (vitamin C) individually protect against EIB by improving pulmonary function and reducing airway inflammation. The main aim of this study is to determine the comparative and additive effects of fish oil and ascorbic acid supplementation on EIB and airway inflammation in asthmatic individuals.</detailed_description>
