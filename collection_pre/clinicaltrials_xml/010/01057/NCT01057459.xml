	<brief_summary>This research trial studies deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) analysis in predicting response to antibody therapy in patients with follicular lymphoma treated on clinical trials Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB)-50402 or CALGB-50701. Studying samples of blood from patients with follicular lymphoma in the laboratory may help doctors predict how well patients will respond to treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>DNA Analysis in Predicting Response to Antibody Therapy in Patients With Follicular Lymphoma Treated on Clinical Trials CALGB-50402 or CALGB-50701</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: l. To test the hypothesis that killer immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genotypes predict overall response (partial response [PR], complete response[CR], and unconfirmed complete response [CRu]) within 12 months to rituximab-containing monoclonal antibody combinations in follicular lymphoma patients treated on CALGB protocols 50402 and 50701. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To test the hypothesis that KIR and HLA genotypes are associated with survival outcomes (progression-free survival [PFS] and overall survival [OS]) in follicular lymphoma patients treated with rituximab-containing monoclonal antibody combinations on CALGB protocols 50402 and 50701. OUTLINE: Genomic DNA is extracted from previously collected blood samples for KIR and HLA genotyping and polymorphism analysis.</detailed_description>
