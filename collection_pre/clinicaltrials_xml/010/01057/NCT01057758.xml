	<brief_summary>The objective is to assess the efficacy and safety of oral simvastatin in patients with a suspicion of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The hypothesis of this study is that simvastatin therapy will improve mortality in patients a suspicion of VAP.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>STATIN-VAP STATIN-VAP - STATINs and Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>When a patient will present a suspicion of VAP (Clinical Pulmonary Infection Score modified ≥ 5), Simvastatin or placebo will be administered with antibiotics. Quantitative cultures will be performed for microbiological confirmation of VAP. Simvastatin or placebo will be administered through an enteral feeding tube or administered orally when patients are able to safely take oral medications. The type and placement of the enteral feeding tube (nasogastric, nasoenteric, PEG, orogastric, oroenteric, etc.) and the ability to safely take oral medications will be determined by the patient's primary team. Study drug will be blinded with an identical appearing placebo. Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score (SOFA), and various blood factors will be measured during treatment.</detailed_description>
