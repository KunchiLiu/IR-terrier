	<detailed_description>Dexmedetomidine, an alpha 2 agonist provides some analgesia without respiratory depression. Children undergoing tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy occasionally have episodes of respiratory obstruction in the recovery room following administration of opioids. As dexmedetomidine provides some analgesia without respiratory depression,an intra-operative dose of dexmedetomidine may provide adequate analgesia without significant side effects thereby allowing for quick post operative recovery.</detailed_description>
