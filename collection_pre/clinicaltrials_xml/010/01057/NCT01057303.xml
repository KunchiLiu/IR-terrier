	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Studying samples of tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer. PURPOSE: This research study is looking at gene expression in tissue samples from young patients with acute myeloid leukemia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Studying Gene Expression in Tissue Samples From Young Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Examine mRNA from pediatric patients with acute myeloid leukemia with 11q23 translocations by reverse transcriptase-PCR to quantify expression of EVI1 splice variants. OUTLINE: Cryopreserved mRNA from diagnostic samples is analyzed for gene expression by reverse transcriptase-PCR.</detailed_description>
