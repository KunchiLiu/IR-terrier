	<brief_title>EVIdence Based TreAtment - Heart Failure (EVITA-HF)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiac insufficiency is the main or secondary diagnosis of 10% of all hospitalised patients. Due to the age-structure of the population and to the increased life expectancy after myocardial infarction prevalence is increasing. Even though prognosis in patients with established heart failure has been improved it remains serious, with an average survival rate of 50% after 4 years. Approximately 2% of all expenses in health care are caused by cardiac insufficiency, the most expensive being the hospitalization phase. The rehospitalisation rate after the first hospital stay is 50% within 6 months. By optimal, guideline-adjusted therapy during hospital- and post-hospital-stay the rehospitalisation rate could be reduced by 50%. But our knowledge concerning therapies is based on study results, which are generated with selected patients under controlled study conditions. Thus it is necessary to collect data on the development of therapy, the successes as well as the complications in clinical everyday life. Results concerning the quality of therapies are required and measures are needed that will contribute to quality assurance and improvement. Due to these reasons EVITA was initiated with the following objectives, aims, structure, and organization form: The register will not substitute randomized, controlled, multi-center clinical trials (RCT) that have a defined prospective research question. Such randomized studies investigate the "efficacy" of a therapy, i.e. a clinical effect under experimental conditions. In contrast, registers investigate the transferability of RCT results to the daily routine within hospital, the so called "effectiveness". Both study types are complementary and are needed for a judgment of the clinical efficiency as well as of security aspects and possible adverse reactions. Furthermore EVITA should function as an idea supplier and should coordinate possible future studies. Other important tasks of the register are: (i) the establishment of recommendations for an optimal medicinal therapy (OMT) as well as for ICD- and CRT-treatment; (ii) the establishment of quality assurance measures, including monitoring of new therapy. Every 6 months each study center receives a complete overview concerning the centers own data in comparison with the data supplied by other centers.</detailed_description>
