	<brief_summary>As we age, we experience a reduction in muscle and bone which inevitably decreases strength and the ability to perform tasks of daily living such as gardening, carrying groceries, and climbing stairs. Health costs associated with aging muscle and bone loss are in the billions of dollars. With the projected increase in life expectancy, the incidence of muscle and bone loss will rise and further drain the healthcare system, with greater need for hospitalization, treatment, and rehabilitation. Without effective strategies to counteract aging muscle and bone loss, we may face a healthcare crisis in the future. Creatine, a compound found in red meat and seafood, increases creatine phosphate stores in muscle, providing increased energy during high-intensity exercise. Short-term (i.e. 3-4 months) resistance-exercise and supplementation with creatine, have been shown to have a favorable effect on properties of aging muscle and bone. However, the longer-term (i.e. 1 year) effects of these interventions are unknown. Therefore, the purpose of this innovative research is to determine the longer-term effects of resistance-exercise and creatine supplementation (0.1gâ€¢kg-1) in older adults. The primary dependent variables to be assessed will include muscle hypertrophy, bone mineral and bone geometry, strength, and urinary and blood indicators of liver and kidney function. This innovative, multidisciplinary research will help contribute to the successful pursuit of prolonged independent living by improving aging musculoskeletal health for older Saskatchewan adults. Saskatchewan provides a relevant setting for this research, given the higher percentage of older adults (15%), compared to the national average (12%). We hypothesize that creatine supplementation will increase muscle mass, strength, and bone mineral density more than placebo.</brief_summary>
