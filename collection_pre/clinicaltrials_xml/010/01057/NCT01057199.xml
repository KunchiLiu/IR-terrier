	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Studying samples of tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer. PURPOSE: This research study is looking at biomarkers in cell samples from patients with acute myeloid leukemia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Studying Biomarkers in Cell Samples From Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - To determine the significance of regulation of microRNA-34a and microRNA-194 by C/EBPα during granulopoiesis in patients with acute myeloid leukemia with CEBPA mutations. - To determine whether overexpression of micro RNA-34a and microRNA-194 in myeloid progenitors with C/EBPα mutations leads to granulocytic differentiation. - To examine how microRNA-34a and microRNA-194 downregulate E2F3 during granulopoiesis. - To determine the role of microRNA-34a and microRNA-194 in myeloid cell proliferation. OUTLINE: Cryopreserved cell samples are collected for laboratory analysis, including mutation analysis, gene expression analysis, RNA analysis, and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis.</detailed_description>
