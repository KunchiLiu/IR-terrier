	<brief_title>Is Omega-3 Fatty Acid Red Blood Cell (RBC) Saturation Product Dependent?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To demonstrate that RBC saturation of the Omega-3 fatty acids reaching cardioprotective levels as proven with the HS-Omega-3 Index test will be achieved most efficiently depending on a specific product utilized within this study. The HS-Omega-3 Index is a new test that measures blood levels of the cardioprotective omega-3 fatty acids, EPA and DHA. RBS saturation is being measured to identify how much Omega 3 is in the blood.</detailed_description>
