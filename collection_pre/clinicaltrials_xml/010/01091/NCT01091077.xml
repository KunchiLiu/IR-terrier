	<brief_summary>Hepatitis C virus when it leaves the cells in the liver is bound to a type of fat. An component of grapefruit could block this fat and thus lower the amount of virus in the blood stream. We propose that treatment with this ingredient, called naringenin, could be used to block this fat and HCV in persons infected with hepatitis C.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Study of the Grapefruit Flavonoid Naringenin for HCV Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The hepatitis C virus is actively secreted by the liver of infected patients while bound to very low density lipoprotein (vLDL). The grapefruit flavonoid naringenin could be used to block vLDL secretion and lower the circulating viral titer. Hypothesis: Treatment with naringenin will block vLDL and HCV secretion in persons infected with HCV. Primary Objective To study the safety and pharmacokinetics of a single-dose of naringenin Secondary Objectives 1. To study the changes in circulating HCV titers during the transition from a fasted to fed state. 2. To study the changes in circulating HCV titers after administration of the grapefruit flavonoid naringenin. 3. To study effects of naringenin on vLDL secretion. This is a single-arm, cross over study where placebo is administered during a transition from a fasted to a fed state, then the protocol is repeated with a single dose of naringenin plus cyclodextrin, using the previous measurements as his/her own control</detailed_description>

History of an adverse reaction to citrus fruits History of uncontrolled seizure disorder. Uncontrolled depression or other psychiatric disorder such as untreated Grade 3 psychiatric disorder, Grade 3 disorder not amenable to medical intervention, or any hospitalization within the past 52 weeks that in the opinion of the site investigator might preclude tolerability of study requirements. History of autoimmune processes, including but not limited to Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, severe psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, that have been exacerbated by previous interferon use. Any systemic antineoplastic or immunomodulatory treatment or radiation within 24 weeks prior to study entry. Serious illness including malignancy, active symptomatic coronary artery disease within 24 weeks prior to study entry, or other chronic medical conditions that may preclude completion of the protocol in the investigator's opinion.

Subjects with diabetes/hyperglycemia occurring in the context of shortterm use of corticosteroids, growth hormone, or other diabetogenic medication, but not requiring any treatment for diabetes after discontinuation of the implicated medication, are eligible to participate. Subjects with diabetes/hyperglycemia following an episode of pancreatitis who no longer require treatment for diabetes are eligible.
