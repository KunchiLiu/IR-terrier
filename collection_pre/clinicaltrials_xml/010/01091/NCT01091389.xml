	<brief_summary>This study aims at investigating the role of autonomic modulation of AF. Therefore, totally thoracoscopic PV isolation with additional ablation of ganglionated plexi (GP) will be studied against PV isolation alone. Two groups of patients (paroxysmal AF with or without structural heart disease and persistent AF with or without heart disease) of 110 patients each will be studied.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Atrial Fibrillation Ablation and Autonomic Modulation Via Thorascopic Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common chronic arrhythmia in man. Its treatment consists of control of ventricular rate or attempts to restore sinus rhythm. For symptomatic patients who fail on anti arrhythmic drugs, isolation of the pulmonary veins (PV), with additional linear left atrial lesions when appropriate, can cure AF. At least in some, but probably in many patients, the autonomous nervous system plays a pivotal role in the initiation and perpetuation of AF. The autonomic ganglia, or ganglionated plexi (GP) are located within the epicardial fat pads of the left atrium. This study aims at investigating the additional value of ablation of those GPs in addition to totally thoracoscopic PV isolation. Objective of the study: This study aims at investigating the role of autonomic modulation of AF. Therefore, totally thoracoscopic PV isolation with additional ablation of ganglionated plexi (GP) will be studied against PV isolation alone. Two groups of patients (paroxysmal AF with or without structural heart disease and persistent AF with or without heart disease) of 110 patients each will be studied. Study design: This is a single center, randomized single blinded study Study population: Any patient with an indication for non-pharmacological treatment of symptomatic paroxysmal or persistent AF can enter the study. An indication for non-pharmacological treatment exists when patients are symptomatic and have failed on at least one anti-arrhythmic drug. Symptoms of AF include, but are not limited to palpitations, reduced exercise capacity, exertional dyspnea, and fatigue. Failure of anti-arrhythmic therapy is defined as 1) recurrence of AF despite the use of an anti-arrhythmic drug in a clinical efficacious dosing or 2) adverse effects of medication that is not acceptable to the patient. Intervention (if applicable): In patients randomized to additional GP ablation, the following procedures will be carried out during the totally thoracoscopic procedure in addition to the PV isolation (and extended lesion set when appropriate): The left atrial autonomic GPs are localized within the epicardial fat pads and subsequently ablated with radiofrequency current delivered through an ablation probe (AtriCure Isolator™ Transpolar™ pen).</detailed_description>
