	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to look at the importance of L-Arginine in the digestive tract. L-Arginine is an amino acid and is important in making proteins within the cell. The evaluation of colon tissue, blood, urine, diet, health history, and symptoms will help us learn more about L-Arginine and ulcerative colitis. The investigators believe these studies will provide new insights into the treatment for Inflammatory Bowel Disease (ulcerative colitis) and nutritional needs. The investigators plan to enroll 200 participants in this study over the next two years.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Amino acids are being measured in colon tissues and in serum by high performance liquid chromotography (HPLC). Cytokines and chemokines are being measured in colon tissues and in serum by Luminex assay. Cytokines and chemokines are also being measured in colon tissues by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of mRNA expression.</detailed_description>
