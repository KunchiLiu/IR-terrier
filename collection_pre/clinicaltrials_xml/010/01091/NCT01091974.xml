	<brief_title>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy +/- Armodafinil for Insomnia and Fatigue Following Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Treatment Protocol: CBT-I and armodafinil are being studied in a four-arm, randomized, controlled, clinical trial of 226 cancer survivors with chronic insomnia who are at least one month post treatment. The seven-week intervention is designed to determine the efficacy and acceptability of these treatment strategies in reducing insomnia in cancer survivors. Assessments will be made by questionnaires before, during, and two weeks following the study intervention. All ancillary treatments, as appropriate for control of symptoms caused by the cancer or its treatment may be administered as clinically indicated. Withdrawal of Sleep Medications: All participants, prior to beginning the baseline data collection phase of the study, must have withdrawn from all sleep medications, including: prescription, over-the-counter, CAM and herbal remedies for at least one week prior to beginning the study. CBT-I (Arms 3 &amp; 4): CBT-I will be provided on an individual basis to all patients in study Arms 3 &amp; 4 by a licensed clinical psychologist trained in CBT-I by Dr. Perlis. Subjects in these two study arms will receive 7 weeks of CBT-I, using a structured research grade protocol developed at the UR-SNRL. This manualized intervention, which exists as a published text: Perlis et al., 2005, includes four essential components: Sleep Restriction Therapy, Stimulus Control Instruction, Sleep Hygiene Guidelines, and a session of cognitive therapy. Data Collection: Patients will complete the Insomnia Severity (ISI) at the time of consent and every Friday during weeks 3-11 of the study. A follow-up call by study personnel will be made to each participant not currently receiving CBT-I on each of these Fridays to promote compliance, prompt completion, assess potential side effects of study medication, and answer patient questions.</detailed_description>
