	<brief_title>Non-Interventional Study To Investigate Whether Information Provided To Patients Influences Their Satisfaction With Toviaz Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients will be identified and monitored during routine clinical practice visits, and will not be specifically selected as this would interfere with the representativeness of the results. The study will be conducted with office-based urologists and office-based general physicians, practitioners and internists (GPs) in Germany, thus representing a wide range of practices and populations. Each urologist or GP may invite patients to participate who have already been diagnosed with overactive bladder and prescribed Toviaz according to their usual standard of care. Study enrollment stopped on December 31, 2011 due to difficulty in recruiting patients. No safety issues were related to the decision to stop patient enrollment.</detailed_description>
