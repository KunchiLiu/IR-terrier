	<brief_title>Evaluation of the Effects of Certolizumab Pegol on Semen Quality in Healthy Male Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CZP is a PEGylated humanized Fab' fragment with specificity for human tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα). Evidence suggests that modulation of TNFα signaling may affect male spermatogenesis. Therefore, this study will compare semen quality parameters before and after a single 400 mg dose of CZP, or matched placebo.</detailed_description>
