	<brief_summary>Following informed consent, patients will be randomly assigned to oral fiberoptic intubation or to oral intubation using the GlideScope Video Laryngoscope. Following the induction of general anesthesia a sealed envelope would be opened to reveal the technique to be used. A stop watch will be started at the beginning of the procedure. At the completion of intubation the stop watch will be stopped and the time recorded along with other data. Based on a sample size estimation process, it is the investigators plan to study fifty patients. The two techniques will be compared in terms of the average time needed to place the endotracheal tube and studied using a two-sided T-Test with a significance level of 0.05. To ensure comparability between the two methods, all intubators will be required to have at experienced at least 10 uses of the GlideScope and 10 uses with fiberoptic intubation.</brief_summary>
