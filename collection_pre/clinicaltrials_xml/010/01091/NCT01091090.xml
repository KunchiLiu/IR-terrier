	<brief_summary>Millions of individuals with chronic pain smoke and our preliminary research suggests that currently available strategies to help people quit smoking may not be effective for individuals with chronic pain. This is important in that smokers with chronic pain have worse pain-related health outcomes compared to nonsmokers with chronic pain. The primary aim of this research project is to develop a smoking cessation intervention for specific use in an outpatient clinical setting for smokers with chronic pain.</brief_summary>
