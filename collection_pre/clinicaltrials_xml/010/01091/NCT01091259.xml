	<brief_title>Irinotecan and Bevacizumab for Recurrent Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Accumulating data suggests that angiogenesis plays a critical role in the formation and development of a number of solid tumors including ovarian cancer. For women with ovarian cancer, a direct relationship between vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression and tumor vascularity has been documented. In vivo and in vitro data has demonstrated that increased angiogenesis and microvessel density are negative prognostic factors for women with ovarian cancer. These observations have fueled interest in incorporating anti-angiogenic agents into ovarian cancer treatment regimens. Several phase II trials of irinotecan in patients with epithelial ovarian cancer showed that the drug had efficacy in both chemotherapy-naïve patients and in those who had been previously treated with standard therapies, including platinum-based compounds, radiation, or both. Combination of bevacizumab, an antibody against VEGF, and irinotecan was studied in colorectal cancer and malignant brain neoplasms. In these trials, the combination was shown to be safe and effective. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of irinotecan in the treatment of women with recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer or primary peritoneal cancer when combined with bevacizumab. In this phase II open-label study patients will be treated with bevacizumab 15 mg/kg and irinotecan 175mg/m^2 every 3 weeks. Patients will undergo pre-treatment evaluation within 4 weeks of enrolling into the study. Clinical and laboratory evaluation will be performed every 3 weeks. Imaging studies and CA-125 measurements will be used to assess response to treatment.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Women with recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer, fallopian tube cancer, or primary peritoneal carcinoma Patient should have measurable or evaluable disease as defined by the following. Measurable disease: At least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest dimension to be recorded). Each lesion must be ≥ 20 mm when measured by conventional techniques, including palpation, plain xray, CT and MRI, or ≥ 10 mm when measured by spiral CT. Evaluable (nonmeasurable) disease: Patients who do not meet measurable criteria will be eligible having known disease with CA125 levels &gt;50 U/mL on two occasions at least one week apart. They will be considered for CA125 response criteria. Any number of prior chemotherapy regimens Any number of prior bevacizumabcontaining regimens No chemotherapy within the last 2 weeks prior to initiating this study. Karnofsky Performance status score ≥ 60%. Patients must have a life expectancy ≥ 12 weeks. Patients must be at least 18 years of age. Patients must understand and willingly sign an approved informed consent. Inability to comply with study and/or followup procedures Life expectancy of less than 12 weeks Current, recent (within 4 weeks of the first infusion of this study), or planned participation in an experimental drug study other than a Genentechsponsored bevacizumab cancer study Active malignancy, other than superficial basal cell and superficial squamous (skin) cell, or carcinoma in situ of the cervix within last five years BevacizumabSpecific Exclusions Inadequately controlled hypertension (defined as systolic blood pressure &gt; 150 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure &gt; 100 mmHg) Prior history of hypertensive crisis or hypertensive encephalopathy New York Heart Association (NYHA) Grade II or greater congestive heart failure History of myocardial infarction or unstable angina within 6 months prior to Day 1 History of stroke or transient ischemic attack within 6 months prior to Day 1 Known central nervous system disease, except for treated brain metastasis Treated brain metastases are defined as having no evidence of progression or hemorrhage after treatment and no ongoing requirement for dexamethasone, as ascertained by clinical examination and brain imaging (MRI or CT) during the screening period. Anticonvulsants (stable dose) are allowed. Treatment for brain metastases may include whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT), radiosurgery (RS; Gamma Knife, LINAC, or equivalent) or a combination as deemed appropriate by the treating physician. Patients with CNS metastases treated by neurosurgical resection or brain biopsy performed within 3 months prior to Day 1 will be excluded Significant vascular disease (e.g., aortic aneurysm, requiring surgical repair or recent peripheral arterial thrombosis) within 6 months prior to Day 1 History of hemoptysis (&gt;= 1/2 teaspoon of bright red blood per episode) within 1 month prior to Day 1 Evidence of bleeding diathesis or significant coagulopathy (in the absence of therapeutic anticoagulation) Major surgical procedure, open biopsy, or significant traumatic injury within 28 days prior to Day 1 or anticipation of need for major surgical procedure during the course of the study Core biopsy or other minor surgical procedure, excluding placement of a vascular access device, within 7 days prior to Day 1 History of abdominal fistula or gastrointestinal perforation within 6 months prior to Day 1 Serious, nonhealing wound, active ulcer, or untreated bone fracture Proteinuria as demonstrated by a UPC ratio &gt;= 1.0 Known hypersensitivity to any component of bevacizumab Pregnancy (positive pregnancy test) or lactation. Use of effective means of contraception (men and women) in subjects of childbearing potential History of abdominal fistula or intraabdominal abscess within 6 months prior to start. Any history of prior gastrointestinal perforation Patients believed to possibly be at higher than average risk of perforation, including symptoms or findings of partial or complete bowel obstruction, history of fistula, patients requiring parenteral nutrition and hydration, and those with history of prior perforation due to tumor or perforation within last 6 months from other causes will be excluded from study Patients with evidence of abdominal free air not explained by paracentesis</criteria>
