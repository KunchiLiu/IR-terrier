	<brief_title>Safety &amp; Efficacy of Eslicarbazepine Monotherapy in Sub.w/Partial Epilepsy Not Well Controlled by Current Antiepileptic</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an 18-week, double-blind, randomized, historical control, multicenter study with gradual conversion to monotherapy in subjects with partial onset seizures who are not well controlled by current AEDs. The 18 week double-blind treatment period consists of a 2-week titration period, 6-week taper or conversion period, and a 10-week monotherapy period. This study was previously posted by Sepracor Inc. In October 2009, Sepracor Inc. was acquired by Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma., and in October 2010, Sepracor Inc's name was changed to Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Diagnosis of partial epilepsy as defined in the Classification of Seizures of the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) (simple partial seizures with observable motor component, or complex, with or without secondary generalization) Medical history of seizures; Absence of confounding factors (pseudoseizures, syncope); Documented EEG recording (done within 5 years prior to screening) consistent with focal onset epilepsy Documented CT or MRI scan conducted within 10 years prior to screening, showing the absence of a structural abnormality (eg, tumor or malformation) ≥ 4 partial onset seizures during the 8 weeks prior screening with no 28day seizure free period Stable treatment with 12 AEDs during the last 4 weeks prior to screening Subjects must have the ability to comprehend the informed consent form and be willing to provide informed consent. For subjects who are unable to comprehend the written consent, a witness/caregiver who is able to describe and provide an understanding of the informed consent to the subject must sign the consent form on behalf of the subject. Subjects must give written informed consent prior to participation in the study. For subjects &lt;18 years of age, the informed consent must be signed by the subject's parent or legal guardian, and, when appropriate and/or required by state or local law, minor subjects must give written informed assent prior to participation in the study. Subjects of Asian ancestry are required to give written informed consent for genotyping. All subjects must sign a HIPAA Form. All females of child bearing potential must also sign the "Women of Childbearing Potential" Addendum. A female subject is eligible to enter and participate in the study if she is of: Nonchildbearing potential (ie, physiologically incapable of becoming pregnant, including any female who is premenarchal or postmenopausal); Childbearing potential (all females ≤65 years of age), has a negative pregnancy test at screening and agrees to satisfy contraception requirements Subjects with only simple partial seizures without a motor component Presence of generalized seizure syndromes (eg, juvenile myoclonic epilepsy or LennoxGastaut syndrome) History of pseudoseizures Current seizures related to an acute medical illness Seizures secondary to metabolic, toxic or infectious disorder or drug abuse Status epilepticus within 2 years prior to screening Seizures only occurring in a cluster pattern Subjects taking 2 of the following sodium channel blocking AEDs: phenytoin, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, or lamotrigine Subjects taking 2 AEDs with both being in the upper dose range (defined as approximately twothirds of the defined daily dose) Subjects taking more than 2 AEDs Subjects with progressive structural central nervous system lesion or progressive encephalopathy Psychiatric exclusion criteria Medical exclusion criteria: known renal insufficiency (estimated creatinine clearance [CrCL]) &lt;60 mL/min based on serum creatinine using the CockcroftGault formula Clinical and laboratory exclusion criteria: Subjects of Asian ancestry who tests positive for the presence of the HLAB*1502 allele Subjects who have been on benzodiazepines, phenobarbital, or primidone on a regular basis within 3 months prior to screening Subjects taking antipsychotics, tricyclic antidepressants, anxiolytics, sedative hypnotics including nonbenzodiazepines, central opioid agonists/antagonists, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) within at least 5 half lives (or for at least 2 weeks whichever is longer) prior to randomization Subjects presently on felbamate or vigabatrin</criteria>
