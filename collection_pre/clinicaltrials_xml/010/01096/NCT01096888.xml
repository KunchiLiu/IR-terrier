	<brief_title>Fit Moms- an Internet-based Postpartum Weight Loss Program</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Develop recruitment methods and determine feasibility of recruiting WIC postpartum women who meet inclusion criteria. We will collect data on number of individuals screened and reasons for exclusions. Establish and examine feasibility and effectiveness of protocol for WIC counselors reinforcing adherence to web based program. We will assess frequency with which WIC counselors adhere to protocol of reinforcing adherence to web-based program and extent to which any "treatment contamination" occurs between WIC counselors and Standard Care participants.In those randomized to Enhanced WIC + Internet-based postpartum program, examine acceptability, burden, ease of use, frequency of technical problems, and adherence to web-based program (number of logins, message board postings)Explore whether the Enhanced WIC plus Internet postpartum weight loss program will produce significantly greater weight losses than Standard WIC at 2 months. Explore whether Enhanced WIC plus Internet postpartum weight loss program will result in greater improvements in eating and exercise behaviors (examined at 0, and 2 months) and psychosocial parameters (i.e., depression, social support, self-efficacy, body image) than standard care.</detailed_description>
