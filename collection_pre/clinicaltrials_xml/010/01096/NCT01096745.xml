	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy between gemcitabine/cisplatin and S-1/cisplatin in the first-line treatment in advanced biliary tract cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomized Trial of Gemcitabine/Cisplatin Versus S-1/Cisplatin in Advanced Biliary Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Standard chemotherapy regimen for biliary tract cancer(BTC) has not been established due to the difficulty associated with performing clinical trials in this field. Gemcitabine or fluoropyrimidines, including 5-fluorouracil and S-1, are routinely used for BTC chemotherapy. The European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines published in 2009 recommend either gemcitabine-based or fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy or clinical trials for first-line treatment.</detailed_description>
