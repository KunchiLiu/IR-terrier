	<brief_summary>Standard Quit and Win contests, in which smokers typically quit for one month in return for the opportunity to win prizes, are simple and easy to implement and may be cost-effective in encouraging smokers to quit. By extending contest length and enhancing counseling content, Quit and Win contests may be more effective at encouraging smoking abstinence. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of extended and content-enhanced Quit and Win contests to enhance smoking abstinence at college campuses.</brief_summary>
