	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare a standardized 6 week Iyengar Yoga program (IYP) for adolescents and young adults with rheumatoid arthritis to a standard care wait-list condition. In addition to effects on function and pain, this study will explore intervention effects on disease activity, immune response, HRQOL, functionality, and mood. Results will shed light on the feasibility and potential efficacy of a novel intervention (Iyengar yoga) for rheumatoid arthritis symptoms. The hypotheses are: 1. The IYP will be safe, acceptable and feasible: at least 80% of subjects will complete the IYP. 2. Following the IYP, participants will show significantly improved disease status, general functioning, arthritis-functioning and HRQOL relative to controls. The benefits will be apparent post-treatment and at two-month follow-up. 3. Following the IYP, participants will report significantly improved pain, immune response and mood compared to controls. These improvements will be evident at both post-treatment and at two-month follow-up.</brief_summary>
