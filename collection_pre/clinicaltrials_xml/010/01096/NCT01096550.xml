	<brief_title>Intensive Outpatient Versus Outpatient Treatment With Buprenorphine Among African Americans</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This two-group randomized clinical trial will test the effectiveness of intensive outpatient (IOP) v. standard outpatient (OP) treatment in 272 heroin-dependent African American adults receiving buprenorphine in 2 formerly "drug-free" programs. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the two treatment intensity conditions at intake and assessed at baseline, 3-, and 6-months post-baseline to determine treatment retention, frequency and severity of heroin and cocaine use, self-reported HIV-risk, quality of life, and to determine DSM-IV criteria for Full or Partial Remission of Opioid Dependence. Furthermore, patient factors potentially critical for treatment success (e.g., attitudes towards buprenorphine and average buprenorphine dose while in treatment) will be examined to determine their importance in influencing treatment outcomes. Moreover, both patient and staff attitudes and average buprenorphine dose will be evaluated to determine their respective relationships to treatment experiences and treatment retention.</detailed_description>
