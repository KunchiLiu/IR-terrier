	<brief_title>IGF-1/IGFBP3 Prevention of Retinopathy of Prematurity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>When preterm infants are deprived of their natural intrauterine environment they lose access to important factors, normally found in utero, such as proteins, growth factors, and cytokines. It has been demonstrated that insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) is one such factor. In utero these biological factors are introduced to the fetus via placental absorption or ingestion from amniotic fluid. Deprivation of such factors is likely to cause inhibition or improper stimulation of important pathways, which in the case of the eye may cause abnormal retinal vascular growth, the hallmark of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). Retinopathy of prematurity is the major cause of blindness in children in the developed and developing world, despite the availability of current treatment of late-stage ROP. As developing countries provide more neonatal and maternal intensive care, which increases the survival of preterm born infants, the incidence of ROP is increasing. This phase 2 study was originally designed in 3 sections, Sections A, B, and C which are now complete. The protocol was amended and patients enrolled from this point forward will be enrolled into Section D. In Study Section D, a total of 120 subjects (GA of 23 weeks + 0 days to 27 weeks + 6 days) will be randomly assigned with 1:1 allocation ratio to either treatment with rhIGF-1/rhIGFBP-3 or to receive standard neonatal care (Control Group) to obtain at least 80 evaluable subjects. Duration of infusion will last at longest from Study Day 0 (day of birth) up to and including PMA 29 weeks + 6 days, when the subject's endogenous production of IGF-1 is considered sufficient to maintain physiologic serum IGF-1 levels. After discontinuation of study drug infusion, each subject will be followed to PMA 40 weeks Â± 4 days.</detailed_description>
