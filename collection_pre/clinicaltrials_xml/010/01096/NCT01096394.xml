	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Collecting and storing samples of tumor tissue and ascites fluid from patients to test in the laboratory may help the study of cancer. PURPOSE: This pre-clinical research study is collecting tissue samples and ascites fluid from patients with stage III or stage IV ovarian/primary peritoneal/fallopian tube epithelial cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Collection of Tissue Samples From Patients With Stage III or Stage IV Ovarian Epithelial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - To generate a translational ovarian cancer model using tumor tissue and cells from patients with stage III-IV ovarian/primary peritoneal/fallopian tube epithelial cancer for drug response and development. OUTLINE: Tissue and fluid samples are collected at the time of surgery or paracentesis and used in laboratory experiments and in animal models. Health data is collected from patient medical records before, during, and after surgery. After surgery, patients are followed up for 5 years.</detailed_description>
