	<brief_summary>Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common disabling illness that disproportionately affects women, with prevalence rates two times those of men. In addition to suffering, MDD has been shown to have a marked effect on social and vocational functioning, with increased disability, lost productivity, and excess mortality. Women with MDD have an increased prevalence of comorbid anxiety disorders and medical conditions. Our model of care utilizes a social worker as a depression care manager (DCM) to support both patients and physicians in optimizing care in the OB-GYN clinical setting. This intervention will be compared to usual care for depression.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Depression Attention for Women Now (The DAWN Study)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A large number of women receive their routine care in OB-GYN clinics, including a disproportionate percentage of low-income and minority women. For many of these women, OG-GYNs are the only provider they see on a regular basis. OB-GYNs take care of women across their lifespan, addressing gynecologic, health care maintenance, pregnancy and primary care concerns in their everyday practices. There are multiple aspects of OG-GYN care that are uniquely suited for detection and treatment of depression, but there are also significant barriers to such care that must be addressed. In this randomized controlled trial, we are testing this depression care management program for women attending two OB-GYN clinics in the University of Washington health care system. Our research aims to test the hypothesis that a depression care management intervention, integrated into the OB-GYN clinic setting, will improve treatment outcomes for depression, functional outcomes, and satisfaction with depression care. The results of our research will greatly impact clinical care by satisfying an unmet need for effective depression services for women seen in OB-GYN clinical settings. The study compares a depression care management intervention, delivered by a depression care manager, to usual care for depression in the clinics. The primary aims of the study are to evaluate, compared to usual care, a depression intervention consisting of enhanced education, engagement, and depression care management (with a choice of antidepressant medication monitoring and/or provision of brief psychotherapy).</detailed_description>
