	<brief_summary>This study is intended to be an evaluation of the properties of human sputum collected from patients with COPD. It is hypothesized that cationic airway lining modulators will have beneficial effects on the rheological properties of sputum derived from patients with COPD. Approximately 10 patients with COPD will collect sputum at home for 5 days. Samples will be collected and tested in laboratory tests.</brief_summary>
