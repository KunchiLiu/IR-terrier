	<brief_title>Radiofrequency Versus Laser Ablation for Hepatocellular Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Percutaneous ablation is a safe and effective therapy for cirrhotic patients with HCC when resection or liver transplantation is not possible. Among the various percutaneous local ablative therapies, radiofrequency ablation (RFA) has attracted the greatest interest because of its effectiveness and safety for single HCC ≤ 5.0cm or ≤3 HCC nodules ≤3cm. Some studies have shown that laser ablation (LA) may be as effective as RFA in the treatment of HCC. However, RFA and LA are different techniques and, in different cases (for example: size or site of HCC nodule), each of these procedures may have some advantages or disadvantages. Therefore there is the need for a prospective randomized controlled study to compare RFA and LA in patients with small HCC.</detailed_description>
