	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if, in a subset of patients treated with a beta-blocker and diuretic, prediabetes is detectable to a greater extent through a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) compared to fasting glucose measurement.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Antihypertensive Medication Exposure as Risk for Impaired Glucose Tolerance: A PEAR Sub-Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Beta-blockers and diuretics have a well-established role in treating hypertension and are frequently used first-line. However, it is increasingly evident that these medications have harmful metabolic effects. The Pharmacogenomic Evaluation of Antihypertensive Responses (PEAR - NCT00246519) study was a greater than 700 participant, randomized, parallel assignment trial, aimed at determining the genetic factors that influence response to both a beta-blocker (atenolol) and a diuretic (hydrochlorothiazide [HCTZ]). The PEAR trial design includes evaluation at baseline, after monotherapy with either medication, and after combination therapy with both medications. This pilot, PEAR sub-study aims to characterize the ability of two diagnostics tests (fasting glucose versus glucose 2-hours after an OGTT) to detect prediabetes development prior to blood pressure medication use, after monotherapy (with atenolol or HCTZ) and after combination therapy (with atenolol and HCTZ).</detailed_description>
