	<brief_summary>The investigators goal is to improve bowel preparations with an educational video on the Center for Digestive Disorders (CDD) website that explains the steps required for bowel preparation for those patients undergoing screening colonoscopies. The video will focus on explaining the purpose of a screening colonoscopy, the rationale for bowel preparation, the pre-colonoscopy diet, and the instructions for completing the laxative. In a randomized fashion, patients in the control group will receive the standard written bowel preparation instructions, while patients in the intervention group will receive standard written instructions plus a link to watch the instructional video. The investigators hypothesize that an educational tool that provides visual examples of a good and poor preparation, examples of the pre-colonoscopy diet, and an explanation of how to administer the laxative will lead to improved patient compliance and a better bowel preparation. In addition, the investigators hypothesize that a better quality bowel preparation will improve detection of colonic polyps and fewer recommendations for repeat colonoscopy based solely on inadequate bowel preparation.</brief_summary>
