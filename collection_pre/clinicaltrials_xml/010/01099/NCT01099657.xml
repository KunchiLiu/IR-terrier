	<brief_summary>We would like to determine how well hypnosis works when induced through virtual reality medium for patients who have suffered a major burn injury in the past two years and suffer from chronic pain. These patients are coming back to the outpatient burn and plastic clinic at Harborview Medical Center for routine follow-up. We think that patients will find VR-Hypnosis interesting, and it will help them relax and feel less pain.</brief_summary>
