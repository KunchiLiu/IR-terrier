	<brief_title>Resistance Training in Knee Osteoarthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients in experimental group participated in a 12-week progressive resistance training using a repetition maximum (RM) exercise in which patients performed 1RM with the maximum bearable weight. Once the 1RM was determined, training was divided into the following regimen: 2 series of 8 repetitions, the first with 50% and the second with 70% of 1RM. The exercises were knee extension and flexion and hip abduction and adduction, all performed in machines. The 1RM load was reevaluated every 2 weeks. The control group remained on a three-month waiting list for physiotherapy. Patients were assessed for pain, function, quality of life, muscle strength and six-minute walk test.</detailed_description>
