	<brief_summary>Researchers from Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, in collaboration with The New York Presbyterian Hospital-Weill Medical College of Cornell University, are conducting a study of a medicinal mushroom extract called Maitake (pronounced my-tock-e). Laboratory studies show that Maitake can reduce the growth of cancer in animals. The Maitake does not kill cancer cells directly. It is believed to work through the immune system (the body's defense system against infection). Our test tube, animal and human dose determining studies show that Maitake can enhance immune function. We are conducting this study to see whether Maitake improves the neutrophil count and function in patients with MDS. The neutrophils are white blood cells which help to fight infection.</brief_summary>
