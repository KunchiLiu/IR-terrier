	<brief_summary>The UKPDS risk score is recommended to assess global risk for future coronary heart disease (CHD) events in primary prevention. Recently, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) has emerged as a strong independent risk factor for CHD. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) is a promising imaging technique for the evaluation of vascular inflammation that reflects vulnerable atherosclerotic plaque.</brief_summary>
