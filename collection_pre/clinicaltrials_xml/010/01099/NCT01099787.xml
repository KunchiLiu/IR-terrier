	<brief_summary>To explore the predictive value of alarm signs ("red flags") for a diagnosis of functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID) in children. To assess the natural history of pain predominant functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID) in newly diagnosed pediatric patients. To document the benefit of various treatment regimens currently employed in managing FGID. To assess the short- and long-term impact of various FGID regimens. To allow physicians to gain a better understanding of the epidemiology of FGID. Hypothesis: There are presenting symptoms or results from diagnostic tests that are more likely to associated with conditions different from FAP or IBS. Symptoms of children with FAP/IBS change overtime regardless of the treatments used.</brief_summary>
