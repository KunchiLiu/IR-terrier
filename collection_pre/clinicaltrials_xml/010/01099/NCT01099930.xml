	<brief_summary>Multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune disease. We are studying whether high dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplant can replace the autoreactive immune system and if this reduces clinical inflammatory disease in the central nervous system (CNS). A second goal is to examine whether there is long-term stabilization or improvement in disability scores if the inflammatory disease is controlled.</brief_summary>
