	<brief_title>Low Grade Inflammation in Type 1 Diabetes Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The increase of type 1 diabetes incidence, particularly in young children leads to conduce new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies, notably for associated chronic morbidity.Measurement of chronic inflammation, with modification of the balance between pro-inflammatory cytokines and anti-inflammatory cytokines, could lead to detect patients with high risk to diabetes chronic morbidity. After parental consent, blood sampling will be carried out by micromethod for cytokine (500 µl) and CRPhs dosages and glycemia (100 µl) and glycated hemoglobin (1 µl). Urine will be collected (50 ml) in the morning for further researches.</detailed_description>
