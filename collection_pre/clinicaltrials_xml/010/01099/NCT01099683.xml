	<brief_summary>A total of 26 healthy elderly male and female subjects will receive both 10 mg NRL001 in a 2 g rectal suppository and placebo in this double-blind, cross-over study. The order of treatment will be randomised, with a minimum washout period of 3 days between doses. An end of study assessment will be conducted at least 7 days after administration of the last treatment. The pharmacokinetics of NRL001 will be determined prior to, and after, dosing. Pharmacodynamics will be examined using a three lead Holter monitor during both treatment periods. Adverse Events, vital signs, ECGs and clinical laboratory parameters will be collected, tabulated, reviewed and recorded throughout the study.</brief_summary>

Blood pressure in excess of 150/90 mmHg or pulse rate below 50 beats per minute at screening. Any significant illness during the screening period preceding entry into this study. Clinically relevant ECGabnormalities (e.g. QTc prolongation, acute arrhythmia) during the screening assessment Laboratory values which are abnormal and deemed to be clinically significant according to BioKinetic Europe Ltd. SOPs, unless agreed in advance by the Sponsor's Responsible Medical Officer and the BioKinetic Investigator. Current or history of drug or alcohol abuse or a positive drugs of abuse test at screening or check in. Use of any disallowed concomitant medication, including overthecounter items within 14 days prior to study drug administration until the end of the study. Use of any medication applied via the rectum, within 30 days prior to dosing Use of any medication currently or within 30 days prior to dosing which the Investigator believes may affect the study participation or results. Participation in a clinical drug study during the 90 days preceding the initial dose in this study. Donation of blood or blood products within 90 days prior to study drug administration, or at anytime during the study, except as required by this protocol.
