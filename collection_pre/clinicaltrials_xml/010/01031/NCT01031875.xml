	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Pazopanib hydrochloride may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well pazopanib hydrochloride works in treating patients with or metastatic urothelial cancer or bladder cancer that has relapsed or not responded to treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pazopanib Hydrochloride in Treating Patients With Metastatic Urethral Cancer or Bladder Cancer That Has Relapsed or Not Responded to Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To evaluate the activity of daily oral doses of pazopanib hydrochloride monotherapy in patients with relapsed/refractory metastatic urothelial carcinoma or transitional cell tumors. Secondary - To evaluate the safety and tolerability of pazopanib hydrochloride monotherapy in a population of chemotherapy pretreated patients. - To assess progression-free survival of these patients. Tertiary - To evaluate the ability of whole-body 18FDG-PET to image metastases and monitor tumor response and to determine the rate of concordance with CT imaging and RECIST response criteria. - To evaluate the relationship existing between tumor response measured by 18FDG-PET and progression-free survival. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive oral pazopanib hydrochloride once daily on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo whole-body 18FDG-PET at baseline and periodically. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 2 years.</detailed_description>
