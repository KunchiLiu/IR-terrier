	<brief_title>(A Novel Pharmacologic Regime for Elective Percutaneous Coronary Intervention)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aim: Primary objective:To evaluate the efficiency and safety of low dose intracoronary unfractioned heparin (UFH) on elective percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Secondary objective: - To evaluate the effect of low dose intracoronary UFH on myocardial ischemia after PCI. - To evaluate the effect of low dose intracoronary UFH on bleeding complications after PCI. - To evaluate the cost-effectivity of low dose intracoronary UFH on elective PCI Study central: - Bursa Postgraduate Hospital, Cardiology Clinic Study population: - we planned to enrol 200 patients. - Patients will randomise in two groups (control group:100 patients, study group:100 patients) Study works:-Write case report form for all patients - Control for inclusion criteria - Demographic data (age, gender) - Height, weight, BMI and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) - Risk factors - laboratory data (biochemical and hematologic) - Medication history - Echocardiographic data - Angiographic data - Procedure time - PCI data(vessel diameter, stent diameter, lesion and stent length, performed percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) or not, etc) - Before and after procedure (activated clotting time) ACT value - Before and after procedure troponin I (TnI) and Creatine kinase MB (CKMB) levels - Note complication (MACE, bleeding, hematoma etc) - Note femoral compression time. 4 weeks later note the first control data. Six months later note the second control data.</detailed_description>
