	<brief_summary>Infection with human papillomavirus (HPV) has been clearly established as the central cause of cervical cancer. This Phase IV, observer-blind study is designed to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of Cervarix™ in HIV infected females aged 15 to 25 years as compared to Merck's HPV vaccine (Gardasil®). For comparative purposes, a group of HIV negative females will also be evaluated. All subjects will receive the HPV vaccine (either Cervarix™ or Gardasil®) according to a three-dose schedule (Day 0, Week 6, Month 6).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subjects who the investigator believes that they and/or their parent(s)/legally acceptable representative(s) (LAR) can and will comply with the requirements of the protocol. A female between, and including, 15 and 25 years of age at the time of the first vaccination. Written informed consent obtained from the subject and/or from the subject's parent or LAR. Subjects willing to undergo HIV Voluntary Counseling and Testing (VCT) and willing to be informed of their HIV infection status. For HIV seropositive subjects: Subjects must be HIV seropositive according to World Health Organization (WHO) case definition. Subject must be asymptomatic (or only have persistent generalized lymphadenopathy). Subjects should have a CD4 cell count &gt; 350 cells/mm3. If currently taking antiretrovirals (ARVs), subjects must be on compliant to triple therapy (highly active ART) and have undetectable viral load on two previous clinical visits within the six months prior to study entry. For HIV seronegative subjects: Subjects confirmed as HIV seronegative at the screening visit. For nonvirgin female subjects: Subjects must have no history of abnormal cytology or CIN 1/2/3. Subjects must have had no more than six lifetime sexual partners prior to enrollment. Subjects must have no history of congenital malformations of the uterine cervix, or history of cauterization or surgical procedures involving damage to the transformation zone of the cervix or stenosis. Female subjects of nonchildbearing potential may be enrolled in the study. Female subjects of childbearing potential may be enrolled in the study, if the subject: has practiced adequate contraception for 30 days prior to vaccination, and has a negative pregnancy test at screening and on the day of vaccination, and has agreed to continue adequate contraception during the entire treatment period and for two months after completion of the vaccination series. Previous vaccination against HPV, or planned administration of any HPV vaccine other than that foreseen by the study protocol during the study period (Day 0 to Month 24). ART not compliant with the National Guidelines. Active tuberculosis (TB) visit (criteria mandatory only for HIV+ subjects). Current TB therapy. Hemoglobin &lt; 8.0 g/dL at the screening visit. Creatinine &gt; 1.5fold the upper limit of normal (ULN) at the screening visit. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &gt; 2.5fold ULN at the screening visit. Use of any investigational or nonregistered product (drug or vaccine) other than the study vaccine(s) within 30 days preceding the first dose of study vaccine, or planned use during the study period (Day 0 to Month 24). Chronic administration (defined as more than 14 consecutive days) of immunosuppressants or other immunemodifying drugs (with the exception of ART) within six months prior to the first vaccine dose. Administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol within 30 days (Days 0 29) before the first dose of study vaccine/control. Enrollment will be postponed until the subject is outside the specified window. Planned administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol within 30 days before or 30 days after (i.e., Days 0 29) any dose of study vaccine. Previous administration of components of the investigational vaccine. Cancer or autoimmune disease under treatment. Hypersensitivity to latex. History of allergic disease or reactions likely to be exacerbated by any component of the vaccine/control. Acute disease and/or fever at the time of enrollment. Acute or chronic, clinically significant pulmonary, cardiovascular, hepatic or renal functional abnormality, as determined by physical examination or laboratory testing performed at the screening visit. History of any neurological disorders or seizures. Pregnant or breastfeeding female. A subject planning to become pregnant, likely to become pregnant (as determined by the investigator) or planning to discontinue contraceptive precautions during the study period, up to two months after the last vaccine dose (i.e., up to Month 8). Concurrently participating in another clinical study, at any time during the study period (Day 0 to Month 24), in which the subject has been or will be exposed to an investigational or a noninvestigational product. Any medically diagnosed or suspected immunodeficient condition (other than HIV for HIV seropositive subjects), based on medical history, physical examination and/or laboratory tests results. Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the three months preceding the first dose of study vaccine/control or planned administration during the study period. Enrollment will be postponed until the subject is outside the specified window. Administration of trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole within seven days before the first dose of study vaccine/control, or planned administration of trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole within seven days after the first dose of study vaccine/control. Current drugs or alcohol abuse. Child in care.</criteria>
