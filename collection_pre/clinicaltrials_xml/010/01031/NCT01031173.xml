	<brief_title>Treatment Protocol of Replagal for Patients With Fabry Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of Replagal in patients with Fabry disease who are either naive to treatment, who were previously treated with agalsidase beta, or who had previously received Replagal. Patients diagnosed with Fabry disease who have not previously received treatment, who have received agalsidase beta, or who had previously received Replagal will be eligible to enroll in the study and will receive Replagal at a dose of 0.2 mg/kg body weight administered by an IV infusion over 40 minutes every other week. This study will be conducted in the United States. Study visits will occur in 3 phases: - Screening/Baseline Phase: A Screening/Baseline period (Day -30 to Day -1) to determine eligibility and obtain baseline measurements. Patients who have previously received agalsidase beta will be tested for the presence of anti-agalsidase beta antibodies. - Treatment Phase: A 12-month treatment phase during which all patients will receive Replagal administered IV every other week. Clinical assessments will occur at Months 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12. The study may be extended to continue giving patients access to treatment. - End-of-Study Phase: An end-of-study contact either as an office visit or follow-up telephone call will occur one month after the last infusion.</detailed_description>
