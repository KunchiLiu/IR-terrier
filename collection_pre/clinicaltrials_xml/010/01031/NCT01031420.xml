	<brief_summary>Standard treatment for early stage bladder cancer is chemotherapy with methotrexate (M), vinblastine (V), adriamycin (A), and cisplatin (C) followed by surgical removal of any remaining cancer and the bladder with the intent of cure. The MV chemotherapy is usually given every 14 days with the AC given along each 28 days. This study looks at giving the same drugs at the same doses closer together, all drugs every 14 days, with the support of growth factor medication to promote growth of the white blood cells and platelets and allow chemotherapy to be finished sooner and surgery to be done sooner.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dose Dense MVAC for Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objective To assess the rate of complete response (pT0) at cystectomy or ureterectomy following preoperative dose dense MVAC (DD-MVAC) in patients with muscle invasive urothelial carcinoma of the bladder or high grade upper tract urothelial carcinoma. Secondary Objectives To assess the toxicity profile of DD-MVAC when given in the neoadjuvant setting: To define the number of patients who complete all three cycles of treatment without dose reduction, and to compare incidence of toxicity to the historical standard described by Grossman et al. To assess the 5 year overall and relapse free survival in patients who receive neoadjuvant DD-MVAC. To compare complete response rates between the following subgroups of study patients: Among bladder patients: Clinical N0 versus N1 (Appendix B) Among bladder patients: T2 stage without high risk features versus T2 with high risk features plus those with &gt; T2 stage. Three 14 day cycles of: Methotrexate 30 mg/m2 IV push or infusion over 2-3 minutes. Day 1 Vinblastine 3 mg/m2 Slow IV push or infusion over Day 1 Doxorubicin 30 mg/m2 Slow IV push or infusion over 15 minutes Day 1 Cisplatin 70 mg/m2 IV infusion over 4 hours Note: May divide dose over two sequential days (35 mg/m2/d x 2 days) if creatinine clearance 50-59 mL/min Day 1* (or divided over Day 1 and Day 2) Pegfilgrastim 6 mg SQ 24-48 hours after completion of chemotherapy. Followed in 4-8 weeks by radical cystectomy/ureterectomy.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>histologically confirmed urothelial carcinoma of bladder, ureter, or renal pelvis. T2T4 and muscle invasion must be established by TURBT. Upper tract must be high grade. N0N1 are eligible. candidate for radical cystectomy, nephroureterectomy, or segmental ureterectomy with goal of cure. &gt;/= 18 years old ECOG performance status 01. Adequate marrow and organ function. May enter on therapeutic anticoagulation if it can be safely held during perioperative period. No women of childbearing potential, pregnant or breastfeeding. LVEF &gt;/= 50 % Patients with history of other nonurothelial malignancies may enroll if: 1)no evidence of distant disease w/in last year. 2)No anticancer treatment for &gt;/= 1 year other than adjuvant treatment or treatment for secondary prevention. 3) Less than 360 mg/m2 lifetime dose of adriamycin. ability to understand and willingness to sign written informed consent and HIPAA. Intravesicular therapy w/in 4 weeks of study entry or those who have not recovered from adverse effects of such agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier. Patients may not be receiving any investigational agents within 4 weeks of study entry. History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to Methotrexate, Vinblastine, Adriamycin or Cisplatin or other agents used in the study. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements. Pregnant women are excluded from this study due to the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects of cytotoxic chemotherapy. Known HIVpositive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with cytotoxic chemotherapy. In addition, these patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrowsuppressive therapy. . Patients who have undergone prior pelvic radiation are excluded due to risk of life threatening myelosuppression. Patients who have received any previous systemic chemotherapy or radiation therapy for urothelial carcinoma or cytotoxic chemotherapy for another malignancy within 1 year of study entry are ineligible.</criteria>
