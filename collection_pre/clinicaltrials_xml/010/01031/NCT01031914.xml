	<brief_summary>The purpose of this engineering trial is to develop and validate an algorithm that will deliver Paced Breathing as a ramp feature to obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) subjects using Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) therapy. In this trial the investigators will be evaluating the algorithm's ability to correctly distinguish between sleep and wake.</brief_summary>
