	<brief_summary>The objective is to analyse the changes in the adipose tissue hystological features and the adipogenesis gene expression and related to inflammation after 48 and 96 weeks after the change from AZT+3TC+ABC (Trizivir®) to a monotherapy treatment with LPV/r (Kaletra®)</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients infected with VIH1, documented with a positive HIV1 antibody test and/or positive PCR, confirmed for HIV1 RNA. Patients treated with a HAART that should contain AZT+3TC+ABC (Trizivir®) Patients with an indetectable viral load, which will be defined &lt;40 copies/mL within the last six months. Patients with a lipoatrophy clinical evidence (which will be defined as moderate or severe, according to the Lipodystrophy Severity Grading Scale). Men or women aged ≥ 18. For women of childbearing potential, negative urine pregnancy test during the Screening visit. Patients that have signed and dated the Informed consent Form prior to any Studyspecific procedure. Patients with evidence of protease inhibitors failure, and/or documented evidence of protease gene resistance mutation. This evidence could be prior or during the inclusion period in the Study. Patients who, for any reason could not be treated with LPV/r. Cachexia, defined as an Body Mass Index &lt;17 Kg/m2. Pregnant or breastfeeding women, or women of childbearing potential who do not use the appropriate contraceptive method, according to the Investigator judgment. Clinically relevant disease or condition, according to the Investigator judgment, three months prior to the patient inclusion in the Study. Patients taking the following concomitant medication that could affect the adipocyte function or morphology, such as: insulin, steroids, anabolic steroid, antiinflammatory medication for more than three months.</criteria>
