	<brief_summary>QT dispersion can be a useful, simple noninvasive method for the early detection of cardiac involvement in SLE patients with active disease. The investigators therefore recommend cardiovascular evaluation for every SLE patient with an SLEDAI higher than 10.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>QT Dispersion in Patients With Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective: Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Although autopsy studies have documented that the heart is affected in most SLE patients, clinical manifestations occur in less than 10%. QT dispersion is a new parameter that can be used to assess homogeneity of cardiac repolarization and autonomic function. We compared the increase in QT dispersion in SLE patients with high disease activity and mild or moderate disease activity. Methods: One hundred twenty-four patients with SLE were enrolled in the study. Complete history and physical exam, ECG, echocardiography, exercise test and SLE disease activity index (SLEDAI) were recorded. Twenty patients were excluded on the basis of our exclusion criteria. The patients were divided to two groups based on SLEDAI: 54 in the high-score group (SLEDAI &gt;10) and 50 in the low-score group (SLEDAI &lt;10).</detailed_description>
