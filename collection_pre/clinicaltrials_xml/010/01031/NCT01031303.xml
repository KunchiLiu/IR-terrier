	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to provide further immunogenicity and safety information of sanofi pasteur's DTacP-IPV combined vaccine (TETRAXIM™) as a booster dose during the 4th and 6th year of life in children that previously received in Study E2I34 (NCT 00255021), sanofi pasteur DTacP-IPV// PRP~T vaccine (PENTAXIM™) as a three-dose primary and booster vaccinations. Primary Objective : - To assess immunogenicity in terms of seroprotection rates (Diphtheria, Tetanus, Polio types 1, 2 and 3) and seroconversion/vaccine response rates to acellular Pertussis antigens (Pertussis toxoid [PT], Filamentous Haemagglutinin [FHA]) of sanofi pasteur's DTacP-IPV (Tetraxim™) vaccine, one month after the booster dose given at 4 to 6 years of age. Secondary Objectives : - To describe the antibody persistence in terms of anti-pertussis antibody levels (anti-PT, and -FHA) and in terms of seroprotection rates and GMTs for Diphtheria, Tetanus, and Poliovirus types 1, 2 and 3, just before administration of the booster dose (at Visit 1) in all subjects at 4-6 years of age. - To assess immunogenicity in terms of seroprotection rates (Diphtheria, Tetanus, Polio types 1, 2 and 3) and seroconversion/ vaccine response rates to acellular Pertussis antigens (PT, FHA) of sanofi pasteur's DTacP-IPV (Tetraxim™) vaccine, one month after administration of the booster dose given at 4 to 6 years of age. - To describe the safety after the booster dose of the study vaccine.</brief_summary>
