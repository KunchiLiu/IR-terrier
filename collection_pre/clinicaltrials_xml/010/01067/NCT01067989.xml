	<brief_summary>Low-dose metronomic(LDM)chemotherapy as well as anti-inflammatory agents and bisphosphonates have shown anti-angiogenic properties on tumor vasculature. This study is meant to test the therapeutic potential of an anti-angiogenic treatment strategy by combining all these agents for metastatic breast cancer patients.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Histologic proof of infiltrating duct carcinoma of breast. Her2 negative tumors. ECOG performance status: 01. Presence of measurable disease: primary and/or metastatic. CBC showing normal values or any toxicity limited to grade I. SMA showing liver and renal functions &lt; 1.5 normal values previous treatment with an anthracycline and with a taxane is mandatory either as neoadjuvant/adjuvant treatment or for metastatic disease. previous treatment by chemotherapy for metastatic disease is allowed (up to three lines, allowing for MTD Capecitabine to be one of them). previous treatment by a bisphosphonate is allowed. However,those patients who up to the study had not received any bisphosphonate and those who had received Clodronate will receive Pamidronate; those who had been under Pamidronate will receive Zoledronate; those who had been under Zoledronate will continue with it." The patient's signature on the informed consent. Her2 neu positive tumor Inability to visit the clinic for outpatient treatment and evaluation Active/symptomatic brain metastases. ECOG performance status: 24. Presence of Hand Foot syndrome, at grade &gt; 2. CBC with any grade &gt;2 toxicity SMA showing liver functions &gt; 1.5 normal values SMA showing renal functions &gt; normal values Current continuous treatment by steroids or by NSAIDs, or by anti coagulants for "non protocol" reasons. presence of exclusively nonmeasurable disease (I/E: exclusive bone disease with nonrepresentative tumor markers). previous radiotherapy to the "only measurable disease". pleural or peritoneal effusion that may represent a "third space". history of active peptic ulcer. symptomatic coronary heart disease.</criteria>
