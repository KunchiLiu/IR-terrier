	<brief_summary>The aim of this research study is to determine by laboratory analyses the effects of drinking silicon-rich water on bone health. This will be determined from blood and urine samples from subjects who will be asked to drink 1 liter per day of either silicon-rich water or water without silicon for 12 weeks.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Body mass index (BMI) &lt; 30 Postmenopausal women with no evidence of osteoporosis by dual energy Xray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan (T ≥ 2 in the total hip and lumbar spine). Pre or perimenopausal women with osteopenia but no evidence of osteoporosis by DEXA scan (−1.5 ≤ T ≤ −2 in the total hip and lumbar spine) No estrogens or corticosteroids No prior history of bisphosphonate medication Otherwise in good health with no significant illnesses which could affect bone metabolism such as hypercortisolism, untreated hypothyroidism, treatment with statins or other drugs affecting bone metabolism other than calcium and vitamin D3. No change in exercise regimen or calcium intake in the past 3 months. Subject must sign the Institutional Review Boardapproved written informed consent prior to the initiation of any study specific procedures or randomization. A subject will be excluded for any condition that might compromise the ability to give truly informed consent for participation in the study. Males Premenopausal women with DEXA T scores ≥ 1.5 or ≤ 2. Postmenopausal women with DEXA T scores ≤ 2.</criteria>
