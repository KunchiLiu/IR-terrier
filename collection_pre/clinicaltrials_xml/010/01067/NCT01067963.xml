	<detailed_description>The SMaRT intervention is a 3-week intervention that uses a combined behavioral-education and counseling methodology. The combined intervention involves computer-aided education alongside telephone counseling via motivational interviewing. The computer-aided education is tailored to the diagnoses of type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease and designed in a learning module approach to facilitate goal-setting and discussion of health concerns with greater efficacy and in a more informed way during the brief office visit. Such Computer-aided education has been used to improve diabetes self-management and glycemic control in middle-aged to older adults with moderate success. The inclusion of CKD information will augment current diabetes self-management intervention. The telephone counseling using the evidence-based behavioral change approach of motivational interviewing is a patient-centered approach of partnering with patients by eliciting their health-related concerns. This approach tailors the SMaRT intervention to include collaborative goal-setting with guidance based upon the patient's readiness for change.</detailed_description>
