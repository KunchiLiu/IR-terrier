	<brief_title>Long-term Effects of Lifestyle Intervention in Obesity and Genetic Influence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In Germany, as in other countries, overweight and obesity affects a growing number of children and adolescents. Obesity-related diseases such as arterial hypertension, disorders of glucose and lipid metabolism and an increase in inflammation markers are associated with higher morbidity and mortality in early life, therefore effective therapy concepts are needed. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of a 4-6 week inpatient obesity lifestyle therapy program over 10 years and the genetic influence on the short-, middle- and longterm outcome. The lifestyle intervention consists of physical exercise, nutrition education and behaviour therapy based on the criterions developed by the German Obesity Group (degree of weight reduction, improvement of comorbidity and health behaviour, minimising of side effects).</detailed_description>
