	<brief_title>The Role of Serum Leptin Levels in Multiple Sclerosis Disease Activity While on Interferon Beta 1a (Rebif) Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an observational pilot study in patients with definitive relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis to determine whether there is a correlation in serum leptin levels and serum nitric oxide levels during a clinically observed increase in disease activity. Each subject will followed for 12 months while taking interferon beta-1a subcutaneous injections 3 times a week.</detailed_description>
