	<brief_summary>The goal of this study is to determine whether administering Gabapentin prior to surgery affects duration of pain and opioid use post-surgery. The investigators aim to compare gabapentin to placebo in a prospective, randomized clinical trial in which patients will be followed post-surgery until pain resolves and opioid use ceases.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Gabapentin was originally developed as an anti-convulsant, but was quickly recognized as a medication with significant analgesic activity in patients with neuropathic pain. More recently it has begun to be appreciated that it may have some benefits in the peri-operative period. Pre-operative Gabapentin reduces preoperative anxiety, early post-operative pain severity, post-operative opioid use and post-operative delirium (presumably through reduced opioid consumption). These same attributes are shared by medications such as NSAIDS and tylenol and the use of peri-operative gabapentin has not permeated the standard of care. Early post-operative pain severity and preoperative anxiety have been implicated in our own research as risk factors for prolonged time to pain resolution and prolonged time to opioid cessation. Since these endpoints are generally synonymous with time to recovery, interventions reducing these times would be seen not just to increase comfort but to actually speed recovery.</detailed_description>
