	<brief_title>Remote Ischaemic Preconditioning for Heart Surgery (RIPHeart-Study)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass is associated with a predictable incidence of myocardial, neurological and renal dysfunction. This significant morbidity and mortality is at least partly due to perioperative ischaemia. Remote ischaemic preconditioning (RIPC) is a novel, simple, non-invasive and inexpensive intervention by which ischaemia of non-vital tissue (skeletal muscles) protects remote organs (heart, brain and kidney) from a subsequent sustained episode of ischaemia. The investigators perform a multicenter randomized controlled study to evaluate that RIPC reduces teh severity of perioperative ischaemic injury in patients undergoing cardiac surgery, and results in about 1/3 risk reduction in the occurence of major adverse events.</detailed_description>
