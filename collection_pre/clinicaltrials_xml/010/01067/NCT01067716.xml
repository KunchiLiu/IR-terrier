	<mesh_term>Refractive Errors</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Male or female, of any race, and at least 21 years old at the time of the preoperative examination and signing the consent form. The refractive error, based on manifest refraction at the spectacle plane, of: MRSE up to 15.00 D with manifest cylinder between 0.00 and 6.00 D; MRSE up to +7.00 D, with manifest cylinder between 0.00 and 6.00 D; or Manifest cylinder (from 1.0 to 6.0 D) greater than the magnitude of sphere, and the manifest cylinder and sphere have opposite signs. BSCVA of 20/20 or better. UCVA of 20/40 or worse. Manifest refraction sphere within ± 0.75 D of cycloplegic refraction sphere (at the same vertex distance). Anticipated postoperative stromal bed thickness of at least 250 microns, based on preoperative central corneal pachymetry minus the maximum treatment depth to be ablated and the intended flap thickness, and confirmed by intraoperative central corneal pachymetry. Anticipated postoperative keratometry value (based on preoperative manifest refraction and keratometry) that is appropriate. A stable refractive error, based on an exam (or prescription) at least 12 months prior to the preoperative examination and as compared to the preoperative manifest refraction Subjects who have worn a contact lens in the operative eye must discontinue lens wear at least three (3) consecutive weeks prior to the preoperative examination. If, upon review of preoperative measurements, the Investigator determines that the corneal topography is within normal limits, surgery may be scheduled (within 60 days), with no contact lens wear permitted prior to the surgery. Willing and capable of returning for followup examinations for the duration of the study (6 months). Women who are pregnant, breastfeeding, or intend to become pregnant over the course of the study, as determined by verbal inquiry. Concurrent use of topical or systemic medications that may impair healing, including but not limited to: antimetabolites, isotretinoin (Accutane®) within 6 months of treatment, and amiodarone hydrochloride (Cordarone®) within 12 months of treatment. History of any of the following medical conditions, or any other condition that could affect wound healing: collagen vascular disease, autoimmune disease, immunodeficiency diseases, ocular herpes zoster or herpes simplex, endocrine disorders (including, but not limited to unstable thyroid disorders and diabetes), lupus, and rheumatoid arthritis. Subjects with a cardiac pacemaker or implanted defibrillator. History of prior intraocular or corneal surgery (including cataract extraction), active ophthalmic disease or abnormality (including, but not limited to, symptomatic blepharitis, recurrent corneal erosion, dry eye syndrome, neovascularization &gt; 1mm from limbus), retinal detachment/repair, clinically significant lens opacity, clinical evidence of trauma, corneal opacity within the central 9 mm, at risk for developing strabismus, or with evidence of glaucoma or propensity for narrow angle glaucoma. Evidence of keratoconus, corneal dystrophy or irregularity, or abnormal videokeratography. Known sensitivity or inappropriate responsiveness to any of the medications used in the postoperative course. Subjects with one eye that does not meet all inclusion criteria and does not fall within approved indications for treatment using the VISX® STAR S4 IR® Excimer Laser.
