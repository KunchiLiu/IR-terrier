	<brief_summary>Crisis management is important for operating room practice and non-technical skills are acknowledged as key to ensure patient safety in these situations. Unfortunately, it can be difficult to find instructors with appropriate experience. A peer-led team debriefing is led by the team it self rather than an external expert instructor but remains a reflective process. Incorporating peer-led debriefing compared to expert-led debriefing may increase access to an interprofessional crisis resource management course using simulation. The goals of the study are to observe the effect of an interprofessional peer-led team debriefing in the change in performance of non-technical skills of team performance and to compare it with the "gold standard" of expert-led debriefing on the performance of non-technical skills during a simulated operating room crisis. The investigators hypothesize that interprofessional peer-led debriefing will improve the performance of non-technical skills of the team during simulated intraoperative crisis management and that this improvement will be equivalent to the "gold standard" expert-led debriefing.</brief_summary>
