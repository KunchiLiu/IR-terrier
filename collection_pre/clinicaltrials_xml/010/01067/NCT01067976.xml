	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to look at the efficacy (how does it work) and safety of gadobutrol when used for obtaining MR images of both breasts.Women with a recent diagnosis of breast cancer by mammogram (X-ray examination of the breasts) may benefit from MRI of the breasts as MRI may detect additional breast cancers.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Recent histologically proven diagnosis of breast cancer after having obtained XRay Mammography (XRM) of both breasts (according to American College of Radiology [ACR] and performed no longer than 6 weeks prior to enrollment into the study) and has been referred for a contrastenhanced Magnetic Resonance Mammography (MRM) prior to surgery of the breast. If female, a digital XRM is required if any of the following criteria is met: 1. patient is younger than 50 years; 2. patient has heterogeneously or extremely dense breasts; 3. is not postmenopausal (postmenopause defined as at least 12 months prior to inclusion without menstruation). If female of childbearing potential, MRM should be performed on the 714th day of the menstrual cycle. Has an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) value &gt;/= 60 mL/min/1.73m^2 derived from a serum creatinine result within 2 weeks prior to study enrollment. Is a female patient who is pregnant or lactating Has any contraindication to the MRM examination (e.g. metal implants, phobia) or the use of gadoliniumcontaining contrast agents. Has received any contrast agent within 24 hours prior to the study MRM, or is scheduled to receive any contrast agent within 24 hours after the study MRM. Has severe cardiovascular disease (e.g., known long QT syndrome, acute myocardial infarction [&lt; 14 days], unstable angina, congestive heart failure New York Heart Association class IV) or acute stroke (&lt; 48 hours)). Has acute renal insufficiency of any severity due to hepatorenal syndrome or in the perioperative liver transplantation period or who has acute or chronic moderate or severe renal insufficiency (glomerular filtration rate &lt; 60 mL/min/1.73m^2). Has received chemotherapy or hormonal therapy for breast cancer within 6 months. Has received hormone replacement therapy within 4 weeks prior to study drug administration. Is scheduled or likely to require a surgery and/or biopsy in the time period up to 24 hours following study drug application Has prior excisional biopsy or breast surgery less than 6 months before enrollment and between XRM and study MRM</criteria>
