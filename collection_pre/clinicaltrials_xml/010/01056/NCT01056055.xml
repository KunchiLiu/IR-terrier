	<brief_title>Outcomes of the Modified-Brostrom Procedure Using Suture Anchor for Chronic Lateral Ankle Instability</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>With With the increased number of participants in sports and leisure time activities, the incidence of ankle ligament injuries has been correspondingly increased. Various surgical methods have been reported for chronic ankle instability. Of these methods, the modified Brostrom procedure is currently used most frequently, and its excellent treatment outcomes have been reported. If there are any methods for obtaining a strong ligament fixation force which are both technically simple and safe, such methods would shorten the operative time and be helpful for surgeons with little experience in managing chronic ankle instability to obtain excellent treatment outcomes. In recent years, a procedure using a suture anchor, which is used for various types of ligament or tendon reconstructions, has been frequently performed. To date, however, few studies have reported clinical outcomes of suture anchor techniques and comparisons of clinical results between suture anchor techniques and other procedures. Given the above background, we prospectively compared the clinical outcomes between the bone tunnel and suture anchor techniques in the modified Brostrom procedure for chronic lateral ankle instability.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients who complained of subjective instability of the ankle joint in whom repeated sprain injuries for &gt; 6 months and pain were confirmed Patients with marked ankle instability confirmed by the anterior drawer test as compared with the contralateral ankle joint and tenderness involving the lateral ligament of the ankle joint was confirmed on physical examination Patients with an talar tilt angle exceeding 10o or a discrepancy of &gt; 5o as compared with the nonaffected side on stress radiography Patients with an anterior talar translation exceeding 10 mm or a discrepancy &gt; 3 mm as compared with the nonaffected side. Patients who concurrently had an ankle fracture or marked tendon damage were excluded from the current analysis.</criteria>
