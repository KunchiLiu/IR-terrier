	<brief_summary>Cancer results from multiple mutations which cause cells to grow uncontrolled. It therefore may be necessary to inhibit several oncogenic targets to affect cancer cell growth. Studies have shown that panobinostat (LH589) causes a wide range of effect on endothelial cells that lead to inhibition of tumor angiogenesis (a fundamental step in the transition of tumors from a dormant state to a malignant one). Bortezomib triggers cell death in pancreatic cancer cells but the mechanism is not well defined but has been determined to be cytostatic. Combining these two drugs may work together in the treatment of pancreatic cancer.</brief_summary>
