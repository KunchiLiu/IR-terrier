	<brief_summary>This is an open-label, single-arm, dose-escalation Phase I study to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of G-202 (mipsagargin) when administered once daily for 3 consecutive days of a 28-day cycle in patients with advanced solid tumors. G-202 will be administered by intravenous infusion over 1 hour on Days 1, 2 and 3 of each 28-day cycle.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Pro-drug chemotherapy is an approach to cancer treatment that is being investigated as a means to achieve higher concentrations of cytotoxic or biologically active agents at a tumor location while avoiding systemic toxicity. With pro-drug chemotherapy, a relatively non-toxic form of a cytotoxin, the pro-drug, is converted into the active cytotoxic agent at the tumor site or other specific location. G-202 (mipsagargin) is a thapsigargin pro-drug; it consists of a cytotoxic analog of thapsigargin coupled to a masking peptide which inhibits its biologic activity until proteolytic cleavage at the tumor site. Thapsigargin is a natural product with profound effects on cell viability. Thapsigargin is a non-cell-type specific toxin with documented ability to kill a broad spectrum of cancer cell lines as well as normal endothelial cells, fibroblasts and osteoblasts. It induces a rapid and pronounced increase in the concentration of cytosolic calcium, due to blockade of the Sarcoplasmic/Endoplasmic Reticulum Calcium ATPase (SERCA) pump to which it binds with high affinity. The increase in cytosolic calcium leads to induction of apoptosis and ensuing cell death. The anti-tumor effect of G-202 in humans with advanced solid tumors is not yet known.</detailed_description>
