	<criteria>1. Patients who signed written informed consent form 2. SLE patient, aged between 1865 years, female or male; 3. Patients diagnosed lupus nephritis according to ISN/RPS 2003 classification criteria, class Ⅲ, Ⅳ,Ⅳ+Ⅴ, Ⅲ+Ⅴ or Ⅴ LN by renal biopsy 4. All patients had received induction therapy for 6 months with multitherapy (FK506 + MMF) or intravenous CTX pulses. 5. Patients were recruited when received partial remission or complete remission after 6 months induction therapy. Complete remission: proteinuria &lt;0.4 g/24h, negative urine sediment, serum albumin &gt;35 g/L, elevated scr &lt;0.3mg/dl, no extrarenal complications; Partial remission: proteinuria &lt;1.0 g/24h, urine RBC &lt;50X104/ml without casts, serum albumin &gt; 30 g/L, elevated Scr &lt;0.3mg/dl,no extrarenal complications. 1. Patients who didn't sign written informed consent form or could not obey the protocol. 2. Patients who didn't received the CR or PR criterion. 3. Patients who have impaired liver function, with ALT/GPT or AST/GOT twice more than the normal upper limit or who have active hepatitis. 4. WBC &lt;3000/mm3 in peripheral blood . 5.
