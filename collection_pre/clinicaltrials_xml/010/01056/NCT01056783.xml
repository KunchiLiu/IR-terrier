	<criteria>Previously diagnosed and symptomatic isolated eosinophilic esophagitis. Relevant eosinophil tissue inflammation as demonstrated by a mean eosinophil load &gt;= 20 eos/hpf in 8 biopsies at the baseline visit. Able to swallow placebo medication successfully under supervision in the clinic Free of all medications for EoE (including topical steroids) for at least 2 weeks prior to baseline and free of systemic steroids for at least 90 days before screening. A protonpump inhibitor is allowed if required for treatment of secondary acid reflux. Other causes of esophagitis (GERD, peptic ulceration, infection etc.) Other causes of eosphagaeal or generalized eosinophilia (i.e. hypereosinophilic syndromes, parasitic infection, GERD) The patient's EoE is dependant on the level of seasonal allergens and the patient's participation in the study will occur during the allergy season. History of abnormal gastric or duodenal eosinophilia (e.g. HES, Churg Strauss vasculitis, EG or a parasitic infection) Receipt of forbidden prescribed or over the counter medication within the 4 weeks prior to the baseline visit and for the duration of the trial, including vitamins and herbal remedies.</criteria>
