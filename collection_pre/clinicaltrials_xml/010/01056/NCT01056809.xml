	<brief_summary>For patients with primarily generalized colorectal cancer two treatment strategies are compared to establish which strategy gives best overall survival. The traditional strategy is to first resect the primary colorectal tumour and then treat the metastases with chemotherapy followed if possible by surgery. The alternative strategy is to first treat the metastases with chemotherapy followed if possible by surgery and only resect the primary colorectal tumour if there is hope for cure or if symptoms develop that necessitates treatment.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients are randomized between the two treatment strategies mentioned above. After initial treatment the patients are categorized as palliative or treated with curative intent. Patients are followed with quality of life evaluations every 6 months. Outpatient visits, hospital care, examinations and treatment are recorded as well as complications and side effects. Survival is recorded and for those patients treated with curative intent the tumour situation 3 years after randomization is evaluated.</detailed_description>
