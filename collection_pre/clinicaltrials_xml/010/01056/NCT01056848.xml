	<brief_summary>To evaluate the overall safety and continued efficacy of oral lixivaptan capsules in subjects with euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>International, Multicenter Study of a Twenty-eight Week, Open-label, Titrated Oral Lixivaptan Administration in Patients With Chronic Hyponatremia: Extension to Studies CK-LX3401, 3405, and 3430</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Phase I and Phase II clinical trials have demonstrated that lixivaptan may play an important role in treating hyponatremia and the signs and symptoms of water retention associated with HF, LCWA and SIADH. Lixivaptan was previously evaluated in disease states characterized by hyponatremia with euvolemia (SIADH) and hyponatremia combined with fluid overload (HF, LCWA). Lixivaptan demonstrated correction in serum sodium concentration together with marked aquaresis in patients with hyponatremia.</detailed_description>
