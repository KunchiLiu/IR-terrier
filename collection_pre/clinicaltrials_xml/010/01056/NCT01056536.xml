	<detailed_description>All persons aged 18 - 45 years planning to travel alone and attending the travel clinic of the Medical Outpatient Clinic in Lausanne will be asked to participate. The subjects will be randomized into three groups: 1. no intervention, 2. free condoms without further explanations, 3. a structured intervention of 5 minutes on STI risk reduction plus free condoms. The structured interventions will include information about the number of travelers engaging in new sexual relationships, the different types of STI and their prevalence in different countries and population groups. The subjects will complete a pre-travel questionnaire prior to the medical consultation. A post-travel questionnaire will be sent to them 10 days after their trip. The questionnaires will include questions on demographic characteristics, sexual habits, alcohol/tobacco/marijuana consumption and sexual relationships during the trip.</detailed_description>
