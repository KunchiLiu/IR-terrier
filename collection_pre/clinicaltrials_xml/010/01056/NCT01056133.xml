	<brief_title>Effect of Fish-oil on Non-alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Changes in fatty acid (FA) composition within the liver may influence lipid metabolism and inflammation. This is poorly understood in humans. Especially omega-3 FA are important: They promote FA oxidation over storage and are important for export of lipids from the liver. Omega-3 FA have also anti-inflammatory properties. Changes in liver FA composition may be influenced by dietary intake, high rate of lipid peroxidation (LP) or low delta-6 desaturase enzyme activity. We and others recently showed that NASH patients had lower hepatic n-3 and n-6 polyunsaturated FA (PUFA) with increased lipid peroxidation and low antioxidant status when compared to patients with minimal findings on liver biopsy. The dietary intake of FA was similar among the 3 groups suggesting that the difference in hepatic FA composition may be related to high lipid peroxidation or low delta-6 desaturase activity. This difference in hepatic FA composition may be of significance in the pathogenesis of NASH since it may change gene expressions in regard to lipid metabolism. This pilot study in NASH to assess the effect of n-3 PUFA supplementation on FA composition (liver and red blood cells), hepatic gene expression, and histology. We will also assess the ratio of phosphatidylcholine (PC) to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) in liver and red blood cells (RBC). Oxidative stress, insulin resistance and nutritional measurements will be performed to further characterize these patients. New research suggests that the composition of the gut flora (intestinal microbiota) may play a role in the development of NASH. The effect of fish oil on the intestinal microbiota has not been examined in humans. Therefore, intestinal microbiota is also measured before and after intervention and associations between changes in microbiota and changes in liver histology will be examined. In addition, bacterial products (short chain fatty acids in stool, lipopolysaccharide in plasma, bacterial DNA in plasma), and plasma choline will be measured. An environmental questionnaire will capture factors that can influence the intestinal microbiota.</detailed_description>
