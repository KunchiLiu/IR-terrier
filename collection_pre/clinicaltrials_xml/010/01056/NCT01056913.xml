	<brief_summary>After resection of diseased segments of the large intestine, the continuity of the intestine has to be restored. This can be done by suturing or with so called stapling devices. In addition since 2 centuries compression rings are used to connect the intestine after resection. The NITICAR27 device is a novel compression anastomosis device. The investigators want to prove if this novel device can be compared to commonly used stapling devices concerning anastomotic leakage, bleeding and stenosis.</brief_summary>
