	<brief_summary>This study proposes to develop a computer-based software tool that will allow surgeons to plan and simulate surgery for patients with jaw trauma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Advanced Visuohaptic Surgical Planning for Trauma Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The proposed tool will allow surgeons from different specialties to simulate, plan and iterate on complex procedures based on individual patient data in 3-D from a CT scan. The software will allow surgeons to both see and feel the results of their interventions - for example, the quality of the bite or bone alignment of a reconstructed jaw following severe trauma - before the actual surgery, leading to better planning, fewer errors, shortened surgery time and improved outcomes for the patients. The purpose of this study is the evaluation of a visuohaptic planning system for mandibular trauma surgery that is based on interactive manipulation of CT data.</detailed_description>
