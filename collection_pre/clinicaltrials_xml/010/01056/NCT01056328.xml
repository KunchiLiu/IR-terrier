	<criteria>Age 18 years or older Signed Patient Informed Consent Form Able and willing to comply with all pre, post, and followup testing and requirements Failure of at least one antiarrhythmic medication (AAD) for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation* [class I or III, or AV nodal blocking agents such as beta blockers (BB) and calcium channel blockers (CCB)] as evidenced by recurrent symptomatic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation*, or intolerable side effects due to AAD Subjects with symptomatic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF)* PAF is defined as recurrent atrial fibrillation (AF) that terminates spontaneously within seven days. Atrial fibrillation (AF) secondary to electrolyte imbalance, thyroid disease, or reversible or noncardiac cause Previous ablation for AF History of any valvular cardiac surgical procedure Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) procedure within the last six months Awaiting cardiac transplantation or other cardiac surgery within the next 12 months Left atrial thrombus History of a documented thromboembolic event within the past one (1) year Diagnosed atrial myxoma An implanted implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) Significant pulmonary disease, (e.g. restrictive pulmonary disease, constrictive or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) or any other disease or malfunction of the lungs or respiratory system that produces chronic symptoms Significant congenital anomaly or medical problem that in the opinion of the investigator would preclude enrollment in this study Women who are pregnant (by history of menstrual period or pregnancy test if the history is considered unreliable) Acute illness or active systemic infection or sepsis Unstable angina Myocardial infarction within the previous two months Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt;40% as determined by preprocedure transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) History of blood clotting or bleeding abnormalities Contraindication to anticoagulation (i.e. heparin or warfarin) Contraindication to computed tomography/magnetic resonance angiography (CT/MRA) procedure Life expectancy less than 12 months Enrollment in an investigational study evaluating another device or drug Uncontrolled heart failure or New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III or IV heart failure An intramural thrombus tumor, or other abnormality that precludes catheter introduction or manipulation Presence of a condition that precludes vascular access Left atrial size â‰¥ 50 mm as determined by preprocedure TTE</criteria>
