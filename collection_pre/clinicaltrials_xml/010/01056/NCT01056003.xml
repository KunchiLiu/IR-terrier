	<brief_summary>As known from several observational and retrospective endoscopic studies the prevalence of gastric inlet patches (GIPs) of the cervical esophagus is estimated between 1-10%. In most cases GIPs are found within endoscopy as an incident finding, since in most cases they are harmless and do not cause any symptoms. None the less several data exist where an association between GIPs and globus sensations is discussed. Case reports even refer to bleeding complications and moreover to malignant transformations of GIPs. As a result of the assumed association of GIPs and globus sensations we performed a pilot trial. Here we included 10 patients with globus and GIPs and were able to demonstrate a significant symptom relief after ablation of the GIP (Meining et al, Endoscopy 2006). To exclude a potential placebo-effect we concluded a multicenter and sham controlled trial where we imposingly were able to prove the symptom relief after ablation of the GIPs (Bajbouj et al, Gastroenterology 2009). All patients, who are scheduled for esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) in any of the above mentioned endoscopical departments are routinely standardized asked whether they have any hints suggestive for globus sensations (modified globus-questionnaire from Deary et al., J Psychosom Res 1995). Concurrently it is noted, whether the patients have endoscopical detected GIP. All GIPs are biopsied and examined in one institute. Together with anamnestic data (age, gender) a talley sheet gives a survey of all relevant information to prove or disprove following hypotheses. Study hypotheses: 1. The presence of GIPs is associated with globus sensations. In other words: Do patients with globus sensations significantly more often have GIPs? 2. GIPs are not congenital, they arise in the course of the time and become symptomatic. In other words: Do GIPs significantly occur in more elderly people? 3. The more increased the GIPs diameter is the more likely globus sensations are present? In other words: Do huge GIPs cause significantly more often symptoms than small ones? 4. The more mucus-producing mucosa is histologically proven the more likely globus sensations are present? In other words: Do we find more cardiac mucosa in patients with symptoms than fundus mucosa?</brief_summary>
