	<brief_summary>Lutein is one of oxygenated carotenoids. Over the past few years, there has been increased interest in evaluating the effect of lutein for optimizing immune functions. A large number of epidemiological studies support the notion that a high intake of lutein is associated with a reduced risk of coronary heart disease and certain types of cancer. The biological mechanisms for the protective effects of this carotenoid, including powerful modulation of functions and antioxidant properties, are only partially known. Although several nutrients and phytochemicals have been shown to modulate immune functions in humans, few studies have investigated the role of lutein consumption. No information is available as to whether lutein supplementation could be protective against oxidative stress. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to examine the effect of consuming different doses of lutein on oxidative stress in healthy subjects.</brief_summary>
