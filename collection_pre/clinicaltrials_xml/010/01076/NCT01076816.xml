	<brief_summary>Currently, dexmedetomidine is approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for short-term analgosedation (&lt;24h) in mechanically-ventilated critical care adult patients and sedation of non-intubated adult patients prior to and/or during surgical and other procedures. Trials are underway to investigate its pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy and safety in long-term use. Clinical experience with dexmedetomidine in the paediatric population is limited. Moreover, during childhood many developmental changes take place with consequences on drug exposure and drug response. Finally, critical illness itself can affect drug pharmacokinetics and -dynamics. Therefore, we cannot simply extrapolate adult data for use in children but we are in need of data on pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in every paediatric subpopulation.</brief_summary>
