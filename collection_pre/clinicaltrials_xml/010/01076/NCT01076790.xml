	<brief_summary>Dexmedetomidine acts at central nervous system (specifically: at locus caeruleus), providing sedative and analgesic effects. It is widely used in intensive care. Surgery-related interventions elicit arousal ('nociceptive') reactions. The effects of dexmedetomidine on the neurophysiological signs of arousal are studied in surgical patients. Brain waves, electrocardiogram, Entropy Index, Bispectral Index, and fingertip pulse waves are recorded and analyzed later on. The course of anaesthesia and surgery are recorded.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The patients are randomized to receive either dexmedetomidine or saline infusion before and during anaesthesia (dexmedetomidine 0.1 mcg/kg within 10 minutes, thereafter 0.7 mcg/kg/h until 30 min after skin incision). Multi-channel EEG, Entropy, BIS, multi-channel EMG, ECG, and plethysmogram are recorded on computer. Anaesthesia and surgery associated events are annotated on computer. Time points of endotracheal intubation, skin incision, and course of surgery well be analyzed in detail. Additionally, tetanic stimulus of ulnar nerve will be applied for each patient, and reactions to the stimulus will be analyzed.</detailed_description>
