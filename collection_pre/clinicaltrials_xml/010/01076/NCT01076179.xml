	<detailed_description>The Primary Objectives is to assess the tolerability of lopinavir/ritonavir in standard clinical setting. The Secondary Objectives are to characterize the development of viral resistance and to assess the development of CD4 T-lymphocyte cell count. All medications will be prescribed as per clinical practice. The Rationale is to document the safety, tolerability and clinical outcome of therapy regimens including lopinavir/ritonavir and new substances, such as INIs (integrase inhibitors, CCR5 (C-C chemokine receptor type 5) antagonists and new NNRTIs (non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors) as there are many reasons (intolerability, complex resistant patterns or even personal reasons) which may result in a change from the daily clinical routine and lead to the use of a newly approved antiretroviral agent in combination with lopinavir/ritonavir.</detailed_description>
