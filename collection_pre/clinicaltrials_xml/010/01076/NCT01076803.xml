(A responder patient will be defined either as a patient experiencing &lt; or= 1 vomiting episode per day during at least three consecutive days or as a patient in whom NGT has been removed without any vomiting recurrence during at least three consecutive days) The total number of visits will depend on the clinical situation, 5 visits are obligatory: Day(D)-3/-0,Day 1,Day 7,Day 14,Day 28 Inclusion visit (D-3/-0): eligibility, PIC, obstruction history, clinical exam, vital signs, diary cards, VAS scale, cc medication, blood sample Visit D1: injection Visit D7/D14/28: clinical exam, nutrition procedure, result of biochemical analyse, adverse events, cc medication In between the visits, the patient will keep and fill out his diary and VAS scale</brief_summary>
