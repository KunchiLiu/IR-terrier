	<brief_title>Autoimmunity in Sisters of Lupus Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease that causes inflammation and is accompanied by the development of autoantibodies. The inflammation caused by SLE may affect the skin, joints, lungs, blood, kidneys and nervous system. The cause of SLE is unknown, but research has indicated that it is caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Autoimmune diseases often run in families. Close relatives of people with these diseases are at greater risk of developing the same or another autoimmune disease. The study is designed to determine several things: If sisters of people with SLE make the same antibodies that are present in people with SLE, whether or not environmental factors affect the chances of developing these antibodies and if so what these environmental factors may be, if the presence of these antibodies in healthy people leads to increased risk for the development of SLE. This study enrolled over 400 unaffected sisters of young women diagnosed with SLE. These unaffected sisters are being followed with an annual health questionnaire (CSQ) and blood sample. Participation is voluntary and participants can stop participating at any time.</detailed_description>
