	<brief_summary>This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and the best dose of lenalidomide when given together with temsirolimus and to see how well it works in treating patients with Hodgkin lymphoma or non-Hodgkin lymphoma that has come back after a period of improvement or is not responding to treatment. Biological therapies, such as lenalidomide, may stimulate the immune system in different ways and stop cancer cells from growing. Lenalidomide may also stop the growth of Hodgkin lymphoma or non-Hodgkin lymphoma by blocking blood flow to the cancer. Temsirolimus may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving lenalidomide together with temsirolimus may kill more cancer cells.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lenalidomide and Temsirolimus in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Hodgkin Lymphoma or Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the safety, toxicity, and maximum tolerated dose of lenalidomide when combined with temsirolimus in patients with relapsed lymphomas. (Phase I) II. To determine complete and overall response rate of lenalidomide plus temsirolimus in patients with relapsed lymphomas as stratified by histology: follicular lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and lymphoma not otherwise specified (NOS) (including Hodgkin lymphoma, T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma [T-NHL], lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, and mantle cell lymphoma). (Phase II) III. To determine duration of response, progression-free survival, and overall survival of lenalidomide plus temsirolimus in patients with relapsed lymphomas as stratified by histology: diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, and lymphoma NOS (including Hodgkin lymphoma, T-NHL, lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma). (Phase II) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway activation in pre-treatment tumor tissue. II. To determine angiogenic and microenvironmental status of pre-treatment tissue and peripheral blood samples, and to evaluate changes following treatment with temsirolimus and lenalidomide. III. To determine differentially expressed genes associated with differences in clinical response and in progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and follicular lymphoma (FL) (Groups A and B, respectively). IV. To determine a methylation signature predictive of clinical response and PFS in patients with DLBCL and FL (Groups A and B, respectively). OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of lenalidomide followed by a phase II study. Patients receive lenalidomide orally (PO) on days 1-21 and temsirolimus intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with stable disease after 2 courses may continue therapy for up to 52 weeks. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 1 year.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histology: bone marrow biopsies (with the exception of lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma) as the sole means of diagnosis are not acceptable; fine needle aspirates are not acceptable Phase I: previously treated, histologically confirmed Hodgkin and nonHodgkin lymphomas; the only exception to a requirement for a lymph node biopsy is lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, which can be diagnosed based on morphologic evidence in the bone marrow plus the appropriate paraprotein Phase II: previously treated, histologically confirmed mature nonHodgkin lymphoma (NHL) stratified by histology: Group A: diffuse large Bcell lymphoma (NOTE: all patients with DLBCL must have germinal center vs. nongerminal center phenotype established via immunohistochemistry) Group B: follicular lymphoma Group C: lymphoma NOS (including Hodgkin lymphoma, TNHL, marginal zone lymphoma, lymphoplasmacytic No limit to number of prior therapies;

nonmeasurable disease alone is not acceptable; any tumor mass &gt; 1 cm is acceptable; lesions that are considered nonmeasurable include the following: Bone lesions (lesions if present should be noted) Ascites Pleural/pericardial effusion Lymphangitis cutis/pulmonis Bone marrow (involvement by lymphoma should be noted) For Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, measurable disease is defined as at least one lesion with a single diameter of greater than 2 cm by computed tomography or bone marrow involvement with greater than 10% malignant cells and quantitative monoclonal protein (immunoglobulin M [IgM], IgG, IgA) greater than 1,000 mg/dL Females of childbearing potential (FCBP) must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test with a sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL within 10 14 days and again within 24 hours prior to starting cycle 1 of lenalidomide;
