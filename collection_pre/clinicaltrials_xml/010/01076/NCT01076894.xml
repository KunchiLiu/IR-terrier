	<brief_summary>Postoperative pain and consecutive reduction of pulmonary function after thoracic surgery still is a major clinical problem and challenge in anesthesia. Thoracic epidural anesthesia is commonly considered to be the "gold standard" for postoperative pain control and restoration of pulmonary function after thoracic surgery. Thus, the aim of the present study is to investigate whether an intercostal nerve block with ropivacaine plus intravenous PCA with morphine is as effective as thoracic epidural anesthesia with respect to postoperative pain control and pulmonary</brief_summary>
