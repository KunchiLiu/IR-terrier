	<brief_summary>This pilot research trial studies biomarkers in bone marrow samples from pediatric patients with high risk acute myeloid leukemia. Studying samples of bone marrow from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors identify and learn more about biomarkers related to cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Biomarkers in Bone Marrow Samples From Pediatric Patients With High-Risk Acute Myeloid Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To provide a detailed, molecular map of pediatric high risk acute myeloid leukemia (AML). II. To identify mutations, expression profile, gene copy number, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) status and genomic methylation patterns in order to identify novel changes associated with pediatric AML. III. To generate fibroblast cell lines in order to obtain germline nucleic acids from marrow specimens from AML patients with induction failure. IV. To identify genomic alterations contributing to induction failure in childhood AML. OUTLINE: Banked bone marrow samples from diagnosis and remission are used to develop a detailed molecular map of pediatric high-risk acute myeloid leukemia. Analysis includes genome single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping, expression, and methylation profiling.</detailed_description>
