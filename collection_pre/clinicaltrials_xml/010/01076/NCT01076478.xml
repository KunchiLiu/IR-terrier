To be able to eliminate Type I Diabetes Mellitus among the younger subjects, we will only recruit patients who are stable on oral hypoglycemic agent. 3. Established diagnosis of diabetes mellitus type 2 (National Diabetes Data Group) who are currently on good control of the diabetic state. 4. Presence of predominantly distal symmetrical sensory polyneuropathy of the lower limbs as assessed by NSS, NIS and NCS. 1. Current use of potentially neuropathic agents (Isoniazid, Phenytoin, Dapsone, Metronidazole, Vinca Alkaloids, etc.) within the past 1 month; 2. Presence of severe metabolic disease (renal failure, hepatic failure, etc.), alcoholism and malignancy; 3. Presence of hemorrhagic tendencies; 4. Patients who are diagnosed to be of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus; 5. Pregnant and lactating patients, including those who plan to have pregnancy within the study period. 6. Concomitant intake of agents currently used to treat neuropathic pain like gabapentin, carbamazepine/ oxcarbazepine, antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressants and SSRIs) and topical capsaicin. 7.
