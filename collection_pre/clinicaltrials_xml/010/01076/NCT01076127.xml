	<brief_summary>Neck/shoulder and back pain is quite common among employees in sedentary occupations. Furthermore, many have a low level of fitness. Strength training with dumbbells has been shown to alleviate neck/shoulder pain, but many people prefer to also have alternative training options. Empirically, kettlebell training works the neck/shoulder/back while at the same time training the cardiovascular system. This type of training has not previously been tested in a randomized controlled trial. The aim of this study is to test the effect of kettlebell training on musculoskeletal pain, fitness, and muscle strength.</brief_summary>
