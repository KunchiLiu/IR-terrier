	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of a disease management programme (DMP) for very old patients with HF and significant co-morbidity. METHODS: A multicenter randomized trial will be conducted with 700 patients with heart failure, aged over 75 years, admitted to the acute-care units of the Geriatrics Departments in 8 hospitals. Patients will be randomly allocated to a DMP or to conventional usual-care. Randomization will be stratified by hospital and performed with concealment of the allocation list. The DMP will be conducted by a case manager, and will include three main components: 1. patient education to improve disease' knowledge and self-care 2. monitoring of clinical status 3. therapeutic adherence. Main statistical analyses will be performed according to the intention-to-treat principle, and will use Cox regression models to examine the association of a DMP with hospital readmission, quality-of-life, and mortality over 12 months.</brief_summary>
