Subjects indicated for implant or within six months postimplant of a Medtronic marketreleased lead connected to a marketreleased IPG, ICD, or CRT Device. The Medtronic lead must be used for a pacing, sensing, or defibrillation application. B. Subjects who participated in a qualifying study of a Medtronic cardiac therapy product and for whom: product is marketreleased complete implant and followup data, including productrelated adverse events, are available subject or appropriate legal guardian authorizes release of subject study data to SLS C. Subjects implanted with Medtronic CapSure Epi Leads (model 4965 and 4968) at a minimum of three preselected sites to retrospectively collect data for post approval requirements. Post approval requirements indicate 50 adult subjects implanted with a model 4965 and 100 subjects (pediatric and adult) implanted with a model 4968. The study plans to enroll approximately 100 subjects with a model 4965 lead and approximately 200 subjects with a model 4968 lead. Note: Subjects currently active in the Chronic Lead Study or Tachyarrhythmia Chronic Systems Study will continue in the followup phase of the SLS. Subjects receiving an implant of a Medtronic lead at a nonparticipating center and the implant data and current status cannot be confirmed within 30 days after implant Subjects who are, or will be inaccessible for followup at a SLS center Subjects implanted with a Medtronic cardiac therapy device whose predetermined enrollment limit for that specific product has been exceeded Subjects with exclusion criteria required by local law (EMEA only)</criteria>
