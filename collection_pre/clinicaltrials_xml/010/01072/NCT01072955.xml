	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to verify, through a randomized, blinded, parallel clinical trial, the efficacy of bovine heparin from Eurofarma Laboratory product when compared to porcine heparin APP Pharmaceutical in patients undergoing surgery cardiovascular disease and who require cardiopulmonary bypass, through the control of hemostasis during and after surgery, based on measurements of markers of coagulation ACT, aPTT, anti-Xa heparin levels and the excessive blood loss (hemorrhage) after the end of surgery.</brief_summary>
