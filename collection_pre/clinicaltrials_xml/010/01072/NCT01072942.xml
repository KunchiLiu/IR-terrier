	<brief_summary>The study will be conducted in a single-center, randomized, single-blinded, placebo-controlled, dose escalation design with two dose groups.Multiple-dose inhalation of Ciprofloxacin inhale 50 and 75 mg or placebo will be administered to 16 Japanese patients with COPD in totalPatients with moderate to severe COPD, stage II or III according to GOLD criteria, will participate in the study.The study will consist of 2 steps as indicated below; starting at Step 1 (50 mg) and escalating doses up to Step 2 (75 mg), after the tolerability of the dose in the previous step is confirmed. In each step, the study will be conducted as multiple dose study with b.i.d. regimen for 10 days (between day 2 and 11) in a randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled design. In addition, before and after the multiple dose administration, single administration will be conducted in each subject (day 0 and 12).</brief_summary>
