	<brief_summary>This is a single center pilot study designed to evaluate the effectiveness of an asthma education program in the pediatric emergency department. Asthma has reached epidemic proportions. Nine million American children are affected in the United States alone. This problem has increased 75% from 1980 to 1994, with a staggering 160% increase seen in children less than five years old.1 The American Lung Association has targeted this overwhelming problem on both national and local levels. Asthma impacts American communities who differ geographically, culturally, ethnically and by lifestyle, and as a result will present with different obstacles. The primary objectives are: to determine whether this educational intervention (through interactions with a child life specialist and using the asthma based computer game) in the pediatric ED can influence children's [and care givers'] knowledge and understanding of the disease process and treatment, and to improve asthma self-management and decrease morbidity by decreasing ED use and hospitalization. A secondary objective is to introduce the Child Life Specialist as an effective asthma educator and further strengthen the health care team. The target population will be recruited from the pediatric emergency department. We anticipate this study to recruit over a one year period and have a one year follow up with an anticipated enrollment of 64 children and families. There will be three Child Life Specialist involved in this program. After consent has been obtained, the child and parent will complete questionnaires (focusing on asthma knowledge, quality of life, and perception of asthma) and then a laptop will be provided to access the asthma based computer game. During the child's ED visit the Child Life Specialist will have opportunities to open communication to address barriers or concerns, and reinforce material provided by the game. Through these interactions, the importance of communication between the child, parent and healthcare provider is highlighted. The family will be given information to access the computer game via the internet. Follow up phone calls or e-mails will occur at 6 months, 9 months, and 12 months which will entail completing questionnaires. The questionnaires uses validated questions along with questions from the material covered through this asthma education study.</brief_summary>
