	<brief_summary>The leading risk factor for corneal transplant rejection is abnormal blood vessel growth of the host bed. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is thought to be a mediator of this corneal neovascularization (NV), therefore we would like to test the safety and efficacy of local VEGF blockade in the promotion of graft survival in high risk corneal transplants.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy of Bevacizumab in High-Risk Corneal Transplant Survival</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to test the effectiveness of a drug, bevacizumab (Avastin), in preventing blood vessels that often occur after a corneal transplantation which are considered at "high-risk" for rejection. In many cases these blood vessels lead to the graft rejection and eventual failure of the corneal transplant. It is hoped that this treatment will increase the chances of corneal graft survival. The medication used in this study is called bevacizumab or Avastin (Genentech, Inc). It works by inhibiting the action of a molecule called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). VEGF is a substance molecule that binds to certain cells to stimulate new blood vessel formation. When VEGF is bound to the drug, it cannot stimulate the formation and growth of new blood vessels. Growth of blood vessels into the cornea is a complication which can worsen the prognosis of your corneal transplant and put the transplant at a higher risk for rejection.</detailed_description>
