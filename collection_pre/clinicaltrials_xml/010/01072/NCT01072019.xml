	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the surgical and clinical outcomes of patients receiving total knee replacement with the same implant using two different types of cutting guides during surgery: 1. Standard knee cutting guides; 2. MRI generated patient specific custom cutting guides. Both types of cutting guides used in this study are registered with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and are routinely used for knee replacement surgery. However, it is unknown if one type of cutting guide has risks or benefits over the other.</brief_summary>
