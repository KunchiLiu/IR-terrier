	<brief_title>Confocal Laser Endomicroscopy (CLE) in Patients With Diarrhea</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: Diarrhea is characterized by frequent, loose, and watery bowel movements. Common causes include various gastrointestinal infections (e.g. clostridium difficile, salmonella), inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis, Crohn´s disease), drugs (e.g. antibiotics) and malabsorption syndromes (e.g. celiac and Whipple's disease). Confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE) is rapidly emerging as a valuable tool for gastrointestinal endoscopic imaging, enabling the endoscopist to obtain an "optical biopsy" of the gastrointestinal mucosa during the endoscopic procedure. Scope: In patients with diarrhea. Methods: Patients were randomized in two groups. Group 1: Patients underwent standard video colonoscopy for the evaluation of their symptoms. Group 2: During the endoscopic procedure CLE will be performed additionally. Procedure: The patient underwent colonoscopy. In Group 2 patients´ will receive intravenous fluorescein or topical mucosal staining with acriflavin or cresyl violet during the procedure, followed by in-vivo CLE of the tissue. Confocal images are digitally saved and analyzed afterwards.</detailed_description>
