	<brief_summary>Mucopurulent cervicitis (MPC) is a syndrome with associated symptoms including mucopurulent discharge (mucus and pus) from the cervix and other signs of inflammation such as easily induced cervical bleeding. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of no treatment versus empiric treatment with a single dose of cefixime and azithromycin for cure of MPC. Empiric treatment is the initiation of treatment prior to a firm diagnosis. Study participants will include 772 women ages 18 and older in good health with MPC. Women will be randomly assigned to 1 of 2 possible study groups: Group 1 will receive a single dose of cefixime and azithromycin antibiotics and Group 2 will receive placebo (inactive substance). Study procedures will include pelvic examination with a cervical swab sample. Participants will be involved in study related procedures for approximately 2 months, which includes 3 study visits.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Mucopurulent cervicitis (MPC) is a clinical syndrome characterized by the presence of mucopurulent discharge from the cervix and other signs of inflammation such as easily induced cervical bleeding. This phase III study is designed to evaluate the effectiveness of no treatment (placebo) versus empiric treatment with a single dose of cefixime 400 mg and azithromycin 1 gram for clinical cure of MPC at 2 months of follow-up. Secondary aims of the study are: to compare the pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) rate and adverse event rates between no treatment (placebo) versus empiric treatment; explore the role of bacterial vaginosis and Mycoplasma genitalium in the persistence of MPC; evaluate microbiological cure rate of M. genitalium in women treated with cefixime and azithromycin versus placebo; and present the clinical cure, partial response and failure proportions at 2-3 weeks and 2 months for each study arm. Participants will include 772 women greater than or equal to 18 years of age from Sexually Transmitted Disease (STD) or Family Planning (FP) clinics in good general health with MPC in New Orleans, LA; Birmingham, AL; Jackson, MS; Los Angeles, CA; and an additional site to be determined. Research specimens will be obtained at the time of the pelvic examination. As part of the study protocol, 3 cervical and 4 vaginal swabs will be collected at screening, follow-up visit 1, and follow-up visit 2. Eligible participants with clinical MPC at the time of their pelvic examination (cervical mucopus or easily induced cervical bleeding), will be consented, screened, enrolled, and randomized to one of the following arms: Group 1: empiric treatment: a single dose of cefixime 400 mg (1 capsule oral at 400 mg) and azithromycin 1 gm (2 capsules oral at 500 mg each) or Group 2: no treatment: placebo pills that look identical to the above medications. Subjects will be involved in study related procedures for 2 months.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Women greater than or equal to 18 years old in Sexually Transmitted Disease (STD) clinics or Family Planning clinics. Presence of cervical mucopus and/or easily induced cervical bleeding on pelvic exam via endocervical swab. Greater than or equal to 30 white blood cells (WBCs) per high power field in the cervical Gram stain. (Note: the cervical Gram stains will be sent to a central lab for review. The results will not be available at the time of enrollment. Subjects who do not meet this criterion will be withdrawn from the study at the time the results are available). Willingness to provide written informed consent Willing to abstain from sexual intercourse or use condoms during the entire study (approximately 2 months). Willing to abstain from using vaginal products during the entire study (approximately 2 months). Signs and symptoms of pelvic inflammatory disease, including cervical motion, uterine, or adnexal tenderness. History of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), ectopic pregnancy or recurrent cervicitis (3 or more episodes in the prior year) or written documentation of recent cervicitis (within past 30 days). Gonorrhea or Chlamydia on nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) at time of enrollment. (Participant testing positive for Neisseria gonorrhoeae (GC) or Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) on enrollment visit sample will be discontinued). Women with motile trichomonas on wet mount examination or positive trichomonas culture at time of enrollment. Women with symptomatic bacterial vaginosis (BV) (based on clinical Amsel criteria for BV and reported symptoms by participant, i.e. discharge, vaginal odor, etc). Use of vaginal products in past 48 hours (i.e. douching, use of vaginal medications or suppositories). History of chronic renal disease by verbal or documented history. Current use of probenecid. Nursing mothers. Colitis or coagulopathy as per patient selfreport. Known allergy to cephalosporins, penicillin or macrolides by verbal or documented history. History of latex allergy. Use of systemic antibiotics (oral or intravenous), vaginal antibiotics, vaginal antifungal, or oral antifungal use within 30 days of study enrollment. Women who will require antibiotic treatment due to GC or CT in a sexual partner. Serious underlying conditions, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or other primary or secondary immunosuppressive condition. Concomitant infection, which requires antimicrobial therapy (for example, urinary tract infection, sinusitis, skin and soft tissue infection, tooth abscess, etc.) or expected use of any antibiotic/antimicrobial therapy during the study. Menstruation at the time of screening visit. Women who are menstruating can be screened after cessation of bleeding. Active herpes outbreak at the time of enrollment determined by clinical observation. Suspected pregnancy or positive urine pregnancy test at screening or actively seeking pregnancy during study period. Any clinical adverse event, intercurrent illness, or other medical condition or situation as determined by the investigator that is present or occurs such that participation in the study would not be in the best interest of the participant. Previously enrolled in this study. Unable to follow the protocol (inc. inability to comply with the followup procedures). Failing to provide contact information.</criteria>
