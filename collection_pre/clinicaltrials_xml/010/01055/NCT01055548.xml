	<detailed_description>The aim is to explore the recent experience and views of parents in a qualitative way to assist the development of a questionnaire which can be used with a much larger group of parents. The interview guide with the topics to be covered will include: expectations, concerns and issues relating to the equipment used with their baby, any investigations, including cranial ultrasound and MR imaging and the information provided. The data collected will then inform the development of a standard instrument or questionnaire which will be used with parents participating in a trial using a randomised design to compare the influence of MR and ultrasound-based information on parental perceptions, stress and coping in association with healthcare usage and costs.</detailed_description>
