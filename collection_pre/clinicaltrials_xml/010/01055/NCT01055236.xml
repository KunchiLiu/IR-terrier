	<brief_title>Hydroxyzine for the Prevention of Pruritus From Spinal Morphine in Transabdominal Hysterectomy Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>80 patients scheduled for elective transabdominal hysterectomy under combined spinal-general anesthesia. they were randomized to receive either hydroxyzine 75 mg and midazolam 7.5 mg (ATR group) or placebo and midazolam 7.5 mg (control group) as premedication at least half an hour before operation. Clinical data (vital signs, pruritic score, nauseous score, sedation score, etc) was recorded at preoperative, intraoperative and 48-hour postoperative periods. All patients had spinal block with 0.5% heavy bupivacaine 2 ml with 0.3 mg preservative free morphine and general anesthesia with thiopental sodium 250-300 mg as induction, intubated with atracurium 0.6 mg/kg and maintenance with nitrous oxide, oxygen and isoflurane. Conventional reversal technique was done in all patients. Fentanyl intravenous was used for pain as needed, chlopheniramine syrup 2 tsp (4mg/10 ml) every 4 hours was used for pruritus and ondansetron intravenous (8 mg) was used for nausea/vomiting in postoperative period. The results were reported in number of patients or percent of patients who were suffered from pruritus, nausea, vomiting or sedation.</detailed_description>
