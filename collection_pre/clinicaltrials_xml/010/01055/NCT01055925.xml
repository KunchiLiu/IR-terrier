	<brief_summary>The almost single disadvantage of conventional polyurethane film dressings, an uncontrolled leakage, is probably as often described as its numerous advantages for split-thickness skin graft (STSG) donor sites. This shortcoming can be overcome by perforating the polyurethane dressing (MPD), which permits a controlled leakage into a secondary absorbent dressing. The study was conducted to compare the MPD-system and AquacelÂ® (ConvaTec), a hydrofiber wound dressing, which also seems to fulfill all criteria of an ideal donor site dressing.</brief_summary>
