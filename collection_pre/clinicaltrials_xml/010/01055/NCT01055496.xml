	<brief_summary>This is a phase 1 trial designed to evaluate safety and tolerability of chemotherapy in combination with inotuzumab ozogamicin, an investigational product, in adults with CD22-positive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The trial will involve two arms. In one arm, subjects will receive chemotherapy regimen R-CVP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, vincristine and prednisone). In the other arm, subjects will receive R-GDP (rituximab, gemcitabine, cisplatinum and dexamethasone). Subjects in both arms will also receive inotuzumab ozogamicin.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Dose escalation cohorts: subjects with diagnosis of CD22positive NonHodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL) who have had at least 1 prior anticancer treatment, including prior treatment with rituximab and chemotherapy. Expanded maximum tolerated dose (MTD) confirmation and preliminary efficacy cohorts: subjects with diagnosis of CD22positive NHL who have had at least 1 prior anticancer treatment, including prior treatment with rituximab and chemotherapy or newly diagnosed subjects who are not candidates for anthracyclinebased therapy. At least 1 measurable disease lesion that is &gt; 1 cm in the longest transverse diameter, with a product of the diameters &gt; 2.25 cm2 by CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Candidate for potentially curative therapy such as stem cell transplantation. Prior allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Prior autologous transplantation, radioimmunotherapy, or other anti CD22 immunotherapy &lt;= 6 months before the first dose of investigational product. More than 3 previous combination chemotherapy (2 or more cytotoxics) anticancer regimens.</criteria>
