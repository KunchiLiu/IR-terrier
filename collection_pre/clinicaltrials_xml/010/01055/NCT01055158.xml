	<brief_title>Telephone Based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for HIV Related Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Up to 40% of individuals receiving medical care for HIV meet DSM-IV criteria for co-occurring depressive disorder. Individuals with HIV and depressive disorders, compared to those with HIV alone, have been shown to have worse adherence to taking antiretroviral medication, increased HIV related morbidity and among women a higher mortality. Previous research suggests that mental health interventions may lead to improved depressive and HIV related outcomes. However because many HIV infected depressed individuals may have trouble accessing mental health services, there is an urgent need for treatment trials to assess whether treatment of depression targeting patients in urban HIV care settings will result in both improved depressive and HIV related outcomes. The goal of this project is to test the preliminary effectiveness of an adapted telephone-based, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) intervention targeting HIV infected depressed individuals receiving care in adult outpatient HIV clinics. A total of 60 HIV infected, depressed individuals receiving care at an urban, outpatient HIV clinic will be randomly assigned to receive either the telephone psychotherapy intervention or enhanced usual care with non-specific telephone contact. The results will provide preliminary data on whether the telephone psychotherapy intervention for HIV infected depressed individuals is effective in reducing depression. The results will also be used to determine feasibility, accessibility, and whether the intervention leads to improved retention and better satisfaction.</detailed_description>
