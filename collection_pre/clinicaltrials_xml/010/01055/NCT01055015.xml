	<brief_title>Double Blind Efficacy and Safety Study of Flexible-Dose vs Low-Dose Q8003 After Undergoing Primary Unilateral Total Knee Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 3 study is a two-arm, double-blind study to: - compare the analgesic efficacy and safety of the flexible regimen of Q8003 (6 mg/4 mg up to 24 mg/16 mg) administered every 4-6 hours over a 48-hour Treatment Period versus low dose Q8003 (every 4-6 hours 3 mg/2 mg with a 6 mg/4 mg loading dose) to inpatients with moderate to severe postoperative pain who have undergone primary unilateral total knee arthroplasty. - to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Q8003 when administered in the Voluntary Extension Period starting at 48 hours after the initial dosing and extending up to Day 12.</detailed_description>

Was dosed with another investigational drug within 30 days prior to the Screening Visit or has previously received treatment with Q8003. Current therapy with central nervous system depressant medications that might increase the risks of treatment with opioids (other than those used with surgical anesthesia). Current evidence of alcohol abuse (regularly drinks more than 4 units of alcohol per day; 1 unit = Â½ pint of beer, 1 glass of wine, or 1 ounce of spirit). History of abusing licit or illicit drug substances within five (5) years of study entry.
