	<brief_summary>Fluoroquinolone is a one of the most important drugs for treatment of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB). Among them, levofloxacin and moxifloxacin has been used most widely. However, there is no study to directly compare the efficacy of levofloxacin and moxifloxacin among MDR-TB patients. The investigators will compare the efficacy of levofloxacin and moxifloxacin through a prospective multicenter randomized open label phase III trial.</brief_summary>
