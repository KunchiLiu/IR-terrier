	<brief_summary>Sildenafil is a phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor that has been approved for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension with orphan drug designation. Sildenafil modulates the nitric oxide (NO) pathway in the vessel wall. Since this pathway is impaired in pulmonary arteries of patients with pulmonary hypertension (PH) associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the investigators hypothesized that sildenafil might improve pulmonary hemodynamics and increase exercise tolerance in this condition.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Sildenafil Effects in Combination With Rehabilitation in Patients With Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and Associated Pulmonary Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It is a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trial to assess the effect of 3 months treatment with sildenafil (20 mg/8 h), added to a pulmonary rehabilitation program, on exercise tolerance. Subjects: 60 patients (30 by treatment group). Main end-point variable: endurance time in constant work exercise test (CWET). Other measurements: 6 min walk distance, performance in incremental exercise test, physiological and metabolic response at iso-time and iso-load in CWET, dyspnea, and health-related quality of life.</detailed_description>
