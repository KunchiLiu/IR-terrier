	<detailed_description>ACCORDO is a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, and placebo-controlled study conducted in 12 Italian centres. Subjects are screened by means of the BDI-IA (cut-off 15) and randomised to treatment with rasagiline or placebo for 12 weeks. Subjects have to be on stable treatment with dopaminergic agents at least 4 weeks before baseline, and maintained so during the course of the study. The primary objective is to evaluate whether rasagiline compared to placebo improves depressive symptoms as evaluated by the BDI-IA total score.</detailed_description>
