	<brief_summary>This study will test the hypotheses that a single dose of oxyntomodulin (OXM) will be neutral or better than placebo in lowering ambient glucose levels during a graded glucose infusion (GGI) and that a single dose of OXM will lead to a statistically significant increase in the sum of the plasma βOHB + AcAc levels compared to placebo.</brief_summary>
