	<detailed_description>Summary and Synthesis: Epidemiological studies have established the occurrence of high rates of AD in persons with PTSD. Likewise, studies of alcohol/drug abuse treatment seekers have documented high rates of trauma exposure and PTSD. The high prevalence of PTSD/AD comorbidity is the cause of enormous human suffering, most of which either goes untreated or is resistant to treatment efforts. Both theory and research concerning the interface between these two disorders suggests that PTSD is associated with the initiation of excessive alcohol use and/or the development of AD by way of an escape/avoidance behavioral mechanism wherein escalating alcohol use is reinforced by its ability to dampen the negative emotions and arousal associated with PTSD. If PTSD is often a primary cause of the initiation and maintenance of AD, then clinical interventions that primarily impact PTSD should lead to significant improvements in craving for, and use of, alcohol. The findings of two recent treatment studies offer especially compelling support for this expectation. Drawing on both basic neuroscience research and a developing body of suggestive clinical/applied research, we were led to consider if the putative memory modulating properties of the adrenergic antagonist propranolol might have therapeutic benefits for PTSD/AD comorbid individuals. Thus, the proposed study will test the hypothesis that the strategic administration of propranolol coupled with the elicitation/retrieval of trauma-related memories will dampen emotional distress, alcohol craving and cue reactivity during subsequent exposure to trauma- and alcohol-related cues. A two-week follow-up laboratory session and clinical assessment will permit us to evaluate whether treatment benefits are maintained over time and if there are any changes in alcohol use and PTSD symptomatology.</detailed_description>
