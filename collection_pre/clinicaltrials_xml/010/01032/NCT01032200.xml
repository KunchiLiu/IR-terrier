	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Armodafinil may help relieve fatigue and improve quality of life in patients with cancer receiving radiation therapy to the brain. PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well armodafinil works in treating fatigue caused by radiation therapy in patients with primary brain tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Armodafinil in Treating Fatigue Caused By Radiation Therapy in Patients With Primary Brain Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To estimate study accrual, adherence, retention, and participation of patients with primary brain tumors undergoing partial- or whole-brain radiotherapy who are randomized to receive armodafinil or placebo. - To estimate the variability of fatigue, quality of life, and neurocognitive function in these patients. Secondary - To obtain a preliminary estimate of the effect of armodafinil on fatigue as measured by the fatigue subscale of the FACIT-F and the Brief Fatigue Inventory. - To estimate the rates of toxicity and adverse events associated with armodafinil. - To obtain preliminary estimates of the effect of armodafinil on sleepiness as measured by the Epworth Sleep Scale; overall quality of life and brain-specific quality of life as measured by the FACT-G with the brain subscale; and cognitive function as measured by a comprehensive Wake Forest Cognitive Function Battery. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to therapy (radiotherapy alone vs radiotherapy and chemotherapy) and Karnofsky performance status (60-80% vs 90-100%). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms. - Arm I: Patients receive oral armodafinil once daily beginning no later than the fifth fraction of brain radiotherapy and continuing for 9-11 weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. - Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo once daily beginning no later than the fifth fraction of brain radiotherapy and continuing for 9-11 weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. Patients complete questionnaires assessing fatigue, quality of life, and neurocognitive function at baseline and periodically during study.</detailed_description>
