	<criteria>Eligible patients had mid or lower thoracic esophageal cancers that were confirmed on histology to be a squamous cell carcinoma deemed to be resectable. The investigators excluded those patients who had distant metastasis to solid visceral organs or local invasion into trachea, descending aorta, or recurrent laryngeal nerve. Those patients who were older than 75 years or who had a serious premorbid condition or a poor physical status that compromised a thoracotomy were also excluded.</criteria>
