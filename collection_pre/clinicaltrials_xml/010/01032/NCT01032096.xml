	<brief_summary>The main objective of this pilot study is to observe and document the range of changes in the blood concentrations of certain hormones, inflammatory chemicals and immune chemicals in response to the stimulus of Head and Neck cancer</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Physiological Response to Routine Head and Neck Cancer Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This project is in keeping with the strategy of the anaesthetic and intensive care departments to push towards greater understanding of the immune, metabolic and inflammatory changes associated with surgery and how these may be modified through use of different anaesthetic and intensive care techniques. Through increased understanding of the stress, inflammatory and immune responses to surgery we may be able to modulate peri-operative care to reduce cytotoxic(Natural Killer and Cytotoxic T cell) immunosuppression and hence micrometastatic spread at the time of surgery in future studies.</detailed_description>
