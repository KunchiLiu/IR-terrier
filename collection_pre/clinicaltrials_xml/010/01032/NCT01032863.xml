	<brief_summary>Study hypothesis:- Benign joint hyper mobility syndrome which persists into adulthood is a special type of benign joint hyper mobility which is more likely to predispose to chronic musculoskeletal pain. Young Indian adults aged between 25 and 40 years who are blood donors or relatives of patients admitted as inpatient or presenting to the out patient department, in Amrita Institute of Medical Sciences will be enrolled, after excluding the exclusionary criteria. They will be assessed for the presence of chronic musculoskeletal pain using a validated self filled questionnaire. The primary investigator who will be blinded to their response will examine them for the presence of Benign Joint Hyper mobility Syndrome and for tender points suggestive of fibromyalgia. Primary Objective:- To determine whether chronic musculoskeletal pain is associated with Hypermobility among Indian adults. Study design:- Cross sectional survey</brief_summary>
