	<brief_summary>It is essential that anaesthetists successfully perform orotracheal intubation in scenarios in which intubation is potentially more difficult, such as where the neck is immobilized. The Airtraq® Laryngoscope and the CMAC are new intubating devices. They are designed to provide a view of the glottis without alignment of the oral, pharyngeal and tracheal axes. These devices may be especially effective in situations where intubation of the trachea is potentially difficult. The efficacy of these devices in comparison to the traditional Macintosh laryngoscope in situations where the cervical spine is immobilized is not known. The investigators aim to compare the performances of the Airtraq® Laryngoscope and the CMAC to that of the Macintosh laryngoscope, the gold standard device, in patients in which the cervical spine has been immobilized by means of a Manual in-line stabilization of the spine. Hypothesis: The primary hypothesis is that, in the hands of experienced anaesthetists, time to intubation would be shorter using the indirect laryngoscopes, than using the Macintosh laryngoscope in simulated difficult laryngoscopy.</brief_summary>
