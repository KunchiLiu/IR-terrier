	<brief_title>The EFFect of hIgh Dose ClopIdogrel treatmENT in Patients With Clopidogrel Resistance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aim: Primary objective: - To evaluate the effect of continuing high dose clopidogrel treatment on adverse cardiac events after elective PCI in patients with clopidogrel resistance Secondary objective: - To evaluate the effect of continuing high dose clopidogrel treatment on adverse cardiac events after elective PCI - To evaluate the effect of continuing high dose clopidogrel treatment on bleeding complications after elective PCI - To evaluate the clinical effect of VerifyNow which use as a clopidogrel resistance kit. Study central: Bursa Postgraduate Hospital, Cardiology Clinic Study population: we planned to enrol 180 patients. 50% of patients without clopidogrel resistance (control group: 90 patients) 50% have clopidogrel resistance. Than we randomise the patients (with clopidogrel resistance) in two groups (group 1:45 patients (75mg/day), group 2:45 patients (150mg/day)) inclusion criteria: - The patients; who have planned elective PCI and have had written informed consent for participation to study. - Age&gt;18 year-old, - The native coronary artery;lesion with narrowing &gt;=70% Exclusion criteria: - Patients have allergy for ASA, Clopidogrel and heparin - Patients who performed primary PCI - Patients with acute coronary syndrome - Patients with have a history of PCI and use clopidogrel - Patients on warfarin therapy - Patients who have bleeding diathesis, or have high risk for bleeding. Study works: - Write case report form for all patients - Control for inclusion criteria. - Evaluate the clopidogrel and ASA resistance with VerifyNow kit. Than randomised the patients. - Demographic data (age, gender) - Height, weight, BMI and GFR - Risk factors - laboratory data (biochemical and hematologic) - Medication history - Echocardiographic data - Angiographic data - PCI data(vessel diameter, stent diameter, lesion and stent length, performed PTCA or not, etc) - Note complication (MACE, bleeding, hematoma etc) 4 weeks later note the first control data and re assess the clopidogrel resistance with VerifyNow kit in patients groups 1 and 2. Six months later note the second control data.</detailed_description>
