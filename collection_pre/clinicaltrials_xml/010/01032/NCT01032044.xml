	<brief_summary>This study focuses on demonstrating the value of probe-based Confocal Laser Endomicroscopy (pCLE) in guiding endoscopic therapeutic procedures in Barrett's Esophagus (BE). It is a randomized controlled outcomes study including patients already treated for Barrett's Esophagus lesion(s) and undergoing high definition white light endoscopy follow up procedure, with or without pCLE (2 arms will be considered in this study). The procedures will be carried out per standards of practice with appropriately trained physicians.</brief_summary>
