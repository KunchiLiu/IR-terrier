	<brief_summary>This phase is to register all subjects in Monroe County, New York with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) not already included to update the database for years 1990-2003. This will give us a truly population based study which will add to our knowledge of IBD epidemiology, allowing us to compare our rates with the rest of the world. We will be able to provide accurate incidence data from 1980 to 2000, and point prevalence from 12/31/2000. It will have special significance because of the relatively stable Monroe County population prior to 2000 (population in 1970=711,917; population in 2000 = 735,343).</brief_summary>
