	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy of AIN457 in Patients With Quiescent Non-infectious Uveitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description />
	<mesh_term>Uveitis</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Patients with quiescent chronic, noninfectious intermediate uveitis, posterior uveitis or panuveitis as evidenced by &lt;1+ anterior chamber cell grade and &lt;1+ vitreous haze in both eyes for at least 6 weeks prior to screening. Requirement for either of the following immunosuppressive therapies at any time within the past 3 months for the treatment or prevention of uveitis which must not have been increased within the 6 weeks prior to screening: Prednisone or equivalent ≥10 mg daily. ≥1 periocular injection or ≥1 intravitreal corticosteroid injection (i.e. triamcinolone) in the study eye within the past 6 months (the last injection must not have been given 6 weeks prior to screening.) Treatment with either cyclosporine, tacrolimus, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, mycophenolic acid, methotrexate as monotherapy or in combination with or without steroids. (Patients treated with chlorambucil or cyclophosphamide within the past 5 years are ineligible for the study.) Patients not meeting the above specified criteria for immunosuppressive therapies are eligible for enrollment if they are intolerant to systemic immunosuppressive therapy as determined by the study investigator. Ocular concomitant conditions/disease Patients with a primary diagnosis of Behcet's disease, anterior uveitis or any intermediate uveitis, posterior uveitis or panuveitis in which the manifestation(s) of the active intraocular inflammatory disease may spontaneously resolve or that are not characterized by the presence of either anterior chamber cells or vitritis (vitreous cell and haze) such as the white dot retinochoroidopathies (i.e. Punctate inner choroidopathy (PIC), acute zonal occult outer retinopathy (AZOOR.) Patients with active, noninfectious intermediate, posterior or panuveitis in one or both eyes (≥1+ anterior chamber cells and /or ≥1+ vitreous haze.) Patients receiving or that may require corticosteroids (prednisone or equivalent) ≥1 mg/kg/day to maintain quiescence of their intraocular inflammation. Ocular treatments Treatment with intravitreal antiVEGF agents administered to the study eye within 3 months prior to screening. Treatment with fluocinolone acetonide implant (Retisert®) in the study eye within the last 3 years, or dexamethasone intravitreal implant and any other investigational corticosteroid implants in the study eye within the last 6 months. Intraocular surgery or laser photocoagulation in the study eye within the last 6 weeks prior to screening except for a diagnostic vitreous or aqueous tap with a smallgauge needle. Systemic conditions or treatments Any systemic biologic therapy (e.g. interferon, infliximab, daclizumab, etanercept, or adalimumab) given intravenously or subcutaneously within 3 months prior to screening. No biologic therapy other than the investigational study treatment will be allowed during the course of the clinical trial. Any prior treatment with systemic alkylating agents (cyclophosphamide, chlorambucil) within the past 5 years prior to screening. Treatment with any live or liveattenuated vaccine (including vaccine for varicellazoster or measles) within 2 months prior to screening. No treatment with live or liveattenuated vaccines will be allowed during the course of the clinical trial. Other protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply</criteria>
