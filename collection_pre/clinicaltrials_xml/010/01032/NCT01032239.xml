	<brief_summary>To demonstrate that Intrathecal Baclofen (ITB) Therapy, compared to Best Medical Treatment (BMT), has superior efficacy in the treatment of severe spasticity in adult post-stroke patients with generalized spastic hypertonia who have not reached their therapy goal with other treatment interventions assessed by a decrease in the average Ashworth Scale (AS) score in the lower extremities.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>SISTERS: Spasticity In Stroke Study - Randomized Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized, controlled open-label parallel group study to demonstrate the efficacy benefit of ITB Therapy over BMT in post-stroke patients with severe spasticity who have not reached their therapy goal with other treatment interventions. In order to evaluate the efficacy benefit of ITB Therapy over BMT in post-stroke patients, a two-arm parallel group design will be applied. Patients will be equally randomized to one of two treatment arms: 1. ITB Therapy arm; or 2. BMT arm The study consists of a run-in phase of 21 days for the BMT treatment arm and 2-25 days for the ITB Therapy treatment arm, followed by a 6 month active trial. The BMT treatment arm will receive a combination of oral antispastic medication and physiotherapy. Patients must be prescribed at least one or a combination of the following oral antispastic medications: oral baclofen, tizanidine, diazepam (or other benzodiazepines) or dantrolene. Following the run-in phase, patients will enter the 6 month active trial. The ITB Therapy treatment arm will receive a combination of ITB Therapy and physiotherapy. During the run-in phase, a test with intrathecal baclofen will be performed to evaluate the response of the patient. Patients fulfilling the test success criterium will be implanted with a Medtronic SynchroMed®II infusion system. Following implant, patients will enter into the 6 month active trial, which includes a 6 week titration phase, during which time oral antispastic medications must be gradually reduced with complete discontinuation by the end of the titration period. During the 6 month active trial, patients will be assessed at 3 and 6 months. All primary and secondary endpoint assessments will be performed by a blinded assessor. The total study duration is expected to be 60 months, including a 39 month enrollment period. The total duration per patient is approximately 7 months (approximately 1 month run-in period followed by 6 months active treatment).</detailed_description>
