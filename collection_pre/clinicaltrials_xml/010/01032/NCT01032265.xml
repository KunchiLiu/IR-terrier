	<brief_title>Web-based Management of Female Stress Urinary Incontinence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Female urinary incontinence is very common and affects up to one fourth of grownup women. It may reduce quality of life for those affected and costs for society are high. The most common type of urinary incontinence is stress urinary incontinence (SUI), i.e leakage when coughing, sneezing or jumping. There is no association between SUI and serious medical conditions. Thus investigation can be kept to a minimum, including structured history taking and a bladder diary for correct diagnosis. Treatment with lifestyle intervention and pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) give improvement or cure in 60-70% of women. A small study indicates that treatment with cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) may improve incontinence-related quality of life and symptoms of urinary incontinence. Web-based management of SUI has as far as we know never been evaluated in a randomized controlled study. The aim of this study is to determine if web-based management of female SUI, with a treatment using PFMT and elements of CBT is effective compared to treatment supported by a pamphlet. The duration of the treatment programme is three months, follow-up at four months, 1 year and two years.</detailed_description>
