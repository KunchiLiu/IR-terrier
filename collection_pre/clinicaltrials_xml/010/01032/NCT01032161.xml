	<brief_summary>Despite recent advances in postoperative delirium research, the proportion of children with postoperative delirium is still high. Although postoperative delirium is a frequent complication and is associated with the need for more inpatient hospital care and longer length of hospital stay, little is known about risk factors for recovery room delirium (RRD) occurred in postanaesthesia care unit. The aim of the study was to determine pre- and intraoperative risk factors for the development of RRD among children undergoing non cardiovascular surgery.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Recovery room delirium (RRD) defined as delirium occurred in PACU was diagnosed according to RASS-PAEDS criteria. Pre-, intra-, and postoperative data of patients undergoing elective non cardiovascular surgery were prospectively collected, univariate and multivariate logistic regression were performed to find the risk factors related to postoperative delirium.</detailed_description>
