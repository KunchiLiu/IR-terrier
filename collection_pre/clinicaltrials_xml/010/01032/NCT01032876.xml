	<brief_summary>Neonates with a congenital heart defect are often in need of early cardiac surgery. In complex congenital heart defects, cardiopulmonary bypass is usually employed, with or without deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (DHCA). The brain is especially vulnerable to ischemic injury, which puts neonates undergoing complex operations at high risk of neurodevelopmental disorders. Selective antegrade cerebral perfusion (ACP) instead of DHCA during these complex operations may contribute to less cerebral damage, but literature is not conclusive on this issue. Therefore, the investigators will perform a randomised controlled trial comparing DHCA and ACP in neonatal aortic arch reconstructions, focusing on cerebral damage and neurological outcome.</brief_summary>
