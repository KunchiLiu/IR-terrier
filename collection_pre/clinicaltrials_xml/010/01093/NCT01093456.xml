	<brief_title>Diurnal Variation of Uremic Solutes in Peritoneal Dialysis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Many epidemiological studies have pointed to the association between serum parameters of phosphate metabolism (phosphate, FGF23) and microbiotic protein fermentation (p-cresyl sulphate [PCS], indoxyl sulphate [IS]) on the one hand and increased risk of all-cause and cardiovascular death on the other hand. Hypothesis: Due to failing feed-back mechanisms, diurnal variation of serum concentrations of serum phosphate and fermentation metabolites will be more pronounced in dialysis patients, especially in those with negligible residual kidney function. Clinical studies assessing this issue are scarce to non-existing.</detailed_description>
