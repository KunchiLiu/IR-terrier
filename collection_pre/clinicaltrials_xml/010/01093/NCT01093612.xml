	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Diagnostic procedures, such as copper Cu 64-DOTA-trastuzumab-labeled PET, may help doctors to plan a better treatment PURPOSE: This pilot trial is studying copper Cu 64-tetra-azacyclododecanetetra-acetic acid (DOTA)-trastuzumab-labeled positron emission tomography (PET) in women with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the dose of pre-administered cold antibody that optimizes image quality of 64Cu-DOTA-trastuzumab PET without increasing the radiation dose to the heart in women with metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer. II. Determine whether tumor uptake on 64Cu-DOTA-trastuzumab PET correlates with tumor expression of HER2 in women with metastatic disease. III. Perform an exploratory analysis of the relationship between uptake on 64Cu-DOTA-trastuzumab PET, HER2 overexpression, and inactivation of the PI3K/Akt pathway. OUTLINE: This is a part one dose-determining study followed by a part two study. PART ONE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 dose levels. Patients undergo a PET scan 24-48 hours after injection of 64 Cu-DOTA-trastuzumab. PART TWO: Patients undergo a PET scan 24-48 hours after injection of 64 Cu-DOTA-trastuzumab at the optimal dose as determined in part one of the study.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Eligibility Part I (Determination of the cold dose) Participants must be women who have histological confirmation of metastatic invasive breast cancer that has metastasized outside the region of the primary tumor and axilla. Biopsy must be obtained within 28 days prior to study. Patients must have metastatic disease in lung, liver, softtissue or bone to qualify for the study (more than one site is permissible). At least 1 nonhepatic site of metastasis greater than or equal to 2 cm in mean diameter must be identified in addition to the site that was biopsied. The cancer must over express HER2 as determined by IHC and FISH. Patients may have received trastuzumab in the adjuvant, neoadjuvant, or metastatic setting, but cannot have received the drug within the prior 2 months. Participants must have normal cardiac ejection fraction. Eligibility Part 2 (correlation of HER2 expression with PET uptake) Participants must be women who have histological confirmation of metastatic invasive breast cancer that has metastasized outside the region of the primary tumor and axilla. Biopsy must be obtained within 28 days prior to study. Patients must have metastatic disease in lung, liver, softtissue or bone to qualify for the study (more than one site is permissible). At least 1 nonhepatic site of metastasis site greater than or equal to 2 cm in mean diameter must be identified in addition to the site that was biopsied. Participants with HER2 1+, 2+ and 3+ by IHC are eligible. Patients may have received trastuzumab in the adjuvant, neoadjuvant, or metastatic setting, but cannot have received the drug within the prior 2 months. Participants must have normal cardiac ejection fraction. Ineligibility Participants who have received trastuzumab within the prior 2 months Participants who are not considered candidates for trastuzumab Metastatic disease in a single site No metastatic site greater than or equal to 2 cm Concurrent malignancy other than skin cancer Inability to provide informed consent Participants who are pregnant</criteria>
