	<brief_summary>The investigators hypothesize that intensive acid suppression with a long acting high potency proton pump inhibitor (PPI) drug dexlansoprazole will lead to a greater decrease in levels of inflammatory mediators (compared to conventional PPIs) in the esophagus, which could potentially lead to decreased recurrence of intestinal metaplasia following endoscopic ablation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Does Intensive Acid Suppression Reduce Esophageal Inflammation and Recurrent Barrett's Esophagus Following Ablation?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients who achieve complete remission of intestinal metaplasia following ablation will be randomized (using concealed allocation, like the flip of a coin) to either intensive acid suppression with dexlansoprazole 60-90 mg/day or to symptom guided acid suppression with escalating doses of omeprazole (20-60 mg/day) for 6 months. Control of reflux will be assessed using 24 hour ambulatory pH monitoring. The need to escalate drug dosage at the 3 month visit will be determined by presence of excessive acid exposure on ambulatory pH monitoring. Biopsies of esophageal tissue will be obtained at baseline, then at 3 months and 6 months following randomization to measure changes in inflammatory biomarkers.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients who have undergone ablation for Barrett's Esophagus (BE) and High Grade Dysplasia (HGD) or Low Grade Dysplasia (LGD) with Photodynamic Therapy (PDT)/Radiofrequency ablation and endoscopic mucosal resection who have no endoscopic and histologic evidence of specialized intestinal metaplasia on biopsies from the esophagus on two successive endoscopies post ablation will be offered enrollment in the study. Inclusion criteria: 1. Absence of intestinal metaplasia on endoscopy (under Narrow Band Imaging) and on histology (from biopsies taken from gastroesophageal junction and distal esophagus) on two successive surveillance endoscopies. 2. Able to consent to study 3. Males and females age 1890 4. Life expectancy of 5 years or greater. Exclusion criteria: 1. Pregnancy 2. Inability to consent for the procedure 3. Anticoagulation therapy precluding performance of ambulatory pH monitoring and/or biopsies 4. Intolerance to proton pump inhibitors 5. Elevation in Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), (liver enzymes), bilirubin or alkaline phosphatase more than five times the upper limit of normal.</criteria>
