	<brief_title>White Light Scanning to Aid Body Contouring: A Pilot Project</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A 3-D digital body camera that employs non-intrusive white light phase profilometry and 24 coordinated charge-coupled cameras scans and produces a "point cloud" image of the subject. The result of the two-minute scan process is an accurate three-dimensional body model of the subject, consisting of over 1.2 million surface points. The point cloud is compressed to provide programmable measurement extraction profiles (MEP's) that automatically extracts linear and circumferential measurements. Subjects are scanned and anthropometrically measured pre-operatively, and at 3, 6 and 9 months post-op.</detailed_description>
