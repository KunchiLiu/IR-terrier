	<brief_summary>The present study aimed to investigate the efficacy and process of change that occurs in Attention Training in comparison to an established treatment for social phobia, Cognitive Therapy. A randomized trial was conducted in which participants were allocated to either six weeks of Attention Training or Cognitive Therapy. It was hypothesized that both treatments would be effective in reducing social phobia symptoms, but that Attention Training would work primarily by reducing levels of self focused attention, while Cognitive Therapy would work through changes to probability and threat appraisals.</brief_summary>
