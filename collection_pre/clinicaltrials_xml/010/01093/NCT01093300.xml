	<brief_summary>In-stent restenosis (ISR) lesions are considered one of the toughest lesions that interventional cardiologists encounter in the drug eluting stent (DES) era. The current consensus in treating ISR is implantation of another DES into the restenosed segment. However the recent results of paclitaxel-releasing balloon catheter (PRBC) in ISR lesions have been very encouraging. The aim of HOST-ISR trial is to investigate the efficacy and safety of PRBC compared with everolimus-eluting stent (EES) in preventing neointimal growth in ISR lesions. HOST-ISR trial is a multicenter, open-label, prospective, randomized trial to test whether PRBC is non-inferior to EES in preventing neointimal growth in ISR lesions. It plans to enroll a total of 264 patients with ISR, randomizing the cohort 1:1 to either PRBC or EES. The primary endpoint will be in-segment late luminal loss at 9 months angiographical follow-up.</brief_summary>
