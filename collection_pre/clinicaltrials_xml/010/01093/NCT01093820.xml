	<brief_summary>Hypothesis: Based on available pharmacokinetic data from healthy volunteers we hypothesize that the administration of a cumulative dose of 210μg of the continuous erythropoietin receptor activator, Mircera® (Roche), during 3 months post percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) does not result in hemoglobin (Hb) levels &gt;15 g/dl in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) Design: Prospective, open label single center pilot study</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hemoglobin Kinetics in Response to Mircera® in Patients With Acute Myocardial Infarction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This pilot trial will include 8 patients. The inclusion of 8 patients will allow to perform representative statistics of expected Hb kinetics in response to Mircera®.</detailed_description>
