	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to test the pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of an intravenous infusion of a drug called Ganite (gallium nitrate) in patients with cystic fibrosis. We want to see this drug is safe and tolerable and to see if high levels of the drug are found in the sputum.

	<brief_title>A Pharmacokinetic and Safety Study of IV Gallium Nitrate (Ganite) in Cystic Fibrosis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a two center pharmacokinetic and safety dosing study of IV gallium nitrate (Ganite®) in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. Eighteen subjects are planned. Each subject will be administered a single 5-day infusion of study medication (one of 2 doses). No placebo is used. Each subject will receive 5 days of continuous infusion of the experimental treatment. There will be two dosing cohorts (cohort 1: 100 mg/m2/day and cohort 2: 200 mg/m2/day). Cohort 2 will begin enrollment only after Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) safety review and approval of cohort 1 data. Study visits occur at baseline (day 1), day 3 (visit 2), day 6 (visit 3), day 8 (visit 4), day 14 (visit 5), day 28 (visit 6), and day 56 (visit 7). Screening data will be reviewed to determine subject eligibility. Subjects who meet all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be entered into the study. The following treatment regimens will be used: • Experimental treatment continuous infusion of gallium nitrate at the following doses cohort 1: 100 mg/m2/day and cohort 2: 200 mg/m2/day All subjects who receive at least one dose of study medication will be considered evaluable for safety and efficacy analyses. Incidence of adverse events will be monitored during the trial. Primary endpoints will be assessment of pharmacokinetic and safety/tolerability data. Secondary efficacy assessments will be based on changes in lung function and sputum P. aeruginosa density in sputum. Total duration of subject participation will be five weeks. Total duration of the study is expected to be 20 months.</detailed_description>
