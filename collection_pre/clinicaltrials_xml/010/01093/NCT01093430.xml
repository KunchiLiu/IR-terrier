	<brief_title>Is the Anterior Superior Iliac Spine a Useful Landmark at Laparoscopy?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We plan to study patients undergoing gynaecological laparoscopy. Patients will be randomized to two techniques for determining where to position the right and left lateral laparoscopic ports, and port symmetry will be assessed at the end of surgery. We also plan to study patients undergoing any type of gynaecological surgery to determine the incidence of sensory neuropathy involving the lower abdomen according to the route of surgery.</detailed_description>
