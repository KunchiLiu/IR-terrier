	<brief_summary>Among 10 premenopausal women with Metabolic Syndrome: Specific Aim 1: Compare the effects of acute fat feeding on flow mediated dilation (FMD) as measured by brachial artery reactivity among three fat challenges (saturated fat vs. monounsaturated fat (MUFA) vs. polyunsaturated fat (PUFA)at 4 hours post feeding. Hypothesis Saturated fat feeding will impair FMD but MUFA and PUFA feeding will not. Specific Aim 2: Compare the effects of acute feeding on vascular inflammation as measured by VCAM and sICAM among three fat challenges at 3 1/2 hours post feeding. Hypothesis: Saturated fat feeding will increase vascular inflammation but MUFA and PUFA will not.</brief_summary>
