	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to evaluate the security issues and efficacy of coronary stenting Cobalt Chrome covered with sirolimus-eluting Cobalt Chrome platform in patients with coronary artery lesion.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Trial of Bare Metal Stent - Cobalt Chromium Versus Stent Coating With Sirolimus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients will be treated in compliance with the eligibility criteria, with stent study of 16-19mm. All patients are clinically followed for 60 months after the procedure and will undergo a control angiography 6 months. Can be treated multiple lesions, measuring between 2.5-3.5mm (by visual estimate). Patients enrolled will be randomized in a 1:2 propose in one of the groups with or without stent coating, respectively. And a randomized clinical trial, prospective study in 5 centers including 60 patients.</detailed_description>

Subject is currently participating in an investigational drug or another device study, including planned participation in an investigational drug or another device study during the course of the present investigation; 13. Coronary angioplasty (with or without stenting) less than 9 months before the index procedure at any site of the target vessel; 14. Previous coronary angioplasty (with or without stenting) at any time (&gt;9 months) in a vessel segment less than 5 mm proximal or distal to the target lesion. 15. Planned coronary angioplasty (with or without stenting) in the first 12 months after the index procedure in any segment of the target vessel; 4.3. ANGIOGRAPHIC EXCLUSION CRITERIA 1.
