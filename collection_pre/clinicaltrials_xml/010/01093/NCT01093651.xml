	<brief_title>Dipeptidyl Peptidase-4 Inhibition and Immune Function in HIV</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infection and treatment with antiretroviral therapies are associated with several cardiometabolic risk factors; insulin resistance, diabetes, dyslipidemia, central adiposity, that increase risk for MI and stroke. A new class of drugs used to treat type 2 diabetes has been introduced; Dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPPIV)-inhibitors (Januvia®, Onglyza®, alogliptin). Dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPPIV)-inhibition could be a safe and effective therapy for HIV-associated insulin resistance and diabetes. However, no safety data exist. The research question is: If HIV+ adults with stable immunologic (CD4+ T-cell count &gt;350 cells/μL) and virologic (plasma HIV RNA &lt;50 copies/mL) function are given a DPPIV-inhibitor would their CD4+ T-cell count and plasma HIV RNA level increase, decrease, or stay the same? Theoretically, DPPIV-inhibition could enhance their immune system by increasing SDF-1α levels; a potent inhibitor of HIV-entry into T-cells, or harm the HIV+ immune system by inactivating CD26 on immune cells. We hypothesize that DPPIV-inhibition will not harm the immune system in HIV+ people. We propose a blinded randomized controlled pilot safety trial of an FDA-approved DPPIV-inhibitor in virologically- and immunologically-stable HIV+ men and women. We will monitor CD4+ T-cell count, plasma HIV RNA levels, immune activation markers, and safety outcomes (lipid/lipoprotein profiles, blood pressure, kidney and liver function) during 4-6 months of DPPIV-inhibitor exposure vs placebo in 20 HIV+ adults. If safety is confirmed, the efficacy of DPPIV-inhibition in HIV+ with insulin resistance will be tested in future trials that examine potential glucoregulatory and cardiovascular benefits.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Thirty 1865 yr old HIVinfected men and women (with source documentation of HIV status) who are stable on any antiretroviral therapy (cART) regimen 2. Have stable (at least the past 12months) immunologic (&gt;350 CD4+ Tcells/µL) and virologic (&lt;50 copies HIV RNA/mL) status. 3. BMI 1842kg/m2; 4. Normal blood chemistry for at least 1 month prior to enrollment; 5. Platelet count &gt; 30,000/mm3, absolute neutrophil count &gt;750/mm3, transaminases &lt; 2.5x the upper limit of normal (ULN). 6. Longterm nonprogressors (not on ART) are not eligible. 1. CD4+ Tcell count &lt;350 cells/µL or detectable plasma HIV RNA (&gt;50 copies HIV RNA/mL) within the past 12months. During the study, if CD4+ Tcell count declines by &gt;100 cells/µL, or if plasma HIV RNA becomes detectable (&gt;50 copies HIV RNA/mL after repeat analysis 2wks apart), and the participant denies any lapse in their antiHIV medication regimen, the study medication will be stopped and an adverse event documented. If at any time during the study, two participants experience a reduction in Tcell count &gt;100 cells/µL, or their plasma HIV RNA levels become detectable (&gt;50 copies HIV RNA/mL after repeat analysis 2wks apart), and they are confirmed (by unblinding) to have received sitagliptin, the study will be stopped for serious safety concerns. 2. Systemic, secondary or opportunistic infection within past 12months. 3. Fasting glucose intolerance (FBG &gt;100mg/dL), fasting hyperinsulinemia (&gt;15µU/mL), or fasting insulin resistance (Homeostasis model for insulin resistance (HOMA) &gt;3.0). Any agents that might alter glucose metabolism (insulin, TZDs, metformin, glucocorticoids, sulfonylurea, corticosteroids, megace, rhGH, GHsecretagogue) during the 3 months prior to enrollment or at any time during enrollment. Volunteers with T2DM, IDDM or diabetic ketoacidosis will not be enrolled. 4. History of serious CV disease or NYHA Functional Class III or IV, (e.g., recent MI, unstable angina, edema, CHF, CAD, CABG, valve disease (murmur), stroke, uncontrolled high blood pressure (resting &gt;160/95 mmHg), irregular heart rhythm, resting STsegment depression &gt;1mm). Treatment with medications for a CV condition (cardiac glycosides α or ßblockers). Some antihypertensive medications (calciumchannel blocker, diuretic, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB), angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE)) will be permitted. 5. Moderate to severe renal insufficiency. Serum creatinine &gt;1.7 mg/dL (men) &gt;1.5 mg/dL (women). 6. Known allergy or hypersensitivity to DPPIVinhibitors. 7. Plan to change antiHIV medication regimen or prophylaxis for opportunistic infection within 6months of starting study.Transitions among efavirenzbased regimens will be allowed (e.g., Efavirenz + lamivudine + zidovudine (combivir) to Efavirenz + emtricitabine + tenofovir (Atripla)). 8. Lipidlowering medications are permitted (fibrate or statin or niacin), but must be stable on that agent for at least 3 months prior to enrollment. Lipidlowering agents cannot be started during the treatment period. 9. Chronic hepatitis B infection (HB surface antigen positive). Active hepatitis C infection (detectable Hep C RNA). Those who have cleared hepatitis B or C infection are eligible. 10. Hematocrit &lt;34% in men or &lt;25% in women with symptoms (fatigue, "tiredlegs", shortness of breath). Hemoglobin &lt;10 gm/100ml with symptoms. 11. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea (&gt;4 loose stools/day) that are unresponsive to treatment. History of eating disorder or significant GIdisease. 12. Pregnant or nursing mothers. Women must agree to use an acceptable form of birth control during the study. If birth control pills are used, the woman must be stable on these medications for at least 6 months prior to enrollment. 13. Active malignancy or treatment with chemotherapeutic agents or radiation therapy (within past 12 months). 14. &gt;10% unintentional body weight loss during the 12 months prior to enrollment. 15. "Blinded" investigational drugs/medications during the 3 months prior to enrollment that will not be unblinded before enrollment. Openlabel investigational drugs are permitted (within past 3 months, no plan to stop during enrollment and not known to affect glucose, lipid, adipose tissue or liver metabolism). 16. Over the counter agents that might alter glucose, lipid, or adipose tissue metabolism (e.g., creatine monohydrate, chromium picolinate, amino acid/protein supplements, medium or longchain fatty acids) within 1 month of enrollment. These supplements are not permitted during the treatment period. 17. Reduced cognitive function/unable to provide voluntary informed consent. Prisoners are excluded. 18. Active substance abuse that the physicianscientist believes may compromise safety, compliance, or interfere with study drug or data interpretation. 19. Any cytokine or anticytokine therapy during 3 months prior to enrollment.</criteria>
