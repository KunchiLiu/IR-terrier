	<brief_summary>This is a multicenter, randomized, controlled, 3 arm parallel group study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of three all-oral combinations: lenalidomide with dexamethasone (Rd) in comparison with lenalidomide in association with MP (MPR) and lenalidomide in association with cyclophosphamide - prednisone (CPR) in newly diagnosed symptomatic MM patients. This protocol also provides a substudy designed to observe asymptomatic patients excluded to the protocol that in any case could be inserted in the study.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lenalidomide and Dexamethasone Versus Melphalan Prednisone and Lenalidomide Versus Cyclophosphamide, Prednisone and Lenalidomide in Elderly Multiple Myeloma Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an intergroup multicenter, randomized, open label study designed to compare the efficacy and safety of Rd with MPR and CPR in newly diagnosed symptomatic MM patients who are 65 years of age or older. Potential study subjects will sign an informed consent prior to undergoing any study related procedure. This study consists of 3 phases for each study subject: Pre-treatment, Treatment and Follow up.Pre-treatment period: patients will undergo screening for protocol eligibility within 28 days (4weeks) prior to randomization. Subjects who meet all the inclusion criteria will be randomized based on a computer-generated randomization schedule prepared by the Coordinating Centre. The first randomization will occur for the induction treatment: Arm A (Rd) or B (MPR) or C (CPR). Within each arm patients will be then randomized for the maintenance treatment(lenalidomide or lenalidomide and prednisone): Arms A1 (R) and A2 (RP); Arms B1 (R) and B2 (RP); Arms C1 (R) and C2 (RP). Randomization will be concealed until the end of the induction period for the maintenance treatment. Patients will be stratified at randomization according to the International Staging System (5) and age (&lt; 75 years vs &gt; 75 years).Treatment period includes induction and maintenance. During the induction and maintenance phases, all patients will attend periodic study center visits in order to asses the safety and efficacy of the treatment. This protocol also provides a substudy designed to observe asymptomatic patients excluded to the protocol that in any case could be inserted in the study . The asymptomatic patient is characterized by the absence of end-organ damage or tissue involvement, such as anemia, bone lesions, hypercalcemia, and renal failure, or by other relevant clinical conditions, such as hyperviscosity, amyloidosis, and recurrent infections (CRAB).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patient is, in the investigator(s) opinion, willing and able to comply with the protocol requirements. Patient has given voluntary written informed consent before performance of any study related procedure not part of normal medical care, with the understanding that consent may be withdrawn by the patient at any time without prejudice to their future medical care. Patient is 65 years old or older at the time of signing the informed consent or younger patients not candidate to high dose therapy Female patient is either postmenopausal or surgically sterilized or, if at childbearing potential†, must: understand that the study medication could have an expected teratogenic risk Agree to use, and be able to comply with, effective contraception without interruption, 4 weeks before starting study drug, throughout study drug therapy (including dose interruptions) and for 4 weeks after the end of study drug therapy, even if she has amenorrhea. This applies unless the subject commits to absolute and continued abstinence confirmed on a monthly basis. The following are effective methods of contraception* Implant** Levonorgestrelreleasing intrauterine system (IUS)** Medroxyprogesterone acetate depot Tubal sterilisation Sexual intercourse with a vasectomised male partner only; vasectomy must be confirmed by two negative semen analyses Ovulation inhibitory progesteroneonly pills (i.e., desogestrel) Combined oral contraceptive pills are not recommended. If a subject was using combined oral contraception, she must switch to one of the methods above. The increased risk of VTE continues for 4 to 6 weeks after stopping combined oral contraception. prophylactic antibiotics should be considered at the time of insertion particularly in patients with neutropenia due to risk of infection Agree to have a medically supervised pregnancy test with a minimum sensitivity of 25 mIU/ml not more than 3 days before the start of study medication once the subject has been on effective contraception for at least 4 weeks. This requirement also applies to women of childbearing potential who practice complete and continued abstinence. Agree to have a medically supervised pregnancy test every 4 weeks including 4 weeks after the end of study treatment, except in the case of confirmed tubal sterilization. These tests should be performed not more than 3 days before the start of next treatment. This requirement also applies to women of childbearing potential who practice complete and continued abstinence Male subjects must Agree to use condoms throughout study drug therapy, during any dose interruption and for one week after cessation of study therapy if their partner is of childbearing potential and has no contraception. Agree not to donate semen during study drug therapy and for one week after end of study drug therapy. All subjects must Agree to abstain from donating blood while taking study drug therapy and for one week following discontinuation of study drug therapy. Agree not to share study medication with another person and to return all unused study drug to the investigator. Patient was previously diagnosed with symptomatic MM based on standard criteria, and has measurable disease, defined as follows: Secretory myeloma: any quantifiable serum monoclonal protein value (generally, but not necessarily, greater than 1 g/dL of IgG MProtein and greater than 0.5 g/dL of IgA MProtein) and, where applicable, urine lightchain excretion of &gt;200 mg/24 hours; Nonsecretory myeloma: &gt; 30% plasma cells in the bone marrow and at least one plasmacytoma &gt; 2 cm as determined by clinical examination or applicable radiographs (i.e., MRI or CT scan). Patient has a baseline bone marrow sample available for cytogenetics, that will be processed and eventually centralized within each country. Patient has a Karnofsky performance status _ 60%. Patient has a lifeexpectancy &gt; 6 months Patients must have a adequate cardiac function Patients must have adequate pulmonary function Patient has the following laboratory values within 14 days before Baseline (day 1 of the Cycle 1): Platelet count ≥ 75 x 109/L without transfusion support within 7 days before the test. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1.0 x 109/L without the use of growth factors. Corrected serum calcium ≤14 mg/dL (3.5 mmol/L). Aspartate transaminase (AST): ≤2.5 x the upper limit of normal (ULN). Alanine transaminase (ALT): ≤ 2.5 x the ULN. Total bilirubin: ≤1.5 x the ULN. Calculated or measured creatinine clearance: ≥30 mL/minute Previous treatment with antimyeloma therapy (does not include radiotherapy, bisphosphonates, or a single short course of steroid; &lt; to the equivalent of dexamethasone 40 mg/day for 4 days). Any serious medical condition, including the presence of laboratory abnormalities, which places the subject at an unacceptable risk if he or she participates in this study or confounds the experimental ability to interpret data from the study. Pregnant or lactating females. Prior history of malignancies, other than multiple myeloma, unless the subject has been free of the disease for ≥3 years. Exceptions include the following: Basal cell carcinoma of the skin, Squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, Carcinoma in situ of the cervix, Carcinoma in situ of the breast, Incidental histologic finding of prostate cancer (TNM stage of T1a or T1b)</criteria>
