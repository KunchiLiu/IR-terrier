	<brief_title>Prospective Randomized Trial of Navigated and Conventional TKA</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1. Component position, kinematics After skin closure lateral x-rays were done in different flexion angles in order to evaluate the kinematic behaviour of the TKA. A full-length standing and a lateral radiograph as well as CT scans of the hip, knee and ankle joint were performed 5 to 7 days postoperatively before discharge. 2. clinical outcome Patient sociodemographic and anamnestic data were collected. The written interview was complemented by the EuroQol questionnaire (release EQ-5D) and the assessment of the patients' functional status (Knee Society Score) one week before surgery and 18 to 24 month after surgery.</detailed_description>
