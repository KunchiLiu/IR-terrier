	<brief_title>Vaccine Responses to Influenza A H1N1/09 Immunization in High-risk Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective, open-label, parallel-cohorts study will include up to 1250 patients and 250 controls to whom influenza A(H1N1) immunization was recommended. Six cohort have been established, enrolling patients with HIV infection, rheumatic diseases, organ transplant, cancer, pediatric patients and healthy controls. Subjects will be assessed for specific antibody responses (all), T cell responses (subset) and solicited vaccine adverse events. Vaccine safety evaluation will include the influence of immunization on underlying diseases (HIV infected patients, patients with auto-immune diseases) or graft function (transplant patients) - as appropriate.</detailed_description>
