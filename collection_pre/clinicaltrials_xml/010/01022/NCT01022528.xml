	<brief_summary>The objective of the study is to examine the effect of the addition of intravenous dexamethasone 1.5 hours prior to induction of anesthesia on the post-operative opioid consumption, pain scores, fatigue, and recovery in patients undergoing gynecological surgery with laparotomy under general anesthesia. This is a dose finding study with two different doses (0.1 mg/kg vs. 0.2 mg/kg) of dexamethasone to find out the optimal efficacious dose of dexamethasone with minimal side effects. Dexamethasone has anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and analgesic effects; and is superior to placebo in providing post-operative pain control, lower analgesic consumption, prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting, lesser post-operative fatigue, and better recovery profile. No dose response study has been done. The investigators hypothesize that a higher dose of dexamethasone may have an incremental beneficial effect.</brief_summary>
