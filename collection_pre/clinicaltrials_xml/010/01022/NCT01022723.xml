	<brief_summary>To evaluate the efficiency of a microdevice for circulating tumor cells isolation and to correlate the circulating titre with response and progression.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Validation of a Microfluidic Device for Isolation and Molecular Characterization of Circulating Tumor Cells</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Validate the clinical use of a mircofluidic device to capture circulating timor cells from a broad range of tumor types - Characterize and identify these circulating tumor cells and demostrate cell viability with this capture method - Apply this technology in clinically relevant settings and correlate to response to treatment and disease progression - Elucidate predictive and pharmacodynamic biomarkers in the context of early phase trials of novel therapeutics</detailed_description>
