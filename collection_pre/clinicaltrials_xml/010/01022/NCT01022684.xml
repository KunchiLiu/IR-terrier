	<brief_summary>Vascular inflammation is a key factor in both the pathogenesis and outcome of atherosclerosis. Various inflammatory markers such as LpPLA2,MCP-2 and hsCRP are well-known prognostic factors for the cardiovascular event. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) is a promising tool for identifying and quantifying vascular inflammation within atherosclerotic plaques.Therefore, the purpose of the study is to demonstrate the correlation between various inflammatory markers and vascular inflammation detected by 18FDG-PET.</brief_summary>
