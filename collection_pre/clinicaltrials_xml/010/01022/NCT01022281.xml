	<detailed_description>To compare the Scanning Laser Polarimetry findings in subjects with exfoliation syndrome and normal controls and to evaluate the value of scanning laser polarimetry in the early diagnosis and management of exfoliative glaucoma. Prospective study in progress. The investigators compare and analyze the scanning laser polarimetry parameters in consecutive subjects with exfoliation syndrome and normal intraocular pressure and compared them with consecutive normal controls. Randomly selected patients with exfoliation syndrome and normal controls undergo a comprehensive ophthalmic exam which includes 3 IOP measurements, corneal pachymetry, automated perimetry and assessment of the retina nerve fiber layer with scanning laser polarimetry. The investigators hypothesize that patients with exfoliation syndrome may show worse scanning laser polarimetry parameters than normal controls and this may prove to be an early sign of exfoliative glaucoma development. Evaluation of retina nerve fiber layer thickness may help us in identifying earlier those individuals with exfoliation syndrome that will develop exfoliative glaucoma.</detailed_description>
