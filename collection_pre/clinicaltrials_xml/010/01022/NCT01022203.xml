	<brief_summary>The study is designed to evaluate the efficacy of a novel couple-based treatment for PTSD, called Structured Approach Therapy, to decrease PTSD and improve the marital and social functioning of Iraqi war Veterans and their partners. The effectiveness of couples therapy will be compared with the effectiveness of a couple-based educational intervention.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Couple-Based PTSD Treatment and Couple-Based PTSD Education</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal of the proposed study is to test the efficacy of a novel couple-based PTSD treatment, called Structured Approach Therapy, by randomly assigning 57 Iraqi war Veterans and their partners to either a 12-15 session Structured Approach Therapy program, or to a 12-15 session PTSD Family Education comparison condition. The efficacy of the two experimental conditions will be ascertained by obtaining measures of PTSD severity from Veterans and measures of relationship functioning and emotion regulation from Veterans and their partners prior to treatment, immediately after treatment, and three months after the last treatment session. The investigators will test the hypothesis that couples participating in Structured Approach Therapy will show significantly greater improvements on all three clinical outcome measures than couples participating in PTSD Family Education. These hypotheses will be tested with an intent-to-treat analysis using general linear mixed models with main effects of treatment, time (baseline, end of treatment, and 12 week follow-up), and treatment by time interactions to model the longitudinal trajectories of the outcome, separately for the Veterans and their partners. The objectives of the Structured Approach Therapy intervention are to decrease PTSD severity, improve relationship and family functioning, and decrease problems in emotion regulation in a group of young Veterans at risk for developing chronic PTSD, and to reduce emotional distress and relationship and family problems in their partners.</detailed_description>
