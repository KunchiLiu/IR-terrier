	<brief_summary>Treatment of glioblastoma (GBM) is based on surgery when possible, and chemoradiation with temozolomide, which became a standard since the EORTC study (Stupp, 2005). However, the prognosis of unresectable GBM remains poor despite chemoradiation with an estimated 10 month median survival, in the range of the comparable patients in the RPA class V from the EORTC study (Miramanoff, 2006). Vredenburgh et al. from the Duke University (Durham, NC) reported at ASCO 2006 (fully published in J Clin Oncol, 2007) a 57 % unexpected response rate using a bevacizumab/irinotecan schedule in patients with relapsed GBM or grade 3 astrocytomas. This unusual high response rate, sometimes with major and sustained responses, was confirmed by a cooperative french study of ANOCEF (Guiu et al., 2008). Such a major improvement of treatment effectiveness lead ANOCEF, which federates most of the active neuro-oncology teams in France, to propose a neo-adjuvant and adjuvant bevacizumab-based chemotherapy framing a standard temozolomide-based chemoradiation with the aim to improve the prognosis of unresectable GBM. The bevacizumab/temozolomide combination as neo-adjuvant is presently being evaluated by the Duke University. We believe that an ambitious comparison of the bevacizumab/irinotecan-schedule with the ''standard'' temozolomide-based chemoradiation is a fascinating challenge to improve the treatment of this awful disease. The ANOCEF proposal '' Evaluation of the irinotecan/bevacizumab association as neo-adjuvant and adjuvant treatment of chemoradiation with temozolomide for naive unresectable glioblastoma. Phase II randomized study with comparison to chemoradiation with temozolomide'' has been successfully granted by INCA (Institut National du Fancer, France) through its research program ( PHRC : Programme Hospitalier de Recherche Clinique). Implementation of this program is now starting .</brief_summary>
