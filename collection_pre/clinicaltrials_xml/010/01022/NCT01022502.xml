	<brief_title>Comparison of Refined and Crude Indigo Naturalis Ointment in Treating Psoriasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Our previous studies have shown that topical application of indigo naturalis significantly improves psoriatic symptoms. However, patient compliance is hindered because the preparation is unsightly and stains clothing. To improve patient compliance, we have developed a refined formulation in which closer to natural skin tones and less prone to stain clothing. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of this refined form of oil extract ointment and compared the results with those of the original crude form of indigo naturalis ointment in treating psoriasis.</detailed_description>
