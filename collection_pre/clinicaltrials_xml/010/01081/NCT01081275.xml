	<brief_title>Improving Hand Use in Multiple Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multiple Sclerosis (MS) frequently causes reduced use of one of the hands, and as a result, much of daily living activities are conducted only by the other hand, leaving the person effective one-handed. Nonetheless, reduced hand use can be improved for extended amounts of time with specific forms of physical therapy, as long as persons with MS have the ability to perform the training tasks. This study will randomize persons with MS who have relatively reduced use of one of the hands to either CI therapy or CAM treatments. Treatment in either program will be for 2 consecutive weeks, 3.5 hours per day (Monday-Friday), under the direct supervision of a specially trained therapist. Before starting, participants will also undergo comprehensive medical and physical exam screening and brain MRI scan. The same evaluations will be performed after treatment to learn whether any of these have changed as a result of treatment.</detailed_description>
