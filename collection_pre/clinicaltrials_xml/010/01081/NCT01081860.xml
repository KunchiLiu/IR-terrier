	<brief_summary>The exact etiology of CTS remains yet unknown. A rise in carpal tunnel pressure is well documented, but why this phenomenon occurs is yet unknown in most patients. There is an absolute or relative narrowing of the carpal tunnel, which results in a compression of the median nerve. The investigators postulate, that a stiffer flexor retinaculum (roof of carpal tunnel) will be less compliant. As a consequence of this stiffer retinaculum the pressure in the carpal tunnel will rise more quickly in stiff patients resulting in CTS-complaints. A relation between connective tissue composition and joint stiffness is proven. This relationship possibly extends to a relation between stiffness of the skin, joint stiffness and the prevalence of CTS.</brief_summary>
