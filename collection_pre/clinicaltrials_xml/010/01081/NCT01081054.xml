	<brief_summary>The purpose of 01DIVER is to evaluate efficacy and safety of a home treatment protocol for non complicated diverticulitis compared with management in the hospital. The hypothesis is that a ambulatory treatment with oral antibiotic and progressive introduction of diet is not inferior to the conservative management in hospital in patients with acute not complicated sigmoid diverticulitis, shown by contrast enhanced CT scan. Patients are prospectively randomized to conservative antibiotic treatment either to ambulatory or to hospital treatment.</brief_summary>
