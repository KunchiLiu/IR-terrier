	<brief_title>To Evaluate the Convenience, Safety and Efficacy of Follitropin Alfa Liquid Pen Compared With Follitropin Beta Liquid Pen</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Treatment of subfertility and infertility by assisted reproduction technologies (ART) such as in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) and embryo transfer (ET) requires multiple follicular development to increase the number of female gametes, and the chances of a successful treatment outcome. Ovarian stimulation in IVF/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) currently includes suppression of endogenous luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion by administration of a gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist, followed by stimulation of multiple follicular development by exogenous FSH administration. When adequate follicular development is achieved, a single dose of u-hCG (urinary-hCG) is administered to mimic the endogenous LH surge and induce final oocyte maturation. Recombinant-human FSH (r-hFSH) has been shown to be superior to u-hFSH in terms of requiring fewer ampules and more efficacious in terms of number of oocytes recovered and in terms of pregnancy rates. Recently, a new formulation of follitropin alfa has been developed due to a general trend in the field of therapeutic recombinant proteins to move from presentations based on biological activity to presentations based on physico-chemical characteristics. Until now follitropin alfa has been produced as a powder for injection (either as monodose or multidose preparations) in glass ampoules or in glass vials and administered using plastic or glass syringe. Serono developed a multidose solution for injection in a prefilled disposable injection pen. This study involved comparing the administration of follitropin alfa liquid formulation applied by pen with that of follitropin beta liquid formulation also applied by pen. OBJECTIVES The objectives of this study were to evaluate the convenience, safety and efficacy of Follitropin alfa (Gonal-f) liquid pen compared with Follitropin beta (Puregon) liquid pen.</detailed_description>
