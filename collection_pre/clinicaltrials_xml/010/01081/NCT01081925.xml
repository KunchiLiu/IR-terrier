	<brief_title>Congestive Heart Failure: Causes of Sudden Worsening</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Congestive heart failure (CHF) presents a very significant cause of morbidity and mortality. The prevalence of CHF is between 2 and 4% and rises with age (in 70- to 80-year-old people is between 10 and 20%). CHF is the cause of 5% of all acute hospital admissions and accounts for 2% of expenses on health. The most common causes of worsening of the chronic CHF are ischemia, arrhythmias, valvular dysfunction, systemic or pulmonary hypertension, volume overload or fluid retention, high output conditions (infection, anemia, thyrotoxicosis), drugs (NSAIDs, cyclo-oxygenase (COX) inhibitors, thiazolidinediones) and medication nonadherence. The goal of this study is to determine the proportion of various reasons of acute worsening of CHF, using commonly available methods including assessment of serum drug levels.</detailed_description>
