	<brief_summary>Patients with liver cirrhosis have an increased risk to develop life-threatening complications such as spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). Impairment in the intestinal barrier, changes in numbers and composition of the intestinal microbiota and alterations in immune defenses have been suggested to be involved in liver cirrhosis and its complications. Dysfunction in the intestinal barrier for example results in the ongoing passage of toxic substances from the gastrointestinal tract that may damage the liver, leading to oxidative stress, inflammation and eventually liver cirrhosis. In addition, bacterial translocation is considered a key step in the development of spontaneous infections, mainly SBP, in patients with liver cirrhosis. The investigators hypothesize that patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis have a more impaired intestinal epithelial barrier and altered intestinal microbiota than patients with compensated liver cirrhosis.</brief_summary>
