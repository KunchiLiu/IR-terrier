	<brief_summary>The participants included in this observational study will be drawn from a research database containing claims and enrollment data for members of a large, geographically diverse US health plan.The objective of this study is to estimate the rate of serious infections, tuberculosis, malignancies, and other outcomes in rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis patients treated with golimumab, anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) biologics, non-anti-TNF biologics, or systemic non-biological treatments.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The participants included in this study will be drawn from the Ingenix Normative Health Informatics Database, a proprietary research database containing claims and enrollment data dating back to 1993 for members of a large, geographically diverse US health plan. This study will include cohorts of participants who have claims consistent with a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis and who initiate golimumab, anti-TNF biologics, non-anti-TNF biologics, or systemic non-biological treatments. Participants will be identified by claims bearing codes for dispensed drugs, procedures or diagnoses and followed after the launch of golimumab for up to 8 years. A sample of enrolled health plan members without claims evidence of diagnosis or treatment of Rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis or ankylosing spondylitis will also be selected. The claims database will be used to estimate the incidence of the primary outcomes of serious infections, tuberculosis (TB) and non-TB mycobacterial infections, malignancies such as lymphoma, and other selected outcomes. No study agents will be administered in this study. All participants will receive standard-of-care treatment as prescribed by their physician</detailed_description>
