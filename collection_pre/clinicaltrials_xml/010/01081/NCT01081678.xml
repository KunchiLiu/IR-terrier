	<brief_summary>This is an international, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to determine the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of AMG 785 in adults with a fresh unilateral hip fracture, status post surgical fixation. The primary hypothesis of this study is that AMG 785 compared with placebo is effective in accelerating healing of hip fractures and improving physical functioning, as measured by the TUG, for subjects with fresh unilateral low energy hip fractures, status post surgical fixation.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Males and females, age 55 to 95 years Fresh unilateral low energy intertrochanteric or femoral neck fracture as the primary injury Intertrochanteric fractures eligible for this study must have at least two displaced fragments Internal fixation of the intertrochanteric fracture with sliding hip screw or intramedullary nail Internal fixation of femoral neck fracture with either a sliding hip screw or at least three cancellous screws Major polytrauma or significant axial trauma Presence of concomitant injuries such as rib fractures, wrist fractures, or acute symptomatic vertebral fractures which severely impair the ability to rise from a chair Inability to independently rise from armchair or walk 200 meters before hip fracture (use of unilateral assistive device or rolling walker is acceptable) Severe symptomatic osteoarthritis of the lower extremity Cognitive deficit or symptomatic neurological conditions such as Parkinson's disease or persistent gross motor or sensory deficits such as hemiparesis or hemiplegia Use of bone grafts at the time of fracture fixation Pathological fracture or metabolic or bone disease History of facial nerve paralysis or symptomatic spinal stenosis that has not been surgically corrected. If surgically corrected, the subject must be asymptomatic to be eligible for the study Malignancy within the last 5 years Evidence of the following (currently or within the past 5 years): elevated transaminases, significantly impaired renal function, current hyper or hypocalcaemia, hypoalbuminemia Use of agents affecting bone metabolism</criteria>
