	<brief_title>A Study Using Micronised Progesterone (CrinoneÂ® 8%) in the Luteal Phase Support of Women Undergoing in Vitro Fertilisation (IVF) and Embryo Transfer (ET)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This was an open-label, randomized, comparative, multicentric, phase III study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Crinone 8% in comparison with progesterone 60 mg intramuscular administered once a day in luteal phase support in Chinese female subjects undergoing IVF/ET. The study planned to enroll 200 female subjects who underwent pituitary down-regulation as per each center's normal practice prior to and during stimulation of multiple follicular development. The progesterone administration was started on the day of ET. Randomisation was performed on the day of ET. If pregnancy was confirmed on day 14 of the progesterone administration, the progesterone was continued for another 45 days. The subjects were followed up and the treatment outcome (negative pregnancy test or pregnancy) was recorded.</detailed_description>
