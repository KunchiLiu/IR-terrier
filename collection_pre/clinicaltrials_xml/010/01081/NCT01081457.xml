	<brief_summary>Parkinson's disease is characterized by extra-pyramidal symptoms as well as digestive involvement with gastrointestinal motility (GI) impairment. Deep brain stimulation has been recently developed as a successful treatment for extrapyramidal symptoms. In addition, preliminary reports suggest that this therapy might be successful to relieve GI symptoms as well. The aim of this study is therefore to assess the effect of deep brain stimulation on GI voluntary as well as involuntary motility.</brief_summary>
