	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if Vitamin D supplementation helps prevent recurrent cardiovascular events, such as heart attack or stroke, in patients who have already experienced at least one cardiovascular event. This study will investigate if the addition of 150,000 international units of cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) by mouth every 2 months to a subject's medication regimen will prevent further cardiovascular events.</brief_summary>

Subject is on treatment with either phenytoin or phenobarbitol or orlistat (since these medications may cause vitamin D deficiency). Subject who needs two or more steroid bursts per year for other comorbid conditions (since steroids may impair vitamin D metabolism).

Subject has hypersensitivity to vitamin D products. Subject has history of systemic lupus erythematosus (since vitamin D deficiency is common in this group27). Subject has history of sarcoidosis (since they have hypercalcemia and high levels of vitamin D28) Subject has history of renal stones. Subject has hypercalcemia, which is defined as serum calcium levels &gt;10.6 mg/dl, at the time of screening. Subject has end stage renal disease, defined as either chronic kidney disease stage V or requiring dialysis (since these patients have altered vitamin D and calcium metabolism). Subject has systemic disease (including terminal cancer, cirrhosis, end stage COPD etc.,) with reduced (&lt;12 months) life expectancy.
