	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Diagnostic procedures, such as magnetic resonance imaging, may help doctors predict a patient's response to treatment and help plan the best treatment. PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying magnetic resonance imaging in response to radiation therapy in patients with high grade glioma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Evaluating Response to RadiationTherapy in Patients With High Grade Glioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Detailed DescriptionOBJECTIVES: I. To develop a multimodality statistical model to act as a surrogate marker scheme of early changes in high grade glioma patients undergoing radiation therapy, using conventional MRI, MR diffusion tensor imaging, perfusion, permeability, and spectroscopic imaging while incorporating the radiation dose calculations delivered locally and the results of a clinical questionnaire into the model. II. To assess treatment response to tumor and normal tissue changes. OUTLINE: Patients undergo multimodality MRI imaging at baseline, weeks 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6, and then 4-6 weeks after completion of radiation therapy.</detailed_description>
