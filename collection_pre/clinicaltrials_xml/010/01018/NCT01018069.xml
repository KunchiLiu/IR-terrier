	<criteria>Patients with AML, except those with APL (acute promyelocytic leukemia), failing a single standard dose cytarabine based frontline induction regimen. The diagnosis of refractory AML is based on the presence of either &gt; 10% blasts in marrow or blood or 510% blasts in either site together with cytopenia (Hb &lt; 10 g/dL, or platelets &lt; 100 x 109/L, or neutrophil count &lt; 1.0 x 109/L). Patients must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of ≤2. Male, or female patients who are postmenopausal (amenorrheic for at least 12 months), or surgically or biologically sterile. Patients must have adequate organ and immune function as indicated by the following laboratory values: Parameter Laboratory Values Serum creatinine; ≤2.0 mg/dL (≤ 177 μmol/L Total Bilirubin ≤2.0 mg/dL (≤ 34 μmol/L) AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) ≤3 X ULN The patient must understand, be able and willing and likely to fully comply with study procedures, including scheduled followup, and restrictions. Clinical evidence of ongoing grade 3 or 4 nonhematological toxicities from the initial standard dose cytarabinebased induction chemotherapy Patients with a prior history of peripheral neuropathy of grade 2 or higher. Clinical evidence of active CNS leukemic involvement. Active and uncontrolled infection. Patients with an infection who are under active treatment with antibiotics and whose infections are controlled may be entered to the study. Current evidence of invasive fungal infection (blood or tissue culture). Current evidence of an active second malignancy except for nonmelanoma skin cancer. Uncontrolled medical problems, unrelated to the malignancy, or of sufficient severity that in the opinion of the investigator, impair a patient's ability to give informed consent or unacceptably reduce the safety of the proposed treatment. Neurological or psychiatric disorders that would interfere with consent or study followup. Known or suspected intolerance or hypersensitivity to the study drugs [or closely related compounds] or any of their stated ingredients. Study drugs being the antisense, cytarabine and idarubicin. History of alcohol or other substance abuse within the last year. Use of another investigational agent within the last 14 days prior to enrolment. Patients who have received a previous antisense agent in the last 90 days will be excluded. Female patients who are pregnant, lactating, or with a positive pregnancy test at screening must be excluded.</criteria>
