	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: Are ambulatory and greater than or equal to 18 years of age. Females of childbearing potential must test negative for pregnancy at the time of enrollment based on a serum pregnancy test and agree to use a highly reliable method of birth control as defined by those which result in a low failure rate(&lt;1% per year) during the study. Chronic psoriasis vulgaris for at least 6 months prior to randomization. Moderate and severe (plaque) psoriasis involving at least 10% body surface area (BSA) or at least 8% BSA in subjects with severe palmarplantar involvement at randomization. Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) total score of at least 12 at screening. Exclusion criteria: Have had a clinically significant flare of psoriasis during the 12 weeks prior to randomization or a biologic agent/monoclonal antibody within the longer of 5 half lives or 12 weeks prior to dosing, had systemic treatment for psoriasis or phototherapy within 4 weeks prior to dosing, or had topical psoriasis treatment within 2 weeks prior to dosing. Have had a vaccination within 4 to 12 weeks (depending on type) prior to or intend to have one within 4 weeks after the dosing period. Are immunocompromised or have evidence of active infection (such as viral hepatitis and/or positive testing for tuberculosis or human immunodeficiency virus [HIV]); or have had a recent serious systemic infection (such as mononucleosis or herpes zoster). Have a history of or current lymphoproliferative disease or malignant disease (except for resolved cervical dysplasia; or no more than 3 successfully treated basal or squamous cell carcinomas of the skin), or severe drug allergies/hypersensitivity. Have a history of serious cardiac disease within 12 weeks before randomization; or have serious or unstable/uncontrolled illnesses including hepatic, renal, gastroenterologic, respiratory, cardiovascular, endocrinologic, neurologic, psychiatric, immunologic, or hematologic disease and other conditions that, in the investigator's opinion, could interfere with the analyses of safety and efficacy in this study. Have laboratory test values outside the reference range for the population or investigative site that are considered clinically significant and/or have any of the following specific abnormalities: Aspartate transaminase (AST) or alanine transaminase (ALT) &gt;2 x the upper limit of normal (ULN; upper reference range of the central laboratory for the study) Hemoglobin &lt;100 g/L (10 g/dL) White blood cell (WBC) &lt;3.0 G/L (3,000/mm3) Neutrophils &lt;1.5 G/L (1,500/mm3) Platelets &lt;75 G/L (75,000/mm3) Serum creatinine &gt;133 Âµmol/L (1.5 mg/dL) Random glucose &gt;11.1mmol/L (200 mg/dL). Have significant allergies to humanized monoclonal antibodies, or clinically significant multiple or severe drug allergies, or intolerance to topical corticosteroids</criteria>
