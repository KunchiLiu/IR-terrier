	<brief_summary>To determine if prasugrel is superior to clopidogrel in providing adequate antiplatelet effect in a high risk population that requires concomitant use of a Proton Pump Inhibitor (PPI).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Influence of the Proton Pump Inhibitor Omeprazole on the Anti-Platelet of P2Y12 Antagonists in Subjects With Coronary and Peripheral Artery Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To evaluate if simultaneous treatment with the PPI omeprazole and a P2Y12 receptor antagonist will influence the effect of either clopidogrel and/or prasugrel on platelet reactivity in patients with Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) or Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Adults between 18 and 75 years of age Known or documented history of CAD or PAD prior to enrollment (a diagnosis of CAD may be based upon a positive stress test, prior documented acute coronary event, or angiographic demonstration of CAD; a diagnosis of PAD may be based upon an anklebrachial index less than 0.9, or angiographic demonstration of PAD) Have not had thienopyridine therapy for at least 15 days before the study Have not had treatment with a PPI for at least 15 days before the study Are taking aspirin (75 to 325 mg/day) for at least one week prior to randomization Have New York Heart association (NYHA) Class III and IV congestive heart failure Have any form of coronary revascularization (PCI or coronary artery bypass grafting [CABG]) planned to occur during the study Have undergone PCI or CABG within 30 days of entry to the study Have received a drug eluting endovascular stents in the past year Have any of the following: 1. Prior history of hemorrhagic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) 2. Intracranial neoplasm, arteriovenous malformation, or aneurysm 3. A body weight less than 60 kg Have prior history of GI ulcer disease or bleeding Have symptoms of dyspepsia or gastroesophageal reflux disease Have active internal bleeding or history of bleeding diathesis Have clinical findings, in the judgment of the investigator, associated with an increased risk of bleeding Have an International Normalized Ratio (INR) known to be &gt;1.5 at the time of evaluation Have a platelet count of &lt;100,000/mm3 at the time of screening, if known Have anemia (hemoglobin [Hgb] &lt;10 gm/dL) at the time of screening, if known Are receiving or will receive oral anticoagulation or other antiplatelet therapy (other than aspirin) that cannot be safely discontinued for the duration of the study Are receiving daily treatment with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) that cannot be discontinued or require daily treatment with NSAIDs during the study. Are receiving corticosteroid therapy</criteria>
