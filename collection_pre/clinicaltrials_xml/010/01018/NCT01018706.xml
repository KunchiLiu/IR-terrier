	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to confirm or confute the hypothesis that in patients treated with primary pci is not always possible to collect an adequate medical history, the investigators created a clinical registry in which the investigators collect current or previous medical history relevant to DES utilization , in two distinct times.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Goodness of Clinical History During Stemi PCI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>GHOST Registry Use of drug-eluting stent (DES) in STEMI is sometimes limited, by the concern that adequate information, relating to the current or previous medical history, can not be obtained due to the patient's critical condition. A less than adequate medical history would expose patients treated with DES to a particular risk in case that an absolute or relative contraindication to the required long-term double antiplatelet therapy is not fully elucidated before DES implantation. To confirm or confute the hypothesis that in patients treated with primary pci is not always possible to collect an adequate medical history, we created a clinical registry in which we collect current or previous medical history relevant to DES utilization , in two distinct times: Time zero in which the medical history collection is taken in the cath-lab during the primary pci Time one in which the second medical history collection is taken 4 days after the index procedure when the patient clinical conditions no longer impede an adequate medical history collection.</detailed_description>
