	<brief_summary>This study will test the hypothesis of whether an antagonist at the corticotropin releasing factor type 1 (CRF1) receptor (i.e. GSK561679) is superior to placebo in reducing symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of GSK561679 in Women With Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a chronic and common anxiety disorder that follows exposure to an overwhelming traumatic event. The majority of patients with PTSD also meet criteria for other psychiatric disorders and PTSD is associated with an increased risk for suicide attempts. PTSD is responsive to psychological and pharmacological treatments, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), but response rates rarely exceed 60%, and even fewer patients (20-30%) achieve clinical remission. Thus, there is a clear need to develop novel and improved therapeutics for PTSD. The study is divided into 4 phases: Phase 1 (Screening): a 1 week no drug screening period to assess study eligibility. Phase 2 (Pre-Treatment Testing Period): Eligible patients will be enrolled into a 1 week Testing Phase, which will include neuropsychological and neurophysiological testing as well as blood draws and electrocardiogram. Phase 3 (Treatment Period): Eligible patients will be enrolled in a two-armed 6-week period of double-blind placebo-controlled acute treatment. All subjects who continue to meet eligibility criteria will be randomized to one of two groups: GSK561679 (at a fixed dose of 350 mg/day) or placebo. Randomization will be performed at a 1:1 ratio into two treatment groups. Neuropsychological and neurophysiological testing will be repeated after 5 weeks of the double-blind treatment period. Phase 4 (Follow-up Period): Safety follow-up visits will be conducted 1 week and 1 month after the end of the treatment Phase 3.</detailed_description>
