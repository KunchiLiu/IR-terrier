	<brief_summary>The objective of this project is to pilot test a behavioral intervention for modifying the diet and physical activity patterns of overweight preschool children through improved parenting and nutritional education(LAUNCH). This intervention will be compared to standard of care for preschool overweight in the primary care setting using a randomized clinical trial design (RCT. The results of this pilot RCT will provide data integral to estimating the effect size for a more definitive RCT of the intervention in the future. The primary hypothesis is: H1: LAUNCH will result in a significantly greater decrease in BMI z score compared to the standard of care at 12 months post-treatment.</brief_summary>
