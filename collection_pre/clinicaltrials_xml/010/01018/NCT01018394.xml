	<brief_summary>Smokeless tobacco (ST) is a known human carcinogen. Long-term ST use is known to increase the risk for oropharyngeal cancer. Extant literature on cigarette smokers suggests that smoking reduction increases smoking abstinence among smokers not interested in quitting. The overarching goal of this line of research is to develop a ST reduction intervention among ST users not interested in quitting tobacco. Our first step is to conduct the proposed pilot study designed to assess the efficacy of the nicotine lozenges or tobacco-free snuff for reducing ST use or facilitating ST abstinence among ST users not interested in quitting.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nicotine Lozenge or Tobacco-Free Snuff for Smokeless Tobacco Reduction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this study, we will enroll 81 subjects who will be randomized to either the nicotine lozenge or tobacco-free snuff to reduce their ST use over 8 weeks with follow-up at 12 weeks. Forty subjects will be recruited at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN, and 40 subjects will be recruited at the Oregon Research Institute in Eugene, Oregon.</detailed_description>
