	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: New imaging procedures, such as single photon emission computed tomography, may help in learning how acupuncture affects serotonin levels in the brain of breast cancer survivors. PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the best way to visualize the effect of acupuncture on brain serotonin in breast cancer survivors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Visualization of the Effect of Acupuncture on Brain Serotonin in Breast Cancer Survivors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Detailed Description OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the feasibility of using [123-I] ADAM Serotonin transporter (SERT) binding as a putative biomarker to visualize the mechanism of effects of acupuncture for hot flashes involving serotonin. OUTLINE: Patients undergo acupuncture twice weekly for 2 weeks and then once weekly for 6 weeks. Patients undergo single photon emission computed tomography imaging with iodine 123-I ADAM before and after completion of acupuncture. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 4 weeks.</detailed_description>
