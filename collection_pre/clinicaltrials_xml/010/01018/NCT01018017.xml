	<brief_summary>Randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, double-blind, multiple-dose, activity and safety clinical study of SRT2104 administered orally once daily for 28 consecutive days. This will be an inpatient/outpatient study to assess the safety and pharmacokinetics of SRT2104 in type 2 diabetic male and female subjects on an existing, stable, background metformin therapy. Approximately 80 subjects will be enrolled. Subjects will be evenly randomized to receive SRT2104 2.0 g/day or placebo in the fed state. Subjects will be required to stay overnight at the study center on Days -2, -1, 0, 1 (optional discharge at investigator's discretion), 27, 28, 41, and 42. During these admissions, pharmacokinetic, biomarker and glycated albumin samples will be collected, and glucose profiling, OGTT, glucose stabilization, hyperinsulinemc euglycemic clamp (HEGC) studies with indirect calorimetry and various other safety and activity procedures will be performed. On Day 1 of the study, subjects will be randomized to receive SRT2104 or placebo. Day 43 will be the last day of the study and subjects will be released. In addition, subjects will be asked to return to the study center on Day 14 for interim safety assessments. During the dosing period, study personnel will contact subjects by telephone on Days 7 and 21 to conduct a safety assessment. Subjects will be required to monitor their fasting blood glucose and complete a daily diary for the outpatient portion of the study between Days 1 and 28. A follow-up, safety phone call will occur 30 days following their final dose of SRT2104 or placebo (Day 58 of the study) to identify any possible additional adverse events or concomitant medications.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Clinical Study to Assess the Safety, Tolerability, and Activity of Oral SRT2104 Capsules Administered for 28 Days to Subjects With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, double-blind, multiple-dose, activity and safety clinical study of SRT2104 administered orally once daily for 28 consecutive days. This will be an inpatient/outpatient study to assess the safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) of SRT2104 in type 2 diabetic (T2D) male and female subjects on an existing, stable, background metformin therapy. Approximately 112 subjects aged 18-65 years, who fulfill the inclusion/exclusion criteria, will be screened for this study to enroll approximately 80 subjects. Subjects will be evenly randomized to receive SRT2104 2.0 g/day or placebo approximately 15 minutes following consumption of a standardized morning meal. Subjects will remain on a fixed dose of test material for all dosing days in the study. Subjects will sign the informed consent form at the Screening Visit, and will undergo screening assessments to verify eligibility for the study. If eligible and willing to participate, subjects will return to the clinic within 21 days of the Screening Visit to participate in the pre-dosing phase of the study. On Day 1 of the study, subjects will be randomized to receive SRT2104 or placebo. Subjects will be required to stay overnight at the study center on Days -2, -1, 0, 1 (optional discharge at investigator's discretion), 27, 28, 41, and 42 for testing, to assess safety, and to gather required biomarker samples. In addition, subjects will be asked to return to the study center on Day 14 for interim safety assessments. The subject will be telephoned on Days 7 and 21 to assess safety. Subjects will be required to monitor their fasting blood glucose and complete a daily diary for the outpatient portion of the study between Days 1 and 28. A follow-up, safety phone call will occur 30 days following their final dose of SRT2104 or placebo (Day 58 of the study) to identify any possible additional adverse events (AEs) or concomitant medications.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Able and willing to provide written informed consent to participate in the study Ambulatory male and female subjects (of any race) with T2D within the age range of 1865 years (inclusive) at the time of screening All female subjects must be of nonchildbearing potential. All male subjects must agree with their partners to use doublebarrier birth control or abstinence while participating in the study and for 12 weeks following the last dose of investigational product. For the purposes of this study, nonchildbearing is defined as: Amenorrheic for at least 12 consecutive months; menopausal status in amenorrheic females will be confirmed by demonstrating levels of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) &gt;40138 mIU/mL and estradiol &lt; 30 pg/mL at entry. In the event a subject's menopause status has been clearly established (for example, the subject indicates she has been amenorrheic for 10 years), but FSH and/or estradiol levels are not consistent with a postmenopausal condition, determination of subject eligibility will be at the discretion of the principal investigator with agreement of the independent medical monitor At least 6 weeks postsurgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or post tubal ligation The subject must be on stable metformin monotherapy for a minimum of 3 months prior to the Screening visit.
