	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Drugs, such as riluzole, may make tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy. Giving riluzole together with whole-brain radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of riluzole when given together with whole-brain radiation therapy in treating patients with brain metastases.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Riluzole and Whole-Brain Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Brain Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To determine the maximum tolerated dose of riluzole that can be administered concurrently with standard whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) in patients with multiple brain metastases. Secondary - To determine the long-term toxicity of riluzole when administered with WBRT. - To assess neurocognitive function before and after treatment with riluzole and WBRT. - To determine the MRI response of brain metastasis after treatment with riluzole and WBRT. - To compare survival of patients treated with riluzole and WBRT to published historical data for patients with brain metastases. - To evaluate the response of brain metastasis to riluzole and WBRT as a function of the expression of glutamate receptors on the primary tumor specimen. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of riluzole. Patients receive oral riluzole twice daily beginning on day 0. Beginning within 2 days after the initiation of riluzole, patients undergo whole-brain radiotherapy for 15 fractions. Patients undergo neurocognitive and quality-of-life assessments at baseline, at 5 weeks, and at 3 months. Tumor tissue samples are collected for laboratory biomarker studies. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 6 weeks, every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.</detailed_description>
