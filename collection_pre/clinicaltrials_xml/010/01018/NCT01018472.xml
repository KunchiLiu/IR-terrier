	<brief_summary>Infants with congenital heart disease have more frequent infections and exposures to antibiotics than healthy infants. It is unknown how congenital heart disease affects the development of bacterial colonization of the intestines. It is also unknown whether probiotics will change the bacteria in the intestine of infants with heart disease to become more like those of healthy infants without heart disease. This pilot trial is designed to address these two questions.</brief_summary>
