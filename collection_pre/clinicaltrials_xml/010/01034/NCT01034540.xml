	<detailed_description>This trial will utilize a randomized, double-blind, two-period crossover design. At Visit 2 (Week 0), subjects meeting all entry criteria will be randomized to one of two treatment sequences: placebo or POM3 for the first 6 week phase followed by the study product they did not receive during the first phase (POM3 or placebo) for the second 6 weeks.
