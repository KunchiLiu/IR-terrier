	<brief_summary>The primary objective of the trial was to assess the bioequivalence for two concentrations (5.83 mg/mL and 8 mg/mL) of the new r-hGH liquid multidose formulation using the r hGH freeze-dried multidose formulation (Saizen® 8 mg, 8.8 mg/1.51 mL) as reference. Each volunteer received three r hGH treatments, with each treatment being administered as a single subcutaneous dose of 4 mg r-hGH in a randomized sequence with at least one week of wash-out period between successive treatments.</brief_summary>

Smoked less than 10 cigarettes per day, consented to smoke less than 5 cigarettes per day during the trial period and were able to refrain from smoking during the confinement period 6. Were able to communicate well with the Investigator and willing to comply with the requirements of the entire trial 7. Were willing to undergo pituitary downregulation by intravenous infusion with somatostatin for 25 hours If female: 8. Had a negative serum pregnancy test within three weeks prior to trial start and a negative urine pregnancy test at the day before dosing 9. Were premenopausal and using an adequate method of nonhormonal contraception (2 barrier methods, or one barrier method with spermicide, or nonhormonal intrauterine device), sexual abstinence or females with vasectomised partners during the entire trial Main exclusion criteria: 1. Any surgical or medical condition, including findings in the medical history or in the pre trial assessments, that in the opinion of the Investigator, constituted a risk or a contraindication for the participation of the subject in the trial or that could have interfered with the trial objectives, conduct or evaluation 2. Had any clinically significant abnormal laboratory test results in the pretrial safety laboratory tests or any clinically abnormal findings on the 12 leads resting electrocardiogram (ECG) that in the opinion of the Investigator may have increased the safety risk to the subject 3. Had positive results for drugs of abuse or alcohol test 4. Had positive results from serology examination for Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) (not due to vaccination), Hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb) (if positive, was to be verified by test for antiHbcIgM), Hepatitis C Virus (antiHCV) and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (antiHIV 1 and 2) at screening 5. History or presence of hypertension or other significant cardiovascular abnormalities 6. History or presence of cholelithiasis 7. Significant history or clinical evidence of autoimmune, gastrointestinal, haematological, hematopoietic, hepatic, neurological, pancreatic or renal disease 8. History or presence of diabetes 9. History or presence of tumors of the pituitary gland or hypothalamus 10. Definite or suspected personal history or family history of adverse drug reaction or hypersensitivity to drugs with a similar chemical structure to somatropin or somatostatin or its excipients, use of any chronic medication</criteria>
