	<brief_summary>The relevance of the study will be in establishing whether Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) measures obtained repeatedly during hemophilia care are sensitive to significant changes in health or personal circumstances related to the transition from youth to adulthood. This may support the future use of HRQoL measures as part of routine care in order to identify important changes that are not detectible by other clinical means.</brief_summary>
