	<brief_summary>Impaired glucose tolerance is a metabolic state between normal glucose homeostasis and diabetes. Previously, prospective studies have shown higher progression rates from IGT to diabetes in other country. But There is no prospective-multicenter based reports in Korea. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to estimate the progression rates to impair glucose regulation and diabetes in the Korean population-based Korea national Diabetes program.</brief_summary>
