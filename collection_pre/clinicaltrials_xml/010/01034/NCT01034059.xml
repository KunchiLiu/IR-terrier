	<brief_summary>The soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 (sTREM-1) was an established biomarker useful for infection in non-neutropenic patients. In this study, we tested sTREM-1 in the patients with neutropenic fever. Pro-calcitonin (PCT) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were also measured. We planned to investigate and explore the role of sTREM-1 in early diagnosis of infection in patients with neutropenic fever.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessment of sTREM-1 as a Diagnostic Marker in Patients With Neutropenic Fever</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with hematological malignancies developed neutropenia after chemotherapy. We checked the serum level of sTREM-1 in patients with neutropenic fever. Those patients were classified to 2 groups: documented infection or low likelihood of infection. Their sTREM-1 level was measured and was compared with other biomarker such as CRP and procalcitonin. The value of sTREM-1 for diagnosis of infection in patients with neutropenic fever was thus evaluated.</detailed_description>
