	<brief_summary>We hypothesize that the addition of cetuximab to twice weekly paclitaxel/cisplatin concurrent chemoradiotherapy (TP-CCRT) as the adjunctive therapy before esophagectomy or as a definitive CRT would improve the therapeutic efficacy of TP-CCRT in patients with loco-regional esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Pathologically proven squamous cell carcinoma of esophagus. 2.

Adequate liver function reserves, defined as: A. hepatic transaminases ≤ 2.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN); B. serum total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN). 7. Adequate renal function: Creatinine ≤1.5 mg/dl 8. Written informed consent. 1. Invasion to surrounding organ (T4 disease). 2. Distant metastasis, except M1a disease listed in the inclusion criteria 2C. 3. Adenocarcinoma of gastroesophageal (GE) junction. 4. Prior thoracic irradiation. 5. Synchronously diagnosed squamous cell carcinoma of aerodigestive way, other than esophageal cancer. 6. Prior malignancy, except for the following: A. adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer; B. insitu cervical cancer; C. Note: previously treated aerodigestive squamous cell carcinoma is not allowed. 7. Significant comorbid disease, which prohibit the conduction of chemotherapy, concurrent chemoradiotherapy, or radical surgery, such as active systemic infection, symptomatic cardiac or pulmonary disease, or psychiatric disorders. 8.
