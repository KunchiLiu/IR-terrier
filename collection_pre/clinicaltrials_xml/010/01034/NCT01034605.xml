	<brief_summary>Based upon an increased secretion of gastrointestinal satiety hormones (CCK, GLP-1), PinnoThin is hypothesized to be more satiating, and to limit energy intake in humans. Therefore, the objective of this study is to investigate whether PinnoThin leads to an increase in satiety as determined by VAS ratings? Additionally, does PinnoThin consumed during breakfast, in comparison to placebo, in overweight women, lead to a decrease in energy intake during an ad libitum lunch?</brief_summary>
