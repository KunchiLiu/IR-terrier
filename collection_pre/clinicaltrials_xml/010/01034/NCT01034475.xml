	<brief_summary>Chemotherapy resistance is a major cause of death in patients with advanced hematologic malignancies. The proposed novel mechanism of action, non-cross resistance with chemotherapeutic agents currently used in the clinic, and lack of CPI-613-related myelosuppression preclinically and clinically to date make CPI-613 a suitable candidate for phase I clinical trial in these patients. The current trial is one of several clinical trials of CPI-613. Other clinical trials that are conducted in patients with solid tumors have already been initiated. The primary objective of this study is to determine the safety and MTD of CPI-613 when administered 2x weekly for 3 consecutive weeks. The secondary objective is to determine the PKs of CPI-613 following IV administration and to observe the anti-tumor effects of CPI-613, if any occur.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>histologically or cytologically documented relapsed and/or refractory hematologic malignancy Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) of &gt;70%. Must be â‰¥18 years of age. Expected survival &gt;1 month. Women of childbearing potential must use accepted contraceptive methods No radiotherapy, treatment with cytotoxic agents (except CPI613), treatment with biologic agents or any anticancer therapy within the 3 weeks prior to treatment with CPI613. Serious medical illness, such as significant cardiac disease (e.g. symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, myocardial infarction within the past 6 months, uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia, or New York Heart Association Class III or IV), or severe debilitating pulmonary disease, that would potentially increase patients' risk for toxicity. Patients with active central nervous system (CNS) or epidural tumor. Any active uncontrolled bleeding, and any patients with a bleeding diathesis (e.g., active peptic ulcer disease). Pregnant women, or women of childbearing potential not using reliable means of contraception. Lactating females because the potential of excretion of CPI613 into breast milk. Life expectancy less than 1 month. Any condition or abnormality which may, in the opinion of the investigator, compromise the safety of patients.</criteria>
