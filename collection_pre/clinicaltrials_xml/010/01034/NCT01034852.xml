	<brief_summary>Specific Aims: The primary objective of this registry is to determine the percentage of patients who are free from atrial fibrillation (AF) at 6 and 12 months following a surgical ablation procedure when the patient has a history of failing one or more previous catheter based ablations for AF. The first 3 months following surgical ablation will be a blanking period; any arrhythmia occurring during this time will not be used to determine success. Primary Objectives: 1. Determine the percent success of surgical ablation for AF at 6, and 12 months both on and off of antiarrhythmic drugs (AAD) following a failed catheter based ablation for AF 2. Record and evaluate all complications associated with the surgical procedure. Secondary Objectives: 1. Evaluate usage of anticoagulants at 6, and 12 months. 2. Determine the percentage of Pulmonary Veins (PV) that were electrically isolated by intra-operative, pre-surgical mapping</brief_summary>
