	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness of two different reduced calorie diets that have different combinations of carbohydrate, fat, and protein content in 2 groups of study participants: insulin sensitive participants and insulin resistant participants. The hypothesis of the study is that people with high and low levels of insulin resistance may respond differently to different diet compositions in a real-world environment using meals that are commonly available.</brief_summary>
