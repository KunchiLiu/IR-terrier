	<brief_title>Study of Lobaplatin，5-Fluorouracil and Leucovorin for the Treatment of Esophageal Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>patients with metastatic or recurrent esophageal cancer have a particularly poor prognosis .The overall 5-year survival rate for patients with newly diagnosed esophageal cancer is under 10%. Metastatic esophageal carcinoma is an incurable disease and due to the lack of effective therapies to manage this disease,the median survival is only 6 to 8 months Chemotherapy which is one of the most effective treatment so far is used as part of combined modality therapy for locally advanced diseases or as a palliative treatment for metastatic diseases.Lobaplatin is the third generation of platinum.Phase Ⅱclinical trials indicate that lobaplatin is effective for esophageal cancer, ovarian cancer, breast cancer and small cell lung cancer.</detailed_description>
