	<brief_title>Iron Overload in Pediatric Oncology Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Long term survivors of childhood cancer, are a distinct group requiring specific follow-up in order to enhance their quality of life. Studies have shown that many of these patients will go on to develop chronic issues within different organ systems. Because of the iron burden of the frequent transfusions required to care for these patients, iron overload may indeed be one of the problems these survivors potentially face. Research primarily in thalassemia and bone marrow transplant patients who were extensively transfused has shown that iron overload can have a significant impact on their overall health. Complications from increased iron burden can include growth retardation, gonadal dysfunction, hypothyroidism, impaired glucose metabolism, cardiac arrhythmias and failure, hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis, and increased susceptibility to infections. However all of these conditions related to iron overload can be prevented with the use of either phlebotomy or chelation therapy. Based on this knowledge, our objective is to determine if pediatric oncology and transplant patients heavily supported with transfusions develop consequential biochemical and clinical evidence of iron overload.</detailed_description>
	<mesh_term>Iron Overload</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Patients six and a half to twenty five years of age with a history of acute myelogenous leukemia, rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, osteosarcoma, and neuroblastoma who have completed their treatment or received their last packed red blood cell transfusion at least one year prior to enrollment (which ever occurred later) and are one to ten years posttreatment. Patients six and a half to twenty five years of age who have undergone hematopoietic stem cell transplant for any malignancy and are at least one year from their last transfusion or transplant date prior to enrollment (which ever occurred later) and are one to ten years posttransplant. Patients who were treated at Schneider Children's Hospital or at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. Patients who have clinical evidence of chronic graft vs. host disease of skin, liver or gastrointestinal tract. Patients with a chronic infection (viral hepatitis), liver disease (fibrosis, cirrhosis), or a history of radiation to the liver. Patients who cannot have an MRI due to metallic implants (i.e. pacemakers, prosthetic valves, etc.) Patients who are pregnant.</criteria>
