	<brief_summary>Polyneuropathy of different etiologies is often associated with pain and the standard treatment for this type of pain is gabapentinoids or antidepressants. The hypothesis of this study is that the combination of the gabapentinoid pregabalin and the antidepressant imipramine will provide better pain relief than the single compounds alone. This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, 4-way, cross-over trial of pregabalin 300 mg/day, imipramine 75 mg/day and their combination versus placebo. The study will include 60 patients and the treatment outcome will be pain intensity as measured by numeric rating scales.</brief_summary>
