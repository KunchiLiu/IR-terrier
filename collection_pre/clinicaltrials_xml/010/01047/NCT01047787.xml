	<brief_summary>The investigators prospectively evaluated 89 consecutive outpatients (29 female) with stable congestive heart failure. The presence of sleep disordered breathing (SDB) and Cheyne-Stokes respiration (CSR) while awake were investigated by overnight polysomnography. Males and females were similar in age, body mass index, and LVEF. Prevalence of SDB was higher in males than females. During follow up of 25Â±10 months, 27% of the population died. Nonsurvivors had lower LVEF (p=0.01), worse NYHA class (p=0.03) a higher proportion of CSR-awake (p&lt;0.001) than survivors.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Bakground: There is little information in sleep disordered breathing (SDB) in women with congestive heart failure (CHF). We studied consecutive CHF patients in order to compare SDB characteristics according to gender, and to determine overall mortality impact of SDB and Cheyne-Stokes respiration (CSR) while awake. Methods: Eighty nine consecutive outpatients (29 female) with stable CHF (LVEF&lt;45%) were prospectively evaluated. The presence of SDB, as characterized by obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and CSR during sleep, as well as CSR while awake before sleep onset, were investigated by overnight polysomnography.</detailed_description>
