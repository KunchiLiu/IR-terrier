	<criteria>Age &gt; 18 years Locally invasive highrisk rectal adenocarcinoma as defined by the presence on MRI of at least one of the following: i) Tumours within 1mm of mesorectal fascia i.e. circumferential resection margin threatened or involved ii)T3 tumours at/below levators iii)Tumours extending â‰¥5mm into perirectal fat iv)T4 tumours (including the involvement of bladder or vagina if surgical resection is possible with clear margins) v)Presence of extramural venous invasion (primary tumour is therefore at least T3) vi)T2 N0/1/2 tumours requiring AbdominoPerineal Excision, within 1mm of mesorectal fascia i.e. circumferential resection margin threatened or involved The absence of malignant pelvic sidewall disease, local recurrence (either after TME or wide local excision) or metastatic disease Completion of preoperative longcourse CRT No viable disease seen at MRI performed 4 weeks after longcourse CRT, confirmed at 8 week MRI Evidence of partial response of rectal tumour to preoperative longcourse CRT at 4 week MRI which continues to show an incremental response at 8 week MRI. Histological diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of rectum. WHO performance status 0, 1 or 2. No evidence of metastatic disease as determined by CT scan of chest, abdomen, pelvis or other investigations such as PET scan or biopsy if required. Informed written consent Age &lt; 18 years. Absence of concomitant chemotherapy. RT dose below 50Gy. Stable disease at 4 week MRI. Disease that demonstrates a partial response at 4 week MRI but shows no evidence of an incremental response at 8 week MRI. Pregnancy or breast feeding Short course preoperative radiotherapy Previous pelvic radiotherapy Medical or psychiatric conditions that compromise the patient's ability to give informed consent Any contraindication to MRI scanning, eg Cardiac Pacemaker or Hip prosthesis. Any patients within the EXPERTC trial. Tumours which are mucinous (&gt;50% mucin seen on MRI), as these are more likely to be PET negative</criteria>
