	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetics of Anidulafungin on Intensive Care Unit (ICU)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One of the risk factors for mortality of patients with candidemia is inadequate antifungal therapy. The first days in the intensive care unit (ICU), patients are unstable and it can be questioned whether therapeutic levels of anidulafungin are reached after a standard loading scheme. At this moment there are several clues that the PK of anidulafungin in critically ill patients is different, but an overall picture is lacking. For the investigation of the correlation of the pharmacokinetics of anidulafungin and the disease severity a full pharmacokinetic profile will be obtained. Predictive scoring systems will be used to assess disease severity.</detailed_description>
