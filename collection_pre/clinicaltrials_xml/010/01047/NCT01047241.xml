	<brief_title>Nasal Administration of Sufentanil+Ketamine for Procedure-related Pain in Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The management of procedural pain in children ranges from physical restraint to pharmacological interventions. Pediatric formulations that permit accurate dosing, are accepted by children and a have a rapid onset of analgesia are lacking. The objectives were to investigate a pediatric formulation of intranasal sufentanil 0.5 mcg/kg and ketamine 0.5 mg/kg for procedural pain and to characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile. Fifty children (â‰¥10 kg) scheduled for a painful procedure were included in this prospective nonrandomized open-label clinical trial. Thirteen of these children had central venous access for drug assay sampling; enabling a compartmental PK analysis using nonlinear mixed-effects models. Pain intensity before and during the procedure was measured using age-appropriate pain scales. Heart rate, oxygen saturation and sedation were recorded.</detailed_description>
