	<brief_title>Repeat Dose Safety and Efficacy Study for Compound to Treat Anemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Compound 1278863A is a novel small molecule agent, which stimulates erythropoiesis through inhibition of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-prolyl hydroxylases (EGLNs). This compound is being developed for the treatment of anemia. This study, PHI112844, will be the first administration of compound 1278863A to investigate the pharmacodynamics/efficacy, safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of repeat oral doses in anemic pre-dialysis patients with moderate or severe renal impairment and in hemodialysis-dependent patients.</detailed_description>

(Part 1) has Moderate to Severe Renal Impairment (equivalent to NKF KDOQI Stage 3 or 4, not receiving dialysis) as determined by estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) calculated by the abbreviated MDRD equation, and not expected to go on dialysis until ≥ 8 weeks after first administration of investigational product. Stage 5, nondialysis patients with eGFR of 10 15 mL/min per 1.73 m2 will also be eligible for Part 1 on a casebycase basis. 2. (Part 2) has Severe Renal Impairment and has been on stable hemodialysis treatment for 1 month prior to Screening (subjects with planned transition to hemodialysis) or 3 months prior to Screening (subjects emergently placed on hemodialysis). These subjects are equivalent to NKF KDOQI Stage 5. 3. otherwise healthy or considered clinically stable with respect to underlying renal impairment and with respect to underlying/chronic disease as determined by a responsible and experienced physician, based on a medical evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and cardiac monitoring. 4. has clinical laboratory test results that are considered clinically stable in the opinion of the principal investigator, especially if the clinical abnormality or laboratory parameter is deemed associated with the patient's underlying renal impairment. 3. Meets the following erythropoiesis stimulating agent (ESA) criteria: 1. The patient is ESA naïve OR 2. If the patient has a scheduled ESA interval which is ≤ 7 days, ESA treatment must be discontinued for at least 7 days OR 3. If the patient has a scheduled ESA interval which is &gt; 7 days, ESA treatment must be discontinued for at least that scheduled interval length (eg discontinued ≥ 14 days for a scheduled 14 day ESA interval) AND The patient will not resume ESA treatment until completion of the Followup Visit (Day 57). 4. Has a hemoglobin value: 1. For ESA naïve patients: ≤11.0 g/dL 2. For patients receiving ongoing ESA treatment: ≤11.5 g/dL at Screening with a re check value of ≤11.0 g/dL after appropriate ESA discontinuation according to Inclusion 3 and prior to commencing study drug dosing. 5. 5. Has serum ferritin at Screening: 1. ≥40 μg/L with the absence of microcytic or hypochromic RBCs (regardless of transferrin saturation %) OR 2. 2539 μg/L with transferrin saturation % ≥20% (fraction saturation ≥0.20) and the absence of microcytic or hypochromic RBCs 6. Has Vitamin B12 and folate above the lower limit of normal at Screening 7. A female patient is eligible to participate if she is: 1. of childbearing potential, and must agree to use one of the contraception methods in Section 8.1.1. This criterion must be followed from the time of Screening until completion of the Followup Visit (Day 57) OR 2. of nonchildbearing potential defined as premenopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea [in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) &gt; 40 MlU/ml and estradiol &lt; 40 pg/ml (&lt;140 pmol/L) is confirmatory]. Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the contraception methods in Section 8.1.1 if they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status prior to study enrollment. For most forms of HRT, at least 24 weeks will elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends on the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of their postmenopausal status, they can resume use of HRT during the study without use of a contraceptive method. 8. Male patients must agree to use one of the contraception methods listed in Section 8.1.2. This criterion must be followed from the time of the first dose of study drug until completion of the Followup Visit (Day 57). 9. Body weight ≥ 45 kg 10. QTcB or QTcF &lt; 450 msec; or QTc &lt; 480 msec in patients with bundle branch block. These should be based on an average of triplicate values obtained at Screening. 11. Capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with the requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form. 1.
