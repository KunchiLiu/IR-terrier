	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of Alogliptin Plus Metformin in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There are approximately 19 million people in the United States who have been diagnosed with diabetes mellitus, of which 90% to 95% are type 2. The prevalence of type 2 diabetes varies among racial and ethnic populations and has been shown to correlate with age, obesity, family history, history of gestational diabetes and physical inactivity. Over the next decade, a marked increase in the number of adults with diabetes mellitus is expected. Metformin is the usual choice of first-line therapy for type 2 diabetes. Metformin targets insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes by inhibiting hepatic glucose production and stimulating glucose uptake in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue, which results in a long-term glucose-lowering effect. Alogliptin is an inhibitor of the dipeptidyl peptidase IV enzyme. Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 enzyme is thought to be primarily responsible for the in vivo degradation of 2 peptide hormones released in response to nutrient ingestion, namely glucagon-like peptide-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide. Both peptides exert important effects on islet beta cells to stimulate glucose-dependent insulin secretion as well as regulating beta cell proliferation and cytoprotection. Glucagon-like peptide-1, but not glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide, inhibits gastric emptying, glucagon secretion, and food intake. Glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide has been shown to enhance insulin secretion by direct interaction with a glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide -specific receptor on islet beta cells. The glucose-lowering actions of glucagon-like peptide-1, but not glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide, are preserved in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. It is expected that inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidase IV will improve glycemic (glucose) control in patients with type 2 diabetes. Based on the potential, complimentary mechanisms of action of alogliptin and metformin, this study will compare the safety and efficacy of alogliptin and metformin (SYR-322MET) on improving glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who are inadequately controlled by diet adjustment and exercise alone. Participants taking part in this study will receive dietary and exercise coaching, and will monitor their own blood glucose concentrations with a home glucose monitor. Participants will also be required to maintain a hypoglycemic diary throughout the course of the study. Participation in this study is expected to last up to 34 weeks.</detailed_description>
