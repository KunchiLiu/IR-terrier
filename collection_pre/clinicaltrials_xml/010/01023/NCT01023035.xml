	<brief_summary>The current trial is designed to prospectively explore the safety of erythropoietin use for the treatment of anemia during boceprevir plus peginterferon alfa-2b/Ribavirin (PEG2b/RBV) therapy and to assess its relationship to efficacy. All participants in this trial will be treated with the triple combination of boceprevir plus PEG2b/RBV. If a participant becomes anemic during treatment, the participant will be randomized to one of two therapeutic strategies for management of anemia (erythropoietin use versus RBV dose reduction).</brief_summary>
