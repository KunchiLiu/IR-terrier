	<criteria>Up to two de novo lesions can be treated, each located in a separate native epicardial vessel. Target lesion(s) must be located in a native coronary artery where target vessel(s) diameter is ≥ 2.0 mm and ≤ 3.3 mm and target lesion length is ≤ 28 mm, both assessed by online QCA. Target lesion(s) must be in a major artery or branch with a visually estimated stenosis of ≥ 50% and &lt; 100% with a TIMI flow of ≥ 1. If two treatable lesions meet the inclusion criteria they must be in separate major epicardial vessels (LAD with septal and diagonal branches, LCX with obtuse marginal and/or ramus intermedius branches and RCA and any of its branches). Percutaneous interventions for lesions in a nontarget vessel are allowed if done ≥ 30 days prior to or if planned to be done 6 months after the index procedure. Percutaneous intervention for lesions in the target vessel are allowed if done &gt; 6 months prior to or if planned to be done 6 months after the index procedure. Lesion(s) located within an arterial or saphenous vein graft or distal to a diseased (defined as vessel irregularity per angiogram and &gt; 20% stenosed lesion by visual estimation) arterial or saphenous vein graft. Lesion(s) involving a bifurcation with side branch vessel ≥ 2 mm in diameter and/or ostial lesion &gt; 40% stenosed by visual estimation or side branch requiring predilatation. Total occlusion (TIMI flow 0), prior to wire passing. Target vessel(s) contains visible thrombus. Another clinically significant lesion is located in the same epicardial vessel (including side branch) as the target lesion(s). Subject has received brachytherapy in any epicardial vessel (including side branches).</criteria>
