	<brief_title>Symptoms and Quality of Life (QoL) After Palliative Pelvic Radiation of Prostate and Rectal Cancers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>With the aging population, the prevalence of cancer is on the rise, leading to an increased demand for effective palliative treatment. There is little scientific information describing the effects of palliative radiotherapy among patients treated for soft-tissue tumors of the pelvis. This is a treatment that is used relatively frequently, but delivered heterogeneously since the optimum fractionation schedule has yet to be established. This study aims to define the effects of one such fractionation schedule (3Gy x 10-13) and thus, establish a foundation for future fractionation studies.</detailed_description>
