	<brief_summary>Many trials suggested that lipid lowering therapy could significantly reduce cardiovascular events. Enhancing stability of vulnerable plaque is probably the main reason by which statins reduce adverse coronary events. The size of lipid core and the fibrous cap thickness (FCT) are the major determinants of plaque vulnerability. So, it is very important to accurately evaluate changes in plaque after stains therapy. Previous reports suggested that intensive lipid lowering therapy provide more significantly clinical benefit compared with moderate lipid lowering therapy.Such benefit may contribute to the changes in following parameters: FCT, lipid arc(quadrants), TCFA, macrophage, plaque disruption, and thrombus measured by OCT, and plaque burden and remodeling index by IVUS. Current intravascular imaging modalities, such as optical coherence tomography (OCT) and intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) can provide in vivo quantitative and qualitative information of coronary plaques. However, there were few studies aimed at monitoring the progression of coronary plaques in patients receiving statin therapy by OCT combined with IVUS. Therefore, the study we designed were to compare the effect of the rosuvastatin 10mg, atorvastatin 20mg and atorvastatin 60mg treatment on the changes in FCT and lipid core arc by OCT and plaque burden by IVUS of coronary atherosclerotic plaques.</brief_summary>
