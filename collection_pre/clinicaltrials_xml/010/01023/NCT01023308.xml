	<brief_summary>Panobinostat (LBH589) is a highly potent pan-deacetylase inhibitor (pan-DACi), inclusive of HDAC6, which disrupts aggresome function, promotes accumulation of cytotoxic misfolded protein aggregates and triggers myeloma cell death. Combination of pan-DAC and proteasome inhibition by co-treatment with panobinostat (PAN) and bortezomib (BTZ) has demonstrated synergistic cytotoxicity in vitro and in vivo in pre-clinical experiments. Furthermore, clinical experience in advanced multiple myeloma (MM) patients treated by oral panobinostat and i.v bortezomib ± dexamethasone showed very encouraging results for efficacy and manageable toxicity profile. Given the medical need for improved treatment strategies for patients with previously treated and relapsed MM, the purpose of this prospective, multinational, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group Phase III study is to compare the results in progression-free survival of 2 combination therapies, panobinostat with bortezomib and dexamethasone or placebo with bortezomib and dexamethasone, in patients with previously treated MM who recurred after 1-3 prior lines of therapy</brief_summary>
