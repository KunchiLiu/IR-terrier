	<brief_summary>Prospective, real-time observational study of hemodialysis patients treated with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESA) to currently recommended Hgb targets. Subjects will be evaluated dynamically for their blood viscosity status at the beginning and end of the dialysis treatment, and followed prospectively to assess outcomes. Blood specimens will be collected via the subject's hemodialysis port pre- and post-hemodialysis per study assessment visit. Blood will be analyzed at a designated laboratory facility for viscosity over a comprehensive range of shear rates and tested for intradialytic surges in blood viscosity. Subjects will be followed for 48 weeks.</brief_summary>
