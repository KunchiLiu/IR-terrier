	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is 1. To determine if Brain natriuretic peptide levels correlates with elevated tricuspid regurgitation flow velocity levels in pediatric patients with sickle cell disease 2. To determine the role of age, gender, steady state hemoglobin and disease type on Brain natriuretic peptide levels and pulmonary hypertension</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Serum Brain Natriuretic Peptide Levels and Pulmonary Hypertension in Pediatric Sickle Cell Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pulmonary hypertension is recognized as a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with sickle cell disease. Doppler echocardiography is a recommended noninvasive screening tool for sickle cell disease patients with pulmonary hypertension. Brain natriuretic peptide levels have been found to be a possible serum screening marker. This research will offer the opportunity to determine if there is any possible relationship between magnitude of BNP concentration and degree of TRV, if it can be used as a screening test in SCD pediatric patients with PHT and form the basis for a future multicenter study</detailed_description>
