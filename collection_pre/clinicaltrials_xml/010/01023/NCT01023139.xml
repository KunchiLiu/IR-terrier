	<brief_summary>There are few studies that look at sustained weight loss in the adolescent population. This study uses a multidisciplinary approach along with pharmacotherapy (use of Meridia)to motivate and establish behavior changes in adolescents (12-18yo) during the first phase of the study. The second phase will have those who have lost at least 5% BMI to be randomized into one of two groups. This first group will have no intervention and will be followed at 3 and 6 months to assess for weight loss maintenance. The second group will continue on with monthly behavior modifications and also be evaluated at 3 and 6 months. The hypothesis proposed is that, 1)there will be sustained weight loss at the end of one year in both arms as compared to baseline BMI, 2) and the arm with the behavioral therapy intervention will be more successful than no intervention at weight loss maintenance.</brief_summary>
