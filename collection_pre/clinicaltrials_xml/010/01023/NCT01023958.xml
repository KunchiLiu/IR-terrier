	<brief_title>Intravenous BI 6727 (Volasertib) in 2nd Line Treatment of Urothelial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: 1. Histologically or cytologically confirmed urothelial cancer of the bladder, ureters or renal pelvis. 2. Patients with stage III, IV or recurrent urothelial cancer of the bladder, ureter or renal pelvis after failure or recurrence after first line or adjuvant/neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Recurrence is defined as relapse within 2 years after cessation of prior firstline chemotherapy. 3. Male or female patient aged 18 years or older 4. Life expectancy of at least three (3) months 5. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance score of 2 or less 6. At least one target tumor lesion that has not been irradiated within the past three months and that can accurately be measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as &gt;20 mm with conventional techniques or as &gt;10 mm with spiral CT 7. The patient must have given written informed consent prior to inclusion into the trial which must be consistent with the International Conference on Harmonization, Good Clinical Practice (ICHGCP) and local legislation Exclusion criteria: 1. More than one prior regimen of chemotherapy including prior adjuvant therapy 2. Brain metastases 3. Patients with bone metastasis as the only site of disease are excluded 4. Serious illness or organ system dysfunction, which in the opinion of the investigator, would either compromise patient safety, interfere with the evaluation of the safety of the test drug or limit compliance with trial requirements. 5. QTc prolongation deemed clinically relevant by the investigator 6. Second malignancy currently requiring active therapy 7. Other active malignancy diagnosed within the past 3 years (other than non melanomatous skin cancer and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia) 8. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &lt;1,500/µl 9. Platelet count &lt;100,000/µl 10. Hemoglobin &lt;9 g/dl 11. Total bilirubin &gt;1.5 mg/dl 12. Aspartate amino transferase (AST) and/or alanine amino transferase (ALT) &gt;2.5 x ULN, or aspartate amino transferase (AST) and/or alanine amino transferase (ALT) &gt;5 x ULN in case of known liver metastases 13. Serum creatinine &gt;1.5 x ULN 14. Chemo, Radio or immunotherapy within the past 4 weeks. This does not apply to steroids and bisphosphonates. 15. Active infectious disease, or HIV, HepatitisB or C infection 16. Active drug or alcohol abuse 17. Women and men who are sexually active and unwilling to use a medically acceptable method of contraception (e.g. such as implants, injectables, combined oral contraceptives, some intrauterine devices or vasectomized partner for participating females, condoms for participating males) during the trial 18. Pregnancy or breast feeding 19. Treatment with any investigational drug within the past 4 weeks or within less than four halflife times of the investigational drug before treatment with the trial drug and/or persistence of toxicities of prior anticancer therapies which are deemed to be clinically relevant. 20. Prior treatment with Pololike kinase 1 (Plk1) inhibitor 21. Patient unable to comply with the protocol 22. Any known hypersensitivity to the trial drugs or their excipients</criteria>
