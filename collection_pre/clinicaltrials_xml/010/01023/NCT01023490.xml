	<brief_title>Vitamin D Treatment to Patients Suffering From Chronic Pain and Vitamin D Hypovitaminosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Vitamin D is a complex nutrient that functions as a hormone to benefit numerous body tissues. Vitamin D is naturally produced by skin exposed to ultraviolet B. Despite the fact that Israel is a sunny country, a majority of all patients, and particularly those with pain, have inadequate intake of vitamin D. Vitamin D therapy is easy for patients to self administer, well tolerated, and very economical. In this study, we'll check whether vitamin D will lead to a decrease in pain intensity in patients suffering from chronic low back pain.</detailed_description>
