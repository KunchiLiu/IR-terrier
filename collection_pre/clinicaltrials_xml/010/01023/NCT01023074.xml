	<detailed_description>Five general types of evaluations will be employed over multiple study sessions at the National Center for Rehabilitative Auditory Research (NCRAR). First, a neurologist will review the subject's medical history and perform a neurologic exam to confirm MS diagnosis. Second, peripheral auditory function will be evaluated using a standard set of routine audiometric tests. Additionally, subjects will complete a case history and series of hearing handicap inventories. Third, a battery of behavioral procedures will be used to characterize central auditory processing. Fourth, auditory evoked potential studies will be performed. Emphasis here will be upon evoked potentials whose putative neural generators lie within the central auditory nervous system. Fifth, subjects will receive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evaluation to determine sites and amount of neural degeneration.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>age 2165 years; a clinical or laboratory supported diagnosis of "definite" MS; a diagnosis of relapsingremitting, primary progressive, or secondary progressive MS; a Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Score (EDSS) of 0 to 7.0, inclusive; no history of a clinical relapse or change in EDSS for three months preceding entry into the study; and a brain MRI scan that shows at least three whitematter lesions on T2weighted images consistent with MS current major disease or disorder other than MS (e.g., cancer, endstage renal disease, endstage cardiopulmonary disease, posttraumatic stress disorder, diabetes); other neurological conditions that could interfere with the ability to respond to tests and questionnaires; nonnative speaker of English (since test materials are presented in English); pregnant (due to potential negative effects on the fetus during fMRI); more than a mild degree (less than a 40 dB HL fourfrequency puretone average [PTA]) of hearing loss bilaterally (since the presence of more than a mild degree of peripheral hearing impairment may impact CAP test results); metal implants (due to fMRI constraints); and lefthandedness</criteria>
