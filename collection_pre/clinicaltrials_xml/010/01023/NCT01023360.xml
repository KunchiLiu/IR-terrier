	<brief_summary>Currently, drugs commonly used for antiplatelet are aspirin and clopidogrel when encountering stroke or coronary heart disease. In this study, we would use VASP assay and thromboelastograph with platelet mapping assay kit to evaluate the antiplatelet resistance in general population and the relationship between clopidogrel and proton pump inhibitor.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of Antiplatelet Drug Resistance in Taiwanese With VASP &amp; Platelet Mapping â„¢ Assay</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study intent is to search the standard to diagnose of the antiplatelet drug resistance and to discover the prevalence of drug resistance in Taiwanese population in Taiwan. The trial will enroll at least 30 healthy people after fulfilling the investigation questionnaire. All the participants will receive antiplatelet drugs in two separate period and measured the efficacy by VASP assay and thromboelastograph with platelet mapping assay. The health volunteer will receive clopidogrel and different types of proton pump inhibitor to see the interference of antiplatelet efficacy between each drug.</detailed_description>
