	<brief_summary>The primary objective for the project is to evaluate whether nursing home residents who require intravenous fluids and intravenous antibiotics, can be treated just as well or even better in the nursing home as in the hospital. In Vestfold, Norway, a structured training program in the intravenous treatment of dehydration and infections in nursing homes is planned. The 3IV study will evaluate if this leads to an equal or better patient trajectory and reduced hospital admittance.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1. Can a structured training program in administration of intravenous fluids and antibiotics lead to a reduced number of admissions and days in hospitals among nursing home residents? 2. Can treatment with intravenous fluids or antibiotics in nursing homes provide an equally good or better patient trajectory compared to patients hospitalized for the same treatment? We will look at duration of symptoms, direct and indirect complications, and mortality rates. 3. Can treatment costs for the public health service be reduced when patients are treated with intravenous fluids and /or antibiotics in the nursing home instead of being admitted to the hospital? 4. Can treatment for dehydration and infections in the nursing home rather than in a hospital provide an equally or better satisfaction in patients, next of kin and staff? 5. How are difficult ethical issues handeld by medical staff at the nursing homes and the hospital when nursing home patients receive intravenous treatment?</detailed_description>
