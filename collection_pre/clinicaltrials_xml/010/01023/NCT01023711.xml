"Active" is defined as treatment within the past 5 years. Long term (greater than 2 weeks) use of oral or parental steroids, or high dose inhaled steroids (&gt;800 mcg/day of beclomethasone dipropionate or equivalent) within the preceding 6 months (nasal &amp; topical steroids allowed) Received immunoglobulin or other blood product within 3 months prior to enrollment in this study Subject has received an inactivated vaccine within 2 weeks or a live vaccine within 4 weeks prior to enrollment or plans to receive another vaccine within the next 28 days Subject has an acute or chronic medical condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would render vaccination unsafe or would interfere with the evaluation of responses. Those conditions include chronic conditions recognized as risk factors for influenza complications or as contraindicated for live vaccination, including chronic cardiac (exclusive of hypertension) or pulmonary conditions (including asthma), diabetes mellitus, or renal impairment Subject has an acute illness or an oral temperature greater then 99.9 F(37.7 C)within 3 days of enrollment or vaccination. Subject who has acute illness that was treated, symptoms resolved are eligible to enroll as long as treatment is complete &amp; symptoms resolved &gt; 3 days prior to enrollment. Subject is currently participating or plans to participate in a study that involves an experimental agent (vaccine, drug, biologic, device, blood product, or medication) or has received an experimental agent within 1 month of enrollment in this study, or intends to donate blood during this period. Subject has any condition that would, in the opinion of the investigator, place the subject at an unacceptable risk of injury or render the subject unable to meet the requirements of the protocol Subject has a diagnosis of schizophrenia, bipolar disease, or other severe (disabling) chronic psychiatric diagnosis, or are receiving psychiatric drugs.
