	<brief_title>An Efficacy and Safety Study of Transdermal Therapeutic System (TTS)-Fentanyl in Cancer Participants With Inadequately Controlled Pain by Non-Narcotic Analgesics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), single-arm, multicenter (conducted in more than one hospital or medical school team work on a medical research study), prospective (study following participants forward in time) study conducted to assess the efficacy and safety of TTS-fentanyl D-trans in cancer participants of Korea with inadequately controlled pain by non-narcotic analgesics and for participant's satisfaction. The participants will receive the initial dose of TTS-fentanyl D-trans patch releasing 12 micrograms per hour (12 mcg/hr) of fentanyl and will be increased by 12 mcg/hr or 25 mcg/hr, every 3 days depending on the participant's pain control. Efficacy will primarily be evaluated by participant's satisfaction with pain treatment. Participant's safety will be monitored throughout the study.</detailed_description>
