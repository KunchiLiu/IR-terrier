	<brief_summary>We hypothesize that all human malignancies harbour a subpopulation of tumor initiating cells/cancer stem cells (CSCs) that drives tumor development and potentially recurrence or metastasis of the disease. The primary aim of this study is to develop strategies for prospective isolation/enrichment of CSCs from human tumors of different tissue origins. In addition, we will characterize the signaling pathways and/or tumor specific antigens that are specific for CSCs, in order to specifically target these CSCs as the endpoint of this study.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>N/A. We will recruit all nonmelanoma skin and bladder cancer patients that are recommended for surgical removal of tumor tissues. This includes patients from all ages, gender and ethnicity background. Our sample collection criteria based on the tumor size of individual (e.g. tumor samples will only be collected if it will not affect the pathological diagnosis or treatment procedures of patients).
