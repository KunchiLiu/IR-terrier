	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to verify the existence of neuromuscular neutral zones(NNZs) in humans, and develop non-invasive techniques to measure intervertebral kinematics of the lumbar spine. The results will be used to accurately quantify NNZs in humans, and provide a foundation for clinical trials on low back pain patients using this methodology.</brief_summary>
