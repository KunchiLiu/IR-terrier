	<brief_summary>Objectives: Blood in stomach &amp; oesophagus in patients with variceal bleeding often obscures the endoscopic view &amp; makes endoscopic intervention difficult to perform. Erythromycin, a motilin agonist induces gastric emptying. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of Erythromycin on endoscopic visibility and its outcome.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intravenous Erythromycin Before Endoscopy in Patients With Variceal Bleeding: A Randomized, Double-Blind Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Methods: Adult patients with liver cirrhosis or stigmata of chronic liver disease presenting with hematemesis and or melena within previous 12 hours were randomized in a double blind trial to receive either 125 mg erythromycin or placebo 30 minutes before endoscopy. The primary end points were endoscopic visibility assessed by objective scoring system &amp; mean endoscopy duration. Secondary end points were need for repeat endoscopy and blood transfusions within 24 hours of first endoscopy , endoscopy related complications and length of hospital stay.</detailed_description>
