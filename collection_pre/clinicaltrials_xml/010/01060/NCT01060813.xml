	<brief_summary>This is a pilot study including 20 cirrhotic patients that will be randomized to receive during 3 months leucine vs leucine plus a programme of physical exercise specially designed for cirrhotic patients. The hypothesis is that physical exercise in cirrhotic patients could increase muscle mass (and therefore glutamine synthetase activity leading to a higher blood ammonium clearance) and quality of life. Safety of physical exercise in cirrhotic patients will be strictly assessed.</brief_summary>
