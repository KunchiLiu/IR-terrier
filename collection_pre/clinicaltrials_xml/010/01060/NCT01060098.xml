	<brief_summary>Inflammatory arthritis particularly rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis are potentially disabling conditions which cause joint pain, swelling and deformity and treatments are aimed at preventing these complications. Although treatment has improved with the advent of antiTNFalpha therapies, up to 30% of patients fail to respond to this treatment and in others, treatment is associated with significant side effects. The precise mechanisms of this remain unclear. In addition, there are no sensitive methods available to monitor or predict disease response to treatment aside from testing inflammatory markers in the blood. Understanding the mechanism of action and what governs response to antiTNF therapy will allow development of more specific therapies for inflammatory arthritis. Work in animal models of rheumatoid arthritis has characterised a novel cell type, Th17 cells, important in the inflammatory cascade which are affected in a particular way by antiTNF therapies and may underpin their mechanism of action and side effects. We aim to translate these findings into patients with rheumatoid arthritis and other conditions treated with anti-TNF therapy, such as psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. Patients from rheumatology clinics within NHS trusts will be recruited. We will correlate disease activity assessed by clinical parameters, ultrasonography and questionnaires with biomarkers in the blood and target tissues, such as synovium and skin.</brief_summary>
