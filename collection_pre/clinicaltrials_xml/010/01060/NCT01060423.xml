	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of Irinotecan Beads in combination with intravenous cetuximab versus intravenous irinotecan in combination with intravenous cetuximab in the treatment of patients with unresectable liver metastases from colorectal cancer. Secondary objectives are safety and tolerability of hepatic chemoembolization and the question if the addition of aprepitant to standard antiemetic prophylaxis in patients treated by hepatic chemoembolization is safe and will reduce the rate of acute and delayed nausea and emesis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>TACE With Irinotecan Drug-eluting Beads and Intravenous (IV) Cetuximab in Refractory Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>About half of patients with newly diagnosed colorectal cancer will develop metastatic disease and, however, in spite of the significant progress in the therapeutical strategies for metastatic disease, virtually all patients will eventually succumb to their illness. Based on prior clinical data there is a good rationale for the expectation that the combination of systemic chemotherapy and arterial chemoembolization with drug eluting beads may be effective in the setting of patients with unresectable or chemorefractory liver metastases. The aim of this study is therefore to assess whether the combination of Irinotecan eluting beads and intravenous cetuximab is safe and effective in the treatment of patients with unresectable liver metastases from refractory colorectal cancer and will result in a prolongation of disease control when compared to standard systemic treatment with intravenous irinotecan and intravenous cetuximab. In this patient group, intravenous irinotecan plus intravenous cetuximab may represent the "standard of care", with a previously described activity. The patient group is defined in terms of pretreatment, and the scientific question is whether the way of irinotecan administration by eluting beads in feasible and somehow beneficial.</detailed_description>

Age ≥ 18 years. 9. At least 4 weeks since last administration of last chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy (bone metastases may be allowed) 10. Patients who received VEGFinhibition (e.g. with bevacizumab) in prior therapy are eligible if stopped since 46 weeks before randomization 11. Haematologic function: ANC ≥ 1.5 x 109/L, platelets ≥ 75 x109/L 12. INR &lt; 1.5 (patients on therapeutic anticoagulants are not eligible) 13. Adequate liver function as measured by serum transaminases (AST &amp; ALT) ≤ 3 x ULN and total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN 14. Adequate renal function: Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN 15. Normal level of serum magnesium 16. Women of child bearing potential and fertile men are required to use effective contraception (negative serum βHCG for women of childbearing age 17. Signed, written informed consent 1. Presence of CNS metastases 2. Contraindications to irinotecan therapy (Chronic inflammatory bowel disease and/or bowel obstruction, history of severe hypersensitivity reactions to irinotecan hydrochloride trihydrate) 3. Active bacterial, viral or fungal infection within 72 hours of study entry 4. Women who are pregnant or breast feeding 5. Allergy to contrast media 6. Presence of another concurrent malignancy. Prior malignancy in the last 5 years except adequately treated basal or squamous cell skin cancer or carcinoma in situ of the cervix 7. Any contraindication for hepatic embolisation procedures: Large shunt as determined by the investigator (pretesting with lung perfusion scan not required) Severe atheromatosis Hepatofugal blood flow 8. Other significant medical or surgical condition, or any medication or treatment, that would place the patient at undue risk, that would preclude the safe use of chemoembolization or would interfere with study participation 9. Known hypersensitivity or contraindication to the drugs used in the trial (eg: cetuximab, 5HT3 receptor antagonist, dexamethasone, or any component of aprepitant)</criteria>
