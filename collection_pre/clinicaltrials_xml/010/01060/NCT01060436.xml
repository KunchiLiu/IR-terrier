	<brief_summary>The purpose of this pilot study is to find out whether successful treatment of obstructive sleep apnea makes people look less sleepy, for example by reducing swelling or dark circles under the eyes. In addition, this study will help determine whether facial photographs may be used to help identify patients who should be tested for sleep apnea and daytime sleepiness.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Face of Sleepiness</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The main symptom of nocturnal sleep disorders is often excessive daytime sleepiness. Although sleepiness can be a major contributor to decreased quality of life, and even mortality, patients frequently grow habituated to their sleepiness, ignoring it and any underlying disorder. One scarcely explored potential consequence that could motivate patients to address sleep disorders is a sleepy facial appearance. No peer-reviewed literature, to our knowledge, has explored whether inadequate or insufficient sleep actually causes changes facial appearance. No published literature has examined the extent to which treatment for sleep disorders might improve such facial changes, and perhaps motivate patients to treat their sleep disorders. To address these questions in a preliminary manner, therefore, the investigators propose to use cutting-edge photographic technology to assess subtle changes in facial appearance. The investigators will recruit 20 sleepy adult patients who are diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea, an ideal disease model in which subjects can be tested before and after alleviation of severe sleepiness by home use of continuous positive airway pressure. Results of this pilot study could show for the first time that successful treatment of a chronic sleep disorder improves facial features commonly perceived as an undesirable sign of sleepiness.</detailed_description>
