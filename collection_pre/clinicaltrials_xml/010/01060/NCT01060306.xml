	<brief_summary>PONTINA aims at assessing by optical coherence tomography the neointimal coverage of the biodegradable polymer-based Biolimus A9-eluting stent (Biomatrix stent) after full drug elution and polymer biodegradation (6 months), at one month after this time-point (7 months) and, as a comparator, of its bare metal stent counterpart (Gazelle stent) at 1 month after implantation.</brief_summary>
