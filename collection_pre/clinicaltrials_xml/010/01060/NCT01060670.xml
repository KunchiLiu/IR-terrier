	<criteria>Type I or Type II diabetes mellitus Glycosylated hemoglobin, HbA1c, ≤ 12% Negative serum pregnancy test at screening for female participants of childbearing potential Willing and able to maintain the required offloading (as applicable for the location for the ulcer) and applicable dressing changes At least one DFU that met the following criteria: 1. Ulcer was diagnosed as a fullthickness neuropathic DFU that was located distal to the malleolus (excluding ulcers between the toes but including those of the heel), 2. Minimum 2cm margin between the qualifying study ulcer and any other ulcers on the specified foot (post debridement), 3. Area greater than or equal to 1 square centimeter and less than or equal to 12 square centimeters (post debridement at the time of randomization), 4. Wagner grade 1 or 2, 5. Depth less than or equal to 5 millimeters with no exposed capsule, tendon or bone and no tunneling, undermining or sinus tracts, 6. Duration of the study ulcer was at least 30 days at the time of the screening visit Adequate vascular perfusion of the affected limb Suspected or confirmed signs/symptoms of gangrene or wound infection on any part of the limb History of hypersensitivity to bovine collagen and/or chondroitin. Pregnancy Previous treatment under this clinical protocol Participation in another clinical trial involving a device or systematically administered investigational study drug or treatment within 30 days of the randomization visit. Receiving or scheduled to receive a medication or treatment which, in the opinion of the investigator, was known to interfere with, or affect the rate and quality of wound healing Any unstable condition or circumstance that could interfere with treatment regimen compliance Excessive lymphedema that could interfere with wound healing Unstable Charcot foot or Charcot with boney prominence Ulcers secondary to a disease other than diabetes Osteomyelitis with necrotic soft bone Chopart amputation History of bone cancer or metastatic disease of the affected limb, radiation therapy to the foot, or chemotherapy within the 12 months prior to randomization Treatment with wound dressings that include growth factors, engineered tissues, or skin substitutes within 30 days of randomization or scheduled to receive such treatment during the study Nonstudy ulcer requiring treatment that could not be treated during the study with moist wound therapy History of or intercurrent illnesses or conditions (other than diabetes) that would compromise the safety of the subject, or the normal wound healing process Employees or relatives of any member of the investigational site or sponsor Size of the study ulcer following debridement decreased by more than 30% during the run in period</criteria>
