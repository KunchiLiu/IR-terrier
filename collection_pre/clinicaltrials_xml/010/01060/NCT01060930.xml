	<brief_summary>Exposure to combustion-derived fine particulate air pollution is associated with cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. In previous studies, exposure to diesel exhaust (a major constituent of urban particulate air pollution) has been shown to impair two important functions of the vascular endothelium: vascular vasomotor function and endogenous fibrinolysis. Our subsequent studies suggest this impairment of vascular function is mediated by a reduction in nitric oxide bioavailability. In this study we aim to investigate the cardiovascular responses to systemic nitric oxide synthase inhibition following exposure to dilute diesel exhaust.</brief_summary>
