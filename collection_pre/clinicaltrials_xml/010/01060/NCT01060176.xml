	<brief_summary>Tranexamic acid is thought to be a promising substitute for aprotinin when the latter has seceded in 2007. Yet the ideal dosage and dosing regimen of tranexamic acid in cardiopulmonary bypass cardiac surgery in Chinese population remains controversial. The current study includes patients receiving valvular replacement and coronary artery bypass surgery. Different dosage of tranexamic acid is delivered and blood loss, transfusions and clinical outcomes are recorded. The study hypothesis is that tranexamic acid could reduce blood loss and allogeneic transfusion in cardiopulmonary bypass cardiac surgery. Furthermore, tranexamic acid could decrease inflammatory reaction in cardiac surgery.</brief_summary>
