	<brief_title>An Efficacy Study of Osmotic Release Oral System (OROS) Methylphenidate in Participants With Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is 12 week, open label (all people involved know the identity of the intervention), prospective (study following participants forward in time), single arm, multicenter study (when more than one hospital or medical school team work on a medical research study) of OROS methylphenidate HCl. The study will consist of 6 visits at Screening, Baseline, Week 1, 3, 6 and 12. The participants already on other ADHD medications in addition to methylphenidate will be required to undergo a washout period (period when receiving no treatment) of at least 1 week. The participants will be on once daily study medication starting at 18 milligram per day (mg/day) in participants with less than 30 kilogram (kg) of body weight or at 27 mg/day in participants with more than 30 kg. The dose will be increased by 9 mg or 18 mg every week for up to Week 6 based on the treatment efficacy and tolerability, followed by a maximum maintenance dose of 72 mg orally once daily up to Week 12, during which the dose can be decreased by 9 mg depending on tolerability. Efficacy will primarily be assessed using Clinical Global Impression of Severity of Illness (CGI-S) scale, Clinical Global Impression of Improvement of Illness (CGI-I) scale, Korean version of ADHD-IV Rating Scale (K-ARS) and Learning Skill Test (LST) score. Participants' safety will be monitored.</detailed_description>
