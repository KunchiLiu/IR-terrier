	<brief_summary>The primary objective was to improve adjuvant 5-FU chemoradiotherapy in resectable rectal cancer. The investigators hypothesis was that modulation of 5-FU by addition of either FA or INF-alpha may increase overall survival.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Primary endpoint was overall survival (OS). For sample size estimation the following assumptions were made: The 5-year OS rate of 5-FU was estimated to be 58%. Our intention was to detect an increase in the 5-year OS rate by one of the additives of at least 10% with a power of 80% and a level of significance of 5% in comparison to 5-FU (one-sided). Hypotheses were analyzed as pair wise comparisons between the treatment options. This resulted in a target sample size of 280 patients per group and a total of 840 patients.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Eligibility was defined as potentially curative enbloc resection (R0) of an adenocarcinoma of the rectum with a lower tumor edge within 12 cm from the anal verge determined by rectoscopy, a pathologic UICC stage II (pT3/4pN0M0) or III (pT14pNposM0) with examination of at least 12 lymph nodes, a white blood count ≥ 3,500/µl, a platelet count ≥ 100,000/µl, a ECOG performance status of 0 or 1, and written informed consent. Ineligible were patients not fulfilling these criteria or having a history of cancer except for adequately treated superficial basal or squamous cell skin cancer or in situ carcinoma of the cervix, getting previous radio or chemotherapy, pregnant or nursing women, other having severe concomitant diseases limiting life expectancy or not allowing chemotherapy, and with social conditions not allowing a 5year followup.</criteria>
