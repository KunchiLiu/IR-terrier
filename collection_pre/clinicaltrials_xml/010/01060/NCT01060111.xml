	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate the adequacy (reasonably good) of topiramate therapy (medicine or medical care given to a participant for a disease or condition) in prevention of migraine (type of severe headache that occurs periodically and is often associated with nausea, vomiting, and constipation or diarrhea) by comparing standard titration (slow increase in drug dosage, guided by patient's responses) therapy to slow titration therapy and slow titration therapy boosted by the concurrent use of propranolol in participants with migraine with or without aura (having to do with the ear) for more than or equal to 2 attacks per month.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Efficacy and Tolerability Study of Topiramate in Participants With Migraine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective (study following participants forward in time), single-blind (Physician does not know the intervention), randomized (study drug assigned by chance) and comparative multi-center (conducted in more than 1 center) study to assess appropriate administration methods with topiramate preventive therapy in participants with migraine. The study consists of 3 periods: Screening period (4 weeks), Treatment period consisting of 2 titration periods (3 weeks each) and Maintenance period (4 weeks). During Screening period, after the diagnosis of participants' headache, symptoms and severity of migraine will be investigated through a headache diary and participants will be selected for treatment period. In the treatment period, the selected participants will be randomly assigned to either of the 3 topiramate therapy: 'topiramate standard group', 'topiramate slow group', and 'topiramate slow plus propranolol (booster) group'. In the 'topiramate standard group' - participants will receive an initial dose of topiramate 25 milligram (mg) once daily and the dose of topiramate will be increased by 25 mg per day at an interval of 1-week up to the target dose of 50 mg to 100 mg up to Week 6; and a maintenance dose of 50 mg to 100 mg will be administered twice daily up to Week 10 as per Physician's discretion. In 'topiramate slow group' - participants will start with an initial dose of 25 mg once daily and the dose will be increased by 25 mg per day at an interval of 2-weeks up to a dose of 50 mg to 100 mg up to Week 6. A maintenance dose of 50 mg to 100 mg will be administered twice daily up to Week 10 as per Physician's discretion. In 'topiramate slow plus propranolol (booster) group' - participants will follow the same dosage regimen as in the 'topiramate slow group' along with concurrent administration of booster dose of propranolol 80 mg once daily (40 mg each time in the morning and in the evening) for 6 weeks. The participants will primarily be evaluated for reduction in migraine frequency between Week 7 and 10 using a headache diary questionnaire maintained by them. Participants' quality of life will be assessed using Migraine Disability Assessment (MIDAS) score and intensity of pain in migraine will be assessed using Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.</detailed_description>
