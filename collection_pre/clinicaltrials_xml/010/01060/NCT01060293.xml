	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to compare the effects of 1) high-dose furosemide, 2) low-dose furosemide, and 3) low-dose furosemide combined with low-dose dopamine on diuresis, clinical status, renal function, electrolyte balance, length of stay, and 60-day post-discharge outcomes in patients hospitalized with acute decompensated heart failure.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The aim of this study is to compare the effects of: 1. high-dose furosemide (HDF, 40 mg furosemide bolus IV, followed by continuous IV infusion of 20 mg/h for a total of 8 hours), 2. low-dose furosemide (LDF, 40 mg furosemide bolus IV, followed by continuous IV infusion of 5 mg/h furosemide for a total of 8 hours), and 3. low-dose furosemide combined with low-dose dopamine (LDFD, 40 mg furosemide bolus IV, followed by continuous IV infusion of 5 mg/h furosemide plus 5μg/kg/min dopamine for a total of 8 hours) on diuresis, perceived dyspnea, renal function, electrolyte balance, total length of stay, and 60-day post-discharge outcomes in patients hospitalized with ADHF.</detailed_description>
