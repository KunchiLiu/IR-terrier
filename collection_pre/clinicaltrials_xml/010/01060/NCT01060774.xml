	<brief_summary>This study is testing a local anesthetic (numbing medicine) to suppress pain. Bupivacaine and lidocaine are FDA approved local anesthetics that may decrease pain following surgery. Patients will receive either 2% lidocaine, 0.5% bupivacaine, or placebo with epinephrine 1:200,000 as a numbing medicine at the end of root canal surgery. Small pieces of gum will be taken before and after surgery and 2 days later to analyze chemicals that may be related to pain sensation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bupivacaine Versus Lidocaine on Inflammatory Regulation Following Endodontic Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We hypothesize that the use of the LLA bupivacaine will promote local inflammation leading to increased pain and central sensitization as evaluated by increase in pain at later time points. Hence our main hypothesis to be evaluated and statistically tested for our primary endpoint (Aim 1) is: HO: There is no difference in mean levels of biochemical mediators of inflammation between groups. HA: The bupivacaine group has higher levels of biochemical mediators following surgery.</detailed_description>
