	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Stereotactic body radiation therapy may be able to send x-rays directly to the tumor and cause less damage to normal tissue. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine hydrochloride, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving stereotactic body radiation therapy together with gemcitabine hydrochloride may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects of stereotactic body radiation therapy when given with or without gemcitabine hydrochloride in treating patients with pancreatic cancer that can be removed by surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy With or Without Gemcitabine Hydrochloride in Treating Patients With Pancreatic Cancer That Can Be Removed By Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - To demonstrate the feasibility and safety of administering margin-intensive stereotactic body radiotherapy together with preoperative gemcitabine hydrochloride to patients with resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of gemcitabine hydrochloride. Patients receive 1 of 2 treatment regimens. - Regimen 1: Patients undergo a single fraction of margin-intensive stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) on day 1. Patients undergo pancreatoduodenectomy between days 15-43. - Regimen 2: Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Patients undergo a single fraction of SBRT between days 21-28 followed by pancreatoduodenectomy between days 35-63. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 5 years.</detailed_description>
