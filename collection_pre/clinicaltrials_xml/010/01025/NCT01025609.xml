	<brief_summary>This study will look at dietary patterns in individuals with chronic spinal cord injuries and the relationship between these dietary patterns and cardiovascular disease risk factors. The study is a supplement to the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study. The dietary history from CARDIA will be used. The investigators' primary hypothesis is the following: Greater whole-grain and dietary fiber intake will be favorably associated with adiposity (BMI and WC) and metabolic CVD risk factors (fasting glucose, fasting insulin, HOMA-IR, diabetes, hsCRP, TC, HDL-C, triglycerides, TC/HDL-C ratio, non-HDL-C, and systolic and diastolic blood-pressure) among a sample of individuals with SCI aged 38-50 who have been injured &gt;1 year.</brief_summary>
