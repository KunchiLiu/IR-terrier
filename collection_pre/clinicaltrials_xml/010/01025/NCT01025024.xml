	<brief_summary>A single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis of DNA obtained from peripheral blood of the glaucoma patients and the normal control will be performed to find genetic marker for primary open angle glaucoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Investigation of Genetic Disease Marker Associated With Korean Glaucoma Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Unrelated Korean subjects who have primary open angle glaucoma were recruited in the current study. Genotyping for various SNP associated with POAG due to the linkage disequilibrium patterns is to be performed. Genotypes would be statistically compared between patients with primary open angle glaucoma and normal control subjects free of any eye diseases.</detailed_description>
