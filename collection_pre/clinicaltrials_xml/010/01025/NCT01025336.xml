	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the levels of antibodies 1 year after receiving the second vaccine dose in two groups of adults over the age of 60: (1) those who have previously received 2 doses of 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (13vPnC) and (2) those who have previously received 1 dose of 13vPnc and 1 dose of 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (23vPS). This study will also assess whether the use of the 2 vaccines, 13vPnC and 23vPS, administered in different sequential order results in different prolonged antibody levels. This study is limited to individuals who participated in either study 6115A1-3010 (NCT00574548) or 6115A1-3005 (NCT00546572).</brief_summary>
