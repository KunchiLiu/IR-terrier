	<brief_summary>Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer and second leading cause of cancer deaths in western countries. Colonoscopy is a preferred colorectal screening modality since it has both diagnostic and therapeutic capability. Detection and removal of polyps at colonoscopy decreases the incidence and mortality from colorectal cancer. Typical practice is to insert the colonoscope rapidly until it reaches the cecum (a pouch-like portion of the intestines, where the large bowel and the small bowel meet). The physician then withdraws the colonoscope slowly and looks for any polyps or abnormalities within the large bowel. The purpose of this study is to compare this standard practice to the approach whereby the physician examines the bowel as the scope is initially inserted AND as the colonoscope is withdrawn from patients' colons.</brief_summary>
