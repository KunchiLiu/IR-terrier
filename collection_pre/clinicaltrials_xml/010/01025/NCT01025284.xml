	<mesh_term>Lung Neoplasms</mesh_term>
	<mesh_term>Small Cell Lung Carcinoma</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Have histological or cytological evidence of extensivedisease smallcell lung cancer Have the presence of measurable disease as defined by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1) Have received at least 1 prior chemotherapy regimen with agents known to provide clinical benefit for smallcell lung cancer and be, in the opinion of the investigator, an appropriate candidate for experimental therapy Have discontinued all previous therapies for cancer, including chemotherapy, biologic therapy, hormone therapy, or radiotherapy. Patients must have recovered from the acute effects of therapy (except alopecia and fatigue) before study enrollment Part A: Have a performance status of 0 to 2 on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group scale Part B: Have a performance status of 0 to 1 on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group scale Have received treatment within 28 days of the first dose of LY2523355 with a drug that has not received regulatory approval for any indication Have a mixed histological diagnosis of smallcell lung cancer and nonsmallcell lung cancer Have serious preexisting medical conditions that, in the opinion of the investigator, would preclude participation in this study Part A: Have symptomatic, untreated, or uncontrolled central nervous system (CNS) metastases. Patients with treated CNS metastases are eligible provided their disease is radiographically stable, asymptomatic, and corticosteroid use has been discontinued for at least 2 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug. Screening of asymptomatic patients without history of CNS metastases is not required Part B: Have symptomatic, untreated, or uncontrolled central nervous system (CNS) metastases or a history of CNS metastases. Patients who have received prophylactic radiation are not excluded. Screening of asymptomatic patients without history of CNS metastases is not required</criteria>
