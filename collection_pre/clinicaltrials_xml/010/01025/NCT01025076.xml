	<brief_summary>Executive Summary Aims and Hypotheses of the Study: The aim of the study will be to evaluate the safety, effectiveness and early outcome of the StomaphyX procedure for reducing the enlarged gastric pouch and stoma in post-bariatric patients. The study will test a hypothesis that the StomaphyX procedure will be effective in promoting the loss of regained weight, reducing the risk for comorbidities and improving patients' quality of life. Type of Study: Prospective non-randomized Study Duration: 12 months Number of Patients: 20 Inclusion Criteria: 18-70 years of age, BMI ≥ 35, ≥ 2 years after primary Roux-en-Y gastric bypass with evidence of enlarged gastric pouch volume or enlarged stoma diameter of ≥ 20 mm via endoscopy or fluoroscopy. Pts also demonstrate a weight regain of 15% of excess body weight loss. Exclusion Criteria: Esophageal stricture, or any anatomic conditions that preclude passage of transoral endoluminal instruments, has another causal factor for weight regain other than stoma or pouch dilatation, portal hypertension, coagulation disorders or chronic use of anticoagulants, any active medical condition that would preclude the patient from completing the study or would result in an unreasonable risk to the patient. Intervention Treatment: Creation of multiple full-thickness plications within the gastric pouch using the StomaphyX device (EndoGastric Solutions, Inc., Redmond, WA, USA) Evaluation Criteria Primary Outcome: Change in body weight at 6 and 12 months Secondary Outcome: Gastric pouch volume assessment, stoma diameter determination, quality of life scores, waist circumference, co-morbidity resolution Effectiveness and Safety Assessment Clinical: Weight, height, waist circumference quality of life questionnaires (Impact of Weight QOL-Lite, Eating and Weight Patterns, Three-factor Eating, Emotional Eating Scale, GI QoL, GSRS and/or PGWB) Anatomical: Upper GI endoscopy, computed tomography or barium radiography Biochemical: Blood and urine tests (glucose, cholesterol, triglyceride, HDL, LDL, uric acid) Safety: Adverse events, complications, co-morbidities, hospital stay</brief_summary>
