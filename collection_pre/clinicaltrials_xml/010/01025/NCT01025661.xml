	<brief_title>Effects of Chiropractic Care in Patients With Hip Osteoarthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Research over the last years have reported a scarce of trails investigating chiropractic treatment of lower extremities. Osteoarthritis, also called joint failure, is a common rheumatic joint disease often affecting the hipjoint, contributing to pain, decreased mobility and loss of function. Individuals with osteoarthritis can also be affected in many other ways, e.g. economically, socially and emotionally. Chiropractic care may be considered as a complement to the conventional allopathic treatment of hip osteoarthritis. Joint manipulation is a well-established treatment technique to restore optimal joint function of the locomotor system. The aim of the study is to explore the effects of chiropractic vs. continued conventional care (waiting list controls) on pain and function during a three week trail period among patients with hip osteoarthritis waiting for arthroplasty.</detailed_description>
