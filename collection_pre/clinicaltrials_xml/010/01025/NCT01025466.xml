	<brief_summary>The primary objective is to compare the tolerability between rivastigmine patch monotherapy and combination therapy with memantine in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). The secondary objective is to compare the efficacy and safety between rivastigmine patch monotherapy and combination therapy with memantine in patients with AD. The study hypothesis is that the tolerability of the combination therapy with memantine is not inferior to that of rivastigmine patch monotherapy in AD patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Exelon Patch and Combination With Memantine Comparative Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recently, the rivastigmine patch demonstrated efficacy comparable to the highest doses of rivastigmine capsules, with markedly improved tolerability profile. We hypothesized that combination of memantine and rivastigmine patch will be safe and well tolerated and result in more clinical benefit in patients with AD in comparison with rivastigmine patch monotherapy, for the mechanisms of the drugs are different.</detailed_description>
