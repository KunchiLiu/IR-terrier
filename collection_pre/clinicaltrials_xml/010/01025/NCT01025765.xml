	<brief_summary>Pegylated interferon in combination with ribavirin is the current standard treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus infection, but is expensive and has several adverse effects. To modify this standard treatment by optimizing its therapeutic effect and decreasing its adverse events are important. Recent studies have identified a close link between metabolic profiles, insulin resistance and Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection. Several pilot studies in western world have have found beneficial effects of oral hypoglycemic agents on chronic Hepatitis C (CHC) genotype 1 infected patients. Whether this concept still holds true in Taiwanese people remains unknown. The objective of this clinical trial is to evaluate the effect of oral hypoglycemic agents (daily for 4 weeks of run-in period and 8 weeks of combination treatment) on CHC genotype 1 infected Taiwanese patients receiving 48 weeks of Peg-IFN plus ribavirin (RBA), and the enrolled subjects will be randomized into 4 treatment groups (including Acarbose, Metformin, Pioglitazone and standard care control groups). During the trial and 24 weeks after the end of treatment, serial serum HCV RNA, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels, and other clinical data will be evaluated to determine the therapeutic response and adverse events of the CHC patients.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Pegylated interferon in combination with ribavirin is the current standard treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus infection, but is expensive and has several adverse effects. To modify this standard treatment by optimizing its therapeutic effect and decreasing its adverse events are important. Recent studies have identified a close link between metabolic profiles, insulin resistance and HCV infection. Chronic hepatitis C (CHC) patients with higher pretreatment HOMA-IR (insulin resistance) index have poor therapeutic response than the ones with lower HOMA-IR index. Thus, it is reasonable to increase the therapeutic response of CHC patients by lowering insulin resistance. Several pilot studies in western world have been conducted to evaluate this concept by adding oral hypoglycemic agents into pegylated interferon plus ribavirin treatment, and have found beneficial effects of oral hypoglycemic agents on CHC genotype 1 infected patients. Whether this concept still holds true in Taiwanese people remains unknown. To evaluate the effect of oral hypoglycemic agents on CHC genotype 1 infected Taiwanese patients, we design this study and evaluate the virologic, biochemical and histological responses of CHC patients receiving pegylated interferon plus ribavirin treatment, and hope to identify similar beneficial effects of oral hypoglycemic agents in CHC Taiwanese patients. We plan to enroll about 80 chronic hepatitis C genotype 1 infected patients from the clinics into this study. All patients should have informed consent, not receive any interferon-based therapy or anti-viral medication, abstinence from alcohol beverage for more than 6 months and conformed to the regulations of Bureau of National Health Insurance, Taiwan. All patients will be randomly assigned into 4 different treatment arms. The patients assigned into the first 3 arms will receive one kind of the following oral hypoglycemic agents, such as Acarbose, Metformin, or Pioglitazone for 12 weeks (including 4 weeks of run-in period and 8 weeks of combination treatment with pegylated interferon alfa plus ribavirin). From week 13, all the patients of the first 3 arms will receive pegylated interferon alfa plus ribavirin for 40 weeks. The last arm is the control group; all the patients in the last arm will receive standard pegylated interferon alfa plus ribavirin treatment for 48 weeks. During the trial and 24 weeks after the end of treatment, the serum HCV RNA levels, clinical and biochemical data will be evaluated to determine the therapeutic response and adverse events of the patients.</detailed_description>
