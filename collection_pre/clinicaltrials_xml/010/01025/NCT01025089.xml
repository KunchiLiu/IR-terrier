	<brief_summary>The main purpose of this study is to find out the good and the bad effects that the combination of cetuximab with the traditional chemotherapy regimen of cisplatin, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide has when given to patients with later stage thymoma or thymic carcinoma before surgery. The physicians will also look at changes in genes in the tumor that may relate to the effectiveness of cetuximab</brief_summary>
