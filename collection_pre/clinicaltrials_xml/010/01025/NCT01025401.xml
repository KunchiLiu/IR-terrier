	<brief_summary>CAPAMETRIM 2 aims to characterize epileptic motor patterns by a quantitative three-dimensional analysis of movements. This is done to obtain a 3-D motor signature of seizures, for a given patient, and allows their detection with an ambulatory monitoring system. The benefit for patients is to improve the diagnosis of their diseases by better characterizing their seizures.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Characterization of Epileptic Motor Patterns by Tridimensional Analysis of Movement 2</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CAPAMETRIM 2 aims to characterize epileptic motor patterns by a quantitative three-dimensional analysis of movements. The project is planned in three phases: - Installation of 3-D accelerometric and magnetic sensors acquisition systems on the hospital (extension of a preceding study CAPAMETRIM). - Collection of data on epileptic patients. Sensors will be positioned on the right and left hands and on the head. A 3-D analysis of movements will be done according to the collection by tagging data with visual analysis made on video. - Development of a motor pattern classification system used for seizure detection.</detailed_description>
