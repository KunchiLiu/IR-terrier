	<brief_summary>The purpose of this protocol is to study the effects of fluid milk products on satiety, food intake, and glucose metabolism in healthy young men and women. Experiment 1: The specific objective is to investigate isovolumetric amounts of milk (2% M.F.), chocolate milk (1% M.F.), a soy beverage, cow's milk-based infant formula, and water (control) on satiety and food intake and on blood glucose before and after a meal. A fixed volume approach is based on the commercially available serving size. Experiment 2 will examine equicaloric amounts of milk (2% M.F.), chocolate milk (1% M.F.), a soy beverage, cow's milk-based infant formula, a glucose drink and water (control) the treatments in order to investigate macronutrient composition on satiety and food intake and on blood glucose before and after the meal.</brief_summary>
