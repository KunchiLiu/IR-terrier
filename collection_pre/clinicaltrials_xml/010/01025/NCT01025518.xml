	<brief_title>DAHANCA 25A: Resistance Training and Dietary Supplements as Intervention for Regaining Muscle Mass Following Radiotherapy in Head and Neck Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Head and neck cancer patients experience a significant loss of muscle mass following radiotherapy treatment due to cachexia and dysphagia. This negatively affects muscle strength and functional capacity. Studies on healthy individuals and various groups of patients show that resistance training in combination with protein and creatine ingestion is an effective means of increasing muscle mass, strength and functional capacity. Thus the aim is to investigate the following: - is resistance training and dietary supplements tolerable among head and neck cancer patients - the effect of the intervention on muscle mass, strength and functional capacity</detailed_description>
