	<brief_title>Effects of Inulin on Satiety and Food Intake</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Based upon a slower digestion and the fermentation in the intestinal tract, food containing soluble dietary fibres, such as inulin, is hypothesized to be more satiating, and to limit energy intake, in humans. Does supplementation of inulin (at 2 dosages) versus placebo over 13 consecutive days in normal to overweight men and women, lead to an increase in satiety, a reduction in food intake and stronger postprandial increases in GLP-1 and PYY?</detailed_description>
