	<brief_summary>The main objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the Armstrong's Epinephrine HFA-MDI (E004) formulation, in comparison to the Placebo (Placebo-HFA) and an Active Control (Epinephrine CFC-MDI), and to identify the optimum E004 dose strength(s) for the ensuing pivotal clinical trials. The study will be conducted in adult patients who have intermittent, or mild-to-moderate persistent, asthma, but are otherwise healthy. The bronchodilatory efficacy of E004, is evaluated in terms of post-dose area under the curves (AUC) of FEV1 changes (% and volumes), from the pre-dose baseline values, in comparison to the Placebo Control and the Active Control.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Clinical diagnosis of intermittent, or mildtomoderate persistent, asthma for at least 6 months before Screening, and having used inhaled epinephrine or Î²agonist(s) for asthma control; 2. Demonstrating a baseline forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) at 5090 percent of predicted normal at Screening; 3. Demonstrating a 12.0 percent or greater airway reversibility in FEV1 within 30 min after inhaling 2 actuations of Epinephrine CFCMDI (440 mcg Epinephrine base) at Screening; 4. Females of childbearing potential must be nonpregnant, nonlactating, and practicing a clinically acceptable form of birth control; 5. Demonstration of proficiency in the use of a MDI inhaler after training; 6. Having properly consented to participate in the trial. 1. A smoking history of 10 or more packyears, or having smoked within 6 months prior to Screening; 2. Upper respiratory tract infections within 2 wk, or lower respiratory tract infection within 4 wk, prior to Screening; 3. Asthma exacerbations that required emergency care or hospitalized treatment, within 4 wk prior to Screening; 4. Any current or recent respiratory conditions that, per investigator discretion, might significantly affect pharmacodynamic response to the study drugs, including cystic fibrosis, bronchiectasis, tuberculosis, emphysema, and other significant respiratory diseases besides asthma; 5. Concurrent clinically significant cardiovascular, hematological, renal, neurologic, hepatic, endocrine (including diabetes), psychiatric, neoplastic or other illnesses that in the opinion of the investigator could impact on the conduct, safety and evaluation of the study; 6. Known intolerance or hypersensitivity to any of the study MDI ingredients (i.e., Epinephrine, HFA134a, CFC12, CFC114, polysorbate80, ethanol, thymol, nitric acid and ascorbic acid); 7. Use of prohibited drugs or failure to observe the drug washout restrictions; 8. Having been on other investigational drug/device studies in the last 30 days prior to Screening.</criteria>
