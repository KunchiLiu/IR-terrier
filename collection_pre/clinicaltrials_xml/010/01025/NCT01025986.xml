	<brief_title>Uveitis in Relation to Perceived Stress: A Prospective Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients presenting at The New York Eye and Ear Infirmary (NYEEI) who meet the inclusion criteria will be recruited prospectively. Patients diagnosed with non-infectious uveitis will be asked to self-administer the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) - 10, following informed consent. Patient demographics will also be collected. The presence of inflammation will be then be assessed by the investigator. Patients will be asked to complete the PSS-10 again at all subsequent standard-of-care visits within a 6-month timeframe. PSS-10 scores are obtained by reversing the scores on the four positive items (4, 5, 7 and 8), then summing across all 10 items. Patient and the investigator will be masked to the PSS scores.</detailed_description>
