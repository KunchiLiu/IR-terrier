	<brief_summary>The need for oral antibiotics as part of the case management of severe acute malnutrition (SAM) in the outpatient setting has not been studied in a prospective trial. This study will compare the recovery rates of children with SAM treated at home with locally-produced ready-to-use therapeutic food (RUTF) with and without prescribed antibiotics as part of their outpatient case management. The investigators hypothesize that there will be no significant difference in rates of recovery between children who receive and children who do not receive antibiotics.</brief_summary>
