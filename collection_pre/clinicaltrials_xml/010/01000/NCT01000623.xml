It is not yet known whether giving venlafaxine together with hypnosis or focused attention is more effective in treating hot flashes. Purpose: This randomized clinical trial is studying venlafaxine together with hypnosis or focused attention in treating patients with hot flashes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Venlafaxine and Hypnosis or Focused Attention In Treating Patients With Hot Flashes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objectives: I. To evaluate the effect of hypnosis plus venlafaxine versus focused attention with venlafaxine versus hypnosis plus a placebo versus focused attention plus a placebo for reducing hot flashes. II. To evaluate the side effects associated with hypnosis with venlafaxine versus focused attention with venlafaxine versus hypnosis plus a placebo versus focused attention plus a placebo for reducing hot flashes. III. To evaluate the effects of the four treatment arms on mood, sleep, hot flash interference and menopause quality of life. IV. To explore the role of expectancy and hypnotizability as moderators of the effect of each of the four treatment arms in reducing hot flashes. Outline: Patients are randomized to 1 of 4 intervention arms. Patients receive oral venlafaxine or a placebo and practice hypnosis or focused attention.</detailed_description>
