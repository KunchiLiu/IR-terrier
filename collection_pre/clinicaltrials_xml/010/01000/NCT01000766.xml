	<brief_title>Identifying Changes in Blood (Potential Biomarkers) in Individuals With Drug-Induced Liver Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Our hypothesis is that there are liver-specific particles, called mRNA, that are identifiable in a person's blood sample during liver injury caused by some drugs. The purpose of this study is to try to develop new blood tests that may help doctors identify if a drug is hurting a person's liver, perhaps early in the process before significant injury or illness have occurred.</detailed_description>
