Diabetes medical group visits will be held at the Grady North DeKalb satellite clinic the third Thursday of the month starting in October 2009. There will be two cohorts of patients- English speaking patients and Spanish speaking patients. Each group will be scheduled for 4 2-hour group visits throughout a period of 9 months. These visits will be every 8 weeks for each group. During the visit, the patient will be seen by a physician, attend a diabetes education session, re-fill their diabetes medications and receive lab orders.</brief_summary>
