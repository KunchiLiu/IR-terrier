	<brief_summary>Randomized study on the comparison between aerobic training versus progressive resistance training over a 2 months period for older adults with type 2 diabetes. The hypothesis is that progressive resistance training is just as effective as aerobic training on Hba1c and could be an alternative training for those older diabetic patients who cannot participate in aerobic exercise.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Many studies have shown the importance of aerobic training with respect to management of diabetes. However adoption of aerobic activities may be challenging for some individuals with diabetes, especially the elderly and the obese. There is increasing interest in resistance training and no study have looked at direct comparison between the two. Subjects with diabetes but is generally sedentary (determined by means of a questionnaire) were recruited and randomized in one of the two groups. Subjects are supervised in a group and a completer is defined as one who completed 18 sessions within 8 weeks.</detailed_description>
