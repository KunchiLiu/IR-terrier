	<brief_title>Respiratory Tract Inflammation in Children With Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's disease (CD) and Ulcerative colitis (UC) are chronic inflammatory diseases with remissions and exacerbations. CD and UC are associated with a variety of systemic (extra-intestinal) manifestations. In some studies, clinical and subclinical pulmonary abnormalities are described in active IBD as well as in the stable situation. Nitric oxide (NO) is an important mediator of inflammation in several pathological conditions.Patients with lung diseases, like asthma, have higher levels of the Fraction of exhaled Nitric Oxide (FeNO) in active disease in comparison with healthy volunteers. One study in adult IBD patients showed increase in FeNO levels in those patients, with positive correlation with the disease activity and negative correlation between the disease activity and pulmonary functions. We hypothesised that respiratory tract inflammation as expressed by FeNO and spirometry in pediatric IBD patients will correlate to the activity of the primary disease. Methods: FeNO levels and spirometry will be assess for 40 patients with CD or UC (age 4-18 years) during remissions and exacerbations, calculated by the Pediatrics Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI) and the Pediatrics Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index (PUCAI), respectively. Two aged matched groups, the first of healthy children and the second of chronic abdominal pain will serve a controls.</detailed_description>
