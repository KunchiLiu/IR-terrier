	<brief_summary>Anesthesia may affect the function of vital organs. Liver is one of them. The investigator's hypothesis is that intravenous or inhalation anesthesia does not impair liver function as assessed by more elegant tests like markers indicating liver apoptosis. In the present randomized prospective trial female patients scheduled for mastectomy or thyroidectomy will receive inhalation or total intravenous anesthesia and markers for liver dysfunction will be determined.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Markers of Liver Apoptosis After Anesthesia With Sevoflurane or Propofol</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Female patients undergoing mastectomy or thyroidectomy under sevoflurane or propofol anesthesia will be recruited for the study. The type of anesthesia will be determined in a random way using a computer generated table. All patients will be preoxygenated for 3 minutes before induction of anesthesia. Patients assigned to the sevoflurane group will receive an inhalation induction with sevoflurane via a primed anesthetic circle system and anesthesia will be maintained with sevoflurane. In the propofol group patients anaesthesia will be induced and maintained with propofol. Blood samples for liver apoptotic markers will be collected before induction of anesthesia, after skin closure as well as 24 and 48 hours postoperatively. Blood samples will be centrifuged, stored at -80 degrees Celsius and analyzed for M30 and M60 values with radioimmunoassay technique. Serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) and serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) levels will also be determined.</detailed_description>
