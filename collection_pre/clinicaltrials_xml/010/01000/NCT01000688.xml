	<brief_summary>Rationale: Cardiovascular complications in type 2 diabetes are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality associated with the disease. Endothelial dysfunction is regarded as an important factor in these vascular complications. The introduction of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogues and dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) inhibitors for the treatment of type 2 diabetes is of special interest because of possible influences on endothelial function. Numerous reports have shown that GLP-1 improves endothelial function. Objective: To determine whether a four week treatment with vildagliptin compared to acarbose improves endothelial dysfunction in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.</brief_summary>
