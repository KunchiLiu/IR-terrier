	<brief_summary>The build up of plaque in the wall of the artery supplying blood to the brain poses a risk of stroke when the plaques become unstable and fragile. It is important to determine which patients are most at risk so that surgery can be performed. There is evidence that the risk is greatest when these plaques become oxygen deficient (hypoxic). The investigators wish to use PET imaging to identify hypoxic plaque, to help decide whether and when to perform surgery. The investigators have developed radiotracers (imaging agents) for this purpose, and this study is to determine whether they will work in patients.</brief_summary>
