	<brief_summary>Approximately 30% of patients with rheumatoid arthritis have an inadequate response to anti-TNF (primarily or loss of response), leaving two alternatives: rotation to a second anti-TNF or change of biologic, with a different mechanism of action, such as abatacept, rituximab and tocilizumab. No controlled trial compared these two strategies face to face. The present objective is to investigate the issue whether one of these strategies could have a better efficacy in a pragmatic trial in the setting of current practice.</brief_summary>
