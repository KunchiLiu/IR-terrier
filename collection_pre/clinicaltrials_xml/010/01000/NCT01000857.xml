	<detailed_description>This study is an open, randomized, repeat dose, two-period crossover design in Japanese healthy male volunteers. This clinical trial is designed primarily to compare the steady-state pharmacokinetic profile of paroxetine CR at the dosage of 25mg /day (25mg once daily for 14 days) using the proposed final market tablet of CR 25mg in Japan with that of paroxetine IR at the dosage of 20mg/day (20mg once daily for 14 days) using the currently marketed IR 20mg tablet in Japan, by the crossover oral repeat dosing manner.</detailed_description>
