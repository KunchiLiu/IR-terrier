	<criteria>Subjects for whom the investigator believes that their parent(s)/Legally Acceptable Representative(s) (LAR[s]) can and will comply with the requirements of the protocol (e.g., completion of the diary card, return for followup visits). A male or female between, and including, 6 and 12 weeks of age at the time of the first vaccination. Written informed consent obtained from the subject's parent/LAR. Healthy subjects as established by medical history and clinical examination before entering into the study. Born after a gestation period of minimum 36 weeks. Infants who have not received a previous dose of hepatitis B vaccine or those who have received only 1 dose of hepatitis B vaccine administered at least 30 days prior to enrollment. Use of any investigational or nonregistered product (drug or vaccine) other than the study vaccine(s) within 30 days preceding the first dose of study vaccine, or planned use during the study period. Chronic administration (defined as more than 14 days) of immunosuppressants or other immunemodifying drugs since birth. Planned administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol within 30 days of the first dose of study vaccine and until 30 days after the booster dose. Previous vaccination against Haemophilus influenzae type b, diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, Pneumococcus, rotavirus and/or poliovirus; more than one previous dose of hepatitis B vaccine. History of Haemophilus influenzae type b, diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, pneumococcal, rotavirus, poliovirus, and hepatitis B diseases.

History of allergic disease or reactions likely to be exacerbated by any component of the vaccines, including dry natural latex rubber. Major congenital defects or serious chronic illness. History of any neurologic disorders or seizures. Acute disease at time of enrollment. All vaccines can be administered to persons with a minor illness. Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products since birth or planned administration during the study period.
