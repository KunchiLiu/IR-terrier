	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the persistence of the immune response to HAV (Hepatitis A Virus) antigens and HBs (Hepatitis B surface) antigens in healthy adults previously vaccinated with GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Biologicals' Twinrix™ Adult. The subjects will be invited for blood sampling 16, 17, 18, 19 and 20 years after vaccination to evaluate the antibody persistence. For subjects in whom low circulating antibodies are detected, the presence of immune memory against hepatitis A &amp; B antigens will be investigated by the administration of a challenge dose of the appropriate vaccine (Havrix™ and/or Engerix™-B) at the next planned visit. No new subjects will be recruited during this study.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>All subjects must satisfy the following criteria at entry into each of the longterm followup visits: Subjects who the investigator believes that they can and will comply with the requirements of the protocol should be enrolled in the study. A male or female who received the complete primary vaccination course in the primary study Hepatitis A and B vaccine (HAB), HAB028 (208127/021). Written informed consent obtained from the subject. All subjects must satisfy the following criteria at entry into the challenge dose phase: Subjects who the investigator believes that they can and will comply with the requirements of the protocol. A male or female who received the complete primary vaccination course in the primary study HAB028 (208127/021). Written informed consent obtained from the subject. Subjects who participated in the longterm followup (LTFU) phase of the HAB028 (208127/021) study and for whom the antibody concentrations were below the cutoff at the last available followup timepoint. Female subjects of nonchildbearing potential may be enrolled in the study. Female subjects of childbearing potential may be enrolled in the study, if the subject: has practiced adequate contraception for 30 days prior to vaccination, and has a negative pregnancy test on the day of vaccination, and has agreed to continue adequate contraception for two months after the administration of the challenge dose. The following criteria should be checked before entry into each of the longterm followup visits. If any exclusion criterion applies, the subject must not be included in the study: Use of any investigational or nonregistered product within 30 days prior to blood sampling. Administration of a hepatitis A, hepatitis B or combined hepatitis A and B vaccine outside the study procedures, since the primary study HAB028 (208127/021). History of hepatitis A or hepatitis B infection since the primary study HAB028 (208127/021). Administration of hepatitis A or hepatitis B immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within three months prior to blood sampling. The following criteria should be checked before the challenge dose is administered. If any apply, the subject must not be included in the challenge dose phase: Use of any investigational or nonregistered product within 30 days prior to study start or planned use during the study. Administration of a hepatitis A, hepatitis B or combined hepatitis A and B vaccine between the last LTFU visit and the challenge dose visit. History of hepatitis A or hepatitis B infection between the last LTFU visit and the challenge dose visit. History of anaphylactic reactions following the administration of vaccines. History of any reaction or hypersensitivity likely to be exacerbated by any component of the vaccines. Acute disease and/or fever at the time of enrolment. Pregnant or lactating female. Female planning to become pregnant or planning to discontinue contraceptive precautions.</criteria>
