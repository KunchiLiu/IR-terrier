	<brief_summary>This study assessed the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and antiviral activity of multiple oral doses of ABT-450/ritonavir (r), ABT-333 (also known as dasabuvir), or ABT-072 in hepatitis C virus (HCV), genotype 1-infected, treatment-naïve adults.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Randomized Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability and Antiviral Activity of ABT-450, ABT-333 and ABT-072</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This was a Phase 2a, randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study in chronically, hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1-infected participants designed to explore the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, antiviral activity, as well as the evolution and persistence to resistance of ABT-450/r, ABT-333, or ABT-072. Participants were treated with ABT-450/r, ABT-333, or ABT-072 monotherapy for 3 days, followed by 81 days (12 weeks minus 3 days of monotherapy) of ABT-450/r, ABT-333, or ABT-072 combined with pegylated interferon/ribavirin (pegIFN/RBV), followed by 36 weeks of pegIFN/RBV alone. Participants randomized to an ABT-450/r treatment group who achieved rapid virologic response (RVR) and had HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA) levels &lt; 25 IU/mL at all subsequent visits were eligible to stop pegIFN/RBV therapy on or after Week 24.</detailed_description>
