	<brief_title>Acupressure in Pruritus for Atopic Dermatitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Atopic dermatitis (AD) is recognized as a major and common problem worldwide. In the United States, AD and related eczematous symptoms affect 17% of the population; 1 in 10 individuals report having experienced symptoms causing quality of life (QOL) distress, including itching/scratching, red/inflamed rash, excessive dryness/scaling, and/or symptoms lasting â‰¥ 14 days. Two-thirds of these subjects noted at least moderate to severe symptoms, with itch being the most disturbing. Effective treatment of AD and of pruritus (itching) are interconnected. Treating AD will decrease the stimulus for the itch, whereas treating pruritus will decrease the feedback cycle brought on when a patient scratches the skin continually. Effective medications for AD and related symptoms include topical corticosteroids and calcineurin inhibitors. Oftentimes, these remedies are insufficient at treating the itch component of the disease. There is demand for alternative, complementary treatments for AD-related pruritus.</detailed_description>
