	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is the comparison of two different leads in their capabilities to detect episodes and duration of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) and atrial tachyarrhythmia (AT), and the rejection of far field sensing of the far field R-wave (FFRW).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Optimal Sensing in Atrial Tachyarrhythmia's Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of the study is the comparison of two different leads in their capabilities to detect episodes and duration of paroxysmal AF and AT and the rejection of far field sensing of the far field R-wave (FFRW). The study aims to evaluate the accuracy of the detection of atrial tachyarrhythmias (ATAs). An improved detection can potentially increase the accuracy of clinical treatment decisions, based on device derived data.</detailed_description>
