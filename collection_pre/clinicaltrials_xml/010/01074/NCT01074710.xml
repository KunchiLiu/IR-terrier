	<brief_title>Safety and Pharmacokinetic Study of C13-URA in Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The C13-URA Breath Test Kit is intended to be used as a diagnostic tool to identify rapid and/or delayed gastric emptying in patients who have upper GI symptoms such as stomach pain, fullness, early satiety, vomiting, etc., and who have suspected gastric emptying abnormalities such as gastroparesis or dumping syndrome. This study will be a double-blind, placebo-controlled, 3-period safety and PK study of 13C-uracil administered as a single oral dose of 50 mg at step 1 (Period 1), 100 mg at step 2 (Period 2), and 200 mg at step 3 (Period 3) in the form of a semi-solid meal to subjects following at least a 10-hour fast from food and 2-hour fast from water. Dosing will be followed by a 6-hour fast from food and a 4-hour fast from water. There will be a washout of at least 7 days between doses. The objectives of this study are as follows; 1)to evaluate the safety of 13C-uracil in a semi-solid meal in healthy volunteers, 2)to establish the pharmacokinetic profile of 13C-uracil in a semi-solid meal in healthy volunteers, 3)to assess the correlation between plasma concentration of 13C-uracil and urinary excretion of 13C-uracil, 4)to evaluate the reproducibility (intra/inter-individual variance) of the breath test, 5)to determine the dose for 13C-uracil that facilitates adequate Î”13C in breath expired by healthy volunteers</detailed_description>
