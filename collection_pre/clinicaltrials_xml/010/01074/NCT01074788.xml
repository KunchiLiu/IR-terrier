	<brief_summary>The main goal of geriatric rehabilitation following an acute illness is rapid restoration of normal activity. The key elements are pain control, restoration of bowel functions, good sleep quality, appetite and general well-being, as well as return to pre illness physical capabilities. Emphasis has recently been placed on finding innovative multi-disciplinary methods that can improve the care of elderly people who had suffered an acute illness. The aim of this prospective study is to assess the effect of mind-body therapy(including guided imagery, relaxation techniques, mediation and touch therapy) as as an adjunct to medical and physical rehabilitation in geriatric patients.</brief_summary>
