	<brief_summary>We, the investigators, aim to study, in vitro and in vivo, the bioavailability of added b-cryptoxanthin and phytosterols and evaluate in vivo its effect on biochemical markers of bone remodelling and cardiovascular risk. Specifically, we will 1) assess the stability in the food and the bioavailability of b-cryptoxanthin in the presence of phytosterols (absorption modifiers) by using a complementary approach; in vitro and in vivo studies; and 2) we will study in post-menopausal women (target group) the biological effect (bioefficacy) associated with the regular consumption of modified milk-based fruit beverages (containing b-cryptoxanthin and phytosterols) by assessing changes in biochemical markers of bone turnover and cardiovascular risk.</brief_summary>
