	<brief_summary>GAND-emesis is a multinational, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study to investigate the efficacy and tolerability of a neurokinin1 receptor antagonist (fosaprepitant dimeglumine) in combination with an antiemetic (anti-nausea-and-vomiting) control regimen (palonosetron and dexamethasone) in patients with a gynaecological cancer diagnosis, who are scheduled to receive radiotherapy and weekly chemotherapy. The study aims at investigating if a three-drug antiemetic regimen is superior to a two-drug regimen (standard treatment) in preventing nausea and vomiting in patients receiving radiotherapy and weekly chemotherapy. A pilot study demonstrated that approximately 50% of patients will experience nausea and vomiting when offered a two-drug antiemetic regimen, and it is expected that addition of a third drug (a neurokinin1 receptor antagonist) can increase the proportion of patients with no vomiting in the course of combined chemo-radiotherapy.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>(abbreviated) 1. The patient has a diagnosis cervical cancer. 2. The patient understands the nature and purpose of this study and the study procedures and has signed informed consent. 3. The patient is aged &gt; 18 years. 4. The patient must be both chemo and radiotherapy (RT) naïve. NB: previously low voltage RT or electron RT for nonmelanoma skin cancers is allowed. 5. The patient is scheduled to receive fractionated radiotherapy and concomitant weekly cisplatin at a dose of ≥ 40 mg/m2 for at least five weeks. 6. Brachy therapy is scheduled to be initiated after the third cycle of weekly cisplatin, and preferentially after the fifth week of treatment. 7. Chemotherapy with an emetic risk potential of minimal or mild (up to 30%) is allowed on days 14 (see ref. 14). 8. The patient has a WHO Performance Status of ≤ 2. (abbreviated) 1. The patient has a current malignant diagnosis other than cervical cancer, with exception of nonmelanoma skin cancers. 2. The patient is aged &lt; 18 years. 3. The patient is scheduled to receive less than five weeks of fractionated radiotherapy and concomitant weekly cisplatin. 4. Brachy therapy is planned to be initiated before the third cycle of weekly cisplatin. 5. The patient has been previously treated with radiotherapy, and/or chemotherapy, with exception of treatment with low voltage RT or electron RT for nonmelanoma skin cancers . 6. The patient has a WHO Performance Status of &gt; 2.</criteria>
