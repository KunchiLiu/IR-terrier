	<brief_summary>Recurrence of Hepatitis C virus infection (HCV) is universal after orthotopic liver transplantation (LTx) and is associated with allograft failure, death and need for re-transplantation. Currently, there are no effective therapies to prevent HCV recurrence. Nitazoxanide (NTZ), an oral thiazolide anti-infectious agent, was safe, well tolerated and effective in achieving sustained viral response in patients with chronic HCV genotype 4. Its role in the prevention of HCV recurrence after liver transplantation has not been studied. The investigators propose to conduct an open label pilot study examining the role of NTZ in the prevention of HCV re-infection in eight patients undergoing LTx. First time transplant recipients for chronic HCV without history of renal failure or HIV/HBV co-infection, will receive NTZ immediately prior to LTx and for 3 days thereafter. The primary endpoint is the number of patients who remain HCV-RNA-negative at day 7 after LTx. If at least one patient remains negative, the study will be determined to be positive. Additionally, the investigators will examine the viral kinetics of HCV, tolerability and safety of NTZ.</brief_summary>
