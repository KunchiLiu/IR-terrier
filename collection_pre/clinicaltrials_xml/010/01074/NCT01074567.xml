	<brief_title>DMSO Efficacy in IC/PBS Patients During and After Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The modern treatment of IC is a multi-modal treatment which includes behavioural treatment, physiotherapy of the pelvic floor musculature, oral medication (e.g. Amitryptiline) and intra-vesical instillation (e.g. DMSO, steroids, heparin). These treatments were found to be effective in a number of studies and are approved by the FDA. However, the optimal duration of intra-vesical instilation is not known. All patients with IC (according to the international continence society criteria) will receive 12 weekly intra-vesical instillation of DMSO. All patients will fill an O'leary-Sant questionaire and a urination diary before treatment, after 3, 6, 9 and 12 treatments and at 6 weeks, 3, 6 and 12 month after the end to the treatment.</detailed_description>
