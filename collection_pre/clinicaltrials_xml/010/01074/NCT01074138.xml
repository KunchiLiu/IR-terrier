	<brief_summary>The standard of care for patients with bone-metastatic, castrate-resistant prostate cancer is chemotherapy. If a patient elects not to choose chemotherapy, 70% will progress within 6 months. KX2-391 given orally twice a day for 6 months will be evaluated for its ability to delay/prevent disease progression in patients who have not had prior chemotherapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Safety and Efficacy Study of KX2-391 in Patients With Bone-Metastatic, Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Who Have Not Received Prior Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multi-center, single-arm, open-label, prospective phase II clinical trial evaluating the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of orally administered KX2-391 in adult male patients with progressive bone-metastatic CRPC. Patients must have 1) documented bone-metastatic prostate cancer, 2) castrate levels of testosterone, 3) not received prior chemotherapy, and 4) documented disease progression based on rising PSA, progressive measurable visceral disease and/or progressive bone lesions (one criteria is sufficient) as per the Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group (PCWG2) guidelines (Scher et al 2008).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The patient must provide signed informed consent prior to performing any studyrelated procedures; The patient must have histologically or cytologically confirmed prostate adenocarcinoma; The patient must have presence of at least one documented osseous metastasis on bone scan; The patient must have a castrate testosterone level &lt;50ng/dl within 4 weeks prior to initiation of KX2391 treatment. If chemically castrate, the patient must also agree to stay on luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist medication for the duration of the study; The patient must have documented disease progression as evidenced by one or more of the following 3 criteria: Rising PSA, defined as three rising PSA values ≥ 2 weeks apart with the 3rd value 2ng/ml or greater (historical values may be used). Rising PSA must be seen in the 3rd value relative to the 2nd value AND in the 2nd value relative to the 1st value (i.e. two consecutive rises over time muse be noted). Given potential for fluctuations in PSA values, one drop in rising PSA values over time may be seen when determining eligibility. Pretherapy PSA doubling time may also be calculated (if there are 3 or more values 4 or more weeks apart. Evidence of nodal or visceral progression. Progression must be evident within 3 months prior to study entry. Radiographic documentation of disease is required by CT (or MRI, when CT is not available)(using RECIST 1.1 criteria) within 4 weeks of study entry.The patient must have at least 1 unidimensionally measurable lesion ≥ 20mm by conventional techniques (i.e., conventional CT or chest xray) OR ≥ 10mm by spiral CT scan.Only lymph nodes ≥ 20mm in diameter may be counted.CT is preferred over MRI. The radiographic measurement technique used at Baseline must be serially used throughout the duration of the study. Evidence of progression of bone metastases on bone scan. Appearance of ≥ 2 new lesions since the prior scan (prior scan obtained within 3 months of study entry).Documentation of bone metastases by bone scintigraphy (using PCWG2 criteria) within 4 weeks of study entry.
