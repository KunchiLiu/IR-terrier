	<brief_title>A Prospective, Open-labeled, Multi-centric Trial in Subjects With Systolic Heart Failure to Evaluate Bisoprolol Treatment for the Effects on Surrogate Markers of Heart Failure in Korea</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects with systolic congestive heart failure (CHF) will be enrolled in this study after proper evaluation of NT-proBNP, global assessment of CHF, 6-minute walking test and improvement score of New York Heart Association (NYHA) and echocardiogram (left ventricular chamber size and ejection fraction [LVEF]). Each subject will be orally administered bisoprolol for 6 months starting at 1.25 mg at the Week 0 and titrated up to 10 mg during the 6 month period if the persistent standing systolic blood pressure (SBP) is greater than (&gt;) 90 millimeter of mercury (mm Hg) and there is no symptom of hypotension at the current dose medication (syncope, loss of consciousness, dizziness when standing up). OBJECTIVES Primary objective: â€¢ To evaluate the effect of bisoprolol (between low dose and high dose) on surrogate markers of heart failure in Korea Secondary objectives: - To evaluate bisoprolol for the effects on clinical improvement of heart failure in Korea: 1. New York Heart Association (NYHA), 2. 6-minutes walking test 3. Echocardiogram (left ventricular chamber size and LVEF) - Hospitalization due to heart failure - To evaluate the safety and tolerability of bisoprolol - Global assessment of CHF</detailed_description>
