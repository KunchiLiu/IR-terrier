	<brief_summary>This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of intraperitoneal bortezomib when given together with intraperitoneal carboplatin in treating patients with ovarian epithelial cancer, fallopian tube cancer, or primary peritoneal cancer that is persistent or has come back. Bortezomib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as carboplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Bortezomib may help carboplatin work better by making tumor cells more sensitive to the drug. Infusing bortezomib and carboplatin directly into the abdomen (intraperitoneal) may kill more tumor cells.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intraperitoneal Bortezomib and Carboplatin in Treating Patients With Persistent or Recurrent Ovarian Epithelial Cancer, Fallopian Tube Cancer, or Primary Peritoneal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) of intraperitoneal (IP) bortezomib (BTZ) when administered with intraperitoneal carboplatin in women with epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer that is persistent or recurrent and who have failed primary therapy and at least one second-line therapy. II. To examine the safety of administering BTZ in combination with carboplatin by the IP route. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To estimate objective tumor response rate as determined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria. II. To determine the pharmacokinetic profile of BTZ and carboplatin when administered intraperitoneally once every 21 days. III. To characterize the frequency of carboplatin hypersensitivity reactions (HSR) when administered as an intraperitoneal infusion in the context of recurrent ovarian cancer. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of bortezomib. Patients receive bortezomib intraperitoneally (IP) and carboplatin IP on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must have recurrent or persistent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer; histologic documentation of the original primary tumor is required via the pathology report Patients with the following histologic epithelial cell types are eligible: serous adenocarcinoma, endometrioid adenocarcinoma, mucinous adenocarcinoma, undifferentiated carcinoma, clear cell adenocarcinoma, mixed epithelial carcinoma, transitional cell carcinoma, malignant Brenner's tumor, or adenocarcinoma not otherwise specified (N.O.S) Patients must have either measurable disease or detectable disease: Measurable disease will be defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1; measureable disease is defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest dimension to be recorded); each lesion must be &gt;= 10 mm when measured by computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or caliper measurement by clinical exam; or &gt;= 20 mm when measured by chest xray; lymph nodes must be &gt;= 15 mm in short axis when measured by CT or MRI Detectable disease is defined in a patient as one who does not have measurable disease but has at least one of the following conditions: Baseline values of cancer antigen (CA)125 at least twice the upper limit of normal Ascites and/or pleural effusion attributed to tumor Solid and/or cystic abnormalities on radiographic imaging that do not meet RECIST 1.1 definitions for target lesions In addition, patients are allowed to undergo surgical cytoreduction of relapsed disease as proof of detectable disease at the discretion of their treating physician; if performed to allow participation in this protocol, the operative and pathology reports will be required for submission Patients must have a Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) performance status 0, 1, or 2 Recovery from effects of recent surgery, radiotherapy, or chemotherapy Patients should be free of active infection requiring antibiotics (with the exception of uncomplicated urinary tract infection [UTI]) Any hormonal therapy directed at the malignant tumor must be discontinued at least one week prior to registration; continuation of hormone replacement therapy is permitted Any other prior therapy directed at the malignant tumor, including biological and immunologic agents, must be discontinued at least three weeks prior to registration Patients must have had one prior platinumbased chemotherapeutic regimen for management of primary disease containing carboplatin, cisplatin, or another organoplatinum compound; this initial treatment may have included noncytotoxic therapy, intraperitoneal therapy, consolidation, or extended therapy administered after surgical or nonsurgical assessment Patients are required to receive, one additional cytotoxic regimen for management of recurrent or persistent disease Patients are allowed to receive, but are not required to receive, two additional cytotoxic regimens for management of recurrent or persistent disease (maximum number of prior cytotoxic regimens including primary therapy is 4);
