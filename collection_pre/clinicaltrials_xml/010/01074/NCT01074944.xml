	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of once daily (QD) versus twice daily (BID) dosing of eliglustat tartrate (Genz-112638) in participants with Gaucher disease type 1 who had demonstrated clinical stability on BID dosing of eliglustat tartrate (Genz-112638). The secondary objective was to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of Genz-99067 when eliglustat tartrate (Genz-112638) was administered QD and BID in participants with Gaucher disease type 1 who had demonstrated clinical stability on BID dosing of eliglustat tartrate (Genz-112638).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>The participant who was willing and provided signed informed consent prior to any studyrelated procedures. The participant was ≥18 years of age. The participant diagnosed with GD 1 confirmed by a documented deficiency of acid βglucosidase activity by enzyme assay. Female participants of childbearing potential had a documented negative pregnancy test prior to administration of the first dose of eliglustat tartrate (Genz112638) in this study. In addition, all female participants of childbearing potential used a medically accepted form of contraception throughout the study, i.e., either a barrier method or hormonal contraceptive with norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol or similar active components The participant met all of the following criteria at the time of screening: hemoglobin level ≥9 g/dL (mean of 2 measurements); platelet count ≥70,000/mm^3 (mean of 2 measurements); spleen volume ≤25 multiples of normal (MN); liver volume ≤2.0 MN. The participant consented to provide a blood sample for genotyping for Gaucher disease and for CYP2D6 to categorize the participant's predicted rate of metabolism, if these genotyping results were not already available for the participant. The participant was willing to abstain from consumption of grapefruit, grapefruit juice, or grapefruit products for 72 hours prior to administration of the first dose of Genz112638 and throughout the duration of the study. The participant was participating in GZGD02607 study, "A Phase 3, Randomized, MultiCenter, MultiNational, OpenLabel, Active Comparator Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Genz112638 in Participants with GD1 who have been Stabilized with Cerezyme ® ," or was eligible for inclusion in GZGD02607 (while enrollment was ongoing) and had access to a physician participating in GZGD02607, or the participant was participating in GZGD02507 study, "A Phase 3, Randomized, DoubleBlind, PlaceboControlled, MultiCenter Study Confirming the Efficacy and Safety of Genz112638 in Participants with GD1," or was eligible for inclusion in GZGD02507 (while enrollment was ongoing) and had access to a physician participating in GZGD02507. The participant received miglustat within 6 months prior to administration of the first dose of Genz112638 in this study. The participant had a partial or total splenectomy within 3 years prior to randomization. The participant received pharmacological chaperones or miglustat within 6 months prior to administration of the first dose of eliglustat tartrate (Genz112638) in this study. The participant had any evidence of neurologic disorder (e.g., peripheral neuropathy, tremor, seizures, Parkinsonism or cognitive impairment) or pulmonary involvement (e.g., pulmonary hypertension) as related to Gaucher disease. The participant was transfusiondependent. The participant had a documented deficiency of iron, vitamin B12, or folate that requires treatment not yet initiated or, if initiated, the participant had not been stable under treatment for at least 3 months prior to administration of the first dose of Genz112638 in this study. The participant had documented prior esophageal varices or clinically significant liver infarction or current liver enzymes (alanine transaminase [ALT]/aspartate aminotransferase [AST]) or total bilirubin &gt;2 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), unless the participant had a diagnosis of Gilbert Syndrome. The participant had any clinically significant disease, other than Gaucher disease, including cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, gastrointestinal, pulmonary, neurologic, endocrine, metabolic (including hypokalaemia or hypomagnesemia), or psychiatric disease, other medical conditions, or serious intercurrent illnesses that, in the opinion of the Investigator, precluded participation in the study. The participant was known to have any of the following: Clinically significant coronary artery disease including history of myocardial infarction [MI] or ongoing signs or symptoms consistent with cardiac ischemia or heart failure; or clinically significant arrhythmias or conduction defect such as 2nd or 3rd degree AV block, complete bundle branch block, prolonged QTc interval, or sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT). The participant who tested positive for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody, Hepatitis C antibody, or Hepatitis B surface antigen. The participant received an investigational product (other than eliglustat tartrate (Genz112638)) within 30 days prior to administration of the first dose of eliglustat tartrate (Genz112638) in this study. The participant was scheduled for inparticipant hospitalization, including elective surgery, during the study. The participant had a history of cancer, with the exception of basal cell carcinoma, within 5 years prior to administration of the first dose of Genz112638 in this study. The participant was pregnant or lactating. The participant had received any medication that may cause QTc interval prolongation within 30 days prior to the first dose of Genz112638. Exception: Diphenhydramine (Benadryl) or other medications used as premedication for ERT infusions were allowed up to 7 days prior to the first dose of Genz112638. The participant had received for the first time (i.e., the participant was not already chronically using) any of the following medications within 30 days prior to the first dose of Genz112638: Strong inhibitors of CYP2D6 or CYP3A4; Inducers of CYP3A4. Exception: Premedications for ERT infusions were allowed up to 7 days prior to the first dose of Genz112638. The participant was a CYP2D6 nonpoor metabolizer or an indeterminate metabolizer with one allele identified as active who was chronically receiving both a strong competitive inhibitor of CYP2D6 and a strong competitive inhibitor of CYP3A4 and for whom no reasonable alternative medication exists. or The participant was a CYP2D6 poor metabolizer or an indeterminate metabolizer with neither allele known to be active who was chronically receiving a strong competitive inhibitor of CYP3A4 and for whom no reasonable alternative medication exists. Exception for both cases: Premedications for ERT infusions were allowed up to 7 days prior to the first dose of Genz112638.</criteria>
