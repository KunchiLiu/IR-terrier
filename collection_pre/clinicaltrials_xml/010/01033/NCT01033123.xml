	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of BSI-201 on the objective response rate in platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer patients receiving gemcitabine and carboplatin. Based on data generated by BiPar/Sanofi, it is concluded that iniparib does not possess characteristics typical of the PARP inhibitor class. The exact mechanism has not yet been fully elucidated, however based on experiments on tumor cells performed in the laboratory, iniparib is a novel investigational anti-cancer agent that induces gamma-H2AX (a marker of DNA damage) in tumor cell lines, induces cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase in tumor cell lines, and potentiates the cell cycle effects of DNA damaging modalities in tumor cell lines. Investigations into potential targets of iniparib and its metabolites are ongoing.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>At least 18 years of age Histological diagnosis of epithelial ovarian carcinoma, fallopian tube cancer, or primary peritoneal carcinoma Completion of only one previous course of chemotherapy which contained a platinum therapy, with sensitivity to that regimen. "Platinumsensitivity" is defined by a relapse greater than 6 months after termination of platinumbased chemotherapy Measurable disease, defined by at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest dimension to be recorded), and is ≥ 20 mm when measured by conventional techniques (palpation, plain xray, computed tomography [CT], or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) or ≥ 10 mm when measured by spiral CT Adequate organ function defined as: absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1,500/mm3, platelets ≥ 100,000/mm3, creatinine clearance &gt; 50mL/min, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &lt; 2.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN; or &lt; 5 x ULN in case of liver metastases); total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 mg/dL For women of child bearing potential, documented negative pregnancy test within two weeks of study entry and agreement to acceptable birth control during the duration of the study therapy Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0, 1 or 2 Signed, institutional review board (IRB) approved written informed consent Concurrent invasive malignancy, not including: 1. Nonmelanomatous skin cancer 2. In situ malignancies 3. Concurrent superficial endometrial carcinoma, if their endometrial carcinoma is superficial or invades less than 50% the thickness of the myometrium) 4. Low risk breast cancer (localized, noninflammatory) treated with curative intent Lesions identifiable only by positron emission tomography (PET) Prior treatment with poly (ADPribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors, including BSI201 Major medical conditions that might affect study participation (i.e., uncontrolled pulmonary, renal, or hepatic dysfunction, uncontrolled infection) Other significant comorbid condition which the investigator feels might compromise effective and safe participation in the study, including a history of congestive cardiac failure or an electrocardiogram (ECG) suggesting significant conduction defect or myocardial ischemia Enrollment in another investigational device or drug study, or current treatment with other investigational agents Concurrent radiation therapy to treat primary disease throughout the course of the study Inability to comply with the requirements of the study Pregnancy or lactation Leptomeningeal disease or brain metastases requiring steroids or other therapeutic intervention</criteria>
