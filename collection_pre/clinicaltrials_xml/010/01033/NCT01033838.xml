	<brief_summary>Laparoscopic anterior resection is a standardized procedure requiring a small muscle split incision to retrieve the specimen and to fashion the proximal part of the double stapled anastomosis. Most patients can be included within a standardized perioperative care program called Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS). A new evolution as a primary step towards a complete Natural Orifice Translumenal Endoscopic Surgery (NOTES)-procedure is a hybrid approach (transrectal and laparoscopic). The dissection is performed laparoscopically but the specimen is retrieved within an endobag through the rectum. The anastomosis is created intracorporeally using a triple stapled technique. There are no trials available in the literature concerning these 2 techniques. Therefore this study will be undertaken to establish the role of the 2 surgical procedures and to compare them after short-term follow-up.</brief_summary>
