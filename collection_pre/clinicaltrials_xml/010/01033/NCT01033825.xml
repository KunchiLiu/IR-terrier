	<brief_title>Study of the Effects of Ciclesonide Hydrofluoroalkane (HFA) Nasal Aerosol on Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) Axis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, safety and efficacy study of the effects of ciclesonide HFA nasal aerosol and ciclesonide AQ nasal spray on the HPA axis, when administered once daily to male and female subjects 12 years or older diagnosed with Perennial Allergic Rhinitis (PAR). The study consists of a screening period, a single blind run in period, a 6 week double blind treatment period including an active control segment, and a follow up period. Placebo was used as the control during the double-blind treatment period for both delivery methods (HFA nasal aerosol and aqueous nasal spray)and for the study outcome analyses. There was also a positive control administered to a subset of these placebo subjects during the last 4 days of Week 6 (dexamethasone placebo or dexamethasone 6 mg). The active control was utilized to validate the assay sensitivity (ie, distinguish an effective from an ineffective drug) of this study, as dexamethasone is a known HPA axis suppressant, therefore this subset of placebo subjects was not included in the study outcome analyses. This study was previously posted by Sepracor Inc. In October 2009, Sepracor Inc. was acquired by Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma., and in October 2010, Sepracor Inc's name was changed to Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Give written informed consent and assent, including privacy authorization as well as adherence to concomitant medication withholding periods, prior to participation. Subject must be in general good health (defined as the absence of any clinically relevant abnormalities as determined by the Investigator) based on screening physical examination, medical history, and clinical laboratory values (Hematology, Chemistries and Urinalysis). If any of the screening Hematology, Chemistries, or Urinalysis are not within the clinical laboratory's reference range, then the subject can be included only if the Investigator judges the deviations to be not clinically significant. A history of PAR to a relevant perennial allergen (house dust mites, cockroach, molds, animal dander) for a minimum of two years immediately preceding the study Screening visit. The PAR must have been of sufficient severity to have required treatment (either continuous or intermittent) in the past and require treatment throughout the entire study period. A demonstrated sensitivity to at least one allergen known to induce PAR (house dust mite, animal dander, cockroach, and molds) based on a documented result with a standard skinprick test either within 90 days prior to screening or performed at the Screening visit. A positive test is defined as a wheal diameter at least 3 mm larger than the negative control wheal for the skin prick test. The subject's positive allergen test must be consistent with the medical history of PAR and must be present in the subject's environment throughout the study. Subject, if female, must have a negative serum pregnancy test at screening. Females of childbearing potential must be instructed to and agree to avoid pregnancy during the study and must use an acceptable method of birth control. 1. An oral contraceptive, an intrauterine device (IUD), implantable contraceptive, transdermal or injectable contraceptive for at least 1 month prior to entering the study with continued use throughout the study and for thirty days following study participation. 2. Barrier method of contraception, eg, condom and/or diaphragm with spermicide while participating in the study. 3. Abstinence. Female subject who is pregnant or lactating. History of physical findings of nasal pathology, including nasal polyps or other clinically significant respiratory tract malformations; recent nasal biopsy; nasal trauma; or nasal ulcers or perforations. Surgery and atrophic rhinitis or rhinitis medicamentosa are not permitted within the last 120 days prior to the Screening visit. Subject is, in the investigator's judgement, having a seasonal exacerbation at the time of screening. Participation in any investigational drug trial within the 30 days preceding the Screening visit or planned participation in another investigational drug trial at any time during this trial. A known hypersensitivity to any corticosteroid or any of the excipients in the formulation of ciclesonide. History of a respiratory infection or disorder [including, but not limited to bronchitis, pneumonia, influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)] within the 14 days preceding the Screening visit. History of alcohol or drug abuse within 2 years preceding the Screening visit. History of a positive test for HIV, hepatitis B or hepatitis C. Active asthma requiring treatment with inhaled or systemic corticosteroids and/or routine use of beta agonists and any controller drugs (eg, theophylline, leukotriene antagonists, etc.); intermittent use (less than or equal to 3 uses per week) of inhaled short acting betaagonists is acceptable. Use of short acting betaagonists for exerciseinduced bronchospasm will be allowed. Expected use of any disallowed concomitant medications during the treatment period. Initiation of immunotherapy during the study period or dose escalation during the study period. However, initiation of immunotherapy 90 days or more prior to the Screening Visit and use of a stable (maintenance) dose (30 days or more) may be considered for inclusion. Previous randomization in an intranasal ciclesonide HFA nasal aerosol study. Nonvaccinated exposure to or active infection with, chickenpox or measles within the 21 days preceding the Screening Visit. Initiation of pimecrolimus cream 1% or greater or tacrolimus ointment 0.03% or greater during the study period or planned dose escalation during the study period. However, initiation of these creams/ointments 30 days or more prior to screening and use of a stable (maintenance) dose during the study period may be considered for inclusion. Study participation by clinical investigator site employees and/or their immediate relatives who reside in the same household. Study participation by more than one subject from the same household. Have any of the following conditions that are judged by the investigator to be clinically significant and/or affect the subject's ability to participate in the clinical trial: impaired hepatic function including alcohol related liver disease or cirrhosis; history of ocular disturbances, eg, glaucoma or posterior subcapsular cataracts; any systemic infection hematological, hepatic, renal, endocrine (except for controlled diabetes mellitus or postmenopausal symptoms or hypothyroidism; gastrointestinal disease; malignancy (excluding basal cell carcinoma); current neuropsychological condition with or without drug therapy Any condition that, in the judgment of the investigator, would preclude the subject from completing the protocol with capture of the assessments as written.</criteria>
