	<brief_summary>Study Design: A, multinational, double blind, placebo-controlled pilot RCT involving 80 patients in the general ICUs of 30 centres. Most patients will be recruited from within Canada; however cases will be recruited from international sites. This study will be conducted under the auspices of the Canadian Critical Care Trials Group (CCCTG) and the International Forum for Acute Care Trialists (InFACT).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Collaborative H1N1 Adjuvant Treatment Pilot Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objective: The primary objective of the CHAT Pilot Trial is to assess our ability to recruit the desired patient population (i.e., the proportion of eligible patients enrolled in the trial), and to conduct a scientifically rigorous international RCT under pandemic circumstances. Secondary Objectives: To evaluate (i) adherence to the medication administration regimen. (ii) the ability for research staff to collect the required primary and secondary endpoints for the planned full CHAT trial, (iii) the number of study withdrawals due to administration of open-label statins and withdrawals of consent and (iv) the impact of the approved consent model on recruitment rates. Study Methods (Overview): Using a web-based randomization system patients, research coordinators will assign critically ill adults treated with antiviral medication for &lt; or equal to 72 hours and requiring mechanical ventilation to one of two treatment strategies (rosuvastatin or placebo) for 14 days. Given the need to recruit patients into the CHAT Trial under pandemic conditions, when family members may not be present to provide written informed consent, we will request either a waiver of consent or deferred consent from Research Ethics Boards (REBs) at participating centres. The Keenan Research Centre/Li Ka Shing Knowledge Institute (St Michael's Hospital, Toronto, Ontario) will be the study Methods Centre.</detailed_description>
