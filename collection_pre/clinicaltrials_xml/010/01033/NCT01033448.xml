	<brief_summary>This open-label, multi-center study will evaluate the safety and tolerability and the effect on viral activity of a combined PEGASYS and COPEGUS extended therapy in patients with chronic hepatitis C with genotype 1, 2 and 3. Patients who completed 48 weeks (genotype 1) or 24 weeks (genotype 2 and 3) of standard treatment with PEGASYS and COPEGUS and were identified as slow virological responders will be enrolled in this study in order to receive additional 24 weeks of treatment. PEGASYS 180 micrograms will be administered sc once weekly and COPEGUS will be administered as 800 mg, or 1000-1200 mg daily oral doses. The anticipated time on study treatment is 24 weeks. The target sample size is 50-150 patients.</brief_summary>
