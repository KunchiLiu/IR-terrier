	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of CS-1008 in combination with sorafenib to sorafenib alone for treating liver cancer. Approximately 160 participants will take part in this study at approximately 22 sites (4 in the US, 8 in Japan, and 10 in Asia).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Histologically or cytologically confirmed HCC or clinical diagnosis of HCC when the following criteria are all met: History of chronic hepatitis and/or cirrhosis of liver; Typical features of HCC demonstrated in dynamic imaging studies, such as threephase computed tomography (CT); AND AFP level &gt; 200 ng/mL Advanced diseases Extrahepatic metastasis, OR Locally advanced diseases which are not amendable for surgical resection or other locoregional therapies including transhepatic arterial (chemo)embolization (TACE or TAE) and local ablative therapy Measurable disease based on RECIST criteria (version 1.0) of at least 1 untreated target lesion that can be measured in 1 dimension At least 18 years of age Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 or 1 ChildPugh class A Life expectancy of at least 12 weeks Adequate organ and bone marrow function as assessed by clinical laboratory evaluations: Hemoglobin ≥ 8.5 g/dL (transfusion and/or growth factor support allowed) Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ??? 1.0 x 109/L Platelet count ≥ 75 x 109/L Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) or creatinine clearance &gt; 40 mL/min AST and alkaline phosphatase ??? 5.0 x ULN Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN Serum amylase and lipase ≤ 1.5 x ULN Women of childbearing potential must be willing to consent to using effective contraception (eg, abstinence, hormonal contraceptives, bilateral tubal ligation, barrier with spermicide, intrauterine device) while on treatment and for 3 months thereafter. Men who are the partner of a woman of childbearing potential must be willing to consent to using effective contraception (eg, vasectomy or barrier with spermicide) while on treatment and for 3 months thereafter All female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test (serum or urine) result Subjects must be fully informed about their illness and the investigational nature of the study protocol (including foreseeable risks and possible side effects) and must sign and date an IRB/IEC approved ICF before performance of any study specific procedures or tests Subjects must be willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plan, laboratory tests, and other study procedures Any prior systemic therapy for HCC, including systemic chemotherapy (prior exposure to chemotherapy by TACE is allowed), immunotherapy, sorafenib or other Raf kinase inhibitors, VEGF/VEGFRinhibitors, epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors or mTOR inhibitors Radiotherapy or major surgical procedure within 4 weeks of the screening/baseline visit or minor surgical procedures (eg, core biopsy or fine needle aspiration) within 2 weeks of the screening/baseline visit Anticipation of need for RT or a major surgical procedure during the study Any investigational agent within 4 weeks before the screening/baseline visit History of any of the following conditions within 6 months before the screening/baseline visit: Myocardial infarction with significant impairment of cardiac function (eg, ejection fraction ≤ 30%) Severe/unstable angina pectoris New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III or IV congestive heart failure (Section 17.2) Clinically significant pulmonary disease (eg, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma) Clinically active brain metastases (defined as untreated, symptomatic or requiring steroids or anticonvulsants medications to control associated symptoms), uncontrolled seizure disorder; spinal cord compression; or carcinomatous meningitis. Subjects with treated brain metastasis will be included in the study if they have recovered from the acute, toxic effects of radiotherapy. A minimum of 15 days must have elapsed between the end of RT and the screening/baseline visit History of organ transplantation Clinically significant, severe, active infection requiring IV antibiotics Known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection History of prior sensitivity reaction to any components of CS1008 or sorafenib formulations History of a second malignancy, with the exception of in situ cervical cancer or adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin Pregnant or breast feeding Serious intercurrent medical illnesses that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would impair the subject's ability to provide informed consent or unacceptably reduce the safety of the proposed treatment Clinically significant (National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [NCI CTCAE] grade ≥ 3) gastrointestinal bleeding in the past 12 months or current active gastrointestinal bleeding Presence of esophageal varices at risk of bleeding, such as large esophageal/gastric varices or those with red sign, or active peptic ulcer with or without exposed vessels at risk of bleeding (as documented by endoscopy) History of abdominal fistula, gastrointestinal perforation, or intraabdominal abscess within past 6 months</criteria>
