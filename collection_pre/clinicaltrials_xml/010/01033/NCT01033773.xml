	<brief_summary>To demonstrate that a focused Emergency Department (ED) intervention for uncontrolled hyperglycemia enables safe and effective glycemic management and reduces emergency room re-visits.

	<detailed_description>Patients with BG &gt; 200mg/dL presenting to an urban tertiary care hospital ED were enrolled in a 4 week prospective intervention with historic self-controls.
