	<brief_summary>The purpose of this trial is to assess the impact of raltegravir, maraviroc, darunavir/r, and Truvada® (emtricitabine/tenofovir) vs. darunavir/r and Truvada® on cell-associated HIV-DNA levels in patients with primary HIV-1 infection.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Optimisation of Primary HIV1 Infection Treatment(ANRS 147 OPTIPRIM)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary HIV-1 infection is characterized by a phase of intense replication, with a quick dissemination and early changes in the immune system. During primary HIV-1 infection, damages to MALT and GALT promotes a chronic cell activation, which participates in a progressive decay of immune functions. After HAART initiation, the magnitude and rapidity of cell-associated HIV-DNA decrease are significantly higher in patients with primary HIV-1 infection than in patients with chronic infection (Ngo Giang Huong, AIDS 2004). We hypothesize that an early intervention at different levels of viral replication with potent and well-tolerated new drugs may have a greater impact on cell-associated HIV-DNA levels than conventional triple-drug HAART.</detailed_description>
