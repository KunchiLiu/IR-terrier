	<brief_summary>The clinical trial is a phase III, double-blind, randomised, controlled, multi-centre, clinical trial, on the immunogenicity and safety of TdaP vaccine in comparison to Td vaccine when given as a booster vaccination to adults who were vaccinated with D, T and wP vaccine according to the Danish vaccination programme in their childhood. Healthy, adult, female or male volunteers, who completed primary vaccination with diphtheria (D), tetanus (T) and whole cell pertussis vaccine (wP), typically during their childhood, is the target population.</brief_summary>
