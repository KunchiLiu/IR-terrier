	<brief_summary>This pilot study is a sub-study of ATN 067. ATN 067 utilizes a cross-sectional research design to recruit Latina and African American young women to undergo HIV screening. The primary goal of this proposed pilot study, ATN 084, is to explore the feasibility and acceptability of index female recruiters identifying and recruiting their past and present male sexual partners to undergo HIV screening and complete a one-time ACASI interview. In addition, the study will also include female friendship network members who were enrolled in ATN 067 and were diagnosed with HIV. These young women will also be asked to recruit their past and present male sex partners to undergo HIV screening.</brief_summary>
