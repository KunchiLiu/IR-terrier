	<brief_summary>The investigators hypothesize that a calcineurin inhibitor-free, steroid-free, co-stimulatory blockade-based immunosuppressive regimen, in combination with a GLP-1 agonist, will reduce the islet mass required to achieve and sustain insulin independence following simultaneous islet-kidney transplantation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Calcineurin Inhibitor-free, Steroid-free Immunosuppressive Regimen in Simultaneous Islet-Kidney Transplantation for Uremic Type 1 Diabetic Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a single center, open-label, non-randomized, prospective, pilot study of 8 Type 1 diabetic/uremic patients, ages 18-60 undergoing simultaneous islet-kidney transplantation. Study to include both male and/or female subjects. We hypothesize that a calcineurin inhibitor-free, steroid-free, co-stimulatory blockade-based immunosuppressive regimen, in combination with a GLP-1 agonist, will reduce the islet mass required to achieve and sustain insulin independence following simultaneous islet-kidney transplantation. Furthermore, we anticipate an improvement in creatinine clearance and a reduction in Interstitial Fibrosis/Tubular Atrophy in the transplanted renal allograft, and a reduction of "de novo" human anti-HLA antibody and auto-antibody formation against the respective donors. Without calcineurin inhibitors or steroids, we hypothesize that belatacept, in conjunction with sirolimus and mycophenolic acid will provide balanced immunosuppression for combined islet-kidney transplantation.</detailed_description>
