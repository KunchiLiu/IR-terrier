	<brief_summary>Current therapies for Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) have limited effectiveness. This study measures the efficacy of two different approaches to reducing anxiety and stress. One approach uses education, nutrition, exercise, and time management training, and another uses mindfulness meditation and yoga, which is taught as part of the Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) course, an 8-week manualized mindfulness intervention. We hypothesize that the two approaches will reduce anxiety in individuals with GAD in different ways. We will measure changes in stress hormones associated with these changes.</brief_summary>
