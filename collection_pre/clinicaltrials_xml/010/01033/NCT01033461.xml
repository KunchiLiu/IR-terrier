	<brief_title>Combination of Probiotic and Calcium in Healthy Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Animal studies suggest that calcium beneficially influence the microbiota in the gut. This effect of calcium is due to the formation of amorphous calcium phosphate, which has the ability to bind bile acids and other cytotoxic substances in the gut. The precipitation of the cytotoxic substances leads to a less aggressive environment in the gut and might be stimulate the adhesion of the microbiota. Thirty-two healthy men and women participated in a placebo-controlled, double-blind and cross over human study. The participants were randomly divided into two groups. All probands consumed a probiotic drink for four weeks (10e+10 CFU/d). Additionally, one group consumed a pentacalcium phosphate-enriched bread (1 g Ca/d) and the other group consumed a bread without pentacalcium phosphate. After a two-week wash-out and a two-week placebo period the invention changed for another four weeks (cross over). At the end of each intervention and placebo period, subjects consumed a defined diet for three days. Furthermore, there was a three-day quantitative stool and urine collection and a fasting venous blood sample was taken.</detailed_description>
