	<brief_title>Intensive Statin Treatment for STEMI Patients Undergoing Primary PCI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ARMYDA-ACS, ARMYDA-RECAPTURE and NAPLES II demonstrated that in patients with ASP and NSTE ACS undergoing early PCI, loading dose of atorvastatin before early PCI led to a reduction of prei-PCI MI, recurrent CV events and mortality. While, theses studies included patients with non-ST-segment elevation ACS, requiring PCI; these results cannot be extrapolated directly to patients with ST-segment elevation MI, and these trials included patients sent to an early and selective PCI, but not those undergoing emergency revascularization; This study is designed to find out whether STEMI patients undergoing emergency PCI can benefit from intensive atorvastatin treatment compared with routine treatment.</detailed_description>
