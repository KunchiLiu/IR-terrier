	<detailed_description>This study was terminated on 03Feb2011 due to the fact that the anticipated number of patients expected was not reached. The date of cessation of the drug was January 27, 2011. There was no intervention in the treatment or administration of the drug; the study only observed the treatment and collected data. As the study was dependent on the arrival of new patients with metastatic renal cancer, which was of a very low incidence, the study was terminated. Efficacy, adverse events or other safety issues were not factors in terminating the study. Lack of patients was the only reason.</detailed_description>
