	<brief_summary>The primary objective is to assess the safety of two doses of C-Tb (0.01 and 0.1 µg/0.1 mL) when administered intradermally by the Mantoux technique to patients in the acute phase of treatment against active TB. The secondary objectives are to assess the immune response of two doses (0.01 and 0.1 µg/0.1 mL) of C-Tb from the size of induration and to assess the safety of unpreserved C-Tb and C-Tb preserved with 0.5% phenol (local reactions).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Safety and Dose Finding Trial of C-Tb, When Given to Adult Patients Recently Diagnosed With Active Tuberculosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This clinical trial is a single centre phase Ib open dose adjustment study with respect to the dose of C-Tb combined with a double blind randomised, split-body comparison of unpreserved C-Tb and C-Tb preserved with 0.5% phenol (each patient receives the unpreserved version in one arm and the preserved version in the other arm).</detailed_description>
