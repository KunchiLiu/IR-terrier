	<brief_title>Pain Perception at Laser Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Purpose: To compare the pain perception at laser treatment of peripheral retinal degenerations with green and infrared wavelengths. Methods: Thirty patients (60 eyes) were enrolled in the study. Each patient had one eye treated with infrared laser (diode, 810nm) and the other eye treated with green laser (frequency-doubled solid state laser, diode-pumped, with 532-nm). The laser treatment was performed following a standardized protocol. Immediately after photocoagulation, the patient was asked to grading pain perception according an 11-point (i.e. 0-10) numerical rating scale (NRS) 2,3, accompanied by the instructions "Please rate your pain by indicating the number that best describes it". This NRS is represented as a straight line (10 cm in length). The numbers between 0 and 10 are spaced at regular intervals along the line, at either end of the line are two poles that are defined as the extreme limits of the response to be measure, with '0' meaning 'No pain' and '10' meaning 'Pain as bad as you can imagine'.</detailed_description>
