	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to describe DNA copy number variations and gene expression profiles of bone marrow plasma cells of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM). The final objective is to search for correlations with the risk of progression in order to establish a predictive model of early malignant transformation.</brief_summary>
