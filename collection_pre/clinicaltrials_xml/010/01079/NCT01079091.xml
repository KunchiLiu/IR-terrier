	<brief_summary>Patients with compensated chronic liver disease who have an episode of acute deterioration of liver function (acute-on-chronic liver failure) are known to have up to 90% mortality rate. Hepa Wash(R) is a newly developed liver and renal support system that is based on the use of recycled albumin dialysate. The new system has shown a high detoxification capacity in in-vitro and preclinical studies. The aim of the study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the Hepa Wash system in patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure in the intensive care unit.</brief_summary>
