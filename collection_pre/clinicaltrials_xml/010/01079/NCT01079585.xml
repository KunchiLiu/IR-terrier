	<brief_title>The Effect of 40gr Okara on Gastric Emptying</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This trail will be a single blinded, cross-over design. The study population will include 10 subjects. The patients will be randomly assigned to receive one of two Muffin cakes, with or without 40 grams Okara on three occasions (three visits). In two visits the subject will receive a Muffin cake with 40 grams Okara (but with similar caloric value), and in one visit a Muffin cake without Okara. Postprandial gastric emptying time will be measured for each subject, by 13C Breath Test. Okara is a natural water extracted food grade soy product, contains approximately 35% protein (mfb), and about 43% of dietary fibers.</detailed_description>
