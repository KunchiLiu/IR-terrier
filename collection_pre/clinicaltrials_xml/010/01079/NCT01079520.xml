	<brief_summary>Accurate staging of the mediastinum is essential to evaluate prognosis in non-small cell lung cancer and to devise an appropriate treatment plan. Mediastinal staging by surgical techniques (mainly cervical mediastinoscopy) is considered to be the gold standard, although surgical staging is invasive, requires general anesthesia, and is subject to potential serious complications. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA) is a new modality for the evaluation of mediastinal and hilar lymph node metastasis from lung cancer. Compared to other diagnostic methods, EBUS-TBNA is a real-time procedure that enables multiple biopsies with high-quality histologic cores under local anesthesia. However, there have been few data on the head-to-head comparisons of mediastinoscopy and EBUS-TBNA. The aim of this prospective study is to determine the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy of EBUS-TBNA and mediastinoscopy in identifying N2 and N3 lymph node for patients with non-small cell lung cancer.</brief_summary>
