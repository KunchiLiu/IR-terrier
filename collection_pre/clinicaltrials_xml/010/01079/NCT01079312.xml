	<brief_summary>Background: Deep sedation with propofol and opioid is commonly used for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), but is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Delivery of propofol and short-acting potent opioid analgesic using a self-administration device (patient-controlled sedation, PCS) could be another option for this purpose. Comparative studies with PCS for ERCP are lacking.The main objective of this prospective randomized trial trial was to compare PCS with propofol/remifentanil to anaesthesiologist managed propofol sedation during ERCP.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Patient-controlled Sedation With Propofol and Remifentanyl for Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>80 elective ERCP patients were randomized to anaesthesiologist managed propofol sedation (PI-group) or PCS with propofol/remifentanil (PCS-group). Sedation degree was estimated every 5 min throughout the procedure using Ramsay´s and Gillham´s sedation scores. Total amount of propofol was calculated at the end of procedure. Endoscopists´ and patients´ satisfaction was evaluated with questionary.</detailed_description>
