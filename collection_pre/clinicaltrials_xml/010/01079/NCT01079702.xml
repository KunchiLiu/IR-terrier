	<brief_title>Everolimus and Capecitabine in Patients With Advanced Malignancy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The results form preclinical studies suggest that mTOR inhibitors are promising drugs for the treatment of various types of cancer. Everolimus seems the most attractive mTOR inhibitor because of the favourable pharmacokinetic profile and possibility of oral administration. Based on preclinical findings, mTOR inhibitors may be more efficacious when used in a rational combination with other cancer regiments like cytostatic drugs. Indeed, several multiagent combinations are being investigated in clinical trials at the moment, and the results are promising. In our study we combine everolimus, administrated twice daily at a fixed total dose of 10 mg continuously with capecitabine administered bid for 14 days followed by 7 days rest. In this study, capecitabine will be dose escalated. The first dose level of capecitabine is 500 mg/m2 twice daily. Three patients will be enrolled per dose level, starting at dose level 1. If one of the 3 patients develops dose-limiting toxicity at any dose level, 3 other patients will start at the same dose level. If 2 or more out of these 6 patients develop DLT, no further dose escalations will be performed. The MTD will be considered to be the dose given at the previous lower level. No intrapatient dose escalation will be applied. Once the MTD of capecitabine is established, the phase II part of the study will start in which 25 patients with various malignancies will be enrolled to evaluate the efficacy and feasibility of the combination of everolimus and capecitabine.</detailed_description>
