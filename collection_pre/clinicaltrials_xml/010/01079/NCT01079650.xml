Infrared thermography allows us to visualize temperature distribution of the human body and has been used in medical practice since the 1950s. In current study we would like to examine the ability of infrared thermography to detect acute appendicitis, ovary torsion and inflammation, and testicular torsion and inflammation.</brief_summary>
