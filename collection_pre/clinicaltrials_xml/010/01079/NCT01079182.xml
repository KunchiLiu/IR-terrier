	<detailed_description>This was a postmarketing observational study (PMOS) for participants with insufficiently controlled, moderate to severe, active AS who were eligible for adalimumab therapy. Participants started treatment with adalimumab under normal clinical settings in Germany. Enrolled participants were followed during adalimumab therapy . Participants were assessed during regular clinic visits for up to 24 months and 359 clinicians (rheumatologists/orthopedists/general practitioners/internist) participated in the study. Since this was an observational trial, not all doctors followed the stated age limitations and some participants under the age of 18 were enrolled.</detailed_description>
