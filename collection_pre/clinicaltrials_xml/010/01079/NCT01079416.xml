	<brief_summary>Esophageal capsule endoscopy is sedation-less alternative to upper endoscopy for evaluating esophageal lesions and potentially other upper gastrointestinal lesions. The purpose of this study was to determine whether esophageal capsule endoscopy is convenient and accurate as upper endoscopy for detection of esophageal varices and related lesions.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Age at least 18 years and less than 86 years at the time of consent. Clinically evident or biopsy proven cirrhosis. No previous documented UGI bleeding due to peptic ulcers, varices, portal hypertensive gastropathy, angiomas, or watermelon stomach. No previous endoscopic, radiological or surgical treatment for variceal bleeding or ascites. Probable life expectancy of at least 24 months without liver transplantation, as judged by the hepatologist and endoscopistinvestigators, and have a Model for EndStage Liver Disease (MELD) score â‰¤ 29. Signed a written informed consent. Prior variceal bleeding esophageal, gastric, or other site. Prior endoscopic (e.g. sclerotherapy, ligation, or combination therapy), radiological (e.g. transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shuntTIPS) or surgical (e.g. portocaval or splenorenal shunt) treatment of esophagogastric varices or ascites. Patient who was uncooperative or unable to give written consent. Severe comorbid illness, e.g. end stage chronic renal disease (e.g. dialysis dependence, creatinine greater than 2 times normal) or respiratory failure (e.g. ventilator dependent, oxygen dependent, unstable asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease e.g. 2 or more hospitalizations for exacerbation in 1 year, asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease which required daily bronchodilators and/or oral/inhaled steroids), tense ascites requiring repeated therapeutic paracenteses, severe hepatic encephalopathy, peritonitis, or sepsis. Active cancer with less than a 24 month expected survival and/or cancer on active treatment with chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy. Esophageal motility disorder, esophageal stricture or esophageal diverticulum, causing dysphagia or requiring dilatation. GI obstruction or partial obstruction (by history or imaging), symptomatic GI stricture or pseudoobstruction which may prevent passage of the capsule. Patients with potentially reversible portal hypertension such as alcoholic hepatitis, acute viral hepatitis, untreated autoimmune hepatitis, or chronic hepatitis B or C on viral therapy.</criteria>
