	<brief_title>RFS - Radiofrequency Perforator Vein Treatment Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that patients who have competent great saphenous vein (GSV) and short saphenous vein (SSV) or have undergone prior successful endovenous treatment of an incompetent GSV and/or SSV but continue to demonstrate clinical symptoms of peripheral venous insufficiency resulting from incompetent perforator veins (IPVs) will improve the immediate treatment outcomes from successive radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of IPVs veins.</detailed_description>
	<mesh_term>Venous Insufficiency</mesh_term>

Status verified by pregnancy test via blood or urine for women ≤ 55 years old. Having a medical condition, serious intercurrent illness, or extenuating circumstance that would significantly decrease study compliance, including all required study followup Have any condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would jeopardize the safety of the patient or affect the validity of the trial results Have a history of excessive alcohol consumption or any use of illegal drugs rendering the patient unreliable, or at risk during this trial Have undergone major surgery which may result in abnormalities of the target body area, reasonably suspected to compromise the study outcomes Have undergone an invasive procedure of the target body area (e.g., needle biopsy or surgical procedure) within 30 days of enrollment into this study Known incompatibility, such as an allergic reaction to anesthetics to be used in the incompetent perforator vein treatment Patients requiring hyperbaric therapy involving the treated limb during the 6 month post treatment followup period Great toe pressure measurement of ≤ 70 mmHg CEAP 6 classified patients receiving high dose steroid medication or the following medications that interfere with normal mechanisms of wound healing, e.g. glucocorticoids, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), antineoplastic and immunosuppressive drugs, and others like, colchicine and penicillamine.
