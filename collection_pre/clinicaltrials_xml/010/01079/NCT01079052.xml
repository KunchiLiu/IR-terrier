	<brief_title>A Relative Bioavailability Study of 20 mg Famotidine Tablets Under Fed Condition</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Following an overnight fast of at least 10 hours, all subjects were served a high-fat high-calorie breakfast. Thirty minutes after the start of the breakfast, subjects were administered a single oral dose of famotidine tablets, USP 20 mg or Pepcid® AC Acid reducer famotidine tablets 20 mg (containing famotidine 20 mg) under low-light condition during each period of the study, along with 240 mL of drinking water at ambient temperature and under supervision of trained study personnel. During the course of the study, safety parameters assessed were vital signs, clinical examination, medical history and clinical laboratory safety tests (hematology, biochemical parameters, serology and urine analysis) at baseline. Adverse event monitoring was done throughout the study. Laboratory parameters of hematology and biochemistry (except blood glucose and cholesterol) were repeated at the end of the study for all the subjects.</detailed_description>
