	<brief_title>Outcome After Lumbar Epidural Steroid Injection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We will measure levels of the protein complex in the epidural space of patients undergoing lumbar ESI for radiculopathy with HNP. We assess functional outcomes at baseline and after treatment with the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36 instrument (SF-36). Our hypothesis was that the complex is present in patients with clinically significant functional improvement after ESI.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Acute onset of sensory symptoms with the primary complaint as pain as well as varying sensory symptoms (e.g. tingling, numbness) in one or more lumbar nerve root distributions Positive physical exam findings including sensory findings consistent with a spinal nerve root, a positive straight leg raise test, and/or a diminished patellar or Achilles DTR consistent with sensory symptoms; AND MRI of lumbar spine positive for HNP in a distribution correlating with physical examination Plain radiography demonstrating severe loss of disc height, high grade DDD, spondylolisthesis greater than grade I A history of prior lumbar surgery or trauma, weakness in a consistent distribution (nonprogressive with strength at least 4/5) Red flags including progressive weakness, bowel/bladder complaints, radiographic unknown mass, unexpected weight loss; AND Diagnosis of inflammatory arthritides, crystalline arthropathies, or other rheumatologic diseases</criteria>
