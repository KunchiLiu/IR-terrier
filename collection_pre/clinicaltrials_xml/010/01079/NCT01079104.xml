	<brief_summary>Patients with hepatic dysfunction are known to have a high mortality rate. Hepa Wash(R) is a newly developed liver and renal support system that is based on the use of recycled albumin dialysate. The new system has shown a high detoxification capacity in in-vitro and preclinical studies. The aim of the study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the Hepa Wash system in patients with hepatic dysfunction in the intensive care unit.</brief_summary>
