	<brief_title>Combination Anticancer Therapy of Paclitaxel and Everolimus for Relapsed or Refractory Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) accounts for 15% to 20% of all lung cancer, and more than half of these patients are diagnosed with extensive-stage disease (ED). SCLC is a particularly aggressive form of lung cancer with a tendency for rapid tumor growth, early dissemination and high frequency of the metastasis In this study, we evaluate the MTD of everolimus combined with paclitaxel combination chemotherapy in SCLC.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed small cell lung cancer 2. Regarding a limited disease, the disease in a patient, who had concurrent chemoradiation therapy before, is relapsed or progressing, the patient should have received the first line platinumbased anticancer therapy. The disease should be progressing/relapsed during or after the previous treatment. 3. Regarding an extensive disease, the progression/relapse of the disease during or after the first line platinumbased anticancer therapy should be confirmed. 4. Patient with asymptomatic or treated brain metastasis. 5. Patients without current concomitant chemotherapy 6. Patients without current concomitant radiotherapy 7. Patients who are not receiving chronic treatment with steroids or another immunosuppressive agent. 8. Patients with at least one measurable lesion according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). 9. Patients aged 18 years or older 10. ECOG performance status 02 11. Adequate organ function as evidenced by the following; Absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1.5 x 109/L; platelets &gt; 100 x 109/L; hemoglobin &gt; 9g/dL; ; total bilirubin ≤1.5 UNL; AST and/or ALT &lt; 5 UNL; creatinine clearance ≥ 50mL/min. 12. Patients who signed and dated the informed consent form prior to specific study procedures. 13. Patients who can comply with the scheduled followup and toxicity management procedure.' 1. Patients with history of treatment with mTOR inhibitors 2. Pregnant with gastrointestinal problem impairing absorption of drugs 3. Patients who could not use appropriate method of contraception 4. Pregnant or feeding patients 5. Other medically ill patients 6. Severe heart/pulmonary disease 7. DM patients 8. Other malignancy except cured skin cancer or uterine cervix carcinoma in situ 9. High cholesterolemia greater than grade 3 10. Patients with symptomatic brain metastasis 11. Chronic hepatitis or liver cirrhosis (patients with HBsAg positive, IgM antiHBc positive or HCV Ab positive) 12. Patients receiving immunosuppressant</criteria>
