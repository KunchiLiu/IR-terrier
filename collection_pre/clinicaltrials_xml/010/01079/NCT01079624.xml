	<brief_summary>Academic phase 1 study which investigates the effects of the two incretin hormones glucose-insulinotropic peptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) on gastric emptying, appetite, insulin release and glucose disposal in the body. The hypothesis is that incretin hormones not only stimulate insulin release but also inhibits gastric emptying. This effect can be utilized for further drug development.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Effects of GIP and GLP-1 on gastric emptying, appetite control and insulin release in relation to glucose levels in the bloodstream. Infusions of GIP and GLP-1 are given under simultaneous gastric emptying study and appetite questionnaires and blood sampling for analysis of insulin, glucose, and other gut hormones such as glucagon, ghrelin, and PYY, as well as those administered, GIP and GLP-1.</detailed_description>
