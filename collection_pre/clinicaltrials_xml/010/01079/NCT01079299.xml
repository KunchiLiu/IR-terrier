	<brief_summary>This is a randomized, controlled, parallel group, open label, clinical trial to evaluate the effectiveness of intermittent, gradient, pneumatic compression (IPC)on the healing of venous ulcers in subjects diagnosed with chronic secondary lymphedema. Time to complete healing, healing rates, edema, wound pain, granulation tissue, and wound exudate (type and amount) will be compared between the IPC-treated group (IPC plus standard compression)and control (standard compression alone).</brief_summary>
