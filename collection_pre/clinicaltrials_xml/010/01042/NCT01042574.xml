	<brief_summary>This study is a single-arm, open label protocol evaluating the use of Cleviprex to rapidly control hypertension in patients who present with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) or subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), and that require ICP monitoring via ventriculostomy (External Ventricular Drain or EVD).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Efficacy and Safety of Cleviprex in Ventriculostomy Patients Requiring IV Antihypertensive Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Inclusion Criteria: The study population will be comprised of men and non-pregnant women age 18 years or older presenting with ICH or SAH that require ICP monitoring via ventriculostomy, and that require IV antihypertensive therapy to a) reduce the risk re-bleeding in SAH and b) reduce the risk of hematoma expansion over time due to further bleeding. This study population will require rapid and sustained tight control of blood pressure between 110 to 140 mmHg. Subjects may be included in the study if they meet all of the following criteria: 1. Age 18 years or older 2. Patient presentation with ICH or SAH, and that require ICP monitoring via ventriculostomy drain. 3. Baseline systolic blood pressure (immediately prior to initiation of Cleviprex) &gt;160 mmHg measured 4. Requires IV antihypertensive therapy to achieve SBP 110 - 140 mmHg 5. Patients with a life expectancy of &gt; 5 hours. 6. Written informed consent from the patient or their legal representative before initiation of any study specific procedures Exclusion Criteria: Subjects will be excluded from the study if any of the following exclusion criteria apply prior to enrollment: 1. Receipt of an oral antihypertensive within 2 hours prior to initiation of Cleviprex 2. Receipt of IV nicardipine 3. Glasgow coma score (GCS) of &lt;5 and fixed dilated pupils 4. Expectation that the patient will not tolerate or require &gt; 5 hours of concurrent Cleviprex treatment and ICP monitoring 5. Known or suspected aortic dissection 6. Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) on presentation 7. Positive pregnancy test , known pregnancy or nursing mother 8. Intolerance or allergy to calcium channel blockers 9. Allergy to soybean oil or egg lecithin 10. Known liver failure, cirrhosis or pancreatitis 11. Defective lipid metabolism 12. Severe aortic stenosis 13. Prior directives against advanced life support 14. Participation in other clinical research studies involving the evaluation of investigational drugs or devices within 30 days of enrollment Patients excluded for any of the above reasons may be re-screened for participation at any time if the exclusion characteristic has changed.</detailed_description>
