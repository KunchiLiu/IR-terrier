	<brief_summary>"Testing Adaptive Physical Activity in Stroke" tests the idea that adaptive physical activity (APA) will improve fitness, balance and walking function, daily step activity, and outcomes related to quality of life in individuals with chronic stroke. Adaptive physical activity is an exercise model that combines aerobic exercise with balance and gait training in a socially reinforcing group setting. Individualized homework assignments encourage integration of exercise into daily life routines. Our specific aims are: 1. to determine whether APA improves cardiovascular fitness and metabolic health 2. to measure the effects of APA on gait and balance, ambulatory activity, and ADL function 3. to determine whether APA affects self-reported outcomes related to self-efficacy, fatigue, and stroke-specific quality of life</brief_summary>
