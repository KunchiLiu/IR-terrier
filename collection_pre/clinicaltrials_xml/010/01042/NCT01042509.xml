	<brief_title>Combination of Alemtuzumab and Rituximab at Low-doses in Refractory Chronic Graft-Versus-Host Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is the most common long-term complication in patients who underwent allogeneic transplantation. First-line therapy for chronic GVHD is based on immunosuppressive agents (usually cyclosporine and corticosteroids) achieving satisfactory response in around 30% of patients. There is no ideal second-line treatment for chronic GVHD; however, numerous studies have been published with therapeutic options such as alemtuzumab (anti-CD52) and rituximab (anti-CD20). This is a prospective, longitudinal, nonrandomized study in which alemtuzumab and rituximab will be administered at low-doses to patients with refractory chronic GVHD. Clinical response will be evaluated based on the Working Group Report 2006, published by the National Institute of Health Consensus. Follow-up sessions will be weekly for four weeks, every two weeks until achieve response, and finally every four weeks.</detailed_description>
