	<brief_summary>Background and aims: Old patients seldom reach energy requirements. The effects of an oleic-acid rich formula on energy intake and appetite were studied. Methods: Recently admitted geriatric patients (n=71), likely to stay more than 1 week were randomised to receive a fat emulsion (Calogen, intervention group (IG)) or to standard care (control group (CG)). Thirty ml of the emulsion were given 3 times daily, i.e. 420 kcal, and was distributed at the regular medication rounds. Food intake and self-rated appetite were registered 2-3 days after admission and on day 8 or the day prior to discharge. Nutritional risk screening (NRS) 2002 and serum lipids and fatty acid profiles were analysed.</brief_summary>
