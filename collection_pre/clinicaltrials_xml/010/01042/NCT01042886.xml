	<brief_summary>The PILI 'Ohana CBPR partnership implemented a pilot study to determine whether a Family plus Community focused intervention will improve weight loss maintenance compared to Standard follow-up in overweight/obese Native Hawaiian (NH) and other Pacific People (PP) adults (&gt; 18 yr. old) after receiving a standard individual-focused behavioral intervention. The primary hypothesis was that overweight/obese NH and PP adults that undergo a combined family-focused plus community-focused intervention vs. a standard follow-up after receiving a standard individual-focused behavioral intervention will have significantly higher rates of weight loss maintenance.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PILI 'Ohana Project: Partnerships to Overcome Obesity Disparities in Hawaii (3-Year Pilot)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The long term mission of the PILI 'Ohana Program is to integrate community wisdom and expertise with scientific methods to conduct research on health disparities with a specific emphasis on obesity in NHs and PPs. Recognizing that recent advances in medicine such as the reduction of cardiovascular disease mortality and the prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus, have not translated into benefits for all sectors of the U.S. population, especially ethnic and racial minority populations, the PILI 'Ohana Program aims to address this gap through community-academic partnerships focused on interventions to promote change in obesity-related disparities in NH and PP communities. One of the scientific goals of the PILI 'Ohana Program focused on designing and implementing research activities aimed at completing a pilot intervention study to provide the basis for a more definitive, hypothesis-driven 5-year research study in the future.</detailed_description>
