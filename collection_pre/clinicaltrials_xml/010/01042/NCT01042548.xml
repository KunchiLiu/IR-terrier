	<brief_summary>The current study is a case control study involving comparisons of tissue interstitial fluid from breast cancer and adjacent non-cancerous tissue as well as that from benign breast lesion and its adjacent non-diseased tissue for a distinguishable breast cancer profile. The purpose of this research is to collect fresh breast nodule/cancer and surrounding non-cancerous tissue for proteomic studies of the interstitial fluid to identify a profile distinguishing breast cancer which will also permit future research on stored interstitial fluid, blood or tissue samples. Specific markers identified from interstitial fluid study will be investigated in blood samples to develop serum markers for breast cancer diagnosis and prognosis. Additionally, we will perform both prospective and retrospective research on breast cancer involving clinical, demographic, epidemiologic information, treatment, follow-up and outcomes on breast nodule/cancer cases collected.</brief_summary>
