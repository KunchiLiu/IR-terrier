	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the prevention of cardiovascular disease by moderate cholesterol lowering therapy, pitavastatin 1mg/day or aggressive cholesterol lowering therapy, pitavastatin 4mg/day in patients with stable coronary artery disease.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomized Evaluation of Aggressive or Moderate Lipid Lowering Therapy With Pitavastatin in Coronary Artery Disease (REAL-CAD)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It was already demonstrated by previous clinical trials that statins lower the incidence of death and cardiovascular events in patients with coronary artery disease. However, whether aggressive cholesterol lowering therapy, using high dosage of statins, is more effective than moderate cholesterol lowering therapy for the prevention of cardiovascular events in patients with coronary artery disease has not been studied in Japan.</detailed_description>
