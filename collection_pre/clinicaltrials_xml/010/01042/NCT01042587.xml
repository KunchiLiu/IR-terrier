	<brief_title>Effect of Bright Light Treatment On Elders In a Long Term Care Environment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bright light therapy has been shown to improve depression and insomnia in multiple studies. These are common conditions among elders, particularly those residing in long term care environments. Bright light therapy has been inadequately studied in the geriatric population. We will show that a groups of twenty elders can simultaneous be exposed to bright light and that it will result in improvements in multiple realms of behavior and quality of life. Elders will be tested with a number of neuropsychological test batteries prior to exposure to bright light and again at the end of a four week exposure. Some subjects will have daytime and night time activity levels monitored with actigraphy. Cortisol and melatonin levels will be obtained prior to and at the end of the exposure period.</detailed_description>
