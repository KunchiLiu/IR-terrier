	<brief_summary>NAVA used the electrical activity of the diaphragm (EAdi) to initiate and deliver in proportion of an inspiratory assistance. During inspiration, EAdi signal occurred earlier than airflow or pressure variations in the airway. The investigators hypothesized that NAVA improved patient-ventilator synchrony and reduced inspiratory workload as compared with pressure support ventilation delivered at two different cycling criteria (25 and 50 %).</brief_summary>
