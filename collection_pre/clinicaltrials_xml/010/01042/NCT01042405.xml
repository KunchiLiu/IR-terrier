	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to develop a simple computer program, evaluating nutritional status of HD patients. The programming will enable to perform a nutritional screening, based on biochemical measures, taken as part of HD patients' routine care every month. The program will identify patients at risk of malnutrition, define the degree of malnutrition, and identify patients who at risk for increased morbidity and mortality.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>30 patients will randomly be selected for SGA examination and comparison to the MARK results every month. Frequency and duration of hospitalizations within the 5-month collection period will documented, mortality will be documented as well. Effect of different nutritional supplementations or IDPN will be assessed. The MARK nutrition screening will be used for all patients at the beginning of every month. Monthly Biochemical data using a blood sample taken immediately before dialysis will be used to calculate a value between 0-100 showing patient's monthly nutritional status. Data for the SGA will be collected for the same dialysis patients randomly selected at the same month. The nutritional state of the patients according to the SGA will be assessed by two investigators. A statistical test will be held for agreement between observers (Cohen's k concordant coefficient).</detailed_description>
