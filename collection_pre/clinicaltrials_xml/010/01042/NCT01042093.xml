	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare different medication combinations used in a periarticular injection after total knee replacement surgery(TKR). A periarticular injection is an injection that is given into the tissues surrounding the knee joint. The injection is given while the patient is still in surgery. The study will compare the level of pain management, length of hospital stay, range of motion and side effects from subjects receiving one of four different combinations of medication in a periarticular injection. The medications used in the injections are approved medications routinely used for pain management. Approximately 160 subjects will participate in this study. The surgeon, study personnel, and patients will be blinded to the combination of medications each patient receives. The pharmacist will prepare the 4 different combinations of medications, randomize each patient to the particular combination of medications, and maintain the study drug documentation.</brief_summary>
