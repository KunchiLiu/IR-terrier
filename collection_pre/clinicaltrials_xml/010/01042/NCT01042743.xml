	<brief_summary>The recent introduction of robotic surgical system has revolutionized the field of minimally invasive surgery. The investigators hypothesized that adoption of a robotic surgical system for patients with right-side colon cancer seems appealing because This system provides high-definition three-dimensional vision, eliminates physiologic tremor, and better ergonomics. This randomized controlled trial was designed to determine the safety and efficacy of robotic right hemicolectomy in comparison with laparoscopic right hemicolectomy.</brief_summary>
