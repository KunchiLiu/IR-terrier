	<brief_summary>This randomized phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of vaccine therapy and to see how well it works when given together with 1-methyl-D-tryptophan (1-MT) in treating patients with metastatic breast cancer. Vaccines made from a person's tumor cells and white blood cells may help the body build an effective immune response to kill tumor cells.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy and 1-MT in Treating Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and safety using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0, of the combination Ad.p53 DC vaccine (adenovirus-p53 transduced dendritic cell vaccine) plus 1-MT in patients with any solid malignancy that has mutated p53 by immunohistochemistry (IHC). (Phase I) II. To determine efficacy (objective response rate) of the combination Ad.p53 DC vaccine plus 1-MT in metastatic breast cancer patients whose tumor expresses mutated p53 by IHC. (Phase II) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To collect preliminary data on and study the p53 specific interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISPOT) measurement at baseline, week 7 and week 16. (Phase I) II. To collect preliminary data on and study the percentage of p53 specific IFN-gamma ELISPOT responders at week 7 and 16. (Phase II) III. To collect preliminary data on and study progression-free survival on the study treatment. (Phase II) IV. To collect preliminary data on and study response and progression-free survival on the subsequent chemotherapy if administered. (Phase II) V. To collect preliminary data on and study the effects of 1-methyl-D-tryptophan (1-MT) on serum kynurenine, serum tryptophan, C reactive protein, and circulating T-regulatory cells (clusters of differentiation (CD)4+ 25+ CD127low forkhead box P3+ (FoxP3+)) by flow cytometry at each vaccination point on study when compared their corresponding baseline. (Phase II) OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose escalation study followed by a phase II study. Patients receive adenovirus-p53 transduced dendritic cell vaccine intradermally (ID) in weeks 1, 3, 5, and 10, and then every 3 weeks for 6 total doses. Patients also receive 1-methyl-d-tryptophan orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21. Treatment with 1-methyl-d-tryptophan repeats every 28 days (patients with stable disease) for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4 weeks.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>In the phase I patients with any solid tumor positive for p53 by IHC (&gt;= 5% of cells with any degree of nuclear staining) staining; for the phase II, patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed metastatic invasive breast cancer that is positive for p53 staining by IHC (&gt;= 5% of cells with any degree of nuclear staining); patients will sign a separate consent for the p53 testing, and those that meet the above requirements will then be allowed to sign the vaccine trial consent Patients must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as &gt;= 20 mm with conventional techniques or as &gt;= 10 mm with spiral computed tomography (CT) scan There are no restrictions on prior therapies for the phase I part of the trial; for the phase II, patients may have received up to 2 prior lines of chemotherapy (not counting endocrine therapy lines) with the last dose of chemotherapy given 3 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas and mitomycin C) prior to initiation on this study Life expectancy of greater than 4 months Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status =&lt; 1 (Karnofsky &gt;= 70%) Leukocytes &gt;= 3,000/μL Absolute neutrophil count &gt;= 1,500/μL Platelets &gt;= 100,000/μL Total bilirubin within normal institutional limits unless patient has Gilbert's disease Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) /serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) /alanine aminotransferase (ALT) /serum glutamic pyruvate transaminase (SGPT) =&lt; 2.5 X institutional upper limit of normal Creatinine within normal institutional limits OR creatinine clearance &gt;= 60 mL/min/1.73 m^2 for patients with creatinine levels above institutional normal Thyroidstimulating hormone (TSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), folliclestimulating hormone (FSH), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) showing normal pituitary function; these values may deviate if in the opinion of the investigator these are normal pituitary responses to another endocrine condition such as suboptimally treated hypothyroidism Patients with known brain metastases will only be eligible after their tumors have been treated with definitive resection and/or radiotherapy and they are neurologically stable for at least 1 month off steroids No history of gastrointestinal disease causing malabsorption or obstruction such as but not limited to Crohn's disease, celiac sprue, tropical sprue, bacterial overgrowth/blind loop syndrome, gastric bypass surgery, strictures, adhesions, achalasia, bowel obstruction, or extensive small bowel resection Sexually active women of childbearing potential must agree to use two forms of contraception (hormonal and barrier method of birth control or abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation; males should use barrier contraception or abstinence during the study; use of contraception or abstinence should continue for a minimum of 1 month after completion of the study; should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should discontinue the study drug and inform her treating physician immediately; a pregnancy test is required prior to study enrollment and monthly while on treatment with 1MT for all women of childbearing potential; also men should be discouraged from fathering children while on treatment Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 3 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 3 weeks earlier Patients may not receive any other investigational agents or chemotherapy to treat their underlying malignancy while on study; patients who are stable on prior endocrine therapies (i.e. aromatase inhibitors, tamoxifen, and fulvestrant) may stay on these treatments Patients with known untreated brain metastases are excluded from this clinical trial; patients with stable previously treated lesions in a patient off steroids and radiation for 1 month are not excluded History of allergic reactions (significant urticaria, angioedema, anaphylaxis) attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to 1methylDtryptophan;
