	<brief_title>Study to Evaluate the Pharmacokinetic Characteristics of CKD-4101 (Mycophenolate Mofetil) Tablet</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Healthy volunteers are administrated single-dose over the period I and II (Crossover) of CKD-4101 1000mg and Mycophenolate mofetil capsule 1000mg. Every time before and after each medication, PK parameters and safety of CKD-4101 tablet and Mycophenolate mofetil capsule is performed using a blood sample and conducting some tests respectively.</detailed_description>
