	<brief_title>A Phase 4, Single-Blind, Randomized, Study to Compare the Tolerability and Efficacy of 0.1% Tazorac Cream When Used in Combination With Either Duac Gel or Acanya Gel for the Treatment of Facial Acne Vulgaris</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a single-blind (investigator-blinded), randomized, parallel group, single center study to evaluate the tolerability and efficacy of combination therapy with Duac Gel/Tazorac Cream and Acanya Gel/Tazorac Cream for the treatment of facial acne vulgaris. Approximately 40 male and female subjects will be enrolled (20 per study group). Subjects will participate in the study for 12 weeks; visits will be scheduled at baseline and at weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 (total of 6 visits). Eligible subjects will be randomized at baseline to 1 of the 2 study groups in a 1:1 ratio (Duac Gel/Tazorac Cream to Acanya Gel/Tazorac Cream). Subjects will apply either Duac Gel or Acanya Gel to the face each morning and apply Tazorac Cream to the face each evening. Tolerability will be evaluated through subject assessments of burning/stinging, itching, and oiliness and through investigator assessments of peeling, erythema, and dryness. In addition, subjects will evaluate their overall skin comfort and record the usage of moisturizer and sunscreen, if needed. Efficacy will be assessed through lesion counts (total, inflammatory and noninflammatory) and ISGA. Safety will be assessed by evaluating adverse events (AEs), concomitant medication use, and withdrawals from the study. This is an investigator-blinded study; therefore, subjects and study-center staff will not be blinded to study treatment allocation. Subjects (and parents or legal guardians) and study-center staff will be instructed not to reveal study product allocation to the investigator.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Documented diagnosis of acne vulgaris. Lesion count: 20 to 50 inflammatory (papules and pustules) and 30 to 100 noninflammatory (open and closed comedones) facial lesions excluding nose, and ≤ 1 small nodular lesion. Cystic lesions are not allowed at baseline. Investigator Static Global Assessment of 3 or 4 at Baseline. Clinically relevant finding at baseline or medical history of severe systemic diseases or diseases of the facial skin, other than acne vulgaris. Subjects with cystic acne lesions. Facial hair that may obscure the accurate assessment of acne grade. History or presence of regional enteritis or inflammatory bowel disease (eg, ulcerative colitis, pseudomembranous colitis, chronic diarrhea, celiac disease or a history of antibioticassociated colitis) or similar symptoms. Concurrent use of medications known to be photosensitizers (eg, thiazides, tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones, phenothiazines, and sulfonamides) because of the possibility of increased phototoxicity. Concomitant use of neuromuscular blocking agents. Clindamycin has neuromuscular blocking activities, which may enhance the action of other neuromuscular blocking agents. Use of topical antiacne medications (eg, benzoyl peroxide, retinoids, azelaic acid, resorcinol, salicylates, sulfacetamide sodium and derivatives, and glycolic acid) within the past 2 weeks. Use of topical antibiotics on the face within the past 2 weeks or systemic antibiotics within the past 4 weeks. Use of topical corticosteroids on the face or systemic corticosteroids within the past 2 to 4 weeks, respectively. Use of inhaled, intraarticular or intra lesional (other than for facial acne lesions) steroids is acceptable. Use of systemic retinoids, such as Isotretinoin, within the past 6 months. Concomitant use of the following types of facial products: astringents, toners, abradants, hair removal wax, facials, peels containing glycolic or other acids, masks, washes or soaps containing benzoyl peroxide, sulfacetamide sodium or salicylic acid, nonmild facial cleansers, or moisturizers that contain retinol, salicylic acid, or α or β hydroxy acids. Concomitant use of medications that are reported to exacerbate acne, (eg, vitamins such as vitamin D, vitamin A, vitamins B2, B6, B12; haloperidol, halogens such as iodide and bromide, lithium, cyclosporine, psoralen, sirolimus, imatinib, aripiprazole, isoniazid, valproate acid, hydantoin, and phenobarbital) as these may impact efficacy assessments. Iron supplements and folate are acceptable. Facial procedures (eg, chemical peel, lasers/lights, photodynamic therapy, microdermabrasion, artificial ultraviolet therapy) performed by an esthetician, beautician, physician, nurse, or other practitioner, within the past 4 weeks. Known hypersensitivity or previous allergic reaction to any component(s) or excipient(s) of the study products. Use of any investigational medications or treatments within the past 4 weeks. Treatment with estrogens, including oral, implanted and topical contraceptives, androgens, or antiandrogenic agents for 12 weeks or less immediately prior to starting study product and have not been prescribed for the treatment of Acne Vulgaris. Subjects that have been treated with estrogens, as described above, androgens, or anti androgenic agents for more than 12 consecutive weeks prior to start of study treatment are allowed to enroll as long as they do not expect to change dose, medication, or discontinue use during the study. Evidence of recent alcohol or drug abuse (in the opinion of the investigator). Live in the same household as currently enrolled subjects. Employee of the investigator, a clinical research organization, or Stiefel Laboratories who is involved in the study or an immediate family member (eg, partner, offspring, parents, siblings or sibling's offspring) of an employee involved in the study.</criteria>
