	<brief_summary>The study involves approximately 105 adolescent (ages 12-17) subjects to be screened at 4 sites across the US. All subjects enrolled will treat up to 4 MILD migraines over a 6 month period. They will be required to have three office visits during the six months. All subjects will be randomized to either Treximet (85mg Imitrex/500mg Naproxen Sodium) or Placebo (sugar-pill) in four of the five treatment arms with a 3 to 1 ratio. A fifth treatment arm will treat all 4 migraines with active drug, Treximet. The hypothesis is that Treximet will prove to be a safe and effective treatment for this population, that has so few treatment for migraine. And Treximet will be superior over placebo for pain free endpoints at 2 and 24 hours.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>There are two primary treatment comparisons for this study: 1) the percentage of subjects' pain free at 2 hours after treatment with TREXIMET versus placebo across attacks, and 2) the percentage of subjects who are sustained pain free at 24 hours after treatment with TREXIMET versus placebo across attacks. The following alternative hypothesis will be tested to see if there is a difference in the proportion of subjects who are pain free at 2 hours with TREXIMET versus placebo at all attacks, OR there is a difference in the proportion of subjects who are sustained pain free at 24 hours with TREXIMET versus placebo at all attacks.</detailed_description>

Subject has secondary headaches i.e. complex migraine, hemiplegic, or basilar. 4. Subject, in investigators opinion is likely to have unrecognized cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease. 5. Subject has uncontrolled hypertension at screening or is taking an angiotensinconverting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker. 6. Subject has a history of congenital heart disease, cardiac arrhythmias requiring medication, or a history of a clinically significant electrocardiogram abnormality that, in the investigator's opinion, contraindicates participation in the study. 7. Subject has evidence or history of any ischemic vascular diseases including: ischemic heart disease, ischemic abdominal syndromes, peripheral vascular disease, or signs/symptoms consistent with the above. 8. Subject has a evidence or history of central nervous system pathology including stroke and/or transient ischemic attacks (TIAs), epilepsy or structural brain lesions which lower the convulsive threshold, or has been treated with an antiepileptic drug for seizure control within 5 years prior to screening. 9. Subject has a history of impaired hepatic or renal function that, in the investigator's opinion, contraindicates participation in this study. 10. Subject has a hypersensitivity, allergy, intolerance, or contraindication to the use any triptan, NSAID, or aspirin (including all sumatriptan and naproxen preparations) or has nasal polyps or asthma. 11. Subject has used an ergot medication in the previous three months for migraine prophylaxis or is taking a medication that is not stabilized for at least two months for either chronic or intermittent migraine prophylaxis or other comorbid condition. 12.
