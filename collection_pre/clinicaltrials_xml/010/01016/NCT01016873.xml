	<criteria>Patients must have neovascular AMD diagnosed within the previous 3 years, have received at least 3 injections with Lucentis® or Avastin® within the previous year and have the need for treatment with antiVEGF therapy due to increased fluid or persistent cysts on OCT, or leakage on FA. Patients must have a total lesion size of &lt;12 disc areas and a CNV lesion with the greatest linear dimension of &lt;6 mm, but not greater than 3 mm from the center of the fovea to the furthest point on the lesion perimeter. The distance from the center of the fovea to the nearest edge of the optic disc should be not less than 3 mm. Patients must Patient must be at least 50 years of age. Women must be postmenopausal ≥1 year or surgically sterilized, or a pregnancy screen must be performed prior to the study and a reliable form of contraception approved by the investigator must be maintained during the study. Patient must have best corrected visual acuity of 75 to 25 letters in the study eye and at least 20 letters in the fellow eye. CNV due to causes other than AMD, including ocular histoplasmosis syndrome, angioid streaks, multifocal choroiditis, choroidal rupture, or pathologic myopia (spherical equivalent ≥ 8 diopters). An axial length of ≤20 mm or ≥26 mm. Previously diagnosed with Diabetes Mellitus and/or an HbA1c of &gt;6.5%, and with retinal findings consistent with diabetic retinopathy. Prior or concurrent therapies for age related macular degeneration including submacular surgery, subfoveal thermal laser photocoagulation (with or without photographic evidence), transpupillary thermotherapy (TTT), ocular photodynamic therapy, radiation therapy to the head or neck in the study eye. Previous posterior vitrectomy, or any surgery in the study eye within 6 months or YAG capsulotomy within 3 months prior to the screening visit.</criteria>
