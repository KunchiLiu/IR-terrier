	<brief_summary>Background: Identification of new biomarkers with potential predictive and prognostic role has contributed unequivocally to breast cancer treatment. Although traditionally endocrine therapy is based on hormonal receptors status (estrogen - ER and progesterone- PR), some patients become hormone resistant. In order to identify a possible profile associated to hormonal resistance, some biomarkers have been assessed after short period primary hormone therapy (HT). Objectives: To compare the expression of Ki-67, Bcl2, Bax, Bak, ER and e PR in postmenopausal women with ER positive invasive ductal carcinomas (IDC), prior and after tamoxifen and anastrozole in short term hormone therapy.</brief_summary>
