	<brief_summary>This study is being done to gather data that will be used to compare two different TAC (Temporary Abdominal Closure) methods that your doctor may use. The two TAC methods being compared are the Barker's vacuum packing technique or BVPT and the Open Abdomen Negative Pressure Therapy System (ABThera) developed by the sponsor of this research (KCI, San Antonio, TX). The BVPT is made up of supplies that are stocked in most surgery rooms. The ABThera dressing is available commercially. Neither method will be supplied to the doctor (Principal Investigator), so that in no way would the subject's standard of care be different from what they would get if the study was not being done. This study is observational and only collects data about how the subject progresses after surgery TAC is used. When a study is observational it means that the subject's standard medical care will not be altered in any way, simply watched. The doctor will not change treatment of your open abdomen.</brief_summary>
