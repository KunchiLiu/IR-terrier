	<brief_title>Stem Cell Factor (SCF) Priming of Haematopoietic Stem Cell Grafts in Malignant Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Autologous stem cell transplantation is used to support high dose chemotherapy in haematological malignancies.1-2 Peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC) have replaced bone marrow cells as the preferred source for transplantation due to faster blood cell recovery.3-4 One variable of major impact for posttransplant care is the number of PBPC harvested.5-8 Therefore, several clinical studies have aimed to identify priming regimens that improve progenitor and stem cell mobilizations and collections without increased toxicity. Frequently, Filgrastim (r-met HuG-CSF) is administrated alone; however, Filgrastim combined with chemotherapy has proven more effective in context of CD34+ cell numbers harvested9-11 and this combination is considered the gold standard for priming and stem cell mobilization in relapsed malignant lymphoma. Stem cell factor (SCF) is a glycoprotein growth factor that acts on haematopoietic blood cell progenitors.12 Whereas SCF alone exerts little colony-stimulating activity on normal human bone marrow cells in vitro, combination of SCF with other recombinant haematopoietic cytokines results in a synergistic increase in numbers of colonies.13 In vivo, the addition of SCF to G-CSF (Filgrastim) synergistically increases PBPC mobilization compared to Filgrastim alone.14-17 Several clinical trials have reported the ability of the combination of SCF with Filgrastim to mobilize PBPC in patients with lymphoma, multiple myeloma, breast and ovarian cancers even in heavily pretreated patients.18-26 Priming using chemotherapy is toxic and costly11 and new priming procedures need to be established, which is the background for this randomized pilot study. The hypothesis is that elimination of chemotherapy from the priming regimen may decrease the overall toxicity and the ability to collect a sufficient autograft which, however, may be circumvented by adding r-metHuSCF (Ancestim) to the priming regimen. The aim of this randomized phase II trial was to evaluate safety, toxicity and efficacy of growth factors in lymphoma patients considered candidates for high dose chemotherapy.</detailed_description>
