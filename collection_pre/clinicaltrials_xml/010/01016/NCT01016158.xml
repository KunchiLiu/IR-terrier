	<brief_summary>In the present study, the investigators investigated the efficacy of umbilical cord serum eye drops for the treatment of patients with recurrent corneal erosions. Group A were treated with 20% umbilical cord serum eye drops 3 to 4 times a day in addition to artificial tears, and group B were treated with artificial tears only. Ophthalmic examinations including visual acuity measurement and slit lamp biomicroscopy were performed before and every month after treatment. Recurrence was defined as the presence of clinical symptoms accompanied by epithelial defects in the cornea.</brief_summary>
