	<brief_summary>People with pancreatic cancer that cannot be cured by surgery are being asked to participate in this study. The purpose of this study is to test the ability of the radiation oncologists to administer Cyberknife therapy along with Gemcitabine chemotherapy for patients with pancreatic cancer. Radiation and Gemcitabine are both effective at killing cancer cells but they generally cannot be given at the same time. Cyberknife therapy is highly focused radiation that is being used extensively at Georgetown University and around the United States to treat a number of cancers. It is believed that because Cyberknife is so highly focused it can be given safely with regular doses of chemotherapy to attack cancer cells in two ways at the same time. This research is being done because it is not known if using Cyberknife with chemotherapy will be a safe way to treat pancreatic cancer.</brief_summary>
