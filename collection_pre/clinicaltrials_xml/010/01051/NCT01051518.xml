	<brief_summary>The investigation concerns a prospective, multicenter, single arm safety and performance study evaluating the Medtronic CoreValve system. Approximately 120 patients presenting with symptomatic aortic native valve stenosis necessitating valve replacement which are considered poor surgical candidates, with a high surgical risk, as attested to by both the surgeon and the cardiologist are recruited in the study. Safety and performance will be evaluated at discharge and at 30 days post-procedure. Valve performance and placement will be followed up at 3 and 6 months post-procedure. Further long-term patient follow-up visits will be performed at 12, 24, 36 and 48 months post-procedure.</brief_summary>
