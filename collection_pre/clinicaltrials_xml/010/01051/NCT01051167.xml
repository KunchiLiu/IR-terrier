	<brief_title>Bi-weekly Cetuximab Combined With 5-fluorouracil/Leucovorin/Oxaliplatin (FOLFOX-6) in Metastatic Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For years the effective treatment of advanced colorectal carcinoma (CRC) was limited to fluorouracil (5-FU). Combination of 5-FU or a 5-FU analog with oxaliplatin, which has some antitumor activity as a single agent, shows synergistic activity. Combining oxaliplatin with a twice monthly folinic acid/5-FU schedule leads to a further improvement in first-line treatment of advanced CRC thus emerging to a standard regimen in first-line therapy of metastatic CRC. Cetuximab is normally given as a weekly schedule. As recently shown a biweekly schedule with 500 mg/m² instead of the weekly standard regimen (initial dose of 400 mg/m² followed by 250 mg/m² every week) exhibits similar pharmacokinetic results with a comparable efficacy. In order to improve the convenience for the patients, this study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of a bi-weekly combination of cetuximab with FOLFOX. Out of the various FOLFOX regimens the most convenient FOLFOX-6 schedule is chosen for the study, which has been tested before in two studies in combination with the standard weekly schedule of cetuximab. Recent data suggest a decreased efficacy of cetuximab in patients bearing a k-ras mutation in their CRC. Therefore only patients with no evidence for a mutated k-ras gene in the colorectal carcinoma cells will be included in this study.</detailed_description>
