	<brief_summary>The Emergency Department (ED) setting is a unique point of access for reaching underage drinkers (age 14-20). With the aid of computer technology, this study will screen underage drinkers in the ED and fully test promising ED-based brief intervention and 3-month follow-up brief treatment approaches for alcohol misuse. Developing methods to efficiently and effectively optimize these approaches has powerful public health implications for improving outcomes for underage drinkers.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The proposed study will use computerized screening using touchscreen computer tablets with audio (~5,700 patients) and will test a developmentally appropriate, tailored intervention. Specifically, 900 patients aged 14-20 in the ED who screen positive for problematic alcohol use in the past 3 months will be randomized to the combinations of three ED-based conditions: 1) computer brief intervention-CBI; 2) therapist/intervener delivered brief intervention-IBI; or 3) enhanced usual care-EUC. All participants will be randomized to one of two follow-up conditions: 1) adapted motivational enhancement therapy-AMET; or 2) enhanced usual care-EUC that will take place 3 months post-ED. All participants will receive written information regarding community resources; individuals who meet alcohol use disorder criteria will additionally receive substance use treatment referrals. Recognizing that brief interventions are important, but not necessarily sufficient, for change in all adolescents and young adults who misuse alcohol, the primary specific aims of the proposed study will determine the independent effectiveness of immediate "on-the-spot" ED-based brief intervention conditions, 3-month follow-up brief treatment conditions, and combinations of conditions, for decreasing alcohol use and improving health-related outcomes (including injury, mental health, and other risk behaviors) at 6- and 12-months follow-up.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria for screening: (1) Patients age 1420 years presenting to the UMMC ED for medical care (2) ability to provide informed consent. Additional inclusion criteria for intervention based on "alcohol misuse": Participants screening positive on the AUDIT for problematic alcohol use in the past 3 months will be eligible for the randomized control trial. (1) patients who do not understand English (2) patients deemed unable to provide informed consent (e.g., mental incompetence, prisoners); (3) adolescents ages 1417 presenting without a parent/guardian; and (4) patients treated in the ED for suicide attempts or sexual assault.</criteria>
