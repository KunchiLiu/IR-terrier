	<brief_summary>Both simple decompression and anterior transposition of the elbow nerve (ulnar nerve) for acute displaced fractures of the elbow (distal humerus) treated with plate fixation are currently used by surgeons. We want to examine which treatment will overall give better results in regards to arm function and residual pain.</brief_summary>
