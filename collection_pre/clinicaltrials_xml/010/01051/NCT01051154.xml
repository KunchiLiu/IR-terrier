	<brief_title>Effect of Enteral Docosahexaenoic Acid Administration in Children With Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cancer is often associated with malnutrition.The most of children with cancer loss weight, and 50-80% of patients with cancer experience morbidity and mortality as a result of progressive wasting. As a consequence of malnutrition, patients with cancer may have a poorer outcome, reduced effectiveness of chemotherapy and increased risk of chemotherapy-induced toxicity compared to those who are well nourished at diagnosis. On the other hand, in the recent years, there has been increased focus on the role of long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids and their effect on prevention and treatment of several diseases. The results of animal studies and adults with cancer have demonstrated that the consumption of long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids can slow the growth of cancer, increase the efficacy of chemotherapy and reduce loss weight and the side effects of the chemotherapy. Beneficial effects of enteral long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids has been reported in adults with cancer. However, in children with cancer the scientific reports are scarce; therefore, is necessary to evaluate if the long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids administration in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia has the same effects on clinical and nutritional outcomes that have been previously showed by different studies in adults with cancer.</detailed_description>
