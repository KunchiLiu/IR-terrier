	<brief_summary>Previous research studies have shown that depression is associated with changes in structure and activity in different parts of the brain and that antidepressant medication can affect brain activity in different parts of the brain in individuals suffering from depression. The primary purpose of the study is to find out more about how the antidepressant medication duloxetine affects brain activity and structure in individuals with depression.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of the Neurobiology of Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will evaluate participants with depression before treatment is initiated and during treatment, and compare them to a control group of healthy participants. The aim will be to better understand both the neurobiology of depression and how the neurobiology changes in response to treatment of depression and the outcome of treatment. The study will include a variety of assessments of the neurobiology of depression including: scans of brain areas are involved in depression by looking at structures in the brain and how they work and blood tests and how these change in relation to several measures of depression severity.</detailed_description>
