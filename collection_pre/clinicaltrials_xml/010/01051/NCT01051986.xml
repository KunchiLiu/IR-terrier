	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare early and 1-year graft patency rates of saphenous vein composite grafts with those of right internal thoracic artery composite graft and mid-term clinical outcomes in patients who undergo off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting(OPCAB). We also evaluate microscopic findings of saphenous vein graft harvested no touch technique and used as composite graft.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Prospective Randomized Study for Comparison of Y-Composite Grafts</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The SAVERITA trial was designed as a randomized, controlled trial to recruit 224 patients who undergo off-pump coronary artery bypass using Y-composite graft based on the left internal thoracic artery. Patients were randomized by use of a randomization table. Composite conduit was made using saphenous vein or right internal thoracic artery according to the randomization result. The primary end point is to evaluate early and 1-year postoperative graft patency. The secondary end points are overall survival, freedom from cardiac death and freedom from MACCE(major adverse cardiac or cerebrovascular events). In saphenous vein group, 20 remnant saphenous vein specimen was evaluated histologically to compare the difference between composite grafted vein and manually dilated saphenous vein.</detailed_description>
