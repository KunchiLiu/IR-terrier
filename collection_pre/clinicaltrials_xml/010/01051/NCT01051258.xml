	<criteria>Patients must have a diagnosis of advanced emphysema as defined by FEV1/FVC&lt;70% predicted, FEV1 of &lt;50% predicted, TLC &gt; 100% predicted, and RV &gt; 135% predicted. Patients must have persistent symptoms despite medical therapy and either not be candidates for Lung Volume Reduction Surgery (LVRS) or have elected not to undergo LVRS. Patients must be &gt; 40 years of age, have symptoms despite medical therapy, and have none of the prespecified comorbid conditions that could influence study outcomes or their ability to tolerate bronchoscopy.</criteria>
