	<brief_summary>The study will evaluate the safety, tolerability and therapeutic effects (preliminary efficacy) of injection of autologous cultured mesenchymal bone marrow stromal cells secreting neurotrophic factors (MSC-NTF), as a possible treatment for patients with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) at the early and progressive disease stages.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Autologous Cultured Mesenchymal Bone Marrow Stromal Cells Secreting Neurotrophic Factors (MSC-NTF), in ALS Patients.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a single center trial to be conducted at the Department of Neurology &amp; Laboratory of Neuroimmunology, at the Hadassah Hebrew University Medical Center, Jerusalem in Israel. All patients enrolled will have a documented history of ALS disease prior to study enrolment. Patients diagnosed as early stage ALS disease with duration of less than 6 months and patients diagnosed with progressive stage ALS disease with duration of 6-12 months. Overall, 24 patients will be recruited and allocated based on their ALS disease severity to 2 treatment groups: Group A - 12 patients of early ALS disease stage and Group B - 12 patients of progressive ALS disease. Eligible patients will be enrolled into the study and will be observed for every 2 weeks during a "run in period" of 3 months for determination of the progression rate of the disease. During the "run in period" after about 6 weeks following enrollment, patients of both study groups will undergo a Bone Marrow Aspiration procedure and MSC-NTF cells will be produced from the bone marrow aspirate based on Brainstorm Cell Therapeutics Ltd proprietary method. On the last "run in period" visit, patients of both study groups will undergo the treatment and MSC-NTF will be transplanted by IM or IT injection to the early and progressive ALS patients respectively. After the MSC-NTF transplantation patients will be observed on a monthly basis for a post treatment follow up period of 6 months.</detailed_description>
