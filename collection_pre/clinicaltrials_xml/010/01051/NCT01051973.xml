	<brief_summary>The study aims to compare two manualized treatments. They are based on cognitive behavior therapy or stress management. Both treatments are delivered via an internet application and the patients' work with the treatments is supported through online contact with a therapist. The treatments last for 10 weeks. Approximately 200 patients will be included in the study and randomized to either condition. The study hypothesis is that CBT will be superior to stress management on the main outcome measure, which is IBS symptom severity measured over 4 weeks.</brief_summary>
