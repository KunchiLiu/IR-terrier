	<brief_summary>This randomized, single dose, three-way crossover study will evaluate the bioequivalence of two formulations of colchicine, the test product (colchicine 0.6mg Mutual) and a marketed combination product (colchicine 0.5 mg with probenecid 500 mg), administered under fasting conditions. It will also determine the bioavailability following a standard high-fat meal and evaluate the safety and tolerability of the test product.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bioequivalence Study of Colchicine Tablets</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomized, single dose, three-way crossover study will evaluate the bioequivalence of two formulations of colchicine, the test product (colchicine 0.6mg Mutual) and a marketed combination product (colchicine 0.5mg with probenecid 500mg), administered under fasting conditions. It will also determine the bioavailability of the test product following a standard high-fat meal and evaluate the safety and tolerability of the test product. Twenty-eight healthy, non-smoking, non-obese (BMI 81-30 kg/m2 and BW â‰¥110 lbs), 18-45 year old, male and female volunteers will be randomly assigned in a crossover fashion to receive one of three dosing regimens in sequence with washout periods of at least 14 days between dosing periods. After a fast of at least 10 hours, subjects will receive either, one tablet of colchicine 0.6 mg, one tablet of colchicine 0.6 mg after a standardized high-fat,high-calorie breakfast or 0.5mg/500mg colchicine/probenecid. All doses will be given with 240mL of room temperature water. Patients will be confined for at least 15 hours before and 24 hours after each dose with daily outpatient visits over the following 3 days. Blood will be drawn at times sufficient to adequately define the concentration time curves for each dosing regimen, which will be compared to assess the bioequivalence of the reference and test products and the effect of food on the test product. Subjects will also be monitored for adverse events throughout this same period.</detailed_description>
