	<brief_summary>At any given time, 10 million Americans suffer from temporomandibular disorders (TMD), with a lifetime prevalence of 45% and costs for direct care exceeding $2 billion/year. Little evidence exists regarding the efficacy of specific conservative interventions used to treat TMD and currently there is no "gold standard" of care that is widely accepted by the dental or medical community. This study is a prospective, randomized 4 arm parallel observer-masked pilot study comparing: 1) Activator Methods Chiropractic Technique (AMCT), 2) a conservative dental approach with reversible interocclusal splint therapy, 3) a sham AMCT, and 4) a self-care only group, which includes a standard checklist of self-care jaw relaxation techniques, for a total of 80 patients with chronic myofascial TMD.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Conservative Treatment of Patients With Temporomandibular Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All patients will be offered the self-care checklist of homecare approaches at baseline. Patients will be treated for two months with follow up at 3 and 6 months after enrollment. The primary outcome measure will be an 11 point Numerical Rating Scale for average TMD pain during the past week. Secondary outcomes will include the Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-14), believability of the sham AMCT compared to active AMCT, expectations of and satisfaction with care, medication use, bothersomeness of symptoms and health care utilization. Our project is a collaborative effort between the Palmer Center for Chiropractic Research (PCCR) and the University of Iowa (UI) through the College of Dentistry and the General Clinical Research Center (GCRC) Oral and Craniofacial Unit. The PCCR Clinic and Data Core will serve as the data coordinating center and will develop a web-based data collection system for this project. Patient eligibility will be assessed by dental examiners at the UI College of Dentistry using the Research Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders to diagnose chronic, Axis I myofascial TMD. Dental care will be provided by a dentist at UI GCRC and chiropractic care will be provided by a private practitioner in close proximity to UI. The aims of this project are to assess the feasibility of conducting a full-scale randomized clinical trial to evaluate the effectiveness of AMCT for patients with chronic myofascial TMD; determine the most appropriate control group(s) for a full-scale randomized controlled trial; and to estimate the sample size needed for an adequately-powered trial and the recruitment period that would be required. In general, there is a lack of evidence for the efficacy of non-surgical treatment for patients with TMD, including chiropractic interventions. If the beneficial effects of the AMCT are supported in this pilot study, the logistical information gained will allow us to plan a full scale trial for patients suffering pain and disability due to TMD. It is anticipated that such a trial will allow clinicians to make more informed recommendations for treatment of patients with TMD. At the conclusion of this project, we will be well-positioned to prepare an R01 level grant application.</detailed_description>
