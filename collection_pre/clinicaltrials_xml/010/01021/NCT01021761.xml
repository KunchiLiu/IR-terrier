	<brief_summary>Approximately 126 subjects scheduled to undergo cataract surgery by phacoemulsification, will be randomized in an even allocation (1:1:1) to either Acuvail, Xibrom or Nevanac. Subjects will be instructed to begin dosing the study medication in the operative eye the day before surgery and continue dosing on the day of surgery. Beginning one hour before surgery 1 drop of study medication will be instilled by operating room staff approximately every 15 minutes for a total of 3 doses. At the designated time a paracentesis will be performed at the start of the cataract procedure and at least 0.15cc of aqueous humor will be collected. The sample will be immediately stored on dry ice and shipped to a laboratory for analysis.</brief_summary>
