	<brief_summary>A study to evaluate the efficacy of lenalidomide as maintenance therapy after completion of first-line combination chemotherapy in patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) who are not candidates for transplantation and have achieved partial response (PR) or complete response (CR). This study was prematurely terminated by the sponsor in light of new unpublished data that rendered the current design of the study no longer clinically relevant. A study design with the control arm of no active treatment was no longer appropriate. The termination of the trial was not based on any safety concerns in the study.</brief_summary>
