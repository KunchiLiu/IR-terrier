	<brief_summary>The primary purpose of this pilot study is to determine whether African Americans with mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) can be enrolled and retained in a 6-month aerobic exercise-training study.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study will examine the effects of aerobic exercise-training on neurocognitive function, and on cerebral glucose homeostasis. It is yet to be determined whether African Americans with mild AD can be recruited into such a study, nor has the relationship of fitness adaptation to neurocognitive function been systematically examined in this population. In addition to the goal of assessing the intervention effects, the study will evaluate the differential relationships of APOE to aerobic fitness-induced changes in neurocognition. The long-term goal is to explore the mechanism by which fitness adaptation exerts an effect on neurocognition, notably, low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), elevated inflammation (C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukins (IL-1A)), deranged glucose homeostasis, hypertension and endothelia dysfunction are precursors of arteriolosclerosis, decreased cerebral perfusion and oxygen deprivation, all of which may increase AD risk. Because many of these putative AD risk factors are susceptible to lifestyle alterations, the study will also assess their roles in aerobic fitness-related improvements in cognitive function and reduction in AD risk.</detailed_description>
