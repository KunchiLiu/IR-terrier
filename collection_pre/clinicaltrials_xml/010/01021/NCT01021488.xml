	<brief_summary>Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)is devastating disease which influencing the mortality and morbidity of patients at-risk like those undergoing orthopedic surgery. Recent publication suggested HMO-co-A reductase inhibitor (statin) may reduce the occurrence rate of venous thromboembolism in apparently healthy persons. The pleiotropic property of statin like antioxidant, antithrombotic, anti-inflammatory may have effect on the positive results. We are investigating whether rosuvastatin is associated with lower incidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in patients undergoing total knee replacement arthroplasty(TKRA)who are at-high risk for developing DVT</brief_summary>
