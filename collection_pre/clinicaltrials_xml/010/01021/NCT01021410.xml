	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to better understand the pharmacokinetics of acetaminophen and further clinical interpretations of laboratory results that confirm the presence of acetaminophen-cys adducts. This study will determine how long adducts persist in serum after a therapeutic course of acetaminophen as taken in a previous study (COMIRB 06-1265). Subjects will be asked to complete three study visits, each three days apart, following termination of COMIRB 06-1265. Each study visit will include collection of blood samples for batch testing of aminotransferase, serum acetaminophen and protein adducts. No interventions are planned.</brief_summary>
