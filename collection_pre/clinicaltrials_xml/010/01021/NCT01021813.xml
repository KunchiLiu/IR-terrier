	<brief_summary>This study will establish the safety and tolerability of suvorexant (MK-4305) when administered for up to 14 months. Participants will be randomized to receive suvorexant or placebo for a 12-month double-blind (DB) Treatment Phase. Participants who complete the 12-month DB Treatment Phase will enter a 2-month DB Randomized Discontinuation Phase. At the time of initial randomization, participants assigned to receive suvorexant during the initial 12-month Treatment Phase will be simultaneously randomized, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive either suvorexant or placebo during the 2-month Randomized Discontinuation Phase. Participants randomized to receive placebo in the initial 12-month Treatment Phase will continue to receive placebo during the 2-month Randomized Discontinuation Phase. The first 3 nights of the Randomized Discontinuation Phase are referred to as the Run-Out Phase, and will assess rebound and withdrawal.</brief_summary>
