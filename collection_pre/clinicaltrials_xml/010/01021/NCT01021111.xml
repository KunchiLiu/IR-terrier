	<brief_summary>The overall goal of this project is to reduce the risk for anterior cruciate ligament injuries by designing a targeted intervention that will alter the known kinematic and kinetic risk factors associated with ACL injuries. This study will address the following specific aims: 1) To optimize a wearable, targeted, active training feedback device to reduce the risk of ACL injury among healthy subjects by inducing patterns of movement that alter the known kinematic and kinetic risk factors associated with ACL injuries. 2) To evaluate the efficacy of the active device and determine if the device reduces the risk of ACL injury among healthy subjects by effectively inducing patterns of movement that alter the known kinematic and kinetic risk factors associated with ACL injuries.</brief_summary>
