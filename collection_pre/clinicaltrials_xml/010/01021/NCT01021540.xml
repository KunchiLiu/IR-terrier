	<brief_title>Prospective Study Evaluating the Effect of Repository Corticotropin in the Treatment of Various Nephrotic Syndromes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Synthetic ACTH (Synacthen Depot) has been used in the treatment of Nephrotic Syndrome in Europe. It has been proven effective in treating idiopathic membranous nephropathy and other various diagnoses involving the kidneys. However, Synacthen is not available in the United States. The only preparation available is the H.P. Acthar Gel (repository corticotrophin) which has been widely used in the treatment of infantile spasms and has been available longer than Synacthen. Therefore, we are conducting this study to determine if H.P. Acthar Gel (repository corticotrophin) is as effective in reducing protein in the urine as seen in synthetic ACTH in Europe.</detailed_description>
