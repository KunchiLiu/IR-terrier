	<brief_summary>The objective of this 2 year research project is to determine whether an evidenced-based empowerment strategy, Problem Solving Education (PSE), targeted to mothers of young children with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), promotes family well-being by decreasing the burden of maternal depressive symptoms and maternal parenting stress and improving social functioning. We propose a randomized control trial involving 140 mothers who have children &lt;4 years with confirmed ASDs. Based on the paradigm of the IOM report on mental health prevention research that highlights the importance of targeting interventions to at-risk populations who may not meet diagnostic criteria, all mothers of young children with ASDs will be eligible to participate. Consistent with previous studies of cognitive-behavioral interventions, the mother-child pairs will be followed for 9 months. The intervention will be embedded in two settings that provide services to young children with ASDs - Early Intervention (EI) programs and specialty developmental assessment clinics. We aim to support families during a critical juncture - when they are confronted with a new diagnosis and are asked to navigate a complex service system on their children's behalf. The hypothesis of this proposal is that strengthening problem solving skills among mothers of young children with ASDs serve as an important buffer against the negative impact of life stressors, and thereby prevent and attenuate depressive symptoms and parenting stress.</brief_summary>
