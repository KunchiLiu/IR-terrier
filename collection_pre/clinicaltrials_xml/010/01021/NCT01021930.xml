	<brief_summary>Diabetic patients are prone to a diffuse and rapidly progressive form of atherosclerosis. Both clinical and angiographic outcomes following percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) are poor in patients with DM compared with those without DM. Autopsy study has shown delayed neointimal healing with inadequate endothelialization and persistent stent surface ﬁbrin deposition after DES implantation in DM patients. This might partially contribute to the high risk of late stent thrombosis. YINYI Polymer-Free paclitaxel stent is a domestic new type stent with bare metal base with micro porous surface. However, limited data is available in vivo about the surface coverage after stent implantation in DM patients because of lack of sensitive imaging modalities. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an optical analogue of intravascular ultrasound（IVUS）that allows high-resolution tomographic intravascular imaging. Furthermore, several studies have demonstrated the feasibility of OCT to quantitatively evaluate the surface coverage and stent conditions in the follow up after PCI . Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyze the surface coverage and late malapposition after two types of DES implantation in DM patients compared with non-DM patients by using OCT and IVUS.</brief_summary>
