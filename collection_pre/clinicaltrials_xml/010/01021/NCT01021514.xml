	<brief_summary>Arteriosclerosis is a dynamic inflammatory disorder. Recently, FDG-PET CT is emerging diagnostic tool of non-invasive technique to detect vulnerable atherosclerotic plaque. And there are arising evidence that sRAGE(soluble Receptor for Advanced glycation End Product) is correlated with metabolic risk. So the investigators will investigate association between sRAGE and FDG-PET uptake in large artery in healthy patient.</brief_summary>
