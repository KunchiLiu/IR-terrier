	<criteria>Male or female subjects with confirmed pneumonia, defined as the presence of a new progressive infiltrate(s) on chest radiograph and the presence of gramnegative organism by either culture or Gram stain of respiratory secretions. The subject must be intubated and mechanically ventilated and expected to remain so for at least 3 days after the start of study treatment. Subjects with a tracheostomy were also eligible. Subjects with compromised or suppressed Immune systems, severe hypoxemia, neutropenia, serum creatinine &gt; 2mg/dl and chronic liver disease Had primary lung cancer or another malignancy metastatic to the lungs Were known or suspected to have active tuberculosis, cystic fibrosis, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, or Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia Were receiving immunosuppressive therapy, defined as chronic treatment with known immunosuppressant medications Had a body mass index of â‰¥30 kg/m2 Had burns &gt;40% of total body surface area Had known local or systemic hypersensitivity to amikacin or aminoglycosides Had a diagnosis of endstage renal failure or were currently on dialysis treatment Had a serum albumin level &lt;2 g/dL at Screening Used amikacin by any route within 7 days before the start of study treatment Had a presence of any concomitant condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would preclude completion of study evaluations or make it unlikely that the contemplated course of therapy and FollowUp could be completed Had known respiratory colonization with amikacinresistant gramnegative rods</criteria>
