	<brief_summary>Study hypothesis: Low level laser (LED) will reduce initial bone resorption and improve primary stability of dental implant. It will also reduces post operative pain compared to patient without treatment Implant osseointegration depends on many factors including biocompatibility of implant materials, design, surface, surgical access, patient conditions, biomechanical status, and lack of primary stability. Several in vivo and in vitro studies showed the healing effect of low level laser therapy (LLLT) on bone by decreasing the initial bone resorption postoperatively and increasing the primary stability of the implant. It has also shown to have an analgesic effect intraorally when used post intraoral surgical procedures. The exact mechanism is unclear despite the fact that many hypothesis has been proposed. In our study, our goal is to present, in a randomized standardized clinical trial, the effect of LLLT on post operative implant stability assessed by resonance frequency analysis (RFA). We will assess the subjective measures of postoperative pain using visual analog scale (VAS).</brief_summary>
