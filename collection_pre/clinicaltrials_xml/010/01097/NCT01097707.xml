Have a Total Prostate Volume by Transrectal ultrasound greater than or equal to 30 mL at screening. Show signs of bladder outlet obstruction as defined by a peak urinary flow rate (Qmax) greater than or equal to 4 and less than or equal to 15 mL/sec (from a prevoid total bladder volume [assessed by ultrasound] of greater than or equal to 150 to less than or equal to 550 ml and a minimum voided volume of 125 ml) at screening. Have a PSA greater than or equal to 1.4 and less than or equal to 10 ng/mL at screening. Demonstrate a Post Void Residual less than or equal to 300 mL by ultrasound at screening. Have not received the following treatments within the specified time period: 1. Finasteride or dutasteride for at least 6 months prior to screening. 2. Any alphaadrenergic antagonists for at least 4 weeks prior to screening. 3. Any other nonexperimental BPH therapy (including an herbal preparation) for at least 4 weeks prior to screening. 4. Any other experimental or offlabel BPH therapy such as injectable therapies with a protracted effect for at least 6 months prior to screening. 5. Any overactive bladder treatment for at least 4 weeks prior to screening. 6. Any Erectile Dysfunction treatment which may include oral phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors or devices for at least 4 weeks prior to screening. Have a morning fasting Total Testosterone concentration greater than or equal to 300 ng/dL at screening. If hyperlipidemic, based on history, be on stable statin treatment as determined by the investigator for at least 2 months prior to screening. Have completed or withdrawn from this study or have completed or withdrawn from any other study investigating LY500307. Have any history of BPHrelated invasive procedures (for example, Transurethral Resection of the Prostate, open prostatectomy, and minimally invasive procedures that include thermalbased therapies, transurethral microwave treatment, transurethral needle ablation, and stents). Have active cardiovascular disease as evidenced by the following: 1. Recent Myocardial infarction, unstable angina, stroke or Transient ischemic attach within 6 months of screening. 2. Recent coronary intervention that includes coronary artery bypass surgery, percutaneous coronary artery intervention, or stent placement within 6 months of screening. 3. Recent history of positive stress tests without any written documentation of effective intervention within 6 months of screening. 4. Evidence of heart disease categorized as greater than or equal to Class III functional classification of NYHA within 6 months of screening. Have known or suspected history of prostate cancer, breast cancer, or other clinically significant neoplastic disease (other than squamous cell or basal cell carcinoma of skin). Have a history of deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism disease. Have moderate to severe renal insufficiency. Have a hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) greater than 9.0%. Are on testosterone replacement therapy, or drugs that influence the hypothalamuspituitarygonadal axis. Are on pharmacological treatment other than statins for hyperlipidemia.</criteria>
