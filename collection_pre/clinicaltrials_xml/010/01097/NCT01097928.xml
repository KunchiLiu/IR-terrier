	<brief_title>Pulmonary Embolism Response to Fragmentation, Embolectomy, &amp; Catheter Thrombolysis: PERFECT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective of this study is to capture high quality patient safety and effectiveness data on CDT for acute PE. The goal will be achieved by capturing a concise set of immediate and short-term functional and clinical outcome data for PE patients undergoing CDT. Secondary study objectives include the following: - To assess and benchmark clinical practice patterns (patient selection, optimal technique, use of procedure worldwide) These objectives will be achieved through the capture of selected process data for patients included in the registry. Data collected in this study may also be used to develop and refine standards of care for use of CDT for PE and to facilitate the design of randomized clinical trials</detailed_description>
