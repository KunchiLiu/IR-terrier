	<brief_summary>Aim: In this project proposition the investigators would like to examine the effect of immune modulation by probiotics on the clearance of HPV-infections. This study provides a model for viral infection but also for cancer precursors. This would be an excellent model (and the only possible short-term model) to examine an effect on cancer precursors. Cancer precursors (cytological abnormalities such as L-SIL) are a scientifically accepted surrogate endpoint for cervical cancer, for example in HPV-vaccine studies. Research question: Does daily intake of probiotics lead to a better immune-response in HPV-infected women, i.e. does it facilitate clearance of the virus and/or regression of cytological lesions?</brief_summary>
