	<brief_summary>Surgical skin complications can be costly and could contribute to extended in-patient stay following total joint replacement or even the need for re-admission. If efficacy in reducing the incidence of post-operative wound drainage and, in turn, surgical wound complications can be demonstrated, it may also reduce the length of hospital stay and the need for revision surgery or readmission. The aim of this research is to investigate the incidence of post-operative wound drainage following elective total joint arthroplasty using two surgical skin preparation protocols.</brief_summary>
