	<brief_summary>To evaluate the efficacy of ultraviolet-A (UVA)-induced cross-linking of corneal collagen (CXL) as a method to increase the biomechanical and biochemical stability of the cornea by inducing additional cross-links within or between collagen fibers using UVA light and the photo- mediator riboflavin. The purpose of this study is to generate data for presentation at medical meetings and for peer-review publication</brief_summary>
