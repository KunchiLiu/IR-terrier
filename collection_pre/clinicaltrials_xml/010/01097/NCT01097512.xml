	<brief_summary>In clinical practice and research, combination of anticancer agents is often used to improve efficacy of treatment. In vitro and in vivo experiments have shown additive-synergistic anti-tumour effects of AS703569 treatment when combined with gemcitabine. Specifically, additive-synergistic anti-tumour effects were noticed when the two agents were given sequentially and not concomitantly i.e. AS703569 given the day before or the day after gemcitabine. This trial was designed to investigate in parallel two regimens testing sequential administration of AS703569 either the day after gemcitabine infusion, (Regimen 1) or the day before (Regimen 2).</brief_summary>
