Patients with untreated and/or symptomatic metastatic CNS malignancies. Patients with known hypersensitivity to any of the components of MM111 or who have had hypersensitivity reactions to fully human monoclonal antibodies, including Herceptin. Patients who have received other recent antitumor therapy including: Treatment with Herceptin within the 28 days prior to the first scheduled day of dosing with MM111 Investigational therapy administered within the 28 days prior to the first scheduled day of dosing MM111 (Dosing in less than 28 days' since receiving investigational therapy is acceptable once a time interval equal to at least five halflives of the investigational agent has passed.) Any standard chemotherapy, Tykerb (lapatinib) or radiation within 14 days (and having passed the time of any actual or anticipated toxicities) prior to the first scheduled dose of MM111 Patients who have previously received MM111 Patients with NYHA Class III or IV congestive heart failure or LVEF &lt; 50% Patients with a history of allogeneic transplant Patients with known HIV, hepatitis B or C (if patients have previously been treated for hepatitis C and have undetectable viral loads, they can be considered eligible for the trial) Patients with any other medical or psychological condition deemed by the Investigator to be likely to interfere with a patient's ability to sign informed consent, cooperate and participate in the study, or interfere with the interpretation of the results</criteria>
