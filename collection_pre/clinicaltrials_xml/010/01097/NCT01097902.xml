	<brief_summary>The experimental pain model studied in this proposal show characteristics of an inflamed wound with a pro-inflammatory response. This study will help discover candidate genetic and/or proteomic pain biomarkers that could provide objective and mechanism based tests to diagnose, monitor or quantify pain. We also hope to determine the measurable effects of a known non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) on biomarkers of pain and inflammation.</brief_summary>
