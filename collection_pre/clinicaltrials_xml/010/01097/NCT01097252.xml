	<brief_title>Weekly Versus Three-week Chemoradiation in Patients With Advanced Cervical Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is to compare the compliance, toxicity, response and survival rate between concurrent chemoradiation with weekly cisplatin 40mg/m2 and three-week cisplatin 75mg/m2 in patients with advanced cervical cancer. Patients with primary untreated invasive squamous cell carcinoma, adenosquamous carcinoma or adenocarcinoma of the cervix from stage IIB to IVA were enrolled. Patients with histologically proven locoregionally advanced cervical cancer will be randomized into two treatment arm; Arm I, concurrent chemoradiation with weekly cisplatin 40mg/m2 for six times; Arm II, concurrent chemoradiation with three-week cisplatin 75mg/m2 for three times. The compliance and toxicity during the chemoradiation is the primary endpoint. Response rate and the overall survival will be analyzed as secondary endpoints.</detailed_description>
