	<brief_summary>The investigators evaluate the possible association of PROP taste with gustin gene polymorphism rs2274333 (A/G), salivary zinc ion concentration and BMI. In addition, it has also been evaluated PROP taste sensitivity by recording monophasic potentials from the tongue.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gustin Gene Polymorphism and 6-n-propylthiouracil (PROP) Taste</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators evaluate the possible association of PROP taste with gustin gene polymorphism rs2274333 (A/G), salivary zinc ion concentration and BMI. Furthermore, we apply direct measures of the gustatory system activation following stimulation with PROP, obtained by electrophysiological recordings from the tongue of subjects classified for taster status, genotyped for the specific receptor gene (TAS2R38), and in which papilla density was determined.</detailed_description>
