	<brief_title>Long Term Physical Training in Asthma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Physical training is well known to support a healthy lifestyle. Patients with asthma are often unnecessarily restricted of physical activities or avoid exercise due to the unpleasant experience of exercise-induced dyspnea. As a consequence both children and adults with asthma are less fit than their peers. Like in healthy individuals, regular training supports health in asthmatics. In short-term training programs improvements of physical capabilities have been achieved in children and young adults with asthma. Programs of longer durations than 3 months have not been published in controlled trials. Effects of exercise training on quality of life in adult asthmatics are lacking.</detailed_description>
