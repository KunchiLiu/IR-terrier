	<brief_summary>Purpose: To compare the efficacy of pregabalin to placebo for postoperative pain control after photorefractive keratectomy. Patients: Study subjects will be taken from a standard group of typical candidates for PRK surgery including active duty and DoD beneficiaries. Prior to being approached for the study, all patients will have had a previous desire for surgery and had a pre-operative evaluation indicating healthy ocular status. Methods: Patients scheduled for PRK surgery will be briefed on the purpose of the study and invited to participate at the preoperative appointment. After the consent process, patients will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to receive either oral pregabalin 75mg BID or placebo for pain control, in addition to the standard care treatment of as needed Percocet and tetracaine ophthalmic drops. Subjects will be evaluated daily for 4 days post-operatively for subjective pain assessment, adverse drug events and compliance, use of concomitant medications as well as monitoring of healing time. Quality of life will be measured at baseline and post-op day 2 when the peak of pain is anticipated. Analysis will be performed to detect an approximate 10% improvement in pain scores. Secondary outcomes will include measuring healing time, quality of life and use of rescue medications.</brief_summary>
