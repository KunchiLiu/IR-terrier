	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate a Leukapheresis Treatment in Patients With Ulcerative Colitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic and relapsing disease and is characterized by superficial inflammation in the colonic epithelium. The inflammation is maintained by continuous supply of inflammatory cells from the circulating blood to the intestinal mucosa. Existing therapy e.g. corticosteroids and immunosuppressants are inadequate with an overall long-term remission rate of only 50-60%. Those treatments are also associated with severe side effects why there is a need of new therapies. The aim of this study is to investigate a novel leukapheresis treatment with the potential to reduce the number of inflammatory cells homing to the gut mucosa. By drawing blood from the patient and pass it through the investigational column the inflammatory cells are removed. The blood, depleted of the inflammatory cells, is returned to the patient. The treatment thus enable down-regulation of the inflammation and consequently the inflammation can heal. The treatment is called Tailored leukapheresis.</detailed_description>
