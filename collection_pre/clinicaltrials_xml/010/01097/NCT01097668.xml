	<brief_summary>Phase 1 study to assess the safety and biological activity of ATX-MS-1467 in patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis. This will be an open label upward dose titration involving injections on 9 occasions, each two weeks apart. After dosing is complete there will be a 22 week follow up period. Blood samples will be drawn throughout the study to monitor safety and the body's response to the injections and MRI scans will be performed on several occasions to follow the course of the multiple sclerosis during the trial.</brief_summary>
