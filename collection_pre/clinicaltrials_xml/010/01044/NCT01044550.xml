	<brief_summary>Title: A randomized prospective study comparing non operative management with laparoscopic treatment in patients with a diaphragm injury following left thoracoabdominal stab wounds. Aim of the Study: The aim of this study is to access the clinical outcome of potential occult diaphragm injuries in a group of patients presenting at the Groote Schuur trauma centre with left sided thoracoabdominal stab wounds, if an expectant non operative management course is taken. Objects of the Study: To obtain the above mentioned aim the study will undertake; - to do laparoscopy on a group of randomly selected patients with left thoracoabdominal stab wounds to obtain the incidence of occult diaphragm injury. - to assess the incidence and clinical outcome of delayed diaphragm visceral herniation in the study group.</brief_summary>
