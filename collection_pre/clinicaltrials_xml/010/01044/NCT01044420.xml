	<brief_summary>There are few studies about 2nd line treatment in advanced esophageal carcinoma(AEC), some showed that irinotecan may be effective. The investigators previous study has shown the efficacy and safety of paclitaxel/cisplatin as 1st line treatment, so in this phase II study, the investigators would like to observe the efficacy and safety of Irinotecan/5FU/leucovorin as 2nd line treatment if AEC after failure to 1st treatment of PTX/DDP.</brief_summary>
