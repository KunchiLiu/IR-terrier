	<brief_summary>This will be a randomized, open-label, pilot feasibility study of four 2-dose vaccine regimens in healthy volunteers using two commercially available seasonal influenza vaccines to compare immune responses and in vitro cross-reactivity against H5N1. Vaccine doses will be spaced by approximately 8 weeks to allow for optimal prime boost conditions. Humoral, cellular and secretory immune responses will be measured 2 and 4 weeks after each vaccine dose and compared with baseline values.</brief_summary>
