	<brief_title>Outlook Quality of Life Intervention Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized control trial to evaluate the feasibility of the Outlook intervention. 221 veterans with advanced cancer, congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or end stage renal disease (ESRD) were randomly assigned to one of three intervention groups and completed a brief battery of pre-test measures. Subjects in the first group ("Outlook Intervention") were randomized to meet with a facilitator three times for a period of 45 min-1 hour. Participants were asked in the first session to discuss issues related to life review. They were asked in the second session to speak in more depth about issues of regret, forgiveness and things left undone. The subject of the final session was heritage and legacy. Participants in the attention control group were randomized to meet with a facilitator three times for a period of 45 min- 1 hour and listen to a non-guided relaxation audio disc (CD). Participants in the third group ("treatment as usual") were exposed to no interventional sessions. Participants were assessed with post-test measures administered by a blinded interviewer one week and 3 weeks after the intervention window.</detailed_description>
