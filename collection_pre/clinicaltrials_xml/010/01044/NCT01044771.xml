	<brief_summary>The study is designed to evaluate the proportion of patients with tenofovir induced proteinuria that will resolve their proteinuria when the tenofovir containing nucleoside/nucleotide backbone is switched to a raltegravir backbone. Common HIV treatment regimens contain nucleoside/nucleotide combinations that may have long-term side effects including nephrotoxicity. Switching these backbones out for an integrase inhibitor based regimen has not been systematically evaluated. Hypothesis: Proteinuria developing during treatment with tenofovir improves or resolves when tenofovir is switched out with raltegravir. Switching to a nuc- sparing regimen, containing raltegravir and a boosted protease inhibitor in patients without preexisting protease inhibitor mutations is safe and does not lead to virologic failure</brief_summary>
