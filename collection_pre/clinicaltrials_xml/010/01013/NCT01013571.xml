	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate non-inferiority of a patient-managed titration algorithm (including blood glucose monitoring) for the addition of a single dose of insulin glulisine at breakfast in Canadian patients with inadequately controlled T2DM after optimization of basal insulin, compared with an HCP-managed titration algorithm. The primary endpoint for assessment of this objective is the percent of patients reaching a target HbA1c &lt;=7.0% without severe hypoglycemia at the end of the study. Secondary Objective: Secondary objectives of the study are to compare the effect of the two different insulin glulisine titration algorithms (patient-managed versus HCP-managed) on the following: - change in HbA1c, FG, and 7-point glucose profile at Week 24 and Week 36 - satisfaction with treatment (DTSQc for patient and questionnaire for HCP) at Week 36 - change in weight at Week 24 and Week 36 - incidence of hypoglycemia - insulin doses - resource utilization (rural/urban, blood glucose meter test strips, lancets, HCP visits, telephone calls, and hospitalizations) - adherence with the patient-managed monitoring algorithm</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: Runin phase: T2DM Treated for at least 3 months with a basal insulin (insulin glargine, NPH, detemir) +/ oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs) with an HbA1c &gt;7.0% or insulin naive (23 OADs) with an HbA1c &gt;=7.8% (historic HbA1c result up to 3 months of screening is acceptable) Randomized treatment phase: Completed runin phase HbA1c &gt;7.0% and &gt;= 1 episode of confirmed nocturnal hypoglycemia (BG &lt;4.0 mmol/L) or &gt;= 2 measurements of FG &lt;=6.0 mmol/L within the previous week Patients who completed the runin phase with HbA1c &gt;7.0% and did not meet the randomization criteria will continue titrating insulin glargine and be followed until the end of study. No food intake before lunch (noon) Unstable diet intake or significant changes to current diet regimen Nightshift worker Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus Subjects unwilling to inject insulin or perform selfmonitoring blood glucose Pregnant, alcohol or drug abuse Active cancer or any other disease or condition which in the opinion of the investigator would make the subject unsuitable for participation in the study Any clinical significant laboratory findings that in the judgment of the investigator would preclude safe completion of the study Known allergies to study drugs The above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a patient's potential participation in a clinical trial.</criteria>
