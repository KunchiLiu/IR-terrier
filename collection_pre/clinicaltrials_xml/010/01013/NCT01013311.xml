	<brief_title>Implantable Cardiac Defibrillators for the Prevention of Sudden Death in Patients With Cardiac Sarcoidosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sarcoidosis is an inflammatory disease that can effect many organ systems. Patients with sarcoidosis involving the heart are at risk of sudden death related to ventricular arrythmias. However, we currently do not have a clinical test which can predict sudden cardiac death in these patients. While implantable cardioverter defibrillators(ICDs) can prevent sudden cardiac death in high risk patients, we do not know which patients will benefit from implantation of these devices. This clinical problem is important because we would like to identify patients at risk for sudden death who will benefit from ICD implantation. Additionally, we would like to avoid the risks to patients and financial expenses of inserting ICDs in patients who will not benefit from them.</detailed_description>
