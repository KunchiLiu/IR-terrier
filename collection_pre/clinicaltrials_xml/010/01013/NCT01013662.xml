	<brief_summary>Study of the lipid metabolism under glycemic control in septic patients who got an university 14 bed ICU. Hypothesis: establish a relationship between lipid metabolism alterations and glycemic control or infusion of exogenous insulin</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lipid Profile in Patients With Severe Sepsis or Septic Shock Under Strict or Liberal Glycemic Control</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators enrolled 69 consecutive patients with severe sepsis or septic shock and divided them in two different groups after randomization with sealed envelopes. One group called intensive glycemic control with glycemic levels been between 80 to 110 mg/dl with exogenous insulin. The other group called conventional glycemic control with glycemic levels been between 180 and 220 mg/dl. Blood samples were collected at 0, 12, 24, 48 and 72 hours to measure HDL, LDL, Total cholesterol, free fatty acids and oxidized LDL. Clinical data as creatinine, P/F ratio, bilirubins, platelets, lactate, arterial blood gasometry were either monitored.</detailed_description>
