	<brief_summary>The investigators research group and others have found that patient-reported adherence to all aspects of the regimen is suboptimal and objective measures suggest even poorer adherence. There is little data, however that identifies and examines the reason for nonadherence in an adult Cystic Fibrosis (CF) population or identifies effective strategies for improving adherence. The investigators propose to evaluate the relative efficacy of a Motivational Interviewing-focused intervention (MI) in improving adherence and reducing CF-related morbidity compared to a CF education intervention (CFE; attention control group). Specifically, The investigators hypothesize that MI will result in improved regimen adherence and reduced CF morbidity compared to the CFE control group.</brief_summary>
