	<brief_summary>To study in two cross-sections of healthy volunteers, with single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), the possible changes generated in the mid-term by two rehabilitation techniques: the postural reconstruction and the muscular stretching. The changes in the cortical activation patterns will be estimated during a non-specific position of the ankle, held static. The influence of each technique will be estimated though the evidence of a change in the functional mapping of the areas activated during the defined motor task on healthy volunteers.</brief_summary>
