	<brief_title>Human Fetal Liver Cell Transplantation in Chronic Liver Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One of the major clinical problems in transplantation medicine is the discrepancy between the growing number of liver chronic disease patients and the lack of organs. Research and development of new liver failure treatments thus have a high clinical significance. Regenerative medicine and results recently achieved in the field of stem cell biology may provide a remedy to this emerging problem. Our project aims at developing new generation cell transplantation methodologies through an interdisciplinary research project created from a collaboration between ISMETT, Palermo and the University of Pittsburgh (UPMC-USA). Adult hepatocyte transplantation has been in use for several years already and has proved to be safe for patients and able, especially in pediatric patients, to improve liver function indices and delay the need for liver transplantation. Studies have been limited until now by the use of already differentiated hepatocytes and therefore unable to proliferate and develop a suitable liver mass to support a decompensated liver. The hypothesis of our project, supported by in vitro studies and studies on experimental animal models, is based on the possibility to generate an ectopic liver system in the spleen through the experimental use of hepatic cell progenitors obtained from human fetal liver tissues. Human fetal liver cell transplantation will be performed in the spleen through arterial injection. The final endpoint of the project is to develop an innovative and safe treatment for patients with end-stage chronic liver failure</detailed_description>
