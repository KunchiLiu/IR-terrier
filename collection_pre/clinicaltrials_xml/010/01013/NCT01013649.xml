	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II-R/III trial studies gemcitabine hydrochloride with or without erlotinib hydrochloride followed by the same chemotherapy regimen with or without radiation therapy and capecitabine or fluorouracil in treating patients with pancreatic cancer that was removed by surgery. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine hydrochloride, capecitabine, and fluorouracil, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Erlotinib hydrochloride may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Giving chemotherapy together with or without erlotinib hydrochloride and/or radiation therapy after surgery may kill any tumor cells that remain after surgery. It is not yet known whether chemotherapy is more effective when given with or without erlotinib hydrochloride and/or radiation therapy in treating pancreatic cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gemcitabine Hydrochloride With or Without Erlotinib Hydrochloride Followed By the Same Chemotherapy Regimen With or Without Radiation Therapy and Capecitabine or Fluorouracil in Treating Patients With Pancreatic Cancer That Has Been Removed By Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine whether the addition of erlotinib (erlotinib hydrochloride) to gemcitabine (gemcitabine hydrochloride) adjuvant chemotherapy shows a signal for improved survival as compared to gemcitabine alone following R0 or R1 resection of head of pancreas adenocarcinoma (including adenocarcinoma of the head, neck, and uncinate process). (Phase II-R) II. To determine whether the use of concurrent fluoropyrimidine and radiotherapy following adjuvant gemcitabine based chemotherapy or non-gemcitabine based chemotherapy such as modified fluorouracil-leucovorin-irinotecan-oxaliplatin regimen (FOLFIRINOX) further enhances survival for such patients who are without evidence of progressive disease after 5 months of adjuvant chemotherapy. (Phase III) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate disease-free survival of adjuvant chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy and concurrent fluoropyrimidine for patients with resected head of pancreas adenocarcinoma who are disease free after 5 months of adjuvant chemotherapy. II. To evaluate disease-free survival of standard adjuvant gemcitabine chemotherapy with and without erlotinib for patients with resected head of pancreas adenocarcinoma. III. To evaluate adverse events with and without erlotinib for patients with resected head of pancreas adenocarcinoma. IV. To evaluate adverse events of adjuvant chemotherapy with or without radiation therapy and concurrent fluoropyrimidine for patients with resected head of pancreas adenocarcinoma who are disease free after adjuvant chemotherapy. V. To evaluate preoperative cross-sectional imaging of the primary head of pancreas adenocarcinoma in order to determine the frequency with which objective criteria of resectability are present. VI. To determine if patients reporting low baseline fatigue, as measured by the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT)-Fatigue, predicts survival and to explore correlations between baseline fatigue, as measured by Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS), and survival. OUTLINE: Patients without disease progression after treatment in arm I or II are randomized to 1 of 2 additional treatment arms (arm III or IV). ARM I: Patients receive either gemcitabine hydrochloride or allowable combination chemotherapy per standard of care for 5 months. ARM II (closed to accrual 4/2/14): Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15 and erlotinib hydrochloride orally (PO) once daily on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 5 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. ARM III: Patients receive the same treatment as in arm I for 1 month. ARM IV: Patients receive the same treatment as in arm I for 1 month. Beginning within 7-21 days after completion of chemotherapy, patients undergo radiotherapy (3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy or intensity-modulated radiotherapy) 5 days per week for 5.5 weeks (28 fractions). During radiotherapy, patients receive either capecitabine PO twice daily (BID) 5 days per week or fluorouracil IV continuously for 5.5 weeks or until radiotherapy is completed. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologic proof of primary head of pancreas invasive adenocarcinoma managed with a potentially curative resection (i.e., removal of all gross tumor) involving a classic pancreaticoduodenectomy (Whipple) or a pylorus preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy; patients with invasive adenocarcinoma that also contains a component of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) are eligible The operating surgeon must document in the operative note that a complete gross excision of the primary tumor was achieved; the pathology report must include documentation of the margin status and the size of the tumor; the pathology report must also include the status of the three major marginsâ€”bile duct, pancreatic parenchyma, and retroperitoneal (uncinate) For patients who have not started their chemotherapy prior to registration, the interval between definitive tumorrelated surgery and 1st step registration must be between 2170 days; for patients entering on the study who have already received up to 3 months of adjuvant chemotherapy as per the treating institution, the interval between definitive tumorrelated surgery and day one of adjuvant chemotherapy must be between 2177 days Patients will be staged according to the 6th edition American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system with pathologic stage T13, N01, M0 being eligible Zubrod performance status 0 or 1 Complete history and physical examination including weight and Zubrod status within 31 days of study entry (or within 31 days prior to day 1 of chemotherapy postsurgery for those patients having started chemotherapy prior to first step registration) Before starting therapy the patient should be able to maintain adequate oral nutrition of &gt;= 1500 calories estimated caloric intake per day and be free of significant nausea and vomiting Complete blood count (CBC)/differential obtained within 21 days of registration on study (or within 21 days prior to day 1 of chemotherapy postsurgery for those patients having started chemotherapy prior to first step registration) Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;= 1,500/mm^3 Platelets &gt;= 100,000/mm^3 Hemoglobin (Hgb) &gt;= 8.0 g/dL (transfusion or other intervention to achieve Hgb &gt;= 8.0 g/dl is acceptable) Post resection serum cancer antigen (CA)199 =&lt;
