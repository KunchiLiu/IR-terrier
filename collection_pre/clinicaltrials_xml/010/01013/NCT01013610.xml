Be prepared to adhere to the protocol requirements and be willing and able to remain in the study unit for the entire duration of the confinement period. They must also be willing to return for the EndofStudy Visit one week after the last dosing. Part A only: 4. Subjects must be generally healthy, but may be enrolled with a stable, chronic illness, if it is well controlled and does not interfere with the primary objective of the study. Subjects may be included with clinical deviations from normal limits in medical history, physical examination, vital sign measurements, ECG, or laboratory test results that are associated with stable, well controlled chronic illness. Subjects with concomitant diseases or using concomitant medication will be allowed to participate provided a stable condition and stable treatment for 1 month (30 days) prior to administration of the first dose of study medication. Inclusion of each subject will be reviewed with the Link Medical Monitor prior to enrollment in the trial. Part B only: 5. Subjects with Mild Alzheimer's Disease, as defined by DSMIV. 6. Subjects with a score of ≥ 1826 on the MiniMental State Examination (MMSE). 7. Subjects with a Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) total score of 0.5 or 1.0 (possible or mild dementia). 8. Subjects with a RosenModified Hachinski Ischemic score of ≤ 4. Part A and Part B: 1. Any significant unstable or uncontrolled cardiovascular, hepatic, renal, respiratory, gastrointestinal, endocrine, immunologic, dermatologic, hematologic, neurologic, or psychiatric disease, as determined by medical history, physical examination or laboratory tests. 2. Subjects who have positive serologic findings for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibodies, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), and/or hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibodies. 3. Subjects who have received any experimental drugs or devices within 30 days prior to dosing or who wish to receive any experimental drug within 30 days after completing the study. 4. Subjects unable to understand the protocol requirements, instructions and study related restrictions, the nature, scope and possible consequences of the clinical study.</criteria>
