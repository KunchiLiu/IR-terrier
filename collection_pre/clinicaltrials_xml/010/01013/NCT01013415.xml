	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to find out the safety and activity of an experimental anti-HIV treatment using autologous CD4-zeta gene-changed T cells and/or IL-2 (recombinant interleukin2). The treatments that the investigators are studying try to improve the immune system by changing some of your T cells so they can find and destroy HIV infected cells (HIV is usually able to hide from your T cells). In this study, the investigators are also trying to find out if giving you more IL-2 at the same time as gene changed T cells will help the T cells to live longer or fight HIV better.</brief_summary>
