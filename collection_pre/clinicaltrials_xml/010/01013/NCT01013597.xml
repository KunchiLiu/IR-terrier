	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the tumor response rate in patients with metastatic medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) or radioiodine resistant differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) after receiving treatment with LBH589 20 mg by mouth, three times weekly. Time to progression, overall survival, toxicity, tolerability, and Notch1 protein expression patterns will also be evaluated.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial of LBH589 in Metastatic Thyroid Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) is a neuroendocrine tumor and accounts for 3-5% of cases of thyroid cancer. The majority of patients with MTC do not present with early stage disease. Differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) accounts for &gt;90% of all thyroid cancers. In a sub-set of patients, thyroid cells become resistant to I-131 radioiodine therapy and subsequently develop distant metastases. In both MTC and DTC, systemic chemotherapy for metastatic disease is largely ineffective. LBH589 is a histone deacetylase (HDAC) with recently demonstrated activity to inhibit the Notch1 signaling pathway in MTC cancer cells and suppress tumor cell proliferation in DTC cancer cells. This clinical trial will evaluate the tumor response rate of LBH589 in patients with metastatic MTC or radioactive iodine resistant DTC.</detailed_description>
