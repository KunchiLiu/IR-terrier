	<brief_summary>This study is the second administration of GSK1362885 in humans. GSK1362885 is a novel, potent inhibitor of human glycogen phosphorylase (GP) under development for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This study will investigate the compound's safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics in subjects with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics, and Pharmacodynamics of GSK1362885 in Type 2 Diabetics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is the first administration of single doses of GSK1362885 to the target population with T2DM. Based on the mechanism of action which involves reducing hepatic glucose output, it is possible that day time (AM) or night time (PM) dosing of GSK1362885 could produce different plasma glucose lowering effects, acting either on prandial or post-absorptive elevations of HGO. This study is designed to compare glucose profiles following AM and PM doses to determine if there is any advantage to either one. This study will compare glucose profiles following a single dose of GSK1362885 in the morning before breakfast (AM) to a single dose administered at night (PM). These two dosing periods will be randomized and each subject will receive both dosing regimens. A third dosing period (BID) is not randomized, but is included to explore the effects of GSK1362885 on glucose profiles when administered twice daily in a 24 hour timeframe.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>A subject will be eligible for inclusion in this study only if all of the following criteria apply: A diagnosis of T2DM as determined by a responsible physician based on a medical evaluation including medical history, physical examination, and laboratory tests. Subjects may be entered if they have stable hypertension or hyperlipidemia on therapy. Subjects with other conditions except as noted in Exclusion Criteria may be included only if the Investigator and the GSK medical Monitor agree that the condition is unlikely to introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures.

A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of nonchildbearing potential, defined as premenopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy; or postmenopausal/premature ovarian failure defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea. FSH and estradiol levels will be checked at Screening for postmenopausal women. Simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) greater than 40 MlU/ml and estradiol less than 40 pg/ml (&lt;140 pmol/L) is confirmatory. BMI within the range 22 to 38 kg/m2 (inclusive). T2DM diagnosed at least 3 months prior to Screening with: Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) level less than or equal to 250mg/dL at the Screening visit, FPG level less than or equal to 270 mg/dL on Day 2 For subjects taking no antidiabetic medications: HbA1c between 6.5 and 11 percent, inclusive, at Screening visit For subjects taking one or two antidiabetic medications: HbA1c between 5.8 and 10 percent, inclusive, at Screening visit Subjects must be treating their T2DM using one of the following regimens: Diet and exercise therapy Metformin as monotherapy Sulfonylurea as monotherapy Metformin and sulfonylurea in combination, if one or both component(s) is being administered at a dose that is less than the maximum dose DPPIV inhibitors, either as monotherapy, or in combination with other agent(s) on this list, if one or both component(s) is being administered at a dose that is less than the maximum dose Exenatide, either as monotherapy or in combination with other agent(s) on this list, if one or both component(s) is being administered at a dose that is less than the maximum dose All doses of antidiabetic medication must have been stable for at least 2 months prior to Screening, and the subject must be willing to wash out from their antidiabetic medications from Day 10 through Day 7. Capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with the requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form. A subject will not be eligible for inclusion in this study if any of the following criteria apply: Has any of the following laboratory abnormalities: Positive prestudy Hepatitis B surface antigen or positive Hepatitis C result within 3 months of screening. Positive test for HIV antibody History of uncorrected thyroid dysfunction or an abnormal thyroid function test assessed by TSH at Screening. (NOTE: subjects with hypothyroidism on a stable dose of thyroid replacement therapy for at least 3 months prior to Screening and who have a screening thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) within the normal range may participate.) A positive prestudy drug/urine screen. A minimum list of drugs that will be screened for include amphetamines, barbiturates, cocaine, opiates, cannabinoids and benzodiazepines. A prestudy urine cotinine screen indicating use of tobacco/ nicotine containing products. Subjects with values outside the specified ranges for the following Key Clinical Laboratory Tests must be excluded from the study. Laboratory tests may be repeated once at the discretion of the investigator. Liver function tests: ALT, Direct Bilirubin, or Albumin more than 10 percent outside the normal reference range (less than 0.9 x LLN or greater than 1.1 x ULN) Electrolytes: Sodium more than 5mEq/L outside the normal reference range, Potassium or Calcium more than 10 percent outside the normal reference range (less than 0.9x LLN or greater than 1.1 x ULN) Fasting Total Cholesterol greater than 240mg/dL, or Triglycerides greater than 450mg/dL Muscle: CPK greater than 1.5 x ULN Hematology: Hemoglobin, WBC, Neutrophils, or Platelets more than 10 percent outside the normal reference range (less than 0.9 x LLN or greater than 1.1 x ULN) Significant renal disease as manifested by one or more of the following: Creatinine clearance less than 60 mL/min.
