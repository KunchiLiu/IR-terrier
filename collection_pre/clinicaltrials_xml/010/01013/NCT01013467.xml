	<brief_summary>Insufficient blood pressure control is a frequent problem despite the existence of effective treatment. One of the causes is insufficient self-monitoring and a lack of adherence to therapy. Blood pressure self-measurement at home (Home Blood Pressure Measurement, HBPM) has positive effects on treatment adherence and is helpful in achieving the target blood pressure. Only a few studies have investigated whether the adherence for HBPM can be improved through simple measures and better blood pressure monitoring can be achieved. Objective Improvement of self-monitoring by means of blood pressure self-measurement and improved blood pressure control by using a new colour-coded blood pressure diary</brief_summary>
