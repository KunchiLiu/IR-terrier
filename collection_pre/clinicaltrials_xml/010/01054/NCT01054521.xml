	<brief_summary>Currently, there are several alternative treatments for patients with chronic rhinitis (CR) who failed medication. Although, most of the researches have been focusing on temperature-controlled RF (TCRF), the cost is a major limitation for applying it worldwide. The investigators objective of this study is to compare the subjective and objective outcomes of Bipolar RF (BRF) with the more popular TCRF for CR treatment. The investigators hypothesized that both have equivalent outcomes but with less operative time and potentially at lower cost.</brief_summary>
