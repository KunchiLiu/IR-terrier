	<detailed_description>50 hair follicle dissection - human lower lid skin and lashes will be derived from lateral tarsal strip (LTS) dissected routinely in ectropion repair surgery, the skin strip is dissected routinely in this surgery , without any relation to our study. The study will be planned according to Helsinki declaration for Paraffin embedded LTS tissue sections (4 µ) will be processed and examined in immunohistochemistry lab. FP receptor proteins expression, using subtype-specific polyclonal antibodies, will be detected by the light microscopic level, according to manufacturer instruction.</detailed_description>
