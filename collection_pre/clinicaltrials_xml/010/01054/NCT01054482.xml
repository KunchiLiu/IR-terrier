	<brief_title>Pre-operative Chemotherapy Versus Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy in Locally Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Management of locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains a challenge. Both local relapses and distant metastases are frequent, with 5-year survival of 3-17% for inoperable disease. Staging has historically subdivided stage III disease into clinical stage IIIA, thought to be potentially amenable to surgery, and stage IIIB, treated by defi nitive radiotherapy or radiochemotherapy. This phase II trial is to compare neoadjuvant chemotherapy with concurrent chemoradiotherapy in patients with locally advanced NSCLC to address optimal induction strategy.</detailed_description>
