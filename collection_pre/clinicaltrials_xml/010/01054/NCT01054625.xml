	<brief_summary>This study is to support current and future Zalutumumab studies by increasing the Pharmacokinetic (PK) knowledge of the drug. PK is the study of how a drug is absorbed (taken up), distributed (moved around), metabolised (broken down) and excreted (removed) by the body, in relation to time. The first PK trial only went up to 8 mg/kg, and, as there has been some indication that the PK profile for the higher and lower doses is different, this needs to be further evaluated. Furthermore, there is a need for more PK data on dosing with 16mg/kg. The aim with this study is therefore to evaluate the PK profiles at different doses of Zalutumumab and the amount of drug in the blood at different time points after single and multiple doses. The results of this study, combined with data from completed and ongoing Zalutumumab studies, will enable us to provide patients with an effective treatment option which may significantly prolong their survival and/or improve their quality of life.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Zalutumumab Pharmacokinetics (PK) in Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck (SCCHN)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is to look at the Pharmacokinetics (PK) of Zalutumumab in patients with Head and Neck Cancer. 26 participants will be treated with the study drug Zalutumumab at 4 different doses. Zalutumumab will be given at day 0, day 14, day 21 and day 28. Blood samples (for PK and to check the participant's safety) will be taken before drug is given. Blood samples for PK only will be taken directly after drug is given at all treatment visits and also at +3hr and +12hrs on day 0 and day 28 which may require an overnight stay. Blood samples for PK only are also taken on days between treatments. After treatment on day 28, eight more blood samples will be taken over 3 weeks. On day 49 participants may enter an optional extended treatment period receiving the drug weekly until it is no longer appropriate for the participant (doctor/participant decision or cancer has advanced). Dosing in the extended treatment period will start at 16mg/kg. The correct dose for the participant will be checked at each visit by looking for the presence and severity of skin rash. This is a common side effect of medicines like Zalutumumab which block the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor. The severity of the skin rash is used as a guide for dosing. A mild rash could mean more medication is needed, a severe rash will mean the participant needs a break from the medication. End of study is 8 weeks after the last dose of Zalutumumab and blood samples will be taken +4weeks and +8weeks after the last dose of drug.</detailed_description>
