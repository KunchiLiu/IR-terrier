	<brief_summary>Urinary incontinence which is a major health issue in women affects 30-40% of older women. Surgical treatments for SUI have undergone many modifications in the last century. The Needleless Sling System is a one incision, minimally invasive, surgical procedure that has had great acceptance in Europe and has recently received FDA Clearance for use in the United States. We will evaluate effectiveness and patient reported outcomes for Needleless® sling system (Neomedic International). This is a prospective, multicenter, registry. Up to 150 women will be enrolled from up to 3 registry sites. Patients will be evaluated at baseline, peri-operatively, and post-operatively up to 2 months, up to 6 months and at 12 months. Effectiveness evaluations will include a standing stress test (objective cure), SANDVIK questions (subjective cure) &amp; I-QOL (quality of life measure). Other evaluations will include type of anesthesia, concurrent surgery, operative time, post-operative pain, length of hospital stay, returning to usual activities, change of lower urinary tract symptoms (BFLUTSSF, voiding diaries), goal achievement and patient satisfaction.</brief_summary>
