	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to demonstrate substantial equivalence of the SOLITAIRE™ FR Revascularization Device (SOLITAIRE™ Device) with a legally marketed device, MERCI Retrieval System® (MERCI® Device). The study will demonstrate safety and efficacy of the SOLITAIRE™ Device in subjects requiring mechanical thrombectomy diagnosed with acute ischemic stroke.</brief_summary>
