	<criteria>Adult male subjects, 2178 years of age, must be medically healthy with no clinically significant screening results (except for the subjects in Groups 2 and 3). Subjects with normal renal function (Group 1) must have an estimated CLcr of ≥80 mL/min. Subjects with renal impairment (Groups 2 and 3) must fulfill the additional following criteria: (a) Stable renal impairment; (b) Group 2 subjects with mild renal impairment must have a CLcr of ≥50 to &lt;80 mL/min and (c) Group 3 subjects with moderate renal impairment must have a CLcr of ≥30 to &lt;50 mL/min. Major exclusion criteria include: history or clinical evidence of clinically relevant cardiovascular (including thromboembolic disorders), hepatic, renal (with the exception of renal insufficiency for subjects in Groups 2 and 3), hematological, endocrine, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, psychiatric or neurological impairment; any clinically significant laboratory abnormalities as judged by the Investigator; systolic blood pressure &lt; 90 or &gt;160 mmHg; diastolic blood pressure &lt; 50 or &gt; 95 mmHg; allergy to or previous adverse events with PDE5 inhibitors or its constituents; use of prescription or overthecounter drugs that are known to interfere with metabolism by the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme within 30 days prior to Day 1; use of any investigational drug within 30 days prior to Day 1; use of any prescription or overthecounter drugs or herbal remedies within 14 days prior to Day 1; history of alcohol or drug abuse within 18 months, history of smoking within 6 months; positive breathe alcohol test; positive cotinine test, positive urine drug screen (except in renally impaired subjects following approval by Sponsor). Additional exclusion criteria are listed in Section 4.2.</criteria>
