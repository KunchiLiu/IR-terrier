	<brief_summary>Although approved for minor strains, sprains and contusions, FLECTOR Patch has not been studied extensively in the setting of acute back strain. This study is being conducted as an initial step in demonstrating the benefit of FLECTOR Patch specifically for back strain. In particular, this study is expected to provide information about the amount of improvement in back strain among subjects using the FLECTOR Patch, which may then be used to inform subsequent studies.</brief_summary>
