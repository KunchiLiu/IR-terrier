	<brief_summary>This study will assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (explores what the body does to the drug), and pharmacodynamics (explores what a drug does to the body) of single doses of JNJ-38431055, sitagliptin, and co-administration of JNJ-38431055 and sitagliptin in healthy overweight or obese adult male volunteers.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics, and Pharmacodynamics of Single Doses of JNJ-38431055, Sitagliptin, and Co-administration of JNJ-38431055 and Sitagliptin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a double-blind (neither physician or volunteer knows the name of the assigned study drug), placebo controlled (substance containing no medication), study in healthy, overweight or obese adult male volunteers. For each volunteer, the study consists of a screening phase (up to 30 days), a treatment phase during which volunteers will receive 4 study treatments in a randomized (study sequence assigned by chance) sequence (28 days), and a follow-up phase (10 days). During the treatment phase there will be at least 7 days between each of the 4 treatments. The four treatments will be JNJ-38431055, sitagliptin, JNJ-38431055 and sitagliptin, and placebo. The following safety evaluations will be taken throughout the study: Electrocardiogram (an ECG is a painless procedure that gives a picture of the electrical activity of the heart), blood pressure, heart rate, and blood samples for laboratory tests. The primary outcome will be the effect of JNJ-38431055 and sitagliptin on glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1) levels. Study drug will be administered as single oral doses separated by at least 7 days. The four treatments will be JNJ-38431055, sitagliptin, JNJ-38431055 and sitagliptin, and placebo.</detailed_description>
