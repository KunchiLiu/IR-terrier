	<brief_title>Prenatal Care Program in Dingyuan County</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study was conducted in a rural county of 900,000 people in Anhui province, in eastern China. The total area of the county is almost 3,000 square kilometres. The majority of the population of the county is engaged in farming. In terms of national GDP rankings, the study county is typical of less developed rural areas in China. Twenty townships (10 interventions and 10 control) out of a total of 55 were selected — on the basis of having sufficient health facilities and staff — for a controlled trial on the introduction of systematic prenatal care in the area.</detailed_description>
