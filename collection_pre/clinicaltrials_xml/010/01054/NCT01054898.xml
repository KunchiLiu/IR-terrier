	<brief_title>Effectiveness of a Telephone Intervention to Improve the Mental Health of Abused Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Depression is one of the most common mental health sequelae of intimate partner violence (IPV). Although a range of interventions have been tried to improve the mental health of women survivors of IPV, the results are inconclusive. In this trial, a 12-week advocacy intervention consisting of empowerment and telephone social support is provided to abused Chinese women in a community setting. Usual community services provide the control condition.</detailed_description>
