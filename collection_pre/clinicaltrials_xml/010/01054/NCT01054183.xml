	<brief_summary>This study seeks to assess the role of the GlideScope Ranger video laryngoscope in facilitating successful neonatal/pediatric intubation by pediatric critical care transport teams. The central hypothesis of this study is that the GlideScope Ranger video laryngoscope reduces the rates of failed intubation attempts by pediatric critical care transport teams. The aims of this project are designed to specifically: (1) Establish competencies for GlideScope Ranger video laryngoscopy-assisted intubation for pediatric and neonatal patients; and (2) Compare the intubation success rates for intubation using GlideScope Ranger video laryngoscopy and using conventional, direct laryngoscopy by pediatric and neonatal critical care transport teams.</brief_summary>
