	<brief_summary>The objective of this study was to evaluate and compare two different post-surgical rehabilitation strategies, Rehabilitation supervised by a physical therapist including exercises with progressive early activation of the rotator cuff versus basic home exercises regarding shoulder function, pain, health related quality of life and return to work after arthroscopic subacromial decompression.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Supervised Physical Therapy With Early Activation of the Rotator Cuff Versus Home Exercises in Patients After Arthroscopic Subacromial Decompression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients scheduled for surgery (arthroscopic subacromial decompression)and in the age 25-65 were offered to participate in the study. After surgery they were randomized to either Supervised Physical therapy with early activation of the rotator cuff (PT-group) or to home exercises (H-group). Patients in the PT group met the physical therapist twice a week for exercises and in between these visits they did their exercises at home daily. The H-group did home exercises daily. Shoulder function and pain(primary outcomes)and health related quality of life, returning to work(secondary outcomes)were assessed before surgery, one week after(baseline), 1,2,3 and 6 months after surgery by an independent physical therapist.</detailed_description>
