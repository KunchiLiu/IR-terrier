	<brief_summary>The purpose of this observational study was to provide summary data from participants who relapsed at the end of the follow-up phase after 24 weeks of treatment with standard care PegIntron plus ribavirin in Part 1 of the study (NCT00709228) and who then received retreatment during Part 2 of the study. Relapse was defined as having a positive virology result at the Week 24 post-treatment follow-up, after a negative result at the Week 24 end-of-treatment time point. Hepatitis C Virus Ribonucleic Acid (HCV-RNA) levels were measured at Day 1 and Weeks 12, 24, and 48 of the extension, and at Follow-up Week 24.</brief_summary>
