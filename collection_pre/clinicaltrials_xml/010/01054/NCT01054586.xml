	<brief_summary>APV10017 was a pharmacokinetic study that evaluated the pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of fosamprenavir/ritonavir (FPV/RTV) at reduced doses over 14 days in HIV-infected subjects with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (HI). Based on these data, two new regimens have recently been approved by the EMEA and FDA in these patient groups; FPV 700mg BID/RTV 100mg QD for those with mild HI (Child-Pugh score 4-6) and FPV 450mg BID/RTV 100mg QD for those with moderate HI (Child Pugh score 7-9). The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has requested longer-term safety data among this hepatically impaired HIV-infected population who have received the recently updated FPV/RTV dosing regimens. An observational cohort study will be conducted using routinely collected data in three European HIV patient cohorts with a high proportion of hepatitis co-infected individuals. Patients who received FPV/RTV will be followed to address the following objectives. Primary: To assess the safety and tolerability of FPV/RTV-based ART in subjects with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. Secondary: A). To compare the safety and tolerability of FPV/RTV-based ART in subjects with mild to moderate hepatic impairment when compared to FPV/RTV-based ART in hepatitis B (HBV) or hepatitis C (HCV) co-infected subjects with normal hepatic function. B). To compare the safety and tolerability of FPV/RTV-based ART to lopinavir/ritonavir LPV/RTV-based ART in subjects with mild to moderate hepatic impairment.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>HIV infected patients with or without hepatic impairment coinfected with HBV or HCV who started FPV/RTVbased therapy on or after January 1, 2008. The FPV/RTV exposed patients will be stratified into four groups for analysis (see interventions AD for label/description above), according to their degree of baseline hepatic impairment, which will be defined according to FPV/RTV dose received (and APRI score for interventions A and D). The LPV/RTV intervention group must have started this therapy at approved standard doses on or after January 1, 2008. Receipt of FPV/RTV or LPV/RTV within the year preceding the baseline visit.</criteria>
