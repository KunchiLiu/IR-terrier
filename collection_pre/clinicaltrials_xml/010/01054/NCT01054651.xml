	<brief_title>A Randomised Trial of Artesunate-sulfamethoxypyrazine/Pyrimethamine Versus Praziquantel for the Treatment of S. Mansoni</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Schistosomiasis remains an important parasitic disease in the tropics, including Kenya. In the absence of a vaccine, the major control strategy is the reduction of morbidity by chemotherapy using Praziquantel. Evidence from laboratory studies and field trials continue to show that schistosome worms have developed reduced susceptibility to Praziquantel. These observations indicate the need for research to monitor the trends in efficacy of praziquantel and the need for research to develop novel antischistosomal drugs. Randomized controlled trials have also shown that Artemisinin derivatives (artesunate, artemether) have antischistosomal activity against S. mansoni, S. haematobium and S. japonicum. We propose to conduct an open-label, randomized trial to evaluate the comparative efficacy of artesunate plus sulfamethoxypyrazine-pyrimethamine versus Praziquantel in the treatment of 212 school children infected with S.mansoni in Rarieda district in western Kenya. To do this we will screen about 1000 school children by examination of stool for schistosome eggs. Eligible children will be randomized to receive either artesunate plus sulfamethoxypyrazine-pyrimethamine over 3 days or a single dose of Praziquantel. Four weeks after treatment, the participants will be assessed for cure and egg reduction.Our study may provide vital information regarding an alternative treatment for S. mansoni infection in children.</detailed_description>
