	<brief_summary>Reload of high dose statin may have potential for preventing deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in patients on statin undergoing total knee replacement arthroplasty. A body of evidence have been reported that reloading of atorvastatin have efficacy in reducing periprocedural myocardial infarction and contrast induced nephropathy. These effects are considered to be mainly due to their antioxidant anti-thrombotic and anti-inflammatory property. We, therefore, hypothesize that high dose atorvastatin re-loading may prevent DVT.</brief_summary>
