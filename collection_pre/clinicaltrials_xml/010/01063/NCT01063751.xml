	<brief_summary>This study will be a prospective, non-randomized evaluation of the Tritanium® Acetabular Shell for primary total hip replacement (THR) with a cementless application in a consecutive series of patients who meet the eligibility criteria. Half of the cases will use the X3® polyethylene insert alone as the bearing surface; the other half will use the MDMTM liner coupled with a compatible ADM/MDMTM X3® insert as the bearing surface. The success rate, defined as freedom from acetabular revision for any reason, for hips implanted with the Tritanium® Acetabular Shell, is no worse than for hips implanted with similar technology as reported in the literature and Trident® X3® Study historical control at 5 years postoperative.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>A. Patient has signed an IRB approved, study specific Informed Patient Consent Form. B. Patient is a male or nonpregnant female age 18 years or older at time of study device implantation. C. Patient has primary diagnosis of NonInflammatory Degenerative Joint Disease (NIDJD). D. Patient is a candidate for a primary cementless total hip replacement. E. Patient is willing and able to comply with postoperative scheduled clinical and radiographic evaluations and rehabilitation. F. Patient has a Body Mass Index (BMI) ≥ 40. G. Patient has an active or suspected latent infection in or about the affected hip joint at time of study device implantation. H. Patient has a neuromuscular or neurosensory deficiency, which limits the ability to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the device. I. Patient is diagnosed with a systemic disease (e.g. Lupus Erythematosus) or a metabolic disorder (e.g. Paget's Disease) leading to progressive bone deterioration. J. Patient is immunologically suppressed or receiving steroids in excess of normal physiological requirements (e.g. &gt; 30 days). K. Patient requires revision surgery of a previously implanted total hip replacement or hip fusion to the affected joint. L. Patient has a known sensitivity to device materials. M. Patient is a prisoner.</criteria>
