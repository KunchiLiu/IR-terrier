	<brief_summary>We will compare the use of foley bulb catheters placed in the cervix for ripening of the cervix for labor induction,.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Foley Balloon With or Without Traction for the Cervical Ripening</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One arm will have the foley balloon placed alone in the cervix. And one arm will have the foley balloon placed in the cervix and then attached to a weight (1000 cc Iv Bag of fluid). Our hypothesis is that the weighted balloon will be more effective than the non-weighted balloon in the ripening of the cervix for induction of labor</detailed_description>
