	<brief_title>Effects of Breakfast on Cognitive Processes in Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Breakfast consumption has previously been shown to positively affect cognitive and academic performance in children. Specifically, breakfast consumption has been reported to improve memory, attention, problem solving, and logical reasoning compared to the absence of breakfast. This has been found under both short-term laboratory conditions and within a school environment in children from both a low and high socioeconomic background, although some studies have failed to find favorable effects.</detailed_description>
