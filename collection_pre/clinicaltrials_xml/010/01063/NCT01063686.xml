	<brief_summary>Early preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) complicates 0.7% of pregnancies. When PPROM occurs before the 24th week,the risk of fetal and neonatal death is 70%. There is also a high risk of neonatal and maternal morbidity. When the diagnosis of PPROM is uncertain by physical examination, additional tests are needed. These tests have false positive and false negative rates. The gold standard for diagnosing PPROM is amniocentesis and dye test. This procedure has a risk of infection and abortion.Our hypothesis is that by using a cervical cap for 6 hours and repeated ultrasound exams we can diagnose or rule out PPROM in cases which are uncertain. Our study group will be pregnant women gestational age 14-23, suspected of having PPROM.</brief_summary>
