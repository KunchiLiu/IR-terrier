	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and benefits of the investigational study drug, KW-2478, when given with bortezomib (Velcade®), a drug approved for the treatment of Multiple Myeloma (MM). The primary objectives: - To establish the safety, tolerability, and recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) of KW-2478 in combination with bortezomib (Phase I); - To assess the overall response rate (ORR) when subjects with advanced MM are treated (Phase II). The secondary objectives: - To characterize the Pharmacokinetic (PK) and Pharmacodynamic (PD) of KW-2478 with bortezomib (Phase I only); - To evaluate for preliminary evidence of efficacy (Phase I); - To determine progression free survival (PFS) and duration of response of KW-2478 with bortezomib (Phase II).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of KW-2478 in Combination With Bortezomib in Subjects With Relapsed and/or Refractory Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multicenter, open label, dose escalation, Phase I / II study in subjects with relapsed and/or refractory MM. Up to 24 subjects to be enrolled in the Phase I to determine the RP2D. Up to 77 additional evaluable subjects to be enrolled in Phase II for a maximum up to 101 subjects treated in the study. Study centers in the USA and the UK will participate in Phase I and II. Centers in the Philippines will be participating in Phase II only. The planned enrollment period is 22 months and the planned study duration is 28 months.</detailed_description>
