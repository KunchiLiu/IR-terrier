	<brief_title>Safety and Effectiveness of the Device "Nit-Occlud速 PDA-R"</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>During the years 2003 to 2008, the Cardiological Medical Center "Kardiozentrum" evaluated 1136 patients with echocardiographic studies, 14.7% of the patients were diagnosed with patent arterial duct. The PDA is an abnormal communication between the aorta and pulmonary artery. Untreated it can rise the intrapulmonary pressure and lead to serious complications like cardiac insufficiency. The incidence of ducts as an isolated heart disease is between 3.6 and 7% of all congenital heart diseases at sea level, and 10 - 14% at high altitude; rising up to 20% in cities at more than 2.500 m about sea level. The ducts at high altitude are generally wider and larger than at sea level. One treatment alternative is a percutaneous transluminal implantation of a permanent implant which closes the defect. The device under investigation "Nit-Occlud速 PDA-R" is developed for closure of the PDA with a minimal diameter of 2-8 mm. The device performs the function of generating the defect occlusion by the body itself. The implant stimulates the body to generate an epithelium over the implant so that the PDA closes.</detailed_description>
