	<brief_title>Sleeve Gastrectomy Versus Gastric Bypass for Private Pay Patients Seeking Obesity Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a retrospective chart review of 800 intervention charts each for consecutive laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomies compared to consecutive laparoscopic gastric bypasses performed by two surgeons in a Louisiana private practice. This retrospective chart review will evaluate the safety of the two procedures during the operative and 6-week post-operative periods, compare the insurance patients to the private pay patients having the gastric bypass, and comparative weight loss in subjects with a follow-up of at least 18 months. This offers the unique opportunity to compare any differences in surgical complications in subjects paying by insurance versus those paying personally for the gastric bypass operation.</detailed_description>
