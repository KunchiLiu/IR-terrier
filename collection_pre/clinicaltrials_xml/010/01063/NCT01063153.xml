	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to study a device called an electroencephalograph (EEG) in the diagnosis of treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adults. People with ADHD have symptoms such as difficulty sustaining attention, organizing, and managing impulsivity. They can have trouble in school, at work, and at home. Subjects with ADHD who participate in this study will be given a once daily stimulant medication called osmotic release methylphenidate (Concerta) for 6 weeks, and have EEG testing done before and after the treatment period. Subjects will perform a computer based cognitive task during EEG testing. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved osmotic release methylphenidate (Concerta) for the treatment of ADHD in adults and children. Similar procedures, without medication, will be performed with a sample of healthy adults without ADHD.</brief_summary>
