	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to see if higher dose of bevacizumab can be taken safely by some patients and if changes in the dose of bevacizumab have any effect on blood pressure.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dose Escalation of Bevacizumab With Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring in Patients With Advanced Non-squamous NSCLC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Carboplatin and pemetrexed are FDA approved chemotherapy agents for patients with advanced non squamous non small cell lung cancer. Bevacizumab is also FDA approved in lung cancer , and the combination of all three drugs is promising. The doctors directing this research want to learn how to better personalize drug dosing of bevacizumab by identifying people who could safely take a higher dose of the drug.</detailed_description>
