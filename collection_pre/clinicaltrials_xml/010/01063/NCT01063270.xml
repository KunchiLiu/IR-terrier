	<brief_title>Trial Comparing Efficacy of Treatments for Hidradenitis Suppurativa</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Histological studies suggest that HS is a disease of the follicles with apocrine involvement as a secondary event. The investigators have identified in a previous study that the Nd Yag laser is highly effective for decreasing the inflammation, pain, suppuration and frequency of recurrence of HS. Oral antibiotic therapy with Clindamycin and Rifampin has also been reported in previous studies to be a highly effective treatment regimen for HS and is commonly used by physicians in medical management of HS. The investigators would like to compare the efficacy of NdYag laser treatment combined with antibiotics versus treatment with antibiotics alone. The goal is to evaluate the success of these two treatment regimens on existent HS lesions as well as prevention of recurrence. There will be approximately 18 people in this research study at Henry Ford Health System (HFHS).</detailed_description>
