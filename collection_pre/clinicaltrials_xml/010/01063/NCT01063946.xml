	<brief_summary>Primary Objectives: - To determine the excretion balance and systemic exposure of radioactivity after intravenous infusion of [14C]-AVE8062 to humans - To determine the pharmacokinetics of AVE8062 and RPR258063 and their contribution to overall exposure - To collect samples to determine the metabolic pathways of AVE8062 and identify the chemical structures of the main metabolites Secondary Objective: - To assess the safety profile of the drug</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Investigate the Disposition of Radio-labeled AVE8062 Compound Administered as a 30-minute IV Infusion to Patients With Advanced Solid Tumor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The duration of the study for each patient will include approximately 4 weeks of a screening phase prior to first infusion of study drug, 21-day study treatment cycles and end of treatment visit. The patient can continue treatment until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or the patient's refusal of further treatment.</detailed_description>
