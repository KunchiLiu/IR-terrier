	<brief_summary>This study is an open-label, randomized study, which is designed to investigate the efficacy of Extended-field irradiation (EFI) on reducing recurrences at the para-aortic lymph node (PAN) and supraclavicular lymph nodes, and also on improving disease-free survival of locally advanced uterine cervical cancer. This study includes a translational research component in that all the primary tumors and lymph node are stained with Sema4c, before randomization. According to the investigators study result, patients with more pelvic lymph node metastasis are more likely to develop distant metastasis including the recurrences at PAN and supraclavicular lymph node. Primary cervical cancer tissues and lymph nodes are examined for expression of Sema4c just after registration, and before the patients are randomized to each arm (pelvis only vs. EFI). The investigators expect a higher benefit of EFI in patients with Sema4c-positive lymph node.</brief_summary>
