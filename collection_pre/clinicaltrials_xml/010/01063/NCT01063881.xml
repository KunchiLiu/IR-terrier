	<brief_title>The Asia-Pacific Flexible Dose Study of Dapoxetine and Patient Satisfaction in Premature Ejaculation Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, interventional study to evaluate efficacy and safety of flexible dose dapoxetine as Premature Ejaculation (PE) Therapy. The total study duration will be 16 weeks, composed of a 2-week pretreatment phase and a 12-week open-label treatment phase, followed by a telephone contact two weeks after Week 12 to follow-up adverse events. At Visit 1 (Screening) standardized assessment tool or patient questionnaires will be used to determine which of those patients with erectile dysfunction/premature ejaculation are eligible to participate in this study. Once enrolled the patient and his partner are expected to attempt sexual intercourse a minimum of 2 times (at least 24 hours apart) and to complete a Baseline Event Log. Starting at Visit 2 (Baseline), the patient (and partner) will complete the Premature Ejaculation Profile (PEP) at the beginning of every treatment visit for the duration of the study. Patients will be started on study drug instructed to take 1 tablet of dapoxetine 30 mg, as needed, 1 to 3 hours prior to sexual activity. The need for adjustments in the dose of dapoxetine, as well as to assess the occurrence of adverse events and concomitant therapy use will be assessed approximately every 4 weeks. Patients will complete Treatment Event Logs during each dosing throughout the open-label treatment phase. Patients who have their dose increased to 60 mg, will be scheduled for a telephone consultation 1 week after to determine how the dose change is tolerated. At Visit 5 (Final Visit/Week 12/Early Termination), the patients and partners will complete several standardized assessment questionnaires have all final visit procedures performed and schedule a telephone follow up contact to evaluate any adverse events. The starting dose of dapoxetine is 30 mg (one 30-mg tablet), taken approximately 1 to 3 hours prior to sexual activity. The dose may be increased after 4 weeks to 60 mg taken. The maximum recommended dosing frequency is once every 24 hours.</detailed_description>
