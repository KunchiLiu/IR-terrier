	<brief_summary>This single-arm, open-label, multicenter study evaluated the safety and tolerability and the efficacy in reducing disease activity of tocilizumab [RoActemra/Actemra] as monotherapy or in combination with methotrexate in patients with active moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Patients were eligible to participate in this study if they are currently experiencing an inadequate response to a stable dose of a non-biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD). Patients received 8 mg/kg tocilizumab [RoActemra/Actemra] as an intravenous infusion every 4 weeks for a total of 6 infusions. The anticipated time on study treatment was 24 weeks. The target sample size was 50-200 patients.</brief_summary>
