	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to test the effects of Femarelle ( a plan-derived SERM) on hot flushes and quality of life in menopausal women. Our hypotheses are that compared to placebo, Femarelle reduces the daily number of hot flushes and their severity and also improves the quality of life as measured by validated dairies and questionnaires.</brief_summary>
