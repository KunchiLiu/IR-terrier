	<brief_summary>Healthy individuals with type 2 diabetes will receive intensive counseling on food selection to improve glucose control using either high cereal fiber dietary strategies or low glycemic index foods emphasizing dried legumes and their products. The treatments will last 3 months with bloods taken for HbA1c, glucose and blood lipids. If the study shows a benefit for either or both diets, then use of high fiber and/or low glycemic index foods in the diet may provide another potential way to improve glucose control and lower cholesterol levels in non-insulin dependent diabetes.</brief_summary>
