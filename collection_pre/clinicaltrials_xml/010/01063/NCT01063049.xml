	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare Nulytely (or Trilyte) with a Gatorade and Miralax combination for cleaning out the colon before colonoscopy. A laxative pill called Bisacodyl may also be used with the Gatorade and Miralax to see if it helps with the clean out process. We are trying to find out if either of these methods is more acceptable to the patient and does a better job cleaning out the colon for a colonoscopy.</brief_summary>
