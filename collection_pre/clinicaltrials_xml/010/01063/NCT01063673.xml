	<brief_title>The Relation Between Running Patterns and Overuse Injuries in Runners</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Running patterns are thought to have a major influence on the development of Running Related Injuries (RRI). Worldwide, running is a sport practiced by many individuals to improve cardio-respiratory function, health and well-being. Although running positively contributes to health, there is also a risk of running related injuries (RRI). At best, the consequence of RRIÂ´s is a periodic absence from physical activity, with the athlete returning to sport within weeks. In the worst case, the injury is a chronic painful condition, causing a sedentary lifestyle without physical activity. This is undesirable since physical inactivity increases the risk of lifestyle diseases and death. In Denmark it is estimated that 4.500 deaths each year can be attributed directly to inactivity. Furthermore, inactivity leads to reduced quality of life compared to active persons. To avoid people getting a sedentary lifestyle prevention of RRI are necessary. To define a prevention strategy, one must have knowledge about risk factors and causation. Many risk factors have been proposed. Among these, running patterns and foot type are thought to play a major role in the development of RRI. However, very few firm conclusions can be made based on the existing literature, often because of methodical problems. Consequently, it is suggested to design large scale prospective studies controlling for multiple variables. Furthermore, studies should differentiate between novice, elite and extreme runners. Thus, the study design in this project will take these suggestions into account. The aim of the study is to investigate the association between running patterns and overuse injuries in runners.</detailed_description>
