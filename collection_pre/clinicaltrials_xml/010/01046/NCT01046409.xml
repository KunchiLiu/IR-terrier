	<brief_summary>The purpose of this trial is 1. to compare the clinical significance of the main vessel and the side branch vessel using EKG, pain score and coronary wedge pressure 2. to develop a new scoring system to predict the clinical significance of a side branch</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1. Clinical significance EKG change, pain score during 1 min balloon occlusion 2. Different characteristics between ST segment elevation vs non-elevation side branches 3. Comparison of coronary wedge pressure 4. Establishing a new scoring system to predict the ST elevation during 1min balloon occlusion</detailed_description>
