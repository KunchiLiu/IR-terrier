	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of Ginkgo Biloba Extract (GBE) in executive function-impaired Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) patients by assessing gait while walking alone as well as under differing dual-task conditions. The primary endpoint in the evaluation of GBE efficacy is gait speed. The secondary endpoint is cycle time variability under dual-task conditions.</brief_summary>
