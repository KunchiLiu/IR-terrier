	<brief_title>Thymoglobulin Versus Alemtuzumab Versus Daclizumab in Living Donor Renal Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To observe in a randomized prospective pilot study the effectiveness and toxicity of Thymoglobulin vs. Campath-1H used for induction therapy in recipients of living donor (LD) kidneys, compared with our standard treatment protocol of Zenapax® and maintenance immunosuppression (vide infra). To determine the effect different antibody induction regimen on the lymphoid cell subsets of the immune system in kidney allograft recipients peripheral blood and bone marrow aspirates will be tested at surgery before transplantation and at intervals post operatively. To treat renal transplant patients successfully in the absence of long-term calcineurin inhibition to determine if there are beneficial effects on the prevention of chronic allograft nephropathy.</detailed_description>
