	<brief_summary>Limonene is a major component in the essential oils of citrus fruits. It has demonstrated promising breast cancer preventive and therapeutic effects in preclinical model systems. This early phase clinical study will evaluate the distribution of limonene to the breast tissue and its associated biological activities after 2 to 6 weeks of limonene dosing in women with a recent diagnosis of early stage breast cancer. This study will help evaluate the potentials of developing limonene as a breast cancer preventive agent.</brief_summary>
