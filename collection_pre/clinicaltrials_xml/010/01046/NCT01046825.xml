	<brief_summary>This is a phase III clinical trial using risk-adapted therapy. Treatment outcomes for children with B-cell NHL are excellent. Further improvements in outcome will likely be achieved through more focused study of the biology of the tumors and prospective studies of the late effects of treatment. Toward this end, this study features a spectrum of prospective biologic and late effect studies performed in patients treated with a modified regimen derived from the very successful LMB-96 regimen.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1. This study will perform transcriptional profiling and genome-wide analysis of DNA copy number abnormalities and loss-of-heterozygosity using DNA microarrays in children with newly diagnosed diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL) and small non-cleaved lymphomas from different parts of the world. 2. This study will describe the types and frequency of mutations in the ARF-HDM2-TP53 pathway, in "non-endemic" B-cell lymphomas (United States) and those found in selected geographic regions of the world. 3. This study will describe the expression of ARF-HDM2-TP53 and PUMA-associated pathways in B-cell lymphomas (United States) and that found in B-cell lymphomas of other selected geographic regions of the world. 4. This study will describe the pattern and frequency of XLP gene mutations presenting with B-cell lymphomas in the United States and selected geographic regions. 5. This study will describe the frequency of EBV-positive B-cell lymphomas in the United States and selected geographic regions of the world: and will describe the pattern of EBV protein and gene expression (e.g., EBNA 3) in EBV-positive lymphomas and the study will compare patterns of EBV protein and gene expression with clinical, laboratory and outcome data. Secondary Objective: To estimate the complete response rate, event-free survival, and overall survival rates in patients with Burkitt lymphoma (BL), Burkitt leukemia/B-cell acute leukemia (B-ALL) and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) treated with a stage-adapted regimen based on the St. Jude B-cell II protocol.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>St. Jude Participants: 1. Participant must have a histologic diagnosis of a mature B cell lymphoma (e.g., Burkitt lymphoma/leukemia, atypical Burkitt lymphoma, diffuse large Bcell lymphoma, mediastinal large Bcell lymphoma, mature Bcell lymphoma NOS) as defined in the WHO classification. 2. Participant must be previously untreated, (no more than 72 hours of steroids and/or emergency radiation) 3. Participant must be &lt; 22 years of age at the time of diagnosis 4. For Group B participants with mediastinal large B cell lymphoma (MLBCL) disease only (receiving rituximab) All participants with MLBCL assigned to Group B must have hepatitis screening prior to enrollment. Participants whose results indicate that they are carrier of hepatitis B can still be treated per Group B but will NOT receive rituximab. This screening must be done for eligibility BUT the results are not needed prior to enrollment: Hepatitis B immunization status (vaccination Yes or No) HBsAg AntiHBs antibody AntiHBc antibody. All participants must have screening prior to enrollment. Participants whose results indicate that they are carrier of hepatitis B can still be treated per Group B but will NOT receive rituximab. 5. HIV test has been obtained within 42 days. Participants who test positive for HIV cannot be enrolled on therapeutic part of study, but are still eligible for biology studies. 6. Informed consent must be obtained according to St. Jude guidelines before enrollment into study Participants from Collaborating Sites Participating in Biological Objectives Only: 1. Participant must have a histologic diagnosis of a mature B cell lymphoma (e.g., Burkitt lymphoma/leukemia, atypical Burkitt lymphoma, diffuse large Bcell lymphoma, mediastinal large Bcell lymphoma, mature Bcell lymphoma NOS) as defined in the WHO classification 2. Participant must be &lt; 22 years of age at the time of diagnosis 3. Informed consent must be obtained by local PI or his/her designee according to ICH/Good Clinical Practice and local guidelines before enrollment into study Participants from Collaborating Sites Participating in Therapeutic and Biological Objectives: 1. Participants with prior therapy (except steroids or RT) 2. Participants known to be HIV positive (for therapeutic part of protocol, HIV participants are eligible for biology studies). 3. Participants who are pregnant or lactating 4. Inability or unwillingness of research participant or legal guardian to consent 5. Participants who received emergent steroids and/or radiation prior to biopsy may be included in therapeutic part of study, but will be excluded from biology studies. Participants from Collaborating Sites Participating in Biological Objectives Only: 1. Inability or unwillingness of research participant or legal guardian to consent 2. Histologic diagnosis other than a mature Bcell lymphoma as defined in the WHO classification 3. Participants who received emergent steroids and/or radiation prior to biopsy</criteria>
