	<brief_summary>The primary aim of this IMN 1207 follow-up study is to confirm the effect of a cysteine-rich non-denatured whey protein isolate formulation IMN1207 (20g daily) versus casein (20 g daily) on the reversal of weight loss (cancer-related wasting) over a 40 week treatment period in non-small cell lung cancer patients with or without conventional therapy, i.e., chemotherapy or radiation. And to test the hypothesis that over a period of 66 weeks observation period which includes a 6 months follow-up period, increases the survival of these patients.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This new IMN 1207 study is a follow-up study to the first IMN 1207 trial which was sponsored by Immunotec Inc during the last 3 years. The study revealed that the cysteine-rich whey protein isolate formulation IMN 1207 caused a significant reversal of weight loss (P &lt;0.05) and a conspicuous increase in survival. The outcome of the first IMN 1207 study has been published in (Tozer RG, et al. Cysteine-Rich Protein Reverses Weight Loss in Lung Cancer Patients Receiving Chemotherapy or Radiotherapy. Antioxid Redox Signal. 2008 Feb; 10(2):395-402). PMID:18158761. The purpose of this IMN 1207 follow-up study is to confirm the effect of a cysteine-rich non-denatured whey protein isolate formulation IMN1207 (20g daily) versus casein (20 g daily) on the reversal of weight loss (cancer-related wasting) over a 40 week treatment period in non-small cell lung cancer subjects with or without conventional therapy, i.e., chemotherapy or radiation. In addition, it is prospectively designed to test the hypothesis that, IMN1207 versus casein over a period of 66 weeks observation period which includes a 6 months follow-up period, increases the survival of these subjects. Also, the effect of IMN1207 on the quality of life in a defined subgroup of subjects will be determined.</detailed_description>
