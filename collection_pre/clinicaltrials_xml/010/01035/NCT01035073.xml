	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to determine the time course of duloxetine efficacy on the symptoms of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)and on the symptoms of Soft Tissue Discomfort Syndrome(STDS) via use of 24-hour Actigraphâ„¢ measures. We hypothesize that there will be a reduction in both MDD and STDS symptoms in MDD patients with co-morbid STDS symptoms. We further hypothesize that there will be a rapid improvement in functional outcome ratings and 24-hour activity in MDD patients with co-morbid STDS symptoms which may occur even before the antidepressant effect is observed.</brief_summary>
