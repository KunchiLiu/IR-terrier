	<criteria>Male or female children 10 to &lt; 18 years of age at the time of the first vaccination. "Less than 18 years of age" implies inclusion of adolescents who have not reached their 18th birthday as of Day 0, the day of the first vaccine dose under this protocol. Written informed consent obtained from the subject's parent/legally acceptable representative (LAR); written informed assent obtained from the subject if appropriate. Good general health as established by medical history and clinical examination before entering into the study. Parent/LAR access to a consistent means of telephone contact, land line or mobile, but NOT a pay phone or other multipleuser device. Subjects who the investigator believes that they and/or their parent(s)/LAR can and will comply with the requirements of the protocol. Medical history of physicianconfirmed infection with an A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)vlike virus. Previous vaccination at any time with an A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)vlike virus vaccine. Presence of evidence of substance abuse or of neurological or psychiatric diagnoses which, even if stable, are deemed by the investigator to render the potential subject or parent(s)/ LAR(s) unable/unlikely to provide accurate safety reports. Presence of a temperature &gt;= 38.0ºC by any route or method, or acute symptoms greater than "mild" severity on the scheduled date of first vaccination. NOTE: The subject may be vaccinated at a later date, provided symptoms have resolved, vaccination occurs within the window specified by the protocol, and all other eligibility criteria continue to be satisfied. Diagnosed with cancer, or treatment for cancer, within 3 years. Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, based on medical history and physical examination (no laboratory testing required). Receipt of systemic glucocorticoids within 1 month prior to study enrollment (first dose of study vaccine), or any other cytotoxic or immunosuppressive drug within 6 months of study enrollment. Topical, intraarticular or inhaled glucocorticoids are allowed. Receipt of any immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within 6 months of study enrollment or planned administration of any of these products during the study period. Any significant disorder of coagulation or treatment with warfarin derivatives or heparin. Persons receiving individual doses of low molecular weight heparin are eligible if no such doses are given in the 24 hours before a study vaccination. Persons receiving prophylactic antiplatelet medications, e.g., lowdose acetylsalicylic acid, and without a clinicallyapparent bleeding tendency, are eligible. An acute evolving neurological disorder or history of GuillainBarré syndrome within 6 weeks of receipt of seasonal influenza vaccine. Administration of any licensed vaccine within 30 days before the first dose of study vaccine, with the exception of seasonal influenza vaccine (which may be given within 2 weeks before the first dose of study vaccine). Planned administration of any A/California H1N1vlike vaccine other than the study vaccine between Day 0 and the Day 189 phlebotomy. Planned administration of any other vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol between Day 0 and Day 42 after the first vaccine dose, including seasonal influenza vaccine. Routine childhood vaccinations are exempted if they cannot be delayed, but they must not be administered on the same day as the H1N1 vaccine candidate. Use of any investigational or nonregistered product (drug or vaccine) other than the study vaccine(s) within 30 days preceding the first dose of study vaccine, or planned use during the study period. Any known or suspected allergy to any constituent of influenza vaccines; a history of anaphylactictype reaction to consumption of eggs; or a history of severe adverse reaction to a previous influenza vaccine.
