Patients with a diagnosis of CHF NYHA class IIIV and reduced ejection fraction (EF =&lt; 35%) and elevated BNP. Patients must be on an ACEI or an ARB at a stable dose of at least enalapril 10 mg/d or equivalent for at least 4 weeks. Patients must be treated with a βblocker, unless contraindicated or not tolerated, at a stable dose for at least 4 weeks. Use of other investigational drugs at the time of enrollment, or within 30 days or 5 halflives of enrollment, whichever is longer. History of hypersensitivity or allergy to any of the study drugs, drugs of similar chemical classes, ACEIs, ARBs, or NEP inhibitors as well as known or suspected contraindications to the study drugs. Previous history of intolerance to recommended target doses of ACEIs or ARBs Known history of angioedema. Requirement of treatment with both ACEIs and ARBs. Current acute decompensated HF (exacerbation of chronic HF manifested by signs and symptoms that may require intravenous therapy). Symptomatic hypotension and/or a SBP &lt; 100 mmHg.
