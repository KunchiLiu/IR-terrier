	<brief_summary>This is a Phase 2a double-blind, placebo-controlled study with two dose levels of A0001 given twice daily for 28 days. Potential subjects will be screened first to determine eligibility, after which they will be randomized to receive either a high dose of A0001, a low dose of A0001 or placebo for 28 days. Eligible subjects will return within 21 days of screening for the baseline visit and randomization to one of three potential treatments. The subjects will be required to take 3 capsules of study medication in the morning with a morning meal and 3 capsules of study medication at night with an evening meal for 28 days.
