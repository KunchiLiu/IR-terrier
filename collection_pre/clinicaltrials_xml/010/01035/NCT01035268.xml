	<brief_summary>This is a phase III randomized multi-center study of equivalence comparing the radiological follow-up for patients benefiting from the correction of the esthetical relapse of the preservative treatment by fatty transfer compared with a simple supervision. It is planned that 440 patients participate in this study which plans to compare 2 groups of patients: a group of patients which will benefit from the surgical treatment by transfer of fatty tissue and a group of patients under simple supervision. follow-up consultations are planned in 10 in 45 days post-surgery then at 3 months, 6 months, 12 months and 5 years to look for the expected unwanted effects in relation with the surgery but also to estimate the impact of the fatty transfer on the rate of local and\or from a distance relapse. During these consultations, the surgeon and the patient will also estimate the cosmetic result of the surgery thanks to a questionnaire of cosmetic evaluation and to standardized photos.</brief_summary>
