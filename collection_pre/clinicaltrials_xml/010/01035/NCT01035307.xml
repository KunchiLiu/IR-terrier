	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Studying samples of tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer. PURPOSE: This research study is looking at biomarkers in tissue samples from young patients with acute myeloid leukemia previously enrolled on clinical trial POG-9421.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - To profile basal and potentiated phospho-protein networks (PPPNs) using tissue samples from pediatric patients with de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML) previously enrolled on clinical trial POG-9421. - To classify AML-based signal transduction mechanisms. - To correlate profiles of basal and PPPNs with specific molecular lesions (e.g., FLT3-ITD, NPM, WT1, c-kit, CEPBα, PASGΔ75, and karyotype) and profiles of gene expression in tumor tissue samples. OUTLINE: Banked tissue samples are collected for laboratory studies, including phospho-protein signaling and gene expression profiling studies.</detailed_description>
