	<criteria>Diabetes mellitus type 1 or type 2 With or without established microalbuminuria (albumintocreatinine ratio (ACR)2,525 mg/mmol for men, and 3,525 mg/mmol for women, according to ISH and ESC recommended criteria) Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) between 1560 ml/min/1.73m2 (measured the last 6 months) or GFR &gt;75ml/min/1.73m2. The abbreviated Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation will be used to calculate GFR. Age 1880 years Definite history of myocardial infarction, coronary revascularisation procedure or stroke. (i.e, a strong clinical indication for statin treatment) Functioning renal transplant, or living donorrelated transplant planned. Patients on dialysis. Poor metabolic control, i.e HbA1c &gt; 9% Definite history of chronic liver disease, or abnormal liver function (i.e ALT &gt;1,5 x ULN or, if ALT not available, AST &gt; 1,5 x ULN). Evidence of active inflammatory muscle disease (e.g dermatomyositis, polymyositis), or CK&gt;3 x ULN; Definite previous adverse reaction to a statin or to ezetimibe Definite previous adverse reaction to acetylsalicylic acid. Definite previous adverse reaction to an ACEinhibitor. Need for concomitant treatment with a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4, such as itrokonazole, ketokonazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin, HIVprotease inhibitors or nefazodone (i.e. agents that may markedly elevate simvastatin levels).</criteria>
