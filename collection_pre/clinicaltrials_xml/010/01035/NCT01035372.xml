	<brief_summary>Dried plums (Prunus domestica L.) have traditionally been recognized for their health benefits related to conditions such as constipation, irregular menstrual cycles and mouth sores. This dried fruit provides high levels of fiber, vitamins and minerals. Dried plum has also been shown in animal studies to have beneficial effects on bone and can prevent the loss of bone caused by low hormone levels such as occurs after surgical removal of the ovaries. We also have shown that dried plum can prevent the loss of bone associated with aging in mice. Very few therapies for osteoporosis actually reverse bone loss and improve bone strength. The potential therapeutic value of dried plum in men and women with hormone deficiency or age-related osteoporosis is clear.</brief_summary>
