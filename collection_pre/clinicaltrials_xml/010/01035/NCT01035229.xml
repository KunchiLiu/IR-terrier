	<criteria>Advanced liver cancer Prior systemic treatment with sorafenib for advanced HCC and for whom their disease progressed during or after sorafenib treatment, or were intolerant to sorafenib treatment. Specifically, this can be defined as: Documented radiological confirmation (radiology scans or report) of disease progression during or after sorafenib treatment Intolerance to sorafenib (at any dose and/or duration) is defined as documented sorafenibrelated grade 3 or 4 adverse events that led to sorafenib discontinuation. NOTE: Sorafenib must be the last antineoplastic treatment before randomization Prior local and/or hormonal therapy (e.g., tamoxifen) before sorafenib is allowed One systemic chemotherapy regimen for advanced HCC is allowed before sorafenib treatment ECOG performance status of â‰¤ 2 ChildPugh A Active bleeding during the last 28 days Prior therapy with mTOR inhibitors Prior liver or other organ transplantation which mandates systemic immunosuppression Other protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply</criteria>
