	<brief_title>Rotational Narrow Strip Versus Full Conjunctival Graft in Pterygium Excision</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pterygium is a raised, wing-shaped growth of fibrovascular tissue that extends horizontally from the bulbar conjunctiva, crossing the limbus, and onto the cornea. It is a common ocular surface disease in Malaysia. Pterygium can cause chronic ocular irritation, redness, tearing, visual impairment and poor cosmesis. Treatment of symptomatic pterygium remains surgical. Surgery should achieve low recurrence rate and acceptable cosmesis. Various surgical techniques had been described with variable success. In this study, we compared the efficacy of Rotational Narrow Strip Conjunctival Graft with the conventional full conjunctival graft in pterygium excision. Patient will be follow up for a year after pterygium surgery. Outcome will be recurrence rate between the two groups at one year. Risk analysis of certain factors that affects the recurrence rate will be discussed.</detailed_description>
