	<brief_summary>This is a prospective, single-arm, post marketing observational study in adult patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who are discontinuing treatment due to lack of efficacy, intolerance or to an incomplete response with either infliximab or etanercept. The aim of this post-marketing observational study is to obtain data on clinical outcomes, compliance and tolerability to determine the effectiveness of switching from infliximab or etanercept to adalimumab. In this cohort, the different treatment strategies are to be studied in the context of the routine clinical practice in the different participating places.</brief_summary>
