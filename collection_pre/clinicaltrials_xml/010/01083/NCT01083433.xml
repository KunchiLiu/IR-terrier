	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to find out ways to help pre-teens and teens and their families to improve diabetes control and to help with the burden of diabetes management. Specifically, the study aims to find out if coming to diabetes clinic more frequently and for a longer period of time helps adolescents with diabetes, and if adolescents who wear a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) for 3-5 days a month will have better diabetes control.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study to Find Out if Intensive Diabetes Clinic and Continuous Glucose Monitors Help Teenagers With Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Good glycemic control is critical in preventing chronic complications of type 1 diabetes. However, achieving good glycemic control remains elusive for many adolescents. This study evaluates two clinic-based approaches for improving glycemic control in adolescents with poorly controlled type 1 diabetes - an intensive diabetes support and education program alone and the same intensive diabetes support and education program together with continuous glucose monitoring - in comparison with standard diabetes care.</detailed_description>
