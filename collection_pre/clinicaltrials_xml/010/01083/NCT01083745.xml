	<brief_summary>The etiology of infertility in the majority of patients with poor response to ovarian stimulation remains unknown. This study will investigate the role of immune cells (T cells, B cells, dendritic cells and NK cells), that constitute the immune system which normally fights infection and cancer. We, the investigators, have found that specialized NK cells that help with new blood vessel formation, are found in the fluid surrounding the egg during IVF, only in patients with good response to ovarian stimulation. We now wish to expand our studies and correlate our findings to ovarian blood flow , as measured by 3D ultrasound and to the presence of other cells in the immune system.</brief_summary>
