	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to compare the incidence of post-repair wound related complications, including hernia occurrence/recurrence, between challenging abdominal wall defects repaired with Strattice(TM) Reconstructive Tissue Matrix (TM) and those managed by standard repair. It is hypothesized that the use of Strattice(TM) TM to reinforce the repair will reduce the incidence of these post-repair complications.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Repair of Challenging Abdominal Wall Defects: Strattice(TM) TM in Abdominal Wall Repair (StAR)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, multicenter, single-blind, randomized, longitudinal, cross-over evaluation of the repair of challenging abdominal wall defects using Strattice(TM) TM or standard surgical repair. These abdominal wall defects can be acute or chronic, and include midline, transverse (including flank) as well as Pfannenstiel incisions. The skin may be closed (fascial dehiscence or incisional hernia) or open (patient with open abdomen or acute fascial dehiscence) with or without evisceration. Patients randomized to the control group who require a re-operation to perform the planned final repair or due to failure of the initial repair within 12 months, will be offered repair with Stratticeâ„¢ TM (i.e. "crossed over") or if such repair not performed, the patient will have completed the study. An adaptive study design will be used to validate the initial conditional power of the study and a balanced randomization, based upon the three conditions (type of defect [dehiscence, hernia repair or open abdomen], morbidity [POSSUM score] and time since exposure of abdominal fascia/viscera) will be used to equally distribute subjects between groups. The primary endpoint of this study is hernia occurrence at 12 months post repair and secondary endpoints include re-operation for abdominal wall repair within 12 months, incidence of complications requiring intervention(medical or surgical) within the first 30 days after repair,, length of hospitalization and resource utilization, and all cause mortality. Subjects will be enrolled and randomized to receive Strattice(TM) TM reinforcement of repair or standard of care repair (i.e. suture alone or suture with absorbable mesh) and followed at set timepoints to observe incision site repair for surgical site events, including reoperation and hernia occurrence.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>adults (18years of age or older) who is able to provide written informed consent for study participation has need of surgical intervention for repair of (potentially) contaminated abdominal wall defect of &gt;3cm and &lt;22cm in length, where the viscera have not been exposed for more than 15 days in case of open abdomen(skin and fascia open). Is willing and able to return for all scheduled &amp; required study visit. at the time of randomization severe systemic sepsis frank pus in the wound, a fistula that will not be closed at the time of surgery or intraabdominal abscess in surgical area, ongoing necrotizing pancreatitis, Is on chronic immunosuppressive therapy, or other medication that influences wound healing requires only shortterm temporary closure, requires a synthetic, nonabsorbable mesh to close the abdominal wall defect is unable to undergo general anesthesia, has other major organ system dysfunction or disorder that would jeopardize subject completing the 24 month study. Is unable to undergo an MRI scan</criteria>
