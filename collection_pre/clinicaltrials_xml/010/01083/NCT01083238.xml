	<brief_summary>AZD5069 is a new drug being tested for the possible treatment of people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This is not the first time that AZD5069 will be administered to humans in clinical trials. We are conducting this study to determine whether AZD5069 is safe and well tolerated by healthy males and females in fed and fasted states. We will compare the way the body handles this drug in the fed and fasted states, in subjects in the age group of 18 to 65 years. We will compare the way the body handles this drug between the age groups of 18 to 65 years and above 65 years. We will also be studying how quickly AZD5069 is absorbed into and cleared by the body.</brief_summary>
