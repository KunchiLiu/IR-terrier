	<brief_summary>With the advances in multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) technology, CT angiography (CTA) of the coronary arteries using 64-slice or dual-source CT systems has evolved into a robust, alternative, noninvasive imaging technique to rule out coronary artery disease (CAD). Reported sensitivities and specificities of coronary CTA can compete with those of catheter angiography. Because CT is the major source of ionizing radiation in medicine, dual isotope myocardial perfusion scintigraphy and coronary CTA 16-, 64-slice MDCT and DSCT scanners are associated with the highest amount of radiation dose. Recently, a new generation of MDCT machines with even more detector row (320) has become clinically available. The maximum detector width of 16 cm enables the entire heart to be examined in a single rotation and within a single heartbeat and is expected to substantially reduce artifacts from breathing and body motion. Due to high volume coverage, 320-slice CT machines are able to perform a nonspiral, ECG-gated examination of the heart within a single breath-hold. The purpose of this study was to investigate the correlation of hemodynamic status of 320 MDCT, echocardiography, and coronary catheterization in patients who suspected coronary artery disease.</brief_summary>
