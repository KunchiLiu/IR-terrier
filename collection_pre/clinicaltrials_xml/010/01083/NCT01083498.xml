	<brief_title>Fractional Laser as Treatment Option for Various Pigment Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Becker's nevus (BN) is an uncommon pigment disorder of the epidermis characterized by increased pigmentation, a slightly elevated, verrucous surface of the affected skin and sometimes hyperpigmentation. No effective treatment is available. Several laser modalities have been applied in the treatment of Becker's nevus in uncontrolled studies with varying results. Recently, fractional laser therapy was suggested as treatment option for Becker's nevus. In fractional laser therapy, microscopic columns of skin are coagulated or ablated, leaving the surrounding tissue intact, which enhances healing of the treated skin. In this study, the efficacy and safety of ablative fractional laser therapy was assessed in the treatment of Becker's nevus.</detailed_description>
