	<detailed_description>Radical prostatectomy (RP) is the most utilized surgical treatment option for localized prostate cancer due to the multi-focal nature of the disease. RP is most suitable for otherwise healthy men whose cancer is limited to a small area. The RP procedure involves removing the prostate gland, seminal vesicles and nearby lymph nodes. One of the most technically challenging and critical aspects in all of these surgical approaches is reconstruction of the interrupted urinary tract by hand sewing the vesico-urethral anastomosis. This is where the bladder neck is sewn to the urethra after the prostate has been removed. CONTINUUM™ (study Device) is to be used as part of the RP procedure by facilitating the approximation of the bladder neck and urethral stump. The Device brings together and holds the tissue in place until adequate natural healing of the vesico-urethral anastomosis occurs thereby minimizing extravasation. The Device also provides a conduit for drainage of urine from the bladder out the urethra during tissue healing. The concept of the CONTINUUM™ device and the feasibility of its operation have been successfully tested in animal and human studies. Pilot clinical studies in the United States (G060095) found that the majority of subjects who received and were discharged with the Device demonstrated a water-tight vesico-urethral anastomosis at the first Device removal visit. Additionally, no unanticipated adverse device effects (UADEs) were reported. The focus of the proposed study is to further verify the performance of the Device in global research centers.</detailed_description>
