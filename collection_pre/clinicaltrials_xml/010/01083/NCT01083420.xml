	<brief_summary>The aim of the present study is to assess the clinical efficacy of topical minocyclin in managing of symptoms associated with oral lichen planus (OLP). The rationale of the study is based on our previous studies demonstrating the beneficial effect of minocyclin mouthwash on recurrent aphthous stomatitis. The planned study will be a randomized controlled, cross-over trail. Patients with symptomatic OLP will randomly receive minocycline or dexamethasone rinses. The patients will rinse and expectorate 5 ml of the 1st mouthwash 4 times daily for 14 days. Subjects will complete a daily follow-up form that includes data regarding the daily intensity of pain (using VAS) caused by OLP and regarding possible side effects. After a washout period (at least 14 days) the patients will repeat the protocol with the second mouthwash.</brief_summary>
