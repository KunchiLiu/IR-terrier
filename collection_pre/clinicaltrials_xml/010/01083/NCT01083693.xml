	<brief_summary>The aim of this post-marketing observational study is to obtain further data on the evaluation of quality of life outcomes of HUMIRA速 in routine clinical use in patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA) or Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS) after unsustainable clinical response to disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARD) and or biological disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (BDMARD). Treatment strategies in moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis and in severe active ankylosing spondylitis commonly consist of introducing biologics after conventional disease modifying antirheumatic drugs or non steroidal antiinflammatory drugs fail. Although biologic disease modifying antirheumatic drugs are generally well-tolerated, intolerances may develop or efficacy may diminish, at which time another biologic disease modifying antirheumatic drug might be considered. This study shall evaluate the quality of life outcomes of HUMIRA速, given after conventional disease modifying antirheumatic drugs and or non antiinflammatory drug failures and or after biological disease modifying antirheumatic drug failures . Failure in this context means primary or secondary loss of efficacy or intolerance to the initial agent.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients age greater than or equal to 18 Patients must fulfill international and national guidelines for use of a BDMARD in RA, PsA and AS (Chest Xray and purified protein derivative (PPD) skin test negative for tuberculosis). In addition one of the following criteria must be fulfilled: unsatisfactory DMARD response defined as failure to treatment with at least two DMARDs including Methotrexate in patients with RA or PsA unsatisfactory NSAID response in patients with AS or unsatisfactory response to prior BDMARDs (in this case patients must have received BDMARDs at least 12 weeks before visit 1) in patients with RA or PsA or AS. Patients who meet contraindications as outlined in the latest version of the Humira syringe速 Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and Humira Pen速 SmPC Patients participating in another study or clinical trial.</criteria>
