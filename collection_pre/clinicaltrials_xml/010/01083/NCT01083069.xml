	<brief_summary>Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) remains one of the major leading causes of death. Cognitive deficits are common in survivors of SCA. Postresuscitative mild induced hypothermia (MIH) lowers mortality and reduces neurologic damage after cardiac arrest. The investigators evaluated the long term neurological outcome after mild hypothermia after restoration of spontaneous circulation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Follow up After Survived Therapy With Mild Induced Hypothermia (MIH) After Restoration of Spontaneous Circulation (ROSC)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Consecutive patients with restoration of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) after resuscitation due to out-of-hospital SCA, admitted to our intensive care unit, underwent MIH. Hypothermia was induced by infusion of cold saline and whole-body-cooling methods (electronic randomization: invasive Coolgard or non-invasive ArcticSun). The core body temperature was operated at 32 to 34 Â°C over a period of 24 hours followed by active rewarming. Neurological status was evaluated at hospital discharge and 6 months after discharge using the Pittsburgh Cerebral Performance Category (CPC).</detailed_description>
