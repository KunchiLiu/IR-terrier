	<brief_title>Menominee Stop Tobacco Abuse Renew Tradition Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Smoking is the leading preventable cause of illness and death. American Indians (AIs) have the highest rate of smoking but very little research has addressed how to help AIs quit smoking. AIs also suffer health disparities related to the addictive use of commercial tobacco. Many AIs also use natural tobacco for ceremonial purposes in addition to using commercial tobacco in an addictive manner. This study will add important new knowledge about how best to help AI smokers quit smoking (addictive use of commercial tobacco) and this is expected to help reduce the prevalence of smoking and smoking-related illness in AI communities. The "Menominee Smoking Cessation Clinical Trial" is a community-based study designed to evaluate a culturally-appropriate, evidence-based smoking cessation intervention for AI smokers. This project joins together collaborators at the University of Wisconsin Center for Tobacco Research and Intervention (UW-CTRI; PI Dr. Stevens Smith; smoking cessation expertise), the UW Carbone Comprehensive Cancer Center (UWCCC), the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee (UWM; Dr. Leah Arndt; qualitative analysis expertise), and the Menominee Tribal Clinic (MTC; Wellness Director Mr. Mark Caskey; MTC Director Mr. Jerry Waukau, an enrolled member of the Menominee Tribe; and Ms. Jodi Fossum, an enrolled member of the Menominee Tribe) that serves Menominee and other AI patients. The study will randomize 150 AI smokers to two treatment conditions: (1) a standard evidence-based smoking cessation treatment condition (FDA-approved varenicline for 12 weeks + 4 counseling sessions), and, (2) a culturally-tailored smoking cessation treatment condition consisting of the standard treatment (FDA-approved varenicline for 12 weeks + 4 counseling sessions) plus culturally-appropriate treatment elements. Follow-up will be conducted at 3 and 6 months post-quit to assess smoking status and other study outcomes. We also plan to collect and analyze qualitative data (this aspect of the study will be led by Dr. Arndt) to learn more about the process and factors associated with cessation of commercial tobacco in American Indians including cultural factors.</detailed_description>
