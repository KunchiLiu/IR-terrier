	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is correlating efficacy of the treatment to the proportion of paclitaxel-dose supplied by the catheter. Forty-five patients each will be treated by paclitaxel-coated or uncoated conventional balloon catheters in randomized order in 3 study centers. Main inclusion criteria are Rutherford class 2 - 5, ≥70% stenosis or occlusion in the superficial femoral or popliteal artery, main exclusion criteria are related to the use of paclitaxel and the need for follow-up examinations. Either clinical or angiographic follow-up examinations are planned 6, 12 and 24 months following the intervention. Primary endpoint is 6-month angiographic late lumen loss. Secondary endpoints are further angiographic and clinical efficacy and various safety criteria.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Paclitaxel-coated Balloons in Femoral Indication to Defeat Restenosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Paclitaxel-coated balloons have been shown to reduce late lumen loss, restenosis rates and the need for repeat target lesion revascularization compared to conventional uncoated balloon catheters. The aim of the study is correlating efficacy of the treatment to the proportion of paclitaxel-dose supplied by the catheter. To this end paclitaxel loss of catheters in the introductory sheaths and residual paclitaxel on used balloons will be determined and correlated to individual data indicating inhibition of neointimal proliferation. According to the study protocol 45 patients each will be treated by paclitaxel-coated or uncoated conventional balloon catheters in randomized order in 3 study centers. Main inclusion criteria are Rutherford class 2 - 5, ≥70% stenosis or occlusion in the superficial femoral or popliteal artery, 3 to 30 cm of length; beyond common contraindications against PTA main exclusion criteria are related to the use of paclitaxel and the need for follow-up examinations. Patients will be blinded against treatment. Blinding of investigators after assignment of a patient to a treatment is not possible due to differences in the appearance of coated and uncoated catheters. Either clinical or angiographic follow-up examinations are planned 6, 12 and 24 months following the intervention. Primary endpoint is 6-month angiographic late lumen loss evaluated by a blinded independent core lab. Secondary endpoints are interventional success rate, restenosis rates, minimal lumen diameter, target lesion revascularization, change in Rutherford class, change in ankle-brachial-index, major amputations, a composite safety endpoint (defined as MAE =death of any cause, target limb amputation, clinically / DUS driven TLR) and all kinds of serious adverse events possibly related to the treatment.</detailed_description>
