	<brief_title>Paclitaxel Eluting Balloon and Conventional Balloon for In-Stent Restenosis of the Superficial Femoral Artery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The superficial femoral artery is a common place for arteriosclerosis in patients symptomatic for lower extremity vascular disease. Advances in percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) and stenting have provided new options for the treatment of the disease in this arterial segment. Restenosis after PTA occurs in 40-60% within one year. A novel attempt to reduce restenosis is the use of paclitaxel eluting balloons (PEB). First clinical studies suggest that the use of PEBs during percutaneous treatment of femoropopliteal disease is associated with significant reductions in late lumen loss and target-lesion revascularization. There is no randomized comparison of these treatments in patients with in stent restenosis of the superficial femoral artery. Thus, the aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of PTA with conventional balloon or PEB for in stent restenosis in the SFA in terms of reduction of diameter stenosis at follow-up angiogram.</detailed_description>
