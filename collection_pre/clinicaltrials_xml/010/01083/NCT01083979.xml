	<brief_title>Intravesical Liposomes for Ulcerative Cystitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A physician sponsored Investigation New Drug (IN) has been acquired from the FDA for compassionate use of this non-approved treatment in one patient from Dr. Peters' private practice. Since this treatment has not been used previously in the US, we propose to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the treatment in this one patient by comparing pre and post treatment symptom changes. Prior to treatment (visit 1) baseline measures will be assessed: vital signs,pelvic/bladder pain on a visual analog scale (VAS; "0" being none and "10" being severe), concomitant medications, Serum pregnancy test and Antiphospholipid Antibody Panel, Urine cytology, urinalysis (dipstick), and culture. At visits 2-5 (4 treatment visits) questionnaires will be completed and vital signs, pain VAS, post void residual (measured by bladder scan or catheter), unanticipated events, and voiding history (voiding diary) will also be assessed. Additionally, cystoscopy will be done prior to the first treatment to view the bladder lining. At each treatment visit, the patients will have a solution of liposomes instilled in the bladder with a catheter, retained for 30 minutes, and be carefully monitored for at least 1 hour after the liposomes are drained. After treatment, visits 6 and 7 (follow up) will include vital signs with VAS pain assessment, post void residual (PVR), urinalysis (dipstick), unanticipated events assessment, questionnaire completion and review of voiding diary. Visit 8 (study exit) will include the same parameters measured at follow up visits 6 and 7 with the addition of cystoscopy and Antiphospholipid Antibody Panel testing.</detailed_description>
