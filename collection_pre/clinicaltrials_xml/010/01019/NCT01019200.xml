	<brief_summary>Psoriasis patients are known to be at increased risk for heart disease. This may be due to the increased prevalence of cardiovascular disease risk factors in this population, including high blood pressure, diabetes, obesity, and high cholesterol. Although cholesterol levels are known to be altered in psoriasis, most studies have used standard lipid profiles to measure cholesterol. These tests indirectly measure LDL (bad cholesterol) and become less accurate when triglyceride levels are high, as often see in individuals with psoriasis. We have designed a case-control study that uses a more specific and detailed cholesterol test to measure serum lipid levels in psoriasis patients, allowing for more accurate determination of LDL and better assessment of the lipid-contribution to cardiovascular risk. We will also measure other markers of inflammation that may contribute to cardiovascular disease.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Adults of both sexes from our dermatology clinic, between the age 18 and 80 years who wish to participate voluntarily in the study and who have signed a written informed consent form to participate. Cases will have a diagnosis of psoriasis as diagnosed by our principal investigator, while controls will be selected from the same dermatology clinic. Current or past use (within 68 weeks) of antihyperlipidemic agents (statins, fibrates, neomycin, niacin, ezetimibe) and/or any other medications significantly affecting lipid metabolism, including cyclosporine, acitretin, protease inhibitors, tamoxifen, clozapine, and estrogen replacement therapy. Presence of secondary causes of hyperlipidemia including diabetes mellitus, smoking, untreated hypothyroidism, nephrotic syndrome, chronic kidney disease, and cholestatic liver disease (e.g. primary biliary cirrhosis). History of cardiovascular disease (e.g. previous myocardial infarction, stroke, or angioplasty performed secondary to atherosclerosis). History of alcohol intake &gt;30 g/day in males and &gt;20 g/day in females. Pregnancy Subjects with conditions or diseases hindering data collection and follow up, such as incapacitating diseases, cognitive deterioration, institutionalized patients.</criteria>
