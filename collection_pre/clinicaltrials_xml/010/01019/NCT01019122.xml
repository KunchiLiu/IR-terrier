	<brief_summary>In 2003, observational growth and bone density data was obtained on children with cerebral palsy (CP) living at Hattie Larlham as part of a study comparing growth with an existing database of children with CP who live at home. The original residents included in that study are now of adult age. Due to the lack of longitudinal bone density measurements in facility-based adults with severe CP, the investigators' objective is to obtain 6-year follow-up data from the residents enrolled in the original study.</brief_summary>
