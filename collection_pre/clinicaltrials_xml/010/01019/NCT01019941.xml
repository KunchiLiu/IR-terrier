	<detailed_description>This is a Phase III study designed to evaluate the pharmacokinetic characteristics of docetaxel between two docetaxel products in patients with advanced solid cancer. This study will also assess the safety of the docetaxel in advanced solid cancer patients.</detailed_description>
