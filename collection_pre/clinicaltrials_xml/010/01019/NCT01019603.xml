	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate the Bioavailability of Tazarotene Foam, 0.1%, and Tazorac Gel, 0.1%, in Subjects With Acne Vulgaris</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A single-center, randomized, open-label, phase 1, comparative bioavailability study in subjects with moderate to severe acne vulgaris. Approximately 30 subjects will be enrolled and randomized to 1 of the 2 study product groups in a 1:1 ratio (tazarotene foam: Tazorac Gel). Study product will be applied once daily for 22 days to the face, upper chest, upper back, and shoulders. Following the baseline visit, subjects will return to the study center daily for study product application. Blood samples to determine plasma concentrations of tazarotenic acid will be collected before study product application on days 1, 8, 12, 15, 18, 20, and 22, and collected at multiple time points over a 72 hour period on days 22 through 25.</detailed_description>
