	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate if supplemental oxygen during air travel can be reliably titrated using a Hypoxia-altitude simulation test (HAST). Also, the effect of oxygen supplementation given with the various oxygen equipment allowed for air travel is studied.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pre-flight Titration of Supplemental Oxygen</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>International guidelines recommend supplemental oxygen if PaO2 &lt; 6.7 kPa (50 mmHg) during air travel. Hypobaric chamber exposure is the ideal test but is not widely available. In clinical practice, the HAST has been recommended as the preferable test for pre-flight evaluation, and is used with increasing frequency. The oxygen dose during air travel has been recommended titrated during HAST. In the study, supplemental oxygen titration during hypobaric chamber exposure is compared to oxygen titration during HAST, to evaluate if HAST can be used with confidence to titrate the amount of supplemental oxygen needed during air travel.</detailed_description>
