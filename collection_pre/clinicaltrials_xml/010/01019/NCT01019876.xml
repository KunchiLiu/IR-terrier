	<brief_title>Risk-Adapted Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation For Mixed Donor Chimerism In Patients With Non-Malignant Diseases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is to determine the toxicity of administering a fludarabine/cyclophosphamide (Flu/CY) or busulfan (Bu)/Flu based conditioning regimen followed by allogeneic stem cell transplant (AlloSCT) in patients with non-malignant diseases.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Patients must meet the eligibility criteria for organ function regardless of diagnosis: Age &lt; 30 or = 30 years of age Adequate renal function defined as serum creatinine &lt; or = 1.5 x normal, or creatinine clearance or radioisotope GFR &gt; or =40 ml/min/m2 or &gt;60 ml/min/1.73 m2 or an equivalent GFR as determined by the institutional normal range Adequate liver function defined as SGOT (AST) or SGPT (ALT) &lt; 5.0 x normal Adequate cardiac function defined as shortening fraction of &gt; or = 28% by echocardiogram, or ejection fraction of &gt; or = 48% by radionuclide angiogram or echocardiogram Adequate pulmonary function defined as asymptomatic or, if symptomatic, DLCO &gt;45% of predicted (corrected for hemoglobin level). If unable to obtain pulmonary function test, O2 saturation &gt;85% in room air. Bone Marrow Failure Syndromes Patients with the following diagnoses are eligible: Severe Aplastic Anemia: Hypocellular bone marrow biopsy (&lt;25% cellularity) and 2/3 of the following (at diagnosis or nadir): Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) &lt;200/mm3, Platelets &lt;20,000/mm3 Reticulocyte count &lt;60,000/mm3 Fanconi Anemia: Abnormal clastogenic studies (all patients) Severe Congenital Neutropenia (Kostmann's Syndrome) Amegakaryocytic Thrombocytopenia Severe thrombocytopenia (&lt; or =20,000/mm3) at diagnosis Severe depletion of megakaryocytes on bone marrow aspirate (&lt; or =25% normal) DiamondBlackfan Anemia: Corticosteroid dependent for &gt; 6 months OR Transfusion dependent OR refractory acquired pure red cell aplasia. Infantile Osteopetrosis SchwachmanDiamond Syndrome Dyskeratosis Congenita Other bone marrow failure syndromes at discretion of coprincipal investigators Immunodeficiencies SCIDS, all subtypes Combined Immunodeficiency Syndrome WiskottAldrich Syndrome Chronic Granulomatous Disease ChediakHigashi Syndrome Leukocyte Adhesion Deficiency Other immunodeficiencies at discretion of coprincipal investigators Inborn Errors of Metabolism (IEOM) Transplant is recommended for the following disorders: Hurler syndrome (alphaLiduronidase deficiency, MPSI), preferably before age 24 months MaroteauxLamy syndrome (galactosamine4sulfatase deficiency,MPSVI) Sly syndrome (betaglucuronidase deficiency, MPSVII) Globoid cell leukodystrophy (galactocerebrosidase deficiency), with careful attention to neurologic status in the infantile form Metachromatic leukodystrophy (arylsulfatase A deficiency),juvenile or adult onset form; late infantile MLD only if presymptomatic Childhoodonset Xlinked adrenoleukodystrophy (XALD), at initial signs of neuropsychological deterioration, with dietary modification prior to transplant Fucosidosis (fucosidase deficiency) Mannosidosis Aspartylglucosaminuria NiemannPick Disease Type B (acid sphingomyelinase deficiency) Other diagnoses may be considered at the discretion of the coprincipal investigators For XALD patients greater than 5 years of age, IQ &gt;80 is required. For other patients greater than 5 years of age, IQ &gt; 70 is required. For Gaucher disease (glucocerebrosidase deficiency) Type I (nonneuropathic), the primary therapy is enzyme replacement, but allogeneic stem cell transplant has been used effectively. Histiocytoses Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) Familial Erythrophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis Patients with multisystem disease whose initial disease is stable or progressive after minimum 6 weeks of appropriate therapy, OR Patients with recurrent multisystem disease. Malignant Histiocytosis Other nonmalignant diseases not listed above may be eligible if deemed appropriate by the coprincipal investigators.</criteria>
