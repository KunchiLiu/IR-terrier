Armodafinil may help relieve insomnia and fatigue in patients with cancer after chemotherapy. PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying how well cognitive behavioral therapy with or without armodafinil works in treating cancer survivors with insomnia and fatigue after chemotherapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy With or Without Armodafinil in Treating Cancer Survivors With Insomnia and Fatigue After Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Detailed DescriptionOBJECTIVES: I. To determine if one or more of the intervention strategies (i.e., CBT-I, armodafinil, or both), when compared to a placebo only group, reduce insomnia in cancer patients following the conclusion of chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy. II. To determine if one or more of the intervention strategies (i.e, CBT-I, armodafinil, or both), when compared to a placebo only group, reduce fatigue in cancer patients following the conclusion of chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy. III. To determine if one or more of the intervention strategies (i.e., CBT-I, armodafinil, or both), when compared to a placebo only group, improve QOL in cancer patients following the conclusion of chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 4 treatment arms (cognitive behavioral therapy, armodafinil, both, or neither). After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 30 days.</detailed_description>
