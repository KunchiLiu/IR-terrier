	<brief_summary>It seems that the aldehydes and NO2, at the levels found indoor, could be the aggravating factors for an allergic response. However this effect has not been demonstrated. The investigators plan to study the effect of exposure to standard doses of these pollutants on the bronchial reactivity as measured by bronchial challenge tests with dust mite extract in volunteers asthmatic, allergic to house dust mite.</brief_summary>
