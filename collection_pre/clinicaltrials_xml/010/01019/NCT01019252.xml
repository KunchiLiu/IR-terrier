	<detailed_description>Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a prevalent, distressing, and interfering condition that affects between 2% and 6% of adolescents. Although medications have been widely used as an effective treatment for many years as the sole treatment for ADHD, for many, clinically significant and interfering continued symptoms remain. Even after medication treatment, adolescents still experience residual ADHD symptoms and continue to have problems with inattention, concentration, disorganization, and other symptoms. However, research suggests that adolescents who have received some benefit from medication treatment can then experience further symptom reduction from participation in skills-based cognitive behavioral therapy. This study, adapted from a similar research study for adults with ADHD, will examine whether cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) plus medication is more effective at treating ADHD than medication therapy alone in adolescents with ADHD. Eligible participants will be randomly assigned to receive twelve weekly treatment sessions either immediately upon enrolling in the study or after a four-month waiting period. Questionnaires (that participants complete and ones that are done with an interviewer) will be used to assess participants' ADHD symptoms at study entry, after receiving the treatment, and at 4 month follow-up. Parents will have some involvement in therapy. Note: participants must be able to come to Boston or another study location in the Greater Boston area for 4 assessment visits and 12 weekly therapy visits in order for participation to be feasible.</detailed_description>
