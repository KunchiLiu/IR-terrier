	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to introduce a new operative technique for reconstruction of fingertip degloving injury.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Innervated Sensory Cross-Finger Flap</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Incidence of fingertip degloving injury is common and can result in functional morbidity. A cross-finger flap based on the dorsal branch artery (DBA) including sensory nerve is a useful reconstructive technique.In our modification, the innervated sensory flap is vascularized by the DBA, both its pedicle is narrow and its coverage is extended, the projecting tip of exposed distal phalanx of adjacent digits therefore can be wrapped.</detailed_description>
