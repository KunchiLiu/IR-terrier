	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to find out the outcomes of using the PASS LP System to correct idiopathic scoliosis. This system is a unique set of spinal instrumentation used to surgically correct the rotation and deformity of the spine that is caused by scoliosis. Also, this study wants to find out the effects this system has on the physical appearance and quality of life for patients with scoliosis.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical, functional and radiographic outcomes following the reduction of idiopathic scoliosis. The following will be evaluated 1. The 3D correction of scoliosis: - Reduction of scoliosis in the coronal plane (Cobb angles) - Correction in the sagittal plane (kyphotic and lordotic angles) - Correction of the axial vertebral rotation in the transverse plane 2. The functional and aesthetic outcomes</detailed_description>
