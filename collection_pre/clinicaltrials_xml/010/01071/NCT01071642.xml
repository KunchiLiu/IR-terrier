	<brief_summary>The aim of the current study is to evaluate prospectively whether concomitant administration of RAAS blockers (namely ACE-I and ARBs') influence the change in estimated GFR (eGFR) after administration of contrast media in patients undergoing non-emergent coronary angiography.</brief_summary>
