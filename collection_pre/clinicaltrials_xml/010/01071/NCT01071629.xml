	<brief_summary>Chronic heart failure (CHF) is a common syndrome characterized by several central hemodynamic and peripheral vascular and muscle abnormalities including autonomic imbalance, neuro-hormonal over-activation and decreased oxidative status. In patients suffering from CHF, exercise confers several beneficial effects on the cardiovascular and peripheral systems, mainly by continuous aerobic training. However, interval aerobic training has also been validated as an alternate form of training that increases the exercise capacity of patients who are in CHF. Recent studies have suggested that resistance training alone or as a complementary program besides the traditionally aerobic continuous training might exert favorable effects. However, little it is known about the combined effects of interval and strength training in CHF patients. Aim of this prospective randomized controlled study was to investigate the effects of combined interval and strength training comparing to interval training alone in CHF patients.</brief_summary>
