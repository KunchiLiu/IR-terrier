	<brief_summary>Despite the fact that more than 10% of Americans suffer from migraine, this headache disorder is often not diagnosed and not appropriately treated. The goal of this proposal is to determine whether a migraine protocol designed for use in an emergency room can be used to deliver the headache care that many migraine patients never receive. This is a randomized trial. Consecutive inadequately treated migraine patients will be randomized to TYPICAL care or to COMPREHENSIVE care. Those patients in the comprehensive care arm will receive the following intervention: 1) reinforcement of diagnosis, 2) an adaptable online educational intervention, reading material, and headache diaries, 3) two migraine specific medications and 4) expedited referral to a headache specialist, if needed. Patients in the typical care arm will receive whatever intervention the emergency physician feels is most appropriate. We intend to enroll 21 patients in each arm of this study for a total of 42 patients. Using headache surveys, we will determine if the protocol improves migraine-related pain and functional disability one month after the ER visit.</brief_summary>
