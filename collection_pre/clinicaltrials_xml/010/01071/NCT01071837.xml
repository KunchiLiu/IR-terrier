	<brief_summary>This is a phase II study of APG101 + reirradiation (RT) versus reirradiation. Patients suffering from a malignant brain tumor called glioblastoma having a first or second progression can be included. They will be randomized to RT or RT + APG101. APG101 is a fusion protein (similar to an antibody) and will be administered as a weekly infusion. Patients can stay in this study as long as they benefit from the participation (no fixed end). In this trial, 30-35 sites in Germany, Austria and Russia take part.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In this phase II trial, patients with a recurrence / progression of glioblastoma (first or second progression) either not being eligible for tumour resection or having macroscopic residual tumour after resection of the recurrence can be included (tumor size must 1-4 cm in T1-weighted MRI). They must be candidates for a re-irradiation and will then be randomized in a 1:2 ratio to re-irradiation alone or re-irradiation + 400mg APG101 as a weekly intravenous infusion. Radiotherapy (RT) is considered standard of care and not a study procedure. As prior therapies, a first radiotherapy (maximal dose of 60 Gy; at least 8 months since the end of preirradiation), a prior surgery (at least for histology) and at least one Temozolomide-containing chemotherapy are mandatory; patients with prior treatment with bevacizumab, iodine seeds and/or brachytherapy are not eligible. The patients' steroid dose must be stable or decreasing upon inclusion. The number of patients to be included in this study is up to 83 (depending on the statistical 2-step SIMON design). Primary objective: 6 months rate of progression free survival (PFS6). Subjects can participate in this study as long as a clinical benefit is considered by the treating physician. MRI tumour imaging will be carried out every 6 weeks.</detailed_description>
