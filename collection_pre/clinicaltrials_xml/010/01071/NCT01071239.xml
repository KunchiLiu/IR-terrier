	<brief_summary>The trial proposed is a single arm phase II treatment protocol designed to examine engraftment, toxicity, graft-versus-host disease, and ultimate disease-free survival following a novel cytoreductive regimen including busulfan, cyclophosphamide and fludarabine and anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG- a non-chemotherapy drug whose role is to kill your immune system) for the treatment of patients with Fanconi anemia who have severe aplastic anemia (SAA), or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), lacking HLA-genotypically identical donors using stem cell transplants derived from (1) HLA-compatible unrelated donors or (2) HLA haplotype-mismatched related donors.</brief_summary>
