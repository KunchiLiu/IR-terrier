	<brief_summary>This application proposes a prospective, single arm feasibility clinical trial of a 12-week period of combined endurance and resistance training in survivors of childhood cancer who were treated with doxorubicin and/or daunorubicin and have impaired cardiac function. Baseline and post intervention imaging, laboratory, and neuropsychological evaluations will be used to determine the effects of the intervention on body composition, serum lipid profile, exercise tolerance, and neurocognitive functioning. Participants will be called weekly to monitor compliance with the intervention. Incentives will be given at intervals during the trial to optimize compliance with the intervention.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study will evaluate the feasibility of a 12-week exercise intervention on the cardiac function of survivors of childhood cancer treated with anthracyclines and known to have cardiomyopathy. As a secondary objective, the study will document the effect of a 12-week exercise intervention on exercise tolerance, as determined by measurement of peak VO2 and peak exercise workload, shortening fraction, ejection fraction, and left ventricular wall thickness, and assess the impact of the intervention on neurocognitive functioning in survivors of childhood cancer treated with anthracyclines and known to have cardiomyopathy.</detailed_description>
