	<brief_title>Efficacy of Statins In Prevention of CIN</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Due to the conflict in the available data, there are no practice guidelines that are established in order to prevent contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN). Our goal is to determine if statin therapy plus intravenous normal saline, in patients with chronic renal insufficiency undergoing angiography, is superior to placebo plus intravenous normal saline therapy in the prevention of CIN.</detailed_description>
