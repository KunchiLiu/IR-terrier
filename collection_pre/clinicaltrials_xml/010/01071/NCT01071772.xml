	<brief_summary>Diabetes and Heart Failure are diseases with high morbidity and increased risk of death. Former investigations has shown that diabetes worsens the prognosis of heart failure. However it is uncertain how short term diabetic dysregulation in type 2 diabetics affect cardiac function. Our hypothesis is that short term dysregulation affects left ventricular function and exercise capacity in insulin treated type 2 diabetics with and without heart failure. To elucidate this hypothesis diabetic patients with and without heart failure will be investigated after overnight state of either high or normal blood glucose levels on two separate occasions. Metabolic and hormonal parameters will be measured. Systolic and diastolic cardiac function will be assessed, exercise capacity and post exercise regional myocardial tissue velocity as well as 6 minutes walk test will be investigated on both occasions. The study will be a randomized cross-over design.</brief_summary>
