	<brief_title>Trial of a Secondary Stroke Prevention Program</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Stroke is a major cause of death and disability. A history of stroke is the strongest predictor of a future stroke. Control of risk factors lowers the risk of future stroke, yet most persons with stroke do not have their risk factors controlled. In this randomized-controlled trial, we will test whether an outpatient stroke prevention program consisting of group clinics, patient self-management, and telephone care coordination can lower the risk of recurrent stroke by improving patient knowledge, medication adherence, and lifestyle habits. If successful, this program may be adapted to other settings.</detailed_description>
