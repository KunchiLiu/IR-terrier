	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the capecitabine or 5-fluorouracil selection, according to polymorphisms in TS-3'UTR and ERCC1-118, to be combined with oxaliplatin or irinotecan as first-line chemotherapy in advanced colorectal cancer</brief_summary>
