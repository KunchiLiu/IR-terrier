	<brief_summary>Randomized controlled trial including 100 subjects with rheumatic diseases and biological treatment with a 28 point-Disease Activity Score(DAS28)3.2 or less. The subjects will be randomized to either nurse-led clinic or rheumatologist-led clinic. The hypothesis is that there will be no difference in DAS28 between the two groups after 1 year follow-up.</brief_summary>
