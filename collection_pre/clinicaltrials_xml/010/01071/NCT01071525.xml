	<brief_summary>1. Treatment of Hypercholesterolemic patients with niacin will cause a significant decrease in oxidative stress and a decrease in the atherogenecity in blood samples of the patients. 2. A possible correlation between oxidative stress in hypercholesterolemic patients taking niacin to clinical hypercholesterolemia parameters is possible. 3. Using a novel biomarker will enable a precise detection of the change in the oxidative stress in hypercholesterolemic patients.</brief_summary>
