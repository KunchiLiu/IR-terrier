	<brief_summary>Between 100 up to 200 adults undergoing HSCT for their primary disease will be included in this pharmacokinetic/pharmacogenetic study. In the preparative protocol Busulfan (BU)will be included as indicated in a known protocol. The GST polymorphism (A1,M1,T1 and P1) will be investigated using real time PCR. A correlation between pharmacokinetic parameters and patients polymorphism will be performed using known statistical technics for comparison. The aims of this study are, to correlate the demographic data, clinical presentation, clinical outcomes of the included individuals, the BU kinetics and the GST polymorphism and to establish an outcome "map" for those who receive HSCT for their primary disease.</brief_summary>
