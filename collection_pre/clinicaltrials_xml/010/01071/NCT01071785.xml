	<brief_summary>Metabolic Syndrome (MS) is an clinical condition with high cardiovascular risk. More than 80% of DM patients had MS. Dietary factors can be associated to both, DM and MS. Therefore the aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of add soluble fiber (goma-guar) in the usual diet of type 2 DM with MS and compare this intervention with an usual diet without this supplement.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dietetic Intervention With Soluble Fiber in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (DM) Patients With Metabolic Syndrome (MS)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of soluble fiber (guar gum) on the MS components (International Diabetes Federation-2005 and WHO): blood pressure, plasma glucose, triglycerides, HDL, central obesity (waist, BMI),and albuminuria. Secondary objectives are: effect of guar gum on serum fatty acids, , PCR, endothelin 1, and fibrinogen. Primary outcomes were alterations on MS components. Forty-four type 2 diabetic outpatients were included in a randomized clinical trial: treatment 1- guar gum (10g/day) + usual diet; treatment 2- usual diet. The duration of each treatment was six weeks. Three days weight diet records with concurrent 24h urinary collections (protein intake estimative), clinical and laboratory evaluation were performed at baseline and after 4 and 6 weeks. Serum fatty acids were measured in total triglycerides fractions by gas chromatography.</detailed_description>
