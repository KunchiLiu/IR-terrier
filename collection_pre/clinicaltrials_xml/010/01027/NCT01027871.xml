	<brief_summary>Comparison of fasting blood glucose levels in patients with Type 2 diabetes after 12 weeks of treatment with a new basal insulin analog or with insulin glargine.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study for Patients With Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients in this study will continue to use their stable prestudy dose of metformin and/or a sulfonylurea. Prestudy therapy also includes once daily insulin glargine or NPH insulin. The 12-week active treatment phase will be followed by a 4-week follow-up period, during which patients will return to the basal insulin recommended by the investigator.</detailed_description>
