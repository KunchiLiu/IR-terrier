	<brief_summary>Laparoscopic fundoplication is increasingly performed in paediatric surgery. Many types of fundoplication are performed, each has advantages and disadvantages. The Nissen operation is the most frequently performed procedure in the U.K., however it can be associated with post-operative dysphagia. The relative benefits between Nissen and other fundoplication techniques in children are still uncertain. The aim of our study was to compare the long-term outcomes following laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication with laparoscopic Thal fundoplication in children.</brief_summary>
