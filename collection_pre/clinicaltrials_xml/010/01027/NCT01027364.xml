	<brief_summary>The primary objectives of the study were: to evaluate the safety and tolerability of rFIXFc; to evaluate the efficacy of rFIXFc in all treatment arms; to evaluate the effectiveness of prophylaxis over on-demand (episodic) therapy by comparing the annualized number of bleeding episodes between participants receiving rFIXFc on each prevention (prophylaxis) regimen and participants receiving rFIXFc on an episodic regimen. The secondary objectives of the study were: to evaluate and assess the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameter estimates of rFIXFc and rFIX (BeneFIX®) at baseline in the Sequential PK subgroup as well as rFIXFc at Week 26 (±1 week); to evaluate participants' response to treatment; to evaluate rFIXFc consumption.</brief_summary>
