	<brief_summary>Polyphenols belong to the largest group of secondary metabolites produced by plants, mainly, in response to biotic or abiotic stresses such as infections, wounding, UV irradiation, exposure to ozone, pollutants, and other hostile environmental conditions. It is thought that the molecular basis for the protective action of polyphenols in plants is their antioxidant and free radical scavenging properties. These numerous phenolic compounds are major biologically active components of spices, aromas, essential oils, and traditional medicines. In order to investigate the impact of spice polyphenols on postprandial cytotoxic lipid peroxidation products (MDA) levels in humans, the investigators propose to achieve the following specific aims using a randomized crossover study design: 1. To determine the effect of a ground beef patty meal with and without spices on postprandial levels of plasma malondialdehyde (MDA). 2. To determine the effect of a ground beef patty meal with and without a spice blend on MDA accumulation in urine. This study will determine whether spice polyphenols exert a beneficial effect by inhibition of the absorption of MDA. These findings may help to explain the potentially harmful effects of oxidizable fats found in foods and the important benefit of dietary polyphenols in ameliorating this potentially harmful effect.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>10 male subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus who will be recruited based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. The study will be carried out in accordance with the guidelines of the Human Subjects Protection Committee of the University of California, Los Angeles. All subjects will give written informed consent before the study begins. After the screening visit, each subject will come to the Center for Human Nutrition on two 1-day test phases separated by at least one week. At each of phases, subjects will consume, in a random order, two different test meals consisting of either: a) a ground dark meat beef patty seasoned with salt only, or b) a ground dark meat beef patty seasoned with a spice mixture and salt. The subjects will be asked to avoid eating meat, poultry, or fish products for 3 days before the day of each of the two experimental phases</detailed_description>
