	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to determine whether implantation of a multifocal IOL with a modified addition at lens plane(Restor +3) results in better intermediate visual acuity with similar performance at distance and near compared to other multifocal IOL with similar design but with higher addition at lens plane. Patient's contrast sensitivity of vision and best reading distance following Restor +3 implantation were also assessed. Study hypothesis: the implantation of an intraocular lens (IOL) with a modified addition at lens plane (restor +3, Alcon Laboratories,Inc) results in better intermediate visual acuity with similar distance and near visual acuity after cataract surgery.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients with bilateral visually significant cataract with corneal astigmatism lower than 1.0D (diopters) will be eligible for inclusion in the study. Exclusion criteria will be any ocular diseases, such as corneal opacities or irregularity, dry eye, amblyopia, anisometropia, glaucoma, retinal abnormalities, surgical complications, IOL tilt, IOL decentration greater than 0.4 mm (estimated by retroillumination), or incomplete follow-up. Patients will be examined before surgery and at 1, 7, 30, 90 days and 3and 6 months after surgery.</detailed_description>
