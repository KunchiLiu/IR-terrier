	<brief_title>Effect of Tranexamic Acid on Reducing Postoperative Blood Loss in Cervical Laminoplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tranexamic acid, an inhibitor of fibrinolysis, has proven to be effective in reducing perioperative blood loss in patients undergoing total hip and knee arthroplasty. However, limited numbers of well-controlled trials in spinal surgery have been conducted due to heterogeneity in the performed surgical procedures.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients who were scheduled to undergo cervical laminoplasty from C3 to C6 for cervical multilevel compressive myelopathy with a narrow spinal canal for which nonoperative therapy had failed. Patients with chronic renal failure, cirrhosis of the liver, serious cardiac disease, allergy to TXA, a history of thromboembolic disease, and bleeding disorders, as well as those who were currently receiving antiplatelet and/or anticoagulant drugs, were excluded from this study.</criteria>
