	<brief_summary>The investigators will make a prospective study in which they will look at the economics and security of the treatment of patients with acute coronary syndrome. The investigators want to do a randomized trial. One group will be treated as they have been treated at Ullev√•l University Hospital (UUS) in recent years, and the other group will be returned to their refering hospital the same day. The objective of this study will be to provide increased knowledge about whether the rapid discharge from the intervention center is associated with differences in costs or security.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Acute Coronary Syndrome Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The topic of this study is whether patients with Acute coronary syndrome (ACS)may can be transferred to their refering hospital same day that they arrived intervention hospital. This is to see if one can reduce the hospital stay and costs for the intervention center, and the total hospitalization time. and this rapid transport not give more medical complications Our 1 hypothesis is that patients with ACS, who are transported back to the refering hospital the same day, will reduce the length of stay in intervention center without an increase for the stay at the refering hospital. Our 2 hypothesis is that patients with ACS, who are transported back to the refering hospital the same day as the treatment is performed, have no more complications than those who stay overnight in the intervention hospital.</detailed_description>
