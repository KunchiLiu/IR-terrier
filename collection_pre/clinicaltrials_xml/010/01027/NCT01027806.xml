	<brief_summary>The investigators leading hypotheses are: - Oral therapy with montelukast may lead to improved sleep study findings in children with mild to moderate Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS) who require surgical removal of adenoids and tonsils for OSAS. - A significant proportion of the children with OSAS treated with montelukast will show reduced severity of OSAS, and this will remove the need for surgical intervention.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Eligible for inclusion in the study will be symptomatic snoring children &gt;2 years of age and &lt; 10 years of age, who snore and have an apnea hypopnea index (AHI) &gt;2/hrTST (hour total sleep time), and in whom T&amp;A is therefore contemplated. Also among these, we will include children referred for evaluation for snoring who have a history of allergic rhinitis. Exclusion criteria will include: Hypersensitivity to montelukast, immunodeficiency or immunosuppressant therapy, craniofacial, neuromuscular, syndromic or defined genetic abnormalities, acute upper respiratory tract infection, systemic corticosteroid therapy or antibiotic therapy in the 2 weeks previous to the study, and children who already had adenotonsillectomy. In addition, children chronically receiving oral antihistamine preparations or nasal decongestants will be required to continue using these medications throughout the duration of the study. Patients receiving immunotherapy will continue on the same regimen without escalation of dose and frequency throughout the duration of the study. In addition, patients with severe OSA who in the opinion of their treating physicians require early surgical intervention for their OSA will be excluded from eligibility to the study.</criteria>
