	<brief_summary>The purpose of this project is to evaluate the efficacy of a web-based curriculum designed to teach pediatric practitioners how to provide injury prevention anticipatory guidance, emphasizing firearm injury prevention in a clinic setting. Data will be collected regarding the curriculum's effectiveness using a web-based questionnaire which will be administered to pediatric residents prior to, immediately post, and six months following completion of the curriculum. Pre- and post-test questionnaires will be compared. Residents will also be asked to evaluate the curriculum by completing a survey. We hypothesize that the curriculum will improve residents' knowledge, attitudes and beliefs, and self-efficacy regarding firearm injury prevention anticipatory guidance.</brief_summary>
