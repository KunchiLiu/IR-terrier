Thirty subjects will be randomly divided in two groups: Group 1 will receive tretinoin cream that should be applied daily in areas affected by stretch marks. Group 2 will receive 16 sessions of dermabrasion that would be held in the research center. Subjects will be evaluated by pictures, measurement of width and length of stretch marks, using Mirror System(Canfield). Biopsy to quantify alterations of epidermis and dermis of treated area, will be held pre-treatment and 2 weeks after the conclusion of treatment. For biopsy will be used a punch of 3mm. The results will be evaluated two weeks after the conclusion of the interventions. An independent dermatologist, blinded for intervention, will analyse pictures pre and post treatment.
