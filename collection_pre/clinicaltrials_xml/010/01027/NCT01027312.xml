	<brief_title>Assessment of Ability Related to Vision</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study is designed to test the usefulness and repeatability of testing how much disability is caused by vision loss due to glaucoma. We are recruiting 100 patients with glaucoma and 20 healthy (have no eye disease) individuals to be enrolled in this study. The healthy study participants will be enrolled in order to describe how a healthy individual will perform on the test designed to assess one's performance when completing ten activities of daily living. Clinical testing will be conducted by binocular and monocular visual fields, contrast sensitivity and visual acuity. The NEI-VFQ 15 Quality of Life Questionnaire will be used to measure patients perception of how well they are doing.</detailed_description>
