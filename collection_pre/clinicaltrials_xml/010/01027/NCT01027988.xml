	<brief_summary>Earlier studies have found that retinal photography could be very useful for evaluating the condition of microcirculation and the risk of cardiovascular diseases in patients. The architectural changes in retinal vascularisation strongly correlates with macrovascular remodeling. Also, recent founding suggests a possible close anatomical parallel between both the macrovascular and the microvascular blood. Our objectives are to assess (1) in which age and sex subgroups, if any, retinal vascular alteration in arterioles and venules can be predictive for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality; and (2) whether variations in arteriolar or venular caliber will predict better cardiovascular pathogenesis in normal and patient population. If the association between the diameter of the retinal vessels and the risks of cardiovascular disease is verified during this study, the impact on prevention would be enormous. The retinal microvascular change could become a powerful biomarker in the early detection of the cardiovascular pathogenesis and death risk</brief_summary>
