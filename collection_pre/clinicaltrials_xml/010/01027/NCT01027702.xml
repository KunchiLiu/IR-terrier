	<brief_title>Donor Lymphocyte Infusion After Alternative Donor Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Studies have shown that giving donor T cells after a mismatched T cell-depleted stem cell transplant can speed up recovery of T cells in the patient. This approach can cause severe graft versus host disease (GVHD). The purpose of this study is to determine whether giving a donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) with methotrexate can accelerate immune recovery in recipients of T cell-depleted stem cell transplants. Thirty days after a T-cell depleted transplant, patients will be given a DLI. They will be monitored for immune recovery as measured by CD4 count and for GVHD toxicity. Patients will be separated into six cohorts based on dose of DLI received: 3 x 10^4, 4 x 10^4, 5 x 10^4, 6 X 10^4, 8 x 10^4, and 10 X10^4 cells/ kg of body weight. A minimum of 3 patients will be tested at each dose starting with the lowest dose. Dose escalation will continue until the dose associated with CD4 count &gt;100 at Day +120 after transplant without significant GVHD is determined. All patients will receive thirteen doses of methotrexate after the DLI to prevent GVHD. Patients will be followed for 2 years for outcomes.</detailed_description>
