	<criteria>Subjects who the investigator/coinvestigator believes that their parent(s)/Legally Acceptable Representative(s) (LAR(s)) can and will comply with the requirements of the protocol. A male or female between, and including, 90 and 118 days of age (3 months) at the time of the first vaccination. Written informed consent obtained from the parent(s)/LAR(s) of the subject. Healthy subjects as established by medical history and clinical examination before entering into the study. Born after a gestation period of 36 to 42 weeks inclusive. Use of any investigational or nonregistered product (drug or vaccine) other than the study vaccines within 30 days preceding the first dose of study vaccine(s), or planned use during the study period. Chronic administration of immunosuppressants or other immunemodifying drugs since birth. Planned administration/administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol during the period starting from 30 days before the first dose of study vaccine(s) and ending on the last study visit, with the exception of Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine, Hepatitis B Vaccine, Bacille CalmetteGu√©rin vaccine, Oral Polio Vaccine, Japanese encephalitis, measles and rubella, varicella, mumps, and flu vaccines. Concurrently participating in another clinical study, at any time during the study period, in which the subject has been or will be exposed to an investigational or a noninvestigational product (pharmaceutical product or device). Administration of any pneumococcal vaccine since birth except for the DTPa group for whom vaccination with a licensed pneumococcal vaccine by catchup schedule will be allowed only if the 2 vaccine doses are administered between Study Visit 4 and 5, i.e. from the second blood sampling timepoint (Visit 4) onwards and up to 7 days before the booster dose of the DTPa vaccine. Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, based on medical history and physical examination (no laboratory testing required). History of, or intercurrent diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis disease. History of any reaction or hypersensitivity likely to be exacerbated by any component of the study vaccines. Major congenital defects or serious chronic illness. History of any seizures or progressive neurological disease. Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products since birth or planned administration during the study period. Child in care. Acute disease and/or fever at the time of enrolment.</criteria>
