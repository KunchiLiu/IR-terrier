	<criteria>Radiological diagnosis of resectable pancreatic carcinoma is required prior to treatment. Potentially resectable is defined as no extrapancreatic disease, no evidence (on CT) of involvement of the celiac axis or superior mesenteric artery, no evidence (on CT or MRI) of occlusion of the superior mesenteric vein or superior mesentericportal venous confluence. No evidence of metastatic disease as determined by chest CT scan, abdominal CT scan (or MRI) 18 years of age or older ASA Performance status of 1 to 3 Women of child bearing potential must practice adequate contraception and refrain from breast feeding. Female patients must have a negative pregnancy test within 7 days of treatment Informed consent Locally irresectable pancreatic cancer distant metastases medically unfit for surgery Pregnant or lactating women prior chemotherapy or radiation treatment Other serious uncontrolled medical conditions that the investigator feels might compromise study participation Unwillingness to participate or inability to comply with the protocol for the duration of the study Major surgery, excluding laparoscopy, within 4 weeks of the start of study treatment, without complete recovery Participation in other interventional trials</criteria>
