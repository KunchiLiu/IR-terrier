	<detailed_description>Ten subjects with impaired glucose tolerance were assessed in a crossover trial. A standard 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was served with placebo or cinnamon capsules. Finger-prick capillary and venous blood samples were taken before and 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180 min after the start of the OGTT to measure glucose, and insulin.</detailed_description>
