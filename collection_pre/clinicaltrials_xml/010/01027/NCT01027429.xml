	<brief_title>Simplified Antibiotic Therapy for Sepsis in Young Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objective To evaluate if out-patient (clinic-based) therapy of young infants with possible serious bacterial infection with 7 days of intramuscular procaine penicillin and gentamicin (reference therapy) is equivalent to: - (1) injectable gentamicin once daily and oral amoxicillin twice daily for seven days; - (2) injectable penicillin and gentamicin once daily for two days followed by oral amoxicillin twice daily for five days; and Hypothesis The proportion of babies who fail therapy at (or before 7) days will be 10% in each group. A 5% or less difference in failure rates will be considered equivalent. Study Design This will be a randomized, three arm, open-label equivalence trial among young infants, 0-59 days of age who are diagnosed as having possible serious bacterial infection in one of the Karachi field clinics, and whose families refuse facilitated hospital referral, and the infants meet other specified inclusion criteria. Eligible young infants will be recruited from among those referred to the clinics by trained community health workers as having clinical signs predictive of possible serious illness during regular home visits in the surveillance area, or those presenting directly to the clinics from the areas under pregnancy and newborn surveillance. A diagnosis of possible sepsis will be made by clinicians if specified clinical criteria are met.</detailed_description>
