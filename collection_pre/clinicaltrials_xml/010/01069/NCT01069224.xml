	<brief_summary>Role of proinflammatory factors in Patients with Rotator Cuff Disease Objective: To measure the levels of various cytokines and metalloproteases in patients with rotator cuff disease, and control group and to determine the correlations among them.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Analysis of Proinflammatory Factors in the Synovial Fluid In Patients With Rotator Cuff Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We hypothesize that cytokines and MMP's level will be significantly higher in patients with RC pathology than in control group and will be related to the time frame since injury (i.e. - higher levels as close to the injury). In addition we will examine possible relation of those levels to the pain curve by using Visual Analogue Scale.</detailed_description>
