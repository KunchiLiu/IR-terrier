	<detailed_description>The purpose of the present study is to evaluate the occurrence of first trimester bleeding among patients with abnormal uterine artery Doppler. A prospective study is designed and two groups will be studied; patients with abnormal uterine artery Doppler at second trimester (study group) and patient with normal uterine artery Doppler at second trimester (control group). Both the study group and the control group represent high risk pregnant patients and the Doppler flows are done as part of the patient's predictive risk for placental associated abnormalities. The patients will be asked, as part of the routine history taken before the US about having first trimester bleeding during the current pregnancy.</detailed_description>
