	<brief_summary>To evaluate the knee functionality, screw integrity, graft integrity, cartilage effect, and bony ingrowth in patients treated with the CALAXO screw and MILAGRO screw two years after ACL reconstruction.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) Reconstruction- Bioabsorbable Screw</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will combine the use of survey response, MRI, and x-rays of the knees in Dr. Spindler's ACL reconstructed patients in order to examine long term healing of two types of bioabsorbable screw. We will use a 2-4 yr time point to look at patient reported symptoms of pain and swelling from the surveys and use the x-rays and MRIs to look at absorption of the screw, healing of the graft, and body reactions to the screw.</detailed_description>
