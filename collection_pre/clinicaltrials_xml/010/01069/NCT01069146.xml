	<brief_summary>Objectives: to evaluate the feasibility, the safety and the effects on physiological parameters of mild therapeutic hypothermia during septic shock. Design: a randomized, controlled, pilot physiological study. Setting: a 15-beds university-affiliated intensive care unit of a teaching Hospital. Patients: twenty ventilated and sedated adults patients with septic shock Intervention: Mild therapeutic hypothermia between 32 and 34Â°C during 36 consecutive hours using an external water cooling blanket.</brief_summary>
