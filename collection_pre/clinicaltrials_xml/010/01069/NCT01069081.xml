	<brief_title>Docetaxel and Cisplatin Chemotherapy With or Without High Dose Proton Pump Inhibitor in Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>High dose proton pump inhibitor (PPI) has been proved beneficial and it improved efficacy when combined with chemotherapy in preclinical and clinical trials.This study was designed to explore whether adding a proton pump inhibitor into docetaxel and cisplatin chemotherapy improves efficacy and does not affect tolerability in metastatic breast cancer.</detailed_description>
