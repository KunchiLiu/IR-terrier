	<brief_summary>The purpose of this trial is to investigate whether irrigation solution (soap vs. saline solution), or irrigation pressure (high vs. low) will decrease the rate of infection among patients with open fracture wounds.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fluid Lavage of Open Wounds (FLOW): Pilot Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Open fractures are an important source of morbidity and are associated with delayed union, nonunion, and infection. Preventing infection through meticulous irrigation and debridement is an important goal in management, and different lavage fluids and irrigation techniques (e.g. high or low pressure lavage) have been described for this purpose. There are, however, a limited number of randomized trials comparing irrigating solutions or irrigating technique. We compared the use of castile soap versus normal saline, as well as high versus low pressure pulsatile lavage on the rates of reoperations and complications in patients with open fracture wounds.</detailed_description>
