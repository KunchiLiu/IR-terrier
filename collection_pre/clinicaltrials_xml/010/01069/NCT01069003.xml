	<brief_summary>EDUCATE is a prospective, multi-center study designed to collect real-world safety and clinical outcomes in subjects receiving one or more Endeavor Zotarolimus-Eluting Stents and either clopidogrel and aspirin or prasugrel and aspirin as part of a dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) drug regimen.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>EDUCATE: The MEDTRONIC Endeavor Drug Eluting Stenting: Understanding Care, Antiplatelet Agents and Thrombotic Events</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To provide clinical information on rates of late and very late stent thrombosis after Endeavor Drug-eluting Stent (DES)placement in an all comers population with a broad range of bleeding and thrombosis risk. EDUCATE will further analyze the current practice of clinicians regarding temporary cessation of antiplatelet therapy and its association with clinical outcomes. In addition, patients included in this broad Endeavor registry will also be contributed to the DAPT native study population for analysis of 12 vs 30 months duration of dual antiplatelet therapy.</detailed_description>

Subject switched thienopyridine type or dose within 6 months prior to randomization. Planned surgery necessitating discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy within the 18 months following randomization. Percutaneous coronary intervention or cardiac surgery between 6 weeks post index procedure and randomization. Planned surgery necessitating discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy within the 21 months following randomization. Current medical condition with a life expectancy of less than 3 years. Subjects on warfarin or similar anticoagulant therapy.</criteria>
