	<brief_title>The Effect of High Protein Diet Versus a Low Fat Diet on Body Weight After Smoking Cessation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sustained smoking cessation is one of the most effective therapies to avoid premature morbidity and mortality. However, weight gain associated with nicotine withdrawal may attenuate some of the beneficial health effects and is cited as a major obstacle to quit smoking. The mechanism for the weight gain is not elucidated but reduced resting metabolic rate, reduced total energy expenditure, increased caloric intake and changes in fat metabolism may be involved. Elucidating effective strategies to prevent or reduce post-cessation weight gain may improve health outcomes of smoking cessation.</detailed_description>
