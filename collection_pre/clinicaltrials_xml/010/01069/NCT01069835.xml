	<brief_summary>The overall aim of the study is: To provide accurate and reliable information regarding NSCLC clinical management across Central Eastern European countries and Russia in order to detect unmet medical needs of this disease in terms of: - Patient and hospital characteristics. - Diagnostic and treatment approaches: initial and subsequent. - Follow-up patterns in clinical management. - Outcomes: symptoms, death, functionality, quality of life. - Use of resources and burden on patients and health care systems. Addendum objective is to collect epidemiological data on EGFR mutation status (M+, M-) in the Russian population</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Confirmed NSCLC diagnosis (e.g.bronchoscopic biopsy or FNAB), all stages, men and women, attending the responsible department of treating this type of patients for the first time between January 1st, 2010 and March 31st, 2010 For Patient Reported Outcome (PRO) subsample: ability to read and write since they will be asked to participate in the PRO part of the study. Selection will not be based on the disease stage of each patient, in order to avoid a selection bias. Tumour tissue samples (in paraffinembedded blocks) suitable for EGFR mutation testing available. Mixed histology of small cell and nonsmall cell lung cancer.</criteria>
