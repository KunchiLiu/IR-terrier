	<brief_summary>This is a research study to see whether fat accumulation either under the skin or in the body's organs, for example, the liver, improves in men and women who take a drug called telmisartan. The investigators will be looking at how the amount of fat in the body changes when HIV-positive persons on effective anti-HIV therapy take telmisartan. The investigators will be using a CT scan to make this comparison. Telmisartan is not an HIV medication. It is a medication used to treat blood pressure, but has been shown to decrease fat in the organs in people both with and without high blood pressure. The study involves 8 visits over a period of about 24 weeks.</brief_summary>
