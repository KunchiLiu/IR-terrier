	<brief_summary>Chemoradiotherapy has become the standard of care for women with locally advanced cervical cancer. The available data support a 30 to 50% reduction in the risk of death from cervical cancer for women with locally advanced disease undergoing radiotherapy (RT) and concomitant cisplatin-based chemotherapy compared to RT alone. Despite the fact that this is currently the best treatment of locally advanced cervical cancer, 5-year overall survival is still only 52%. The fully human, agonist monoclonal antibody mapatumumab binds to the Tumor necrosis factor-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand Receptor 1 (TRAIL-R1, DR4) and induces cytotoxicity in multiple tumor cell lines in vitro and in vivo. In multiple phase I and phase II studies, mapatumumab appeared to be safe both as single agent and in combination with chemotherapy, including cisplatin. In cervical cancer cell lines, mapatumumab induced apoptosis in 51% of the cells. Mapatumumab in combination with irradiation increased apoptosis to 83%. In this phase 1b/2 study, the investigators will evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of mapatumumab in combination with cisplatin and radiotherapy in patients with locally advanced cervical cancer.</brief_summary>
