	<brief_summary>Swedish celiac disease women living on a gluten-free diet for years report poorer subjective health and more bowel complaints than Swedish women of same age in general population.

	<brief_title>Celiac Disease School for Women Living on a Gluten-free Diet</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Celiac disease is a disorder of the small intestines triggered by dietary gluten, a protein in wheat-containing foods. Living with is far from easy and associated with restrictions and various dilemmas in daily life, leading to depressed mood and reduced well-being, particularly in women. We decided to include 100 celiac disease women on a gluten-free diet into a randomized controlled education trial in order to compare problem-based learning with usual care. Outcome measures will be two frequently employed questionnaires: PGWB (Psychological Well-being Index) to monitor Well-being and GSRS (Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale) to measure the rate bowel symptoms as assessed at 6 months after the intervention.</detailed_description>
