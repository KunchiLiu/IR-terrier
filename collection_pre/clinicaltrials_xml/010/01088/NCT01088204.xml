	<brief_title>Feasibility Study of Laparoscopy-assisted D2 Distal Gastrectomy to Treat Advanced Gastric Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To test oncological feasibility, compliance of nodal dissection was selected as a primary end point. When there are more than two missing nodal station(no lymph nodes in dissected area), it is defined as a non-compliant nodal dissection. Other secondary outcomes will be supplementary to evaluate feasibility of D2 dissection.</detailed_description>
