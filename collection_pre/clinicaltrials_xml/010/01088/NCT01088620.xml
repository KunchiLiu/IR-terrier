	<brief_summary>The purpose of this trial is to estimate the therapeutic efficacy of the experimental targeted regimen including the EGFR antibody panitumumab (in combination with pemetrexed and cisplatin) in relation to the standard combination in patients with a KRAS wild-type stage IIIB or IV primary nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer. It is expected that the progression free survival rate at 6 months is improved by the targeted regimen.</brief_summary>

Subject (male or female) is not willing to use highly effective methods of contraception (per institutional standard) during treatment and for 6 months (male or female) after the end of treatment (adequate: oral contraceptives, intrauterine device or barrier method in conjunction with spermicidal jelly). Serious concurrent diseases. Major surgery within the last 4 weeks before recruitment Ontreatment participation in a clinical study in the period 30 days prior to inclusion.

Patient with mild to moderate renal insufficiency who are unable to interrupt salicylates (like aspirin) or other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) for a 5day period starting 2 days before administration of pemetrexed (8day period for longacting agents such as piroxicam). Exception: Low dose aspirin (acetyl salicylic acid) intake up to 150 mg per day is permitted without interruption.
