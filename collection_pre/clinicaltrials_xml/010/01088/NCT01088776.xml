	<brief_summary>Children with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) are at very high risk for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Hyper-lipidemia, a traditional risk factor for Cardiovascular Disease (CVD), occurs early in the progression of kidney failure; timely identification and intervention is prudent. Currently, there is no known effective therapy for hypertriglyceridemia, the most common lipid abnormality. n-3FA, in doses ranging from 2-6 g/day have effectively lowered elevated triglyceride (TG) levels by 20-50% in a variety of adult populations; however, their use in children with CKD has not been tested in a randomized controlled fashion. This study will provide important information on the safety, efficacy and tolerance of n-3FA in lowering elevated TG levels in children and adolescents with CKD.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Omega-3 Fatty Acid Supplementation in Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Following counseling on dietary and lifestyle changes to lower triglyceride levels, and a period of applying these modifications, children will be assigned in a random fashion to take either fish oil supplements or a placebo (soybean/corn oil) for 8 weeks. After this 8-week treatment period, children will not take a supplement for 4 weeks and then will be assigned the alternate product (fish oil or placebo) for another 8 weeks. Our main interest is to see whether there is a larger decrease in triglyceride levels after taking the fish oil supplement compared to the placebo. The primary objective of this study is to determine whether omega-3 fatty acid supplements, given at therapeutic dosages over an 8-week period, significantly decrease elevated serum TG in children with CKD; The secondary objectives of this study are: i. To evaluate the effect of n-3 fatty acid supplements on total-, LDL-, and HDL-cholesterol; ii. To determine whether n-3 fatty acid supplements are well tolerated by our study participants; and iii. To test whether TG-lowering effects are sustained up to 4 weeks after stopping supplements.</detailed_description>
