	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the safety and clinical activity of idelalisib in combination with an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (mAb), a chemotherapeutic agent, an mTOR inhibitor, a protease inhibitor, an antiangiogenic agent, and/or an immunomodulatory agent in participants with relapsed or refractory indolent B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), or chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Age ≥ 18 Previously treated with relapsed or refractory disease (refractory defined as not responding to a standard regimen or progressing within 6 months of the last course of a standard regimen) Disease status requirement: For CLL patients, symptomatic disease that mandates treatment as defined by the International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Lymphoma (IWCLL) 2008 criteria For indolent NHL and MCL patients, measurable disease by CT scan defined as at least 1 lesion that measures &gt; 2 cm in a single dimension WHO performance status of ≤ 2 For men and women of childbearing potential, willing to use adequate contraception (ie, latex condom, cervical cap, diaphragm, abstinence, etc.) for the entire duration of the study. For Cohort 7 only: Women of child bearing potential must have 2 negative pregnancy tests prior to starting Lenalidomide. Able to provide written informed consent Is not a good candidate to receive any of the drugs administered in the study for a given disease (idelalisib, bendamustine, rituximab, ofatumumab, fludarabine, everolimus, bortezomib, or chlorambucil), according to the clinical judgment of the investigator Patients with atypical immunophenotype with t(11:14) translocation or cyclin D1 over‑expression (CLL patients only) Had radiotherapy, radioimmunotherapy, biological therapy, chemotherapy, or treatment with an investigational product within 4weeks prior to the baseline disease status tests Had treatment with a short course of corticosteroids for symptom relief within 1‑week prior to the baseline disease status tests Has had an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant Has known active central nervous system involvement of the malignancy Is pregnant or nursing Has active, serious infection requiring systemic therapy. Patients may receive prophylactic antibiotics and antiviral therapy at the discretion of the investigator Has absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &lt; 1000/µL, unless it is related to underlying CLL, MCL or indolent NHL, the latter documented by &gt; 50% infiltration of bone marrow by tumor cells Has platelet count &lt; 75000/µL, unless it is related to underlying CLL, MCL, or iNHL, the latter documented by &gt; 50% infiltration of bone marrow by tumor cells Has serum creatinine ≥ 2.0 mg/dL For Cohort 7 only: Has creatinine clearance &lt; 60 mL/min Has serum bilirubin ≥ 2 mg/dL (unless due to Gilbert's syndrome) for patients with iNHL or CLL; for patients with MCL, serum bilirubin ≥ 1.5 x upper limit of normal Has serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≥ 2 x upper limit of normal Has ChildPugh Class B or C hepatic impairment Has a positive test for HIV antibodies Has active hepatitis B or C (confirmed by RNA test).
