	<brief_summary>Gut microflora-mucosal interactions may be involved in the pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy of Duolac7S in changing the colonic microflora and improve the symptoms in IBS sufferers. In all, 64 patients with Rome III positive diarrhea type IBS will complete a 6-week multiple centre controlled clinical trial. Patients will be randomized to receive either 2 capsules/day Duolac7S or 2 capsules/day placebo. IBS symptoms will be monitored and scored according to Likert scale. Changes in faecal microflora, stool frequency and form, quality of life (QOL) scores will be also monitored.</brief_summary>
