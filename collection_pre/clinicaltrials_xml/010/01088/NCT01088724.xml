	<brief_title>Fludarabine, Cyclophosphamide, Doxorubicin and Rituximab for the Treatment of Post-transplant Lymphoproliferative Disease (PTLD)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Eligible to this study were patients less than 18 years old, presenting with non Burkitt, aggressive, CD20 positive PTLD, after solid organ transplants. Induction therapy consisted of two cycles of a combination of Fludarabine(30mg/sqm/day, days 1,2,3), Cyclophosphamide (750 mg/sqm/day, day 1), Doxorubicin (30 mg/sqm/day, day 1)and Rituximab (375 mg/sqm/day, day 4). Thereafter consolidation therapy was given as follows: two blocks for stage II or III with LDH less than 500 IU/L; three blocks for stage III with LDH &gt;500 and &lt; 1000 IU/L or stage IV with LDH &lt; 1000 IU/L; four blocks for stage III or IV with LDH &gt; 1000 IU/L. Blocks given were modified BFM blocks used for treatment of non Hodgkin B-lymphomas, as follows: Block 1: High Dose Methotrexate (HDMTX) 1.5 gr/sqm; Vincristine (VCR,1.5 mg/sqm); Cytarabine (from 120 to 150 mg/sqm x4); Ifosfamide (600 mg/sqm/day x5); VP-16 (80 mg/sqm/day x2); Dexamethasone (DXM,10 mg/sqm/day for 5 ays); Intrathecal Methotrexate-Cytarabine-Methylprednisolone(TIT). Block 2:HDMTX (3 gr/sqm); VCR (1.5 mg/sqm); Daunomycin (20 mg/sqm/day x2); Cyclophosphamide (160 mg/sqm/day x5); DXM (10 mg/sqm/day x5); TIT Block 3:Vindesine (3 mg/sqm); Cytarabine (3000 mg/sqm q 12 hours x4); VP-16 (100 mg/sqm q 12 hours x4); DXM (20 mg/sqm/day x5); Block 4 as Block 1. Outcome measures are: achievement of complete remission after induction therapy; incidence of infectious episodes; neurological toxicity; incidence of graft rejection; duration of complete remission.</detailed_description>
