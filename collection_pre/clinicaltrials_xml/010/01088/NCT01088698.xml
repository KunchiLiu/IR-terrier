	<brief_summary>Golimumab, a TNF-alpha antibody, has been approved in the EC and USA for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis. The aim of this study is to determine in a randomized half-side comparison whether additional narrowband UVB-311nm phototherapy accelerates and improves the clearance of psoriatic skin lesions in golimumab-treated patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Golimumab Plus UVB-311nm in Psoriasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Psoriatic skin lesions of patients with psoriatic arthritis who receive standard treatment with golimumab (50 mg or 100 mg s.c. once a month depending on total body weight whether below or above 100 kg, respectively) are exposed to UVB-311nm phototherapy on a randomized body half (left or right; head exempt) 3 x per week for six weeks and/or until complete response (defined as reduction in PASI to &lt; 3). A patient qualifies if A) golimumab was started within a week or B) after 3 months of golimumab treatment the PASI reduction is smaller than 90%. PASI score, patient visual analogue score (VAS) for therapeutic response, and patient VAS for severity of skin lesions is assessed weekly; and at follow-up visits at month 3, 6, and 12. The primary hypothesis is that phototherapy increases the PASI reduction on the exposed body site by more than 20%. Paired Wilcoxon testing for differences in PASI and patient VAS scores is done; Fisher exact test is applied to determine differences in complete remission, PASI reduction &gt; 90%, &gt; 75% and/or 50% between body sites.</detailed_description>
