	<brief_summary>This is a cross-sectional study including patients with permanent atrial fibrillation. Assessment will include: - clinic blood pressure measurements (mercury sphygmomanometer and automated oscillometric device) - 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring - determination of various serum markers and cardiac ultrasound. - evaluation of a 24h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring device (Microlife WatchBPO3) in terms of its diagnostic value for the detection of atrial fibrillation compared with the reference 24h Holter ECG</brief_summary>
