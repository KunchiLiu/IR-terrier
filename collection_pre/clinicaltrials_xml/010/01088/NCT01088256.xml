	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to determine the efficacy of etoricoxib on pain patients. The investigators assume that patients with neuropathic pain will have greater pain relief then patients on placebo.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy of Etoricoxib on Peripheral Hyperalgesia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Animal experiments analysing anti-hyperalgesic effects of Coxibs show inconsistent results due to different used dosages and varying different pain models. Theoretical the use of NSAIDs is rational, particularly of Coxibs as a part of the neuropathic pain management. But in the newest topical review, there is no valid information available about the effectiveness of these drugs in human neuropathic pain models or in patients with different underlying mechanism, e.g. with or without hyperalgesia.</detailed_description>
