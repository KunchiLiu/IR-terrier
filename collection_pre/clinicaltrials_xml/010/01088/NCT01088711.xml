	<brief_summary>This study will test the safety and tolerability of omarigliptin. It is hypothesized that administration of once-weekly omarigliptin in obese but otherwise healthy participants, and in obese participants with Type 2 diabetes (T2D) will be sufficiently safe and well tolerated to permit continued clinical investigation.</brief_summary>
