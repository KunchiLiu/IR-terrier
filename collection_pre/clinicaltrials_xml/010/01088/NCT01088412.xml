	<brief_summary>GeNeSIS is an open-label, multinational, multicenter, observational study to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Humatrope treatment. GeNeSIS is a modular program that includes: - Core study: Evaluating the safety and effectiveness of Humatrope in the observational setting - Genetic Analysis Sub-study: Investigating the genetic defects underlying growth hormone (GH) deficiency and non-GH-deficient growth disorders - Growth Prediction Sub-study: Working to validate and refine specific models to accurately predict growth response to GH - SHOX Deficiency Sub-study: Elucidating the clinical, endocrine and radiological features of patients with SHOX deficiency due to loss of, or mutation in the SHOX gene (including patients with Turner syndrome) - Neoplasia Sub-study: To characterize the natural history of neoplastic disease, especially in relation to recurrence/progression of primary neoplasia or development of secondary neoplasia in children with a history of neoplasia</brief_summary>

	<criteria>All patients participating in GeNeSIS must be enrolled in the core study. Patients for whom written consent to release information is provided may enter the core study if they meet any of the following inclusion guidelines: Treatment with Humatrope for improvement of growth. No treatment with somatropin in patients with a history of neoplasia or in those with any SHOXrelated disorder. Patients with closed epiphyses are not eligible for GeNeSIS entry. However, patients may remain in the study if epiphyseal closure occurs during study participation.</criteria>
