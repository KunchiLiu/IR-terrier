	<brief_title>Imaging of ER Density to Guide and Improve Tailored Therapy for Acquired Anti-hormonal Resistant Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The estrogen receptor (ER) is expressed in approximately 70% of the breast carcinomas. In general, for these patients anti-hormonal therapy is the therapy of first choice. Despite good responses in 50-60% of the patients, unfortunately all patients develop (acquired) resistance. Patients with acquired anti-hormonal resistance can be subdivided into three different groups: (1) patients that have lost ER-expression (~25%), (2) patients with preserved ER-expression (~55%) and (3) patients with enhanced ER-expression (~30%). Several studies suggest different treatment strategies for these three different ER-phenotypes in antihormonal resistant breast cancer. In patients with acquired anti-hormonal resistance, ~30% of the patients still respond to hormone-additive therapy with estrogens. In vitro studies have shown estrogen-induced apoptosis in long-treated estrogen deprived cells (simulating aromatase inhibitor resistance). It is suggested that this estrogen-hypersensitivity is accompanied by increased ER-expression. Whole-body imaging of ER-density is now possible with positron emission tomography with the 16-alpha[18-fluoro]-17beta-estradiol tracer (FES-PET). FES-PET has shown to be a predictive biomarker for response to first line anti-hormonal therapy. In this study we will include 50 patients, heavily pretreated with anti-hormonal therapy. All patients will undergo FES-PET at baseline and start estrogen therapy. Investigators and patients will be blinded for FES-PET results. Responders and non-responders will be defined using RECIST criteria and clinical follow-up. After response has been determined, FES-PET results will be analyzed. We hypothesize that patients responding to estrogen therapy can be identified on basis of high ER-expression determined by FES-PET.</detailed_description>
