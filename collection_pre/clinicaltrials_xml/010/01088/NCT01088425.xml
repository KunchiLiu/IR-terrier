	<brief_summary>Great scientific effort has been made to improve practical as well as economical procedures of modern assisted reproduction. In the last years a shift from the well established method of slow-rate freezing to vitrification of 2PN zygotes and embryos could be observed. Like any other method of cryopreservation, the outcome of vitrification will be affected by several factors related to technique itself, its practical management and patient characteristics. The investigators want to investigate the influence of vitrification on the outcome of of 2PN oocytes, pregnancy and infant health. A Comparison between a cohort of spontaneous conceived children and children of vitrified and slow- cooled 2PN oocytes is planned.</brief_summary>
