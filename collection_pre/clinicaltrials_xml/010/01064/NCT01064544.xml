	<brief_summary>Previous research has shown that sleep quality in hemodialysis patients is disturbed. One of the possible explanations is an insufficient or disturbed melatonin rhythm. Melatonin rhythm is regulated by exposure to light. In this feasibility study, the investigators examine the effects of light therapy during dialysis on sleep, melatonin rhythm and mood.</brief_summary>
