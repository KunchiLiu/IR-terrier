	<brief_summary>Intraventricular hemorrhage comprises about 15% of the 500,000 strokes that occur annually in the United States. In the emergent setting, patients with obstructive hydrocephalus are routinely treated with placement of an external ventricular drain. This study will compare the effect of external ventricular drainage plus intraventricular thrombolysis versus external ventricular drainage plus endoscopic evacuation on neurologic outcomes for patients with hydrocephalus from intraventricular hemorrhage.</brief_summary>
