	<brief_summary>After bariatric surgery , thromboembolics complications are major cause of mortality. However, in obese patients, thromboprophylaxia is a controversy. Fondaparinux' efficacy is superior to HBPM, and is a good treatment for this population. Pharmacokinetics information with Fondaparinux in this population are rare.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fondaparinux Population Pharmacokinetic to Morbid Obese Patients in Post-operatory Bariatric Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We proposed a bicentric study cohort of obese patients (BMI &gt; 40 kg/m2) treated by 1 day injection of Fondaparinux 2.5 mg after bypass surgery. Anti-Xa activity of Fondaparinux will be measured 4 times during hospitalisation for each patient to realise a pharmacokinetic modelisation of Fondaparinux. Haemorrhage and thromboembolics events will be collected.</detailed_description>
