	<brief_summary>Skin infections may complicate the treatment of atopic dermatitis.The use of topical ointments has become very important to avoid the use of oral antibiotics. There is little supporting literature regarding the use of topical antibiotics in secondarily infected atopic dermatitis. This study will investigate the safety and effectiveness of Altabax ointment use in treating secondarily infected atopic dermatitis caused by Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy Study of Altabax Ointment in the Treatment of Secondarily Infected Atopic Dermatitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Atopic dermatitis patients are commonly secondarily infected with Staphylococcus aureus and/or Streptococcus pyogenes, more recently with Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), due to impaired barrier function. As cutaneous infections such as MRSA and others may complicate the treatment of atopic dermatitis, the use of topical antibiotics have become very important to avoid oral antibiotics and their side effects, especially in the pediatric population. The current study will investigate the safety and efficacy of Altabax ointment use for treatment of secondarily infected lesions caused by Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes in both the pediatric and adult populations.</detailed_description>
