	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Vorinostat may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays and other types of radiation to kill tumor cells. Giving vorinostat together with chemotherapy and radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of vorinostat when given together with cisplatin and radiation therapy in treating patients with stage III or stage IVa squamous cell cancer of the oropharynx which is either unresectable or borderline resectable.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ph I Vorinostat in the Treatment of Advanced Staged Oropharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the maximally tolerated dose of Vorinostat in combination with concurrent chemoradiotherapy for the treatment of advance stage OPSCC. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: l. To determine the complete response rate, overall survival and progression free survival using the maximally tolerated dose of Vorinostat. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess treatment related acute and late toxicities when combining Vorinostat with chemoradiation and correlate these toxicities to molecular markers of apoptosis in tumor and normal oral mucosa. II. To evaluate the effect of Vorinostat on tumor immune surveillance, particularly in HPV positive patients. III. To illustrate that Vorinostat alters the methylation status of commonly methylated genes in OPSCC. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of vorinostat. Patients receive oral vorinostat on days 0-2 and cisplatin IV on days 7, 21, and 35. Patients undergo radiotherapy 5 days a week beginning on day 7. Patients also receive concurrent oral vorinostat along with the radiotherapy to be given 3 days per week (Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday). Treatment continues for 7 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.</detailed_description>
