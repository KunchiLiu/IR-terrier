	<brief_summary>This is an open-label, dose escalation, safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic study, where active study drug (QPI-1007) will be given to all patients who participate. This study will determine whether QPI-1007 is safe when it is injected into the eye. The study will also reveal if there are any side effects of the drug and how long it takes for the body to clear the drug.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Study of a Single IVT Injection of QPI-1007 in Chronic Optic Nerve Atrophy and Recent Onset NAION Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients will be enrolled according to one of two sets of criteria designated as Stratum I and Stratum II. 1. Stratum I will enroll Optic Nerve Atrophy patients who meet necessary criteria. Stratum I will consist of a maximum of 6 cohorts and each cohort will enroll 3 to 6 evaluable patients. Enrollment in Stratum I is now closed. 2. Stratum II will enroll patients diagnosed with acute Non Arteritic Anterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy (NAION) within 28 days of symptom onset who meet necessary criteria. Stratum II will consist of a maximum of 3 cohorts and each cohort will enroll up to 10 evaluable patients. Enrollment in Stratum II is still open.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Key Stratum I (Chronic Optic Nerve Atrophy) "Legally blind" in the study eye as the result of an irreversible condition affecting the posterior segment of the eye. Clear ocular media and able to undergo adequate pupil dilation. Visual acuity and visual field in the nonstudy eye are better than or equal to the study eye At least 21 years old. Key Stratum I (Chronic Optic Nerve Atrophy) For the study eye only: history of any IVT injection or vitrectomy, vitreous hemorrhage, retinal detachment, or active inflammatory condition (e.g. conjunctivitis). For either eye: history of uveitis. Enrollment is now closed in Stratum I. Key Stratum II (Acute NAION) Positive diagnosis of NAION with symptom onset within 28 days prior to planned dosing with QPI1007. Visual acuity in the study eye is between 20/40 and light perception. Clear ocular media and able to undergo adequate pupil dilation. At least 50 years old. Key Stratum II (Acute NAION) For the study eye only: Macular disease, retinopathy, or other eye disease limiting visual acuity; prior intraocular surgery (other than Lasik) and cataract surgery within 3 months prior to dosing; glaucoma laser surgery within 1 month prior to dosing; pain on or aggravated by eye movement; history of vitreous hemorrhage; history of retinal detachment; any active inflammatory condition (e.g. conjunctivitis); glaucoma or ocular hypertension; or intraocular pressure &gt; 26 mmHg. For either eye: History of optic neuritis; or history of uveitis. Received any treatment for NAION prior to dosing. Any other abnormality which in the opinion of the investigator is suggestive of a disease other than NAION in the study eye only. Clinical evidence of temporal arteritis. History of collagen vascular disease or other inflammatory disease, or history of multiple sclerosis. Enrollment in Stratum II is still open.</criteria>
