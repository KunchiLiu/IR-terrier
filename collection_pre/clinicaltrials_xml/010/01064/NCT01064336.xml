	<brief_summary>Since Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP) affects women who are of reproductive capacity and taking into account the lack of data concerning Eltrombopag (Promacta) use during pregnancy, the Eltrombopag (Promacta) Registry will be an essential component of the ongoing risk management for Eltrombopag (Promacta). The Registry will detect and record the events (live births, spontaneous abortions, stillbirths, elective terminations, therapeutic terminations, any serious pregnancy outcome, major and minor congenital anomalies, outcomes including preterm, small for gestation age, or intrauterine growth restriction adverse adverse effects on the following: immune system development, platelet number and function, neoplasm formation, bone marrow reticulin formation, thrombotic events) in the mother and/or the neonate/infant. The adverse events in the infant will be assessed through at least the first year of life. The Pregnancy Registry will compare the pregnancy and fetal outcomes of women exposed to eltrombopag Tablets during pregnancy to an unexposed control population. This study will be a prospective observational, exposure follow-up study.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Documentation that Eltrombopag is being taken during pregnancy. Timing of the prenatal exposure to Eltrombopag (i.e. best estimation of which trimester in pregnancy that there was exposure to Eltrombopag for stratification and reporting purposes). Sufficient information to determine whether the pregnancy is being prospectively or retrospectively registered. Whether the outcome of pregnancy was known at the time of the report. Source of the report (i.e. health care professional, patient). Full provider contact information to allow for followup (name, address, etc.) None</criteria>
