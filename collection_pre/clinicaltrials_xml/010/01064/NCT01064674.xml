	<brief_summary>Due to rising importance of cardiovascular disease before and after renal transplantation we have changed our standard diagnostic procedure and perform stress echocardiography and myocardial scintigraphy. We would like to monitor these results and the outcome of our patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cardiovascular Evaluation Before Renal Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic kidney disease is a well-known risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Patients waiting for a renal transplantation usually undergo an extensive diagnostic procedure to avoid complications after transplantation such as neoplasia or inflammation. In the past years, cardiovascular complications before and after renal transplantation have gained more attention. We therefore have changed our standard diagnostic procedure before renal transplantation and perform stress echocardiography and myocardial scintigraphy. Thus we would like to evaluate our new standard diagnostic procedure and observe the results of these diagnostic procedures as well as their impact on clinical outcome.</detailed_description>
