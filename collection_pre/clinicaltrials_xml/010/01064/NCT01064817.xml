	<brief_summary>This study will assess the safety and tolerability of PRM-151 administered as a subconjunctival injection and explore the effect of PRM-151 on various correlates of the wound healing process that occurs in the eye after glaucoma filtration surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PRM-151 in the Prevention of Scarring Following Trabeculectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Glaucoma is a disease of the eye which affects the optic nerve (the nerve that sends signals from the eye to the brain) and is associated with visual field defects and potential blindness. The treatment of glaucoma involves lowering the pressure in the eye, which is often (but not always) elevated due to accumulation of fluid inside the eye that cannot drain away. In the operation called trabeculectomy (a type of filtration surgery), a small channel is created through the sclera (the white of the eye) to allow accumulated fluid to drain away. Scarring may occur after surgery when, during healing, too much collagen (a type of protein) is deposited in the channel. This causes the channel to seal up and the pressure inside the eye to build up again. The study will be conducted in patients suffering from glaucoma who are due to undergo trabeculectomy. Patients will be randomized to have either PRM-151 or placebo.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Men or women of nonchildbearing potential (WONCBP) aged 18 years and older at screening. Diagnosis of chronic angleclosure glaucoma or openangle glaucoma, phakic or pseudophakic, with visual field or optic disc changes characteristic of glaucoma. For pseudophakic glaucoma patients, the cataract surgery performed was with phacoemulsification and through a corneal incision. Suitable candidate for trabeculectomy in the study eye which the physician deems as medically necessary. Diagnosis of glaucoma other than chronic angleclosure glaucoma or openangle glaucoma (ie., uveitic, traumatic or neovascular glaucoma). Any previous ocular surgeries in the study eye involving the upper conjunctiva and sclera. History of laser surgeries in the study eye within 90 days before day 1. Presence or history of any disease that could affect wound healing. Any asymmetric abnormality of the anterior segment which requires additional intervention (surgery or medication). Any abnormality other than glaucoma in the study eye that could affect tonometry. Presence or history of uveitis within 10 years or any other ocular infection or inflammation within 14 days before day 1. Clear corneal phacoemulsification performed within 90 days before day 1.</criteria>
