	<brief_summary>The objectives of this study are to assess migration of the MIS Stem compared to the Synergy Hip System, and to assess the long-term safety and effectiveness of the study device using Radiostereometric Analysis (RSA). This study will document any device-related surgical or post-operative complications and adverse radiographic observations. Patients meeting the entrance criteria specified in this protocol will be randomized as they become available.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mini Stem Radiostereometric Analysis Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of the current investigation is to compare migration of the device after implantation with a modular, short hip stem called the "MIS Stem" or a standard THA using the Synergy Hip System using Radiostereometric Analysis (RSA). The intended use of this product is for patients with inflammatory and non-inflammatory degenerative joint disease who require a primary total hip replacement.</detailed_description>
