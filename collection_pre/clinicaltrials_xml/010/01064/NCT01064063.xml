	<brief_summary>This evaluation is being conducted on the relative new knee system, the Vanguard Cruciate Retaining (CR) to evaluate clinical efficacy of the Vanguard CR components.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomized Controlled Clinical Evaluation to Compare Vanguard Cruciate Retaining and AGC Total Condylar Knee Implants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This clinical trial was initially designed as a multi-centre, randomized controlled study, comparing the Vanguard CR with the AGC in routine use. The study now is a single centre study. The Vanguard CR system has been specifically designed to give greater knee stability through the use of more anatomic patello-femoral kinematics.</detailed_description>
