	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if LY2189265 is effective and safe in reducing hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), as compared to placebo (no medicine), or exenatide in participants with Type 2 Diabetes. The participants must also be taking metformin and pioglitazone.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study in Participants With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>During the study, if a participant developed persistent, severe hyperglycemia despite full compliance with the assigned therapeutic regimen, the participant received additional therapeutic intervention or initiation of an alternative antihyperglycemic medication following study drug discontinuation (rescue therapy). Participants who received rescue therapy were included in the analysis population, but only measurements obtained prior to the beginning of rescue therapy were included in specified analyses.</detailed_description>
