	<brief_summary>Intrauterine injection of hCG around the time of implantation may increase endometrial Treg cells and improve implantation. It has been demonstrated that regulatory T cells expand during pregnancy. hCG was found to be secreted by the embryo immediately after fertilization and has chemoattractant properties to Treg cells.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intrauterine Human Chorionic Gonadotrophins (hCG) and Endometrial Treg Cells</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aim of the work: To study the effect of intrauterine injection of human chorionic gonadotrophin on the endometrial T regulatory cells (Treg cells)and the electromicroscopic endometrial characteristics. Background: It has been demonstrated that regulatory T cells expand during pregnancy and are present at the feto-maternal interface at very early stages in pregnancy. Rational: Intrauterine injection of hCG around the time of implantation may increase endometrial Treg cells and improve implantation. Methods: Intrauterine injection of 100 IU hCG will be done followed by endometrial biopsy to check for Treg cells and pinopodes.</detailed_description>
