	<detailed_description>Targeted SCLC chemotherapy with VP-16 and personalized patient-specific biomarkers (SNPs) We obtained the IND 78,420 Exemption Letter from FDA like as Drug Sponsor on 04/29/2009. In future, any IND is not required to conduct our further relative clinical studies. // We obtained DHHS and IRB approval document: Federal-wide Assurance (FWA) for the Protection of Human Subjects for Institutions within the United States (FWA: 00015357). So we can develop our further relative clinical studies in USA. Our Further Retrospect Clinical Study will use Combined Chemotherapy on ETOPOSIDE INJECTION plus CARBOPLATIN INJECTION or Combined Chemotherapy on ETOPOSIDE INJECTION plus CISPLATIN INJECTION to treat Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC) patients, and will try to look for the relationship between the ETOPOSIDE INJECTION therapeutic efficacy and the Topoisomerase II SNP Genotyping, and the relationship between the ETOPOSIDE INJECTION therapeutic safety and the CYP4503A4 SNP Genotyping, based on precisely sequencing drug targets' genes. The treatment option must be ETOPOSIDE INJECTION plus CARBOPLATIN INJECTION or ETOPOSIDE INJECTION plus CISPLATIN INJECTION, but the the specific SCLC patients, who had used the ETOPOSIDE INJECTION or the ETOPOSIDE INJECTION plus CISPLATIN INJECTION until right now, have had to survive over 2 years. According to Etoposide Injection Directions, the Etoposide efficacy target may be Topoisomerase II and the Etoposide metabolism target should be CYP4503A4. // We hope to discover the Topoisomerase II SNP Genotypes which could be more relative to higher therapeutic efficacy, and the CYP4503A4 SNP Genotypes which could be more relative to lower therapeutic risk. We will assay Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) of Etoposide (VP-16) drug target (Topoisomerase II) which are effectiveness-associated, and will assay Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) of Etoposide (VP-16) drug target (CYP4503A4) which are risk-associated in the specific SCLC patients who are surviving after 2 years used Combined Chemotherapy on ETOPOSIDE INJECTION plus CARBOPLATIN INJECTION or Combined Chemotherapy on ETOPOSIDE INJECTION plus CISPLATIN INJECTION, based on precisely sequencing drug targets' genes. In the Retrospect Stage, 400 SCLC patients, used the Combined Chemotherapy on ETOPOSIDE INJECTION plus CISPLATIN INJECTION at all times since 2 years ago until right now, like as the usual approach group. // In the Retrospect Stage, 400 SCLC patients, used the Combined Chemotherapy on ETOPOSIDE INJECTION plus CARBOPLATIN INJECTION at all times since 2 years ago until right now, like as the study approach group. // In the Retrospect Stage, the usual approach group 400 SCLC patients will continue to be used the Combined Chemotherapy on ETOPOSIDE INJECTION plus CISPLATIN INJECTION. // In the Retrospect Stage, the study approach group 400 SCLC patients will continue to be used the Combined Chemotherapy on ETOPOSIDE INJECTION plus CARBOPLATIN INJECTION. // All of oncology drugs must be approved by USA FDA and must be sold on USA market legally. // The dosages about all of oncology drugs must abide by their labeling in USA. We need use the SCLC patients' tissue or humoral specimens to assay the Topoisomerase II SNP Genotypes and the CYP4503A4 SNP Genotypes with precisely sequencing drug targets' genes in USA.</detailed_description>
