	<brief_summary>PF 04620110 is an acylCoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1) inhibitor that is being developed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). It is anticipated that PF 04620110 will have anti diabetic effects through inhibition of intestinal triglyceride absorption and potentially weight loss. The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of multiple oral formulations of PF 04620110 administered to healthy volunteers.</brief_summary>
