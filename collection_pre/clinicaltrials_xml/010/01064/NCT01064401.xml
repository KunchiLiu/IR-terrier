	<brief_summary>The primary study objective is to test the superiority of Daclizumab High Yield Process (DAC HYP) compared to interferon β 1a (IFN β-1a) in preventing multiple sclerosis (MS) relapse in participants with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis. The secondary study objectives are to test the superiority of DAC HYP compared to IFN β-1a in slowing functional decline and disability progression and maintaining quality of life in this participant population.</brief_summary>
