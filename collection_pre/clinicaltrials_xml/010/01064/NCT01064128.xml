	<brief_summary>Purpose: The attempt to further reduce the operative trauma in laparoscopic hysterectomy led in new technique such as Single-Port Access (SPA) laparoscopic surgery. This new technique is considered as painless procedure and better cosmetic effect but there are not any publications to study a possible different pain score and cosmetic effect in new techniques versus conventional laparoscopic hysterectomy. In this randomized controlled study the researchers have investigated the pain scores and cosmetic satisfaction by modified body image scale and cosmetic scar scale.</brief_summary>
