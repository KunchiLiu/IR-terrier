	<brief_summary>This is an observational, physiology pilot study of subjects with overactive bladder, insomnia and normal subjects. No study drug will be given. All subjects will complete a one week sleep diary and a 3-day bladder diary. After one week, subjects meeting eligibility requirements will complete a single sleep night stay in a sleep laboratory setting. During the sleep night stay, subjects will be evaluated using cystometry and polysomnography. In the morning following the sleep night stay, subjects will complete a sleep questionnaire and this will complete their participation in the study.</brief_summary>
