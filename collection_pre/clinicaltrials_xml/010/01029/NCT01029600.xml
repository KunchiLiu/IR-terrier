External rotation 20 degrees or less Abduction 45 degrees or less 3. The patients must not be in phase 1 (inflammation phase) 4. Diabetics may be included 5. MRI must be taken to exclude other reasons for stiffness 1. Other reasons for stiffness( cuff rupture, arthritis) 2. Posttraumatic or postoperative stiffness 3. Patients not suited for day surgery 4. Patients with a history of subacromial impingement before developing stiffness</criteria>
