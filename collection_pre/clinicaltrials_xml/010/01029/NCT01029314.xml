	<brief_summary>Primary study objective is to test the accuracy of the Genius 2 tympanic thermometer and the Exergen TAT-5000(TM) temporal artery thermometer as compared with serial perioperative core temperature measurements obtained in cardiac surgical patients during cardiopulmonary bypass. Study hypothesis: The Genius 2 thermometer will display greater precision and accuracy than the Exergen TAT-5000 thermometer when compared to core body temperature in patients undergoing CABG surgery.</brief_summary>
