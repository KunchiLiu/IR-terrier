	<brief_title>Evaluation of Metabolism-Boosting Beverages</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will assess the effect of MBB's on 24 hour energy expenditure by performing indirect calorimetry, and on appetite using visual analogue scales (VAS). The planned sample size is 54 healthy male and female adults, both lean and overweight. We plan to test 6 metabolism-boosting beverages in the following order: 1) Raspberry Tea 2) Banana Shake 3) Chai Latte 4) Strawberry Shake 5) Cappuccino 6) Hot Cocoa. In the order that they are screened, each subject will be assigned to receive 1 of 6 Metabolism-boosting beverages. Each MBB will contain 90 mg EGCG and 100 mg caffeine.</detailed_description>
