	<brief_summary>1. The use of LMWH following open reduction and internal fixation of ankle fractures will reduce the number of thrombi formed. 2. The rates of clinically significant DVT will be equivalent between two groups.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Low-Molecular-Weight Heparin (LMWH) for Deep Venous Thrombosis (DVT) Prophylaxis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Routine use of thromboprophylaxis may be over treatment and definitely increases healthcare costs. While prophylaxis may reduce the number of thrombi formed the exact number and clinical significance of these is unknown. This study seeks to answer the question of whether or not DVT prophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) following ORIF of ankle fractures is warranted.</detailed_description>
