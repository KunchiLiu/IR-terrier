	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate whether lenalidomide would reduce the number of red blood cell transfusions (RBC) needed in anemic (RBC transfusion-dependent) participants with low or intermediate-1 risk MDS without a deletion 5q chromosome abnormality. The study also investigated the safety of lenalidomide use in these participants. Two-thirds of the participants received oral lenalidomide and one-third of the participants received oral placebo.</brief_summary>
