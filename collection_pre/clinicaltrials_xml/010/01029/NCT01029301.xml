	<brief_summary>Skin aging is a multifactorial process involving the 3 layers of the skin: Epidermis, dermis and hypodermis. Skin aging process involves among others: skin roughness (epidermis), skin dyschromia (epidermis, dermis), wrinkles and elastosis - skin texture changes due to collagen modification, skin laxity and cellulite (dermis and hypodermis). EndyMed has developed the EndyMed Pro system - Computerized Radiofrequency System for Skin Tightening. By using a multielectrodes treatment tip an exact computerized thermal pattern can be produced allowing to selectively heating one or more of the target tissues (epidermis, dermis and hypodermis). In the skin tightening module the dermis and hypodermis would be targeted, creating enough thermal effect to induce collagen remodeling with no ablative thermal damage in the epidermis or dermis. This post marketing study is intended for evaluation of safety and efficacy of the EndyMed Pro system.</brief_summary>
