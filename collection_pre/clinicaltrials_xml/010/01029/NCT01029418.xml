	<brief_summary>This will be a phase I/II clinical trial testing the combination of sorafenib and AZD6244 in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma with Childs A liver cirrhosis. The aim of the phase I portion is to determine appropriate dose of this drug combination. The phase 2 study will look at effectiveness and safety of this drug combination</brief_summary>
