	<brief_summary>The main aim of the trial is to study whether a change of medication in non-responders to a two-weeks antipsychotic drug trial is more effective than continued treatment with the same antipsychotic. Hypothesis: Non-responders who are switched at 2 weeks to another antipsychotic are more frequently in symptomatic remission at week 8 than non-responders who stay on the same antipsychotic</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The patients will be randomised to a double-blind 2 week run in phase with fixed doses of either oral amisulpride 800 mg/day or olanzapine 20mg/day. Those participants who have not responded to treatment at two weeks (PANSS improvement &lt;25%) will be randomised to a 6 week double blind flexible dose phase: 1. Experimental intervention: switch to the other antipsychotic (oral olanzapine 5-20mg/d or oral amisulpride 200-800 mg/d) 2. Control intervention: continuation with the same drug as in the first 2 weeks in flexible dose ranges as above for another six weeks Those participants who have responded at week 2 (≥25% PANSS reduction) will continue on the same drug in flexible dose ranges as above Total duration of intervention per patient: 8 weeks</detailed_description>
