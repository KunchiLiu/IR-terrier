	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of EGT0001442 on fasting plasma glucose after 28 days of treatment in subjects with type 2 diabetes. The study will also assess the pharmacokinetics (how much of the drug gets into the blood and how long it takes the body to get rid of it), safety and tolerability of EGT0001442, the effect on weight and HbA1c as well as the effect EGT0001442 has on the amount of glucose produced in the body by the urine.</brief_summary>
