	<brief_summary>No head to head comparisons between exenatide once weekly and liraglutide have been performed. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to compare exenatide once weekly to once-daily liraglutide with regard to HbA1c, body weight, subject-reported outcomes, and other clinical benefits. The study includes a 26-week treatment period and a safety follow-up visit 10 weeks after the final study drug dose.</brief_summary>
