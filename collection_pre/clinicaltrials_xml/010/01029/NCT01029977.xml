	<brief_title>Imaging Modality Effects on the Multi-dimensional InfraRed Analysis (MIRA) Technology</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective of the current clinical study is to collect sufficient MIRA imaging data of subjects arriving for a routine screening mammography, before and after they undergo the mammography. This is in order to reach a conclusion whether the the firm breast compression involved in the mammography procedure affects the performance of the MIRA technology. At the current stage of the development of the device, the goal of this clinical trial is in no way to arrive at a statistical analysis.</detailed_description>
