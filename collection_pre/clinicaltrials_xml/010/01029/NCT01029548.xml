	<brief_summary>The present study is designed as a prospective observational study directed at evaluating the frequency, magnitude, quality and persistence (primary endpoint) of the anti-Tat immune response in HIV-1 infected asymptomatic individuals, and to prospectively evaluate the immunological, virological and clinical outcome of anti-Tat positive versus anti-Tat negative drug naїve subjects (secondary endpoint) in order to determine the impact of anti-Tat immunity on HIV disease progression as well as the potential use of anti-Tat immune response assessment for the clinical and therapeutic management of infected patients. This survey provided important information for the design, planning and conduction of future therapeutic vaccine trials based on the HIV-1 Tat protein in asymptomatic subjects.</brief_summary>
