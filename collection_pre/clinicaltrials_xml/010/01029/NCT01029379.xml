	<brief_summary>Propofol, (2,6-diisopropylphenol) is a short-acting anesthetic drug used for induction and maintenance of anesthesia. The aim of this study is to evaluate plasma concentrations of propofol in relation to depth of anesthesia, measured by continuous EEG and to correlate plasma concentrations with genetic analyses of liver enzymes responsible for drug elimination. Our hypothesis is that there is an individual requirement of Propofol plasma concentration depending on genetic differences in drug elimination. 200 patients, ASA classification 1, planned for elective surgery of a duration of at least 30 minutes will be included in this study.</brief_summary>
