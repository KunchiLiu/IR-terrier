	<brief_title>To Evaluate Safety, Tolerability, Plasma Drug Levels And Other Biological Effects In Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Evaluate the safety, tolerability, plasma concentrations of PF-03382792 and other biological activity following a single dose of PF-03382792. Three ascending single doses of PF-03382792 were administered in this study (0.05 mg, 0.15mg and 0.5 mg). The decision to terminate the study was made on June 4, 2010 due to safety findings and limitations regarding the levels of the metabolite projected for doses above 0.5 mg.</detailed_description>
