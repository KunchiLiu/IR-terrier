	<brief_summary>Non cardiac surgery in patients with coronary stents is complicated with cardiovascular and hemorrhagic events associated with perioperative management of antiplatelet agents. Several guidelines have outlined the importance of maintaining antiplatelet agents throughout surgical procedures to prevent cardiovascular complications. On the other hand, interruption of antiplatelet agents is still a usual standard to avoid surgical complications. We investigate the impact of perioperative antiplatelet drugs management on these complications, through a multicenter, prospective cohort (RECO stands for "Registre des patients porteurs d'Endoprothèses Coronaires, Opérés de chirurgie non cardiaque"), including all patients with coronary stents undergoing non cardiac surgery or invasive procedures. The aim of this study is primarily to measure the incidence of cardiovascular (including stent thrombosis) and hemorrhagic complications and to identify pre and postoperative risk factors associated with these complications.</brief_summary>
