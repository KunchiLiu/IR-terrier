	<brief_title>The Effect of Berry Extract on Helicobacter Pylori Eradication</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One-week of triple therapy composed of a proton pump inhibitor plus two antibiotics is currently regarded as the gold standard for HP eradication. However, the eradication rate continues to be disappointing. Poor patient compliance and bacterial resistance are the main factors contributing to treatment failure. Therefore, it is urgently necessary to develop a non-antibiotic alternative therapy to increase the eradication rates of Helicobacter pylori. Some literatures reported that cranberry may inhibit Helicobacter pylori adhesion to the human gastric mucus and may reduce Helicobacter pylori infection in adults. The aims of his experiment were to explore the impact of berry extract on triple therapy for Helicobacter pylori eradication.</detailed_description>
