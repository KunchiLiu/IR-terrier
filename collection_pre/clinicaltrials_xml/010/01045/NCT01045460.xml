	<brief_summary>Patient Population: Patients with active myeloma (Stage II/III) that have completed induction therapy and are eligible for an autologous stem cell transplant. Number of Patients: Will treat a total of 32 evaluable patients in a 1:1 randomization of aMILs vs aMILs plus vaccine. An evaluable patient is defined as one which has received the activated MILs and is at least 6 months post-transplant. Study Objectives: Disease response as determined by the Blade' criteria will be the primary endpoint of the trial at one year. Additional study endpoints include progression free survival, parameters of T cell reconstitution, anti-tumor immune responses as well as the effect on osteoclastogenesis and clonogenic myeloma precursor cells.</brief_summary>
