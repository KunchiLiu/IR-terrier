	<brief_title>Effects of Whole-Body Vibration on Balance in the Elderly Population</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Exercise therapy plays an important role in health promotion, preservation of physical function and in preventing loss of independence among the elderly. They work beside an improvement in balance, a positive effect on metabolic and cardiovascular disorders, reducing falls, osteoporosis, colon cancer, breast cancer, depression, anxiety, and the general well-being. There is preliminary evidence to indicated that balance, and strength can be trained in the elderly using whole-body vibration (WBV) therapy. The use of WBV in the elderly population has shown to be a simple and effective treatment in the areas of balance and mobility. It would be very desirable to investigate these factors further in order to provide evidence for the delivery of sustainability of training methods.</detailed_description>
