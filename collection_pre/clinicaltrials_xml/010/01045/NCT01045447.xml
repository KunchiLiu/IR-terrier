	<brief_summary>This trial is conducted in Africa, Asia, Europe and the United States of America (USA). The aim of this clinical trial is to compare NN5401 (insulin degludec/insulin aspart) with insulin glargine in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with insulin and oral anti-diabetic drugs (OADs). Subjects continued their ongoing treatment with OADs in the trial.</brief_summary>
