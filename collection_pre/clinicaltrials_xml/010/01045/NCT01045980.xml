	<brief_summary>The main purpose of this study is to compare the effects of using bio-impedance analysis to guide management of fluid status versus routine clinical care on heart structure. In addition, Vitamin D is being assessed to determine its effect on heart structure.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Bio-impedance Analysis and Vitamin D vs Usual Care on Left Ventricular Mass in Peritoneal Dialysis Patients: A Randomized Controlled Trial (FLUID Study)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients on peritoneal dialysis are frequently hypervolemic which is associated with deleterious changes in left ventricular (LV) architecture including increased LV mass. In dialysis patients, increased LV mass is associated with death. Recent randomized trials have demonstrated that increasing small solute clearance is not associated with improved outcomes - hence an increased interest in the management of volume control in ESRD patients. Bioimpedance analysis is inexpensive, safe and easy to use and appears to be more useful than other techniques to assess volume status in dialysis patients. In addition, dialysis patients are vitamin D deficient and this is also associated with an increased LV mass and its inherent complications. This study will evaluate the use of bioimpedance analysis versus usual care to assess and manage volume status and the use of vitamin D versus placebo in peritoneal dialysis patients and its effect on LV mass as measured by cardiac MRI.</detailed_description>
