	<brief_summary>The population of the US is aging. They remain more active and place greater demands on their musculoskeletal system. A key problem is that pain and disability of age related spinal disorders will increase. Problems such as Degenerative Lumbar Spondylolisthesis, Degenerative Disk Disease, Spinal Stenosis and Degenerative Scoliosis are age related problems that are treated with spinal fusion when non-operative treatment fails. Traditional open surgery poses significant risk for patients in this age group. The use of minimally invasive spinal surgery techniques provides an opportunity to treat these patients with less morbidity than traditional open surgery.</brief_summary>
