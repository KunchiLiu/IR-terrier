	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Lenalidomide may stop the growth of cancer by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab, can block cancer growth in different ways. Some block the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Others find cancer cells and help kill them or carry cancer-killing substances to them. Giving lenalidomide together with rituximab may be an effective treatment for B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of lenalidomide when given together with rituximab as maintenance therapy in treating patients with B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lenalidomide And Rituximab as Maintenance Therapy in Treating Patients With B-Cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study was originally intended to be Phase I/Phase II but it terminated early because of toxicity of treatment and therefore never moved to the Phase II portion of the study. PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and safety of lenalidomide in combination with rituximab in subjects with B-cell NHL following ASCT. (Phase I) II. To evaluate the tolerability of maintenance therapy with lenalidomide and rituximab after ASCT in subjects with B-cell NHL. (Phase II) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the progression-free survival of subjects with B-cell NHL receiving maintenance therapy with lenalidomide and rituximab after ASCT. II. To examine whether potential effects of lenalidomide and rituximab on progression-free survival after ASCT, compared with historical controls, vary according to histologic subtype of B-cell NHL. III. To correlate potential associations between peripheral blood levels of lymphocyte subsets including NK, T, and B cells and progression-free survival after ASCT in enrolled subjects. IV. To evaluate potential associations between progression-free survival after ASCT and polymorphisms at position 158 of FCgammaRIIIa receptor in enrolled subjects. OUTLINE: Patients receive oral lenalidomide once daily on days 1-21of all courses and rituximab IV on day 1of courses 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 2 years.</detailed_description>
