	<brief_summary>A Breath-Actuated Nebulizer is a newer type of nebulizer device that creates aerosol only when a patient is inhaling, rather than creating aerosol continuously. It is thought that breath-actuated nebulizer devices may deliver asthma rescue medications to patients' lungs more effectively and therefore lead them to recover from asthma attacks faster than conventional continuous-output nebulizer devices. This study compares outcomes including hospital admission rates, number of nebulized treatments required, and patient/family satisfaction when a breath-actuated nebulizer device versus a conventional continuous-output nebulizer is used to deliver asthma medications to pediatric asthma patients in the emergency department.</brief_summary>
