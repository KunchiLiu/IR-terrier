	<brief_title>Study to Evaluate the Pharmacokinetics and Safety of Dexlansoprazole in Pediatric Subjects With Symptomatic Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) is a condition of several causes resulting in the backward flow of gastric contents into the esophagus through the lower esophageal sphincter. The prevalence of GERD in the pediatric population is increasingly becoming recognized and documented. It is a disease that may persist through adulthood, with symptoms in older children and adolescents similar to those seen in adults. Younger children generally present with extra-esophageal manifestations, regurgitation, and epigastric pain, while older children and adolescents typically present with adult-type GERD symptoms of heartburn and regurgitation. Treatment for GERD is aimed at improving symptoms and healing esophageal inflammation. Takeda Global Research &amp; Development Center, Inc. (TGRD) developed dexlansoprazole delayed release capsules as a new therapy for treating acid related disorders including symptomatic non-erosive GERD, healing of erosive esophagitis (EE) and maintenance of healed EE. Dexlansoprazole delayed release capsules have not been studied in subjects younger than 12 years of age. This study is designed to evaluate the safety of dexlansoprazole delayed release capsules in the pediatric population (1 to 11 years old) and to determine if the PK profile of dexlansoprazole in subjects 1 to 11 years of age is similar to that in adults given a similar dose. Subjects who satisfy the screening evaluation and Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria may be enrolled in the study. Eligible subjects will be assigned to one of three treatment groups. Attempts will be made to enroll an equal number of male and female subjects in each treatment group.</detailed_description>

Subjects who take prescription or nonprescription proton pump inhibitors (PPI), histamine receptor antagonists (except cimetidine), sucralfate, or antacids on a regular or as required basis must agree to discontinue usage on Day 1 and agree to discontinue use throughout the study. Must have a history of GERD symptoms for at least 2 months prior to Screening or is currently symptomatic, as determined by the investigator. Must be able to swallow study drug capsule or must be able to ingest study drug granules sprinkled on 1 tablespoon of applesauce. Has evidence of current cardiovascular, central nervous system, pulmonary, endocrine disease, hepatic, hematopoietic, renal, or metabolic dysfunction, serious allergy, asthma, or allergic skin rash. Has a known hypersensitivity to any PPI or any component of the formulation of dexlansoprazole capsules. Is taking any other prescription (except birth control) or nonprescription medication (including cimetidine), vitamins, or dietary supplements within 10 days prior to Day 1, or has taken herbal overthecounter medications within 28 days prior to Day 1. Has a positive test result for hepatitis B surface antigen or hepatitis C virus antibody. Has donated or lost greater than 10% of the total blood volume, undergone plasmapheresis, or has had a transfusion of any blood product within 90 days prior to the first dose of study drug. Has a history of alcohol abuse or illegal drug use or drug abuse in the past, or tests positive for alcohol or drugs of abuse at the initial Screening Visit or Day 1 or is unwilling to agree to abstain from alcohol and drugs throughout the study. Has used a product containing nicotine within 90 days prior to the first dose of study drug or has a positive cotinine screen at the initial Screening Visit or Day 1 or is unwilling to agree to abstain throughout the study.
