	<brief_title>Family-based Genetic Long-term Study of Brain Function in Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Schizophrenia is a serious mental disease, highly family inheritable inclination. By means of traditional psychiatry diagnosis, genetics and long term brain change researches will help to unveil the secret of schizophrenia and other factors. The advantage of comparative gene hybridization is that chromosome copy number alterations can be detected; this technique has been widely applied in many researches, such as cancer, mental retardation screening and autism. As we known, we are the first one use this technique in chromosome abnormality research for family history schizophrenic patient, this study also is the first one to track the relationship of long term brain function alteration and chromosome abnormality in Taiwan.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1.Psychiatry doctor diagnosed who met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSMIVTR) criteria for schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, family history, age older than 15 will be recruited for participation in this study. Participants agree and sign informed consent forms will eligible to participate this experiment. 2.1020c.c blood will be drawn from the participants. 3.Participants need to understand procedures and assays of this experiment. 4.At least one psychiatry doctor interview needed, participants and their family voluntarily join this interview, approximately 3045min. 1. Participant can not understand procedures and assays of this experiment. 2. Participant has another major mental disease other than the inclusion criteria. 3. Participant has material abuse history, it could seriously influence diagnosis. 4. Participant has combination diseases, it could seriously influence diagnosis. 5. Psychopathy or psychosis can not be categorized in defined group. Other considerations: 1. Participants, age fewer than 20 needs to their deputy guardians (parents) and their own consent altogether. 2.
