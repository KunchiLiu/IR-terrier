	<brief_summary>The objective of the present trial is to evaluate the local and general safety of the intratumoural electrotransfer of increasing doses of Plasmid AMEP in patients suffering from advanced or metastatic melanoma and to identify doses that could be effective on cutaneous lesions in man.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy Study of Electrotransfer of Plasmid AMEP to Treat Advanced or Metastatic Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this open, multicentre, dose escalation study, successive cohorts of 3 patients suffering from advanced or metastatic melanoma will be electrotransferred increasing doses of Plasmid AMEP into cutaneous melanoma lesions in 2 divided doses at one week interval.</detailed_description>
