	<detailed_description>Clozapine, an antipsychotic drug, is an important clinical medicine which is used for schizophrenia and preventing for its relapse; clozapine is better than some other atypical antipsychotics. However, in clinical uses, clozapine often could induce hypersalivation, it is not only influencing patient's appearance, also deteriorating sleeping quality which could deter patient discontinuing to take medicine. In previous researches, Suo Quan Wan and Wu Lin San had been proven effective for hypersalivation and no significant side-effects, nevertheless, it still lack of systematical scientific trial reports. The ingredients of Suo Quan Wan are Wu Yao, San Yao and Yi Zhi Ren; the ingredients of Wu Lin San are Gui Zhi, Fu Ling, Zhu Ling, Ze Xie and Bai Ju, both have bi-directional regulatory functions for body fluid and saliva. The goal of this research is hoping to combine traditional Chinese medicine medication and find out how to solve clozapine-induced hypersalivation, also reduce side-effect, medication compliance, improving life quality, improving social-function and reducing neopathy.</detailed_description>
