	<brief_summary>Hepatitis C is the leading cause of chronic liver disease in industrialized countries, and is the most common indication for liver transplantation. In the Western world, the absolute majority of cases of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection are related to the use of injectable narcotic drugs. Most injecting drug users contract HCV infection within the first years after starting injecting drug use. The aim of this study is to study hepatitis C in a cohort of patients registered in clinics providing maintenance therapy for opiate dependence in three metropolitan areas of Sweden. The cohort is defined as all patients registered in these three clinics at the date of study initiation. The study contains four parts: Part I: the first part of the study aims to evaluate the prevalence of HCV exposure in the cohort and the proportion of anti-HCV positive participants with chronic infection. Part II: Patients with chronic HCV infection will be offered further investigation of chronic liver disease, including liver biopsy, for selection of candidates for antiviral therapy and identification of risk factors for development of severe liver disease. Part III: Based on the results of these investigations, patients will be considered for antiviral therapy. Indications for such therapy will mainly be clinical and/or histological signs of chronic liver disease with fibrosis. All patients will receive weight-based doses of pegylated interferon-alfa-2b and ribavirin. Part IV: Study of pharmacokinetic interactions between ribavirin and opiate substitution molecule (methadone or buprenorphine) in patients receiving antiviral therapy according to part III.</brief_summary>

Creatinin clearance &lt;50mL/min 9. Any of the following diseases considered to be a dominant cause of the patients chronic liver disease: Hemochromatosis Alpha1 antitrypsin deficiency Wilson's disease Autoimmune hepatitis Alcoholic liver disease Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) Drugrelated liver disease 10. Active malignant disease or suspicion or history of malignant disease within five previous years (except for adequately treated basal cell carcinoma). 11.

Any other condition which in the opinion of the investigator would make the patient unsuitable for enrollment, or could interfere with the patient participating in and completing the study.</criteria>
