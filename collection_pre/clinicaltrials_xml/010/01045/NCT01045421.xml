	<brief_summary>This is an open-label, multicenter study with a phase 1 dose escalation portion and a 2-stage, phase 2 portion, investigating MLN8237 (alisertib) in patients with advanced nonhematological malignancies.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Alisertib in Adults With Nonhematological Malignancies, Followed by Alisertib in Lung, Breast, Head and Neck or Gastroesophageal Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Following the determination of the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) and schedule (Phase 1), 20 response-evaluable patients in each of the 5 tumor indications will be enrolled (Phase 2-Stage 1). An interim analysis will determine which tumor indications will proceed to enroll an additional 25 patients (Phase 2-Stage 2) to further evaluate Overall Response Rate (ORR) and other secondary endpoints.</detailed_description>
