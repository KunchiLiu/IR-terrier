	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to see if using a combination of other drug classes, like the ones that Kaletra® and Intelence™ belong to, can still help reduce the amount of HIV in your blood. Using Kaletra® and Intelence™ without other drugs is not approved by the FDA and so their use in this study is experimental.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>HIV1 RNA ≥ 5000 copies/mL by Roche Amplicor 1.5v Primer More than 18 years of age Provide written informed consent and willingness to participate in and comply Less than 7 days of prior ART with any licensed or investigational compound Does not currently have or has not been treated for an active opportunistic infection (OI) within 30 days of screening Vital signs, physical examination and laboratory results do not exhibit evidence of acute illness A female who is a nonchildbearing potentiator or if in childbearing potential, has a negative serum pregnancy test at screen and agrees to one of the following: complete abstinence from intercourse from 2 weeks prior to administration of the study drug, throughout the study, and for at least 2 weeks after completion or premature discontinuation from the study to account for elimination of the investigational drug. Should a patient decide to become sexually active during the course of the study, she must be counseled and be willing to use one of the birth control methods like double barrier method, intrauterine device, sterilization and any other methods. NOTE: Data are insufficient to exclude a clinically important interaction of LPV/r with drugs, such as hormonal contraceptives, that are highly metabolized by the cytochrome P450 enzyme system. As a result, hormonal contraception is not considered adequate. Patient with active AIDSdefining opportunistic infection in the 30 days prior to baseline and that, in the opinion of the investigator, would preclude the patient from participating in the study (See Appendix C). Patient has a weighted genotypic score for etravirine ≥3 . (See Appendix D) Patient has &gt;3 mutations at 10, 20, 24, 32, 33, 36, 46, 47, 48, 50, 54, 73, 82, 84, or 90 in protease or ≥1 of the following mutations in protease (I47A/V, V32I, or L76V). History of active substance abuse. Pregnant at time of screening evaluation or breastfeeding. Patient, in the opinion of the investigator, is unlikely to be able to complete the 48week dosing period and protocol evaluations and assessments or adhere to the study drug regimen. Serious medical condition, such as diabetes, congestive heart failure, cardiomyopathy or other cardiac dysfunction, which in the opinion of the investigator would compromise the safety of the patient Malabsorption syndrome or other gastrointestinal dysfunction, which may interfere with drug absorption or render the patient unable to take oral medication. Undergoing interferon therapy for HCV or anticipates undergoing therapy during the course of this trial HBV coinfection Laboratory results within 30 days prior to the first dose of study medication: Hemoglobin concentration &lt; 8.0 g/dL Absolute neutrophil count &lt; 750 cells/mm3 Platelet count &lt;50,000 cells/ mm3 Aminotransferase (AST, ALT) &gt;3 times ULN Serum creatinine &gt;1.5 times the Upper Limits of Normal (ULN) Radiation therapy or cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents within 4 weeks prior to entry, or has an anticipated need for these agents within the study period. Immunomodulating agents, such as systemic corticosteroids, interleukins, or interferon's within 4 weeks prior to study entry, or patients who have received an HIV immunotherapeutic vaccine within 3 months prior to entry. Asthmatic patients using inhaled corticosteroids are eligible for enrollment. Methadone therapy Foscarnet therapy or therapy with other agents with documented activity against HIV1 in vitro. Taking astemizole, terfenadine, cisapride, oral midazolam, triazolam, flecainide, pimozide, propafenone, St. John's Wort, lovastatin, simvastatin, and rifampin or ergot derivatives. Allergy to any of the study drugs or any excipients therein. Patient requires inhaled or intranasal fluticasone.</criteria>
