	<brief_summary>Insulin resistance-associated hepatic iron overload (IR-HIO), also defined as dysmetabolic iron overload syndrome or dysmetabolic liversiderosis, is a common cause or iron overload in France, mainly in middle-age patients with increased serum ferritin levels associated with normal serum transferrin saturation, and normal serum iron concentration in the absence of other known cause of increased serum ferritin levels. Treatment includes a combination of dietary measures and physical activity to correct metabolic disorders. Phlebotomies seem to be beneficial when serum ferritin level is high. This study aims at comparing the effect of iron depletion (by phlebotomy) plus lifestyle and diet advices versus lifestyle and diet advices alone on blood glucose level and insulin sensitivity in subjects with IR-HIO in order to assess the benefits of phlebotomies on the reduction of risk of diabetes and cardiovascular associated complications.</brief_summary>
