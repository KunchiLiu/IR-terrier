    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to define the absorption, breakdown and excretion of a single
      dose of radiolabelled SB-649868 and its breakdown products by measuring their concentration
      in blood, urine and faeces over a 7-10 day period. &quot;Radiolabelled&quot; means that the test drug
      has a radioactive component to help us track the drug. The safety and tolerability of the
      test drug will also be assessed.

             than 3 units.

          -  Grapefruit or grapefruit juice intake 7 days before dosing and until the last blood
             sample is taken.

          -  Any subject who is not prepared to eat standard meals in the clinic or is a
             vegetarian.

          -  Participated in a clinical trial for a new drug within 30 days or 5 half-lives or
             twice the duration of that drugs effect before the dosing day for this study.

          -  Exposure to 4 new drugs in clinical trials within the last 12 months before dosing in
             this study.

          -  Use of any medications (prescribed or non-prescribed including vitamins and herbal
             supplements) within 7 days before dosing in this study.

             screening and in the 72 hours before and 48 hours after the treatment period.

          -  Administration of radiolabelled substances or exposure to significant radiation (eg
             serial X-rays or CT scans, barium meal etc)within the past 12 months from screening.
