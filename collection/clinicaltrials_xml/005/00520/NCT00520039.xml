  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the application of osteopathic manipulative
      medicine speeds the rate of resolution of middle ear effusion (fluid) in children following
      an episode of acute otitis media.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute otitis media is a significant world wide problem commonly affecting children between 6
      and 18 months, and is the most frequent reason for childhood illness visits to a physician
      in the US. By three years of age, 50-70% of children will have had one episode, while
      one-third will have had more than three. Persistence of middle ear effusion following an
      episode of acute otitis media is thought to predispose the child to recurrent infection. The
      standard care for recurrent acute otitis media includes long term antibiotic prophylaxis and
      surgery. The risks of standard care are recognized, and alternative means of treating acute
      disease and preventing recurrent otitis media are needed.

      For over a century, osteopathic physicians have reported favorable clinical outcomes in
      children treated with osteopathic manipulative medicine (OMM) in addition to standard
      medical care. To determine if a standardized OMM protocol will reduce the duration of middle
      ear effusion (MEE) after onset of acute otitis media, we outline a prospective, randomized,
      blinded, multi-center efficacy study of children ages six months to two years with a single
      episode of acute otitis media. Subjects will be randomized into one of two treatment groups:
      standard care plus OMM and standard care only. Subjects will be followed for one month to
      determine rate of resolution of middle ear effusion following onset of the acute otitis
      media. Statistical analysis will determine any differences between subjects in the two
      treatment groups.
