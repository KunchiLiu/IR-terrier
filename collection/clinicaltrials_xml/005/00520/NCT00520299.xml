      The purpose of this study is to test a new drug called ADI-SS PEG 20,000 mw in patients with
      melanoma. The study drug (ADI-SS PEG 20,000 mw) is being used because it causes a nutrient
      called arginine to break down. Arginine is an amino acid. Amino acids are the building
      blocks that our bodies use to make proteins. Normal cells do not require arginine. Melanoma
      cells, however, seem to need arginine to survive. ADI-SS PEG 20,000 mw will be used as a way
      to starve melanoma cells and stop them from growing.

    <textblock>
      This is a phase I/II, open-label, dose-escalation study of ADI-SS PEG 20,000 mw in patients
      with advanced melanoma. Eligible patients will receive ADI-SS PEG 20,000 mw intramuscularly
      (IM) once weekly for 9 weeks (Cycle 1). [18F]-FDG PET and CT scans will be performed at
      baseline and at the end of cycle 1 (week 8 and 9 respectively) for assessment of tumor
      response and changes in tumor metabolic activity induced by ADI-SS PEG 20,000 mw. [18F]-FDG
      PET will also be performed on study day 4 for assessment of tumor metabolic activity
      following the first dose of ADI-SS PEG 20,000 mw. Formal assessment of response by RECIST
      and EORTC functional criteria will be based on a comparison of conventional CT scans and
      [18F]-FDG PET scans done pre-treatment and at the end of Cycle 1 (week 8 and 9).

      Blood samples will be obtained prior to each ADI-SS PEG 20,000 mw IM injection for plasma
      arginine and citrulline levels and ADI concentration analysis and detection of anti-ADI
      antibodies. Patients will be assessed by physical examination and laboratory studies (CBC,
      fibrinogen, PT/PTT, comprehensive chemistry panel, LDH, amylase, lipase and uric acid) every
      two weeks while undergoing treatment. A review of toxicities will be conducted during each
      study visit.

      If a patient completes treatment in Cycle 1 without Dose limiting toxicity (DLT, then the
      patients will be eligible to continue to Cycle 2 starting at study week #10 if one of the
      following criteria is met:

        1. CT shows enlargement of existing disease without accompanying symptoms.

           or

        2. CT shows stable disease or improvement and there is no unacceptable toxicity.

      If patient develops symptoms referable to disease progression or if CT shows new disease,
      then no further ADI will be given.

      Radiologic evaluations will be repeated for patients treated in Cycle 2 during study weeks
      16 and 17 to determine eligibility for Cycle 3. The same eligibility criteria used for Cycle
      2 will apply for continuation to Cycle 3.

      Phase I:

      The dose levels of ADI-SS PEG 20,000mw to be administered are outlined below:

        -  Cohort 1 (40 IU/m2)

        -  Cohort 2 (80 IU/m2)

        -  Cohort 3 (160 IU/m2)

      Phase II:

      The cohort determined to be the highest tolerated dose level from Phase I will be expanded
      up to 25 patients.
