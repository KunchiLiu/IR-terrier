    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the progression-free survival of patients with
      surgically staged, Stage I-II papillary serous, clear cell, or endometrioid carcinomas with
      high-intermediate risk factors treated by vaginal cuff brachytherapy followed by
      chemotherapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients must have undergone complete surgical staging including bilateral pelvic and
      para-aortic lymphadenectomy. All patients will receive radiation therapy. Treatment will be
      delivered either by LDR or HDR brachytherapy. The treatment plan must be started at the time
      of enrollment. The vaginal brachytherapy should be started within 4 weeks of surgery (within
      2 weeks of enrollment), in order to avoid delays in initiation of systemic therapy, which
      should start on post-operative day 21. The dose will be prescribed to the vaginal (mucosal)
      surface as defined at the surface of the applicators. Following vaginal cuff radiation
      therapy, all patients will receive chemotherapy.
