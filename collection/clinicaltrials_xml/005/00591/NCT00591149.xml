      A study of Oxaliplatin and Docetaxel followed by Cetuximab for head and neck cancer patients
      to determine their effect on the control and reduction of tumor size
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized, open-label, phase II study to assess the effects of oxaliplatin
      and docetaxel followed by epidermal factor-antibody (EGFR-AB) cetuximab on patients with
      previously treated recurrent /metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. Head
      and neck tissue will also be tested to determine if the protein Epidermal Growth Factor
      Receptor is present in the cancer cells.

    <description>Patients will be treated with oxaliplatin 130 MG/M2 IV over 2 hours on day 1 and docetaxel 60 MG/M2 IV over 1 hour on day 1 of a 21 day cycle. Cycles of treatment will be repeated every 3 weeks for a total of 4 cycles or until disease progression or intolerable toxicity.
Patients who were treated with 4 cycles of oxaliplatin and docetaxel and had a response or stable disease will be treated with cetuximab at 400 MG/M2 on week 1 then 250 MG/M2 weekly for a total of 12 weeks, or until disease progression or intolerable toxicity.</description>
