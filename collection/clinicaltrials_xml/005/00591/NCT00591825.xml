  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The research team hopes to use brain imaging and mental testing to learn more about specific
      phobias and the treatment of phobia. When given directly prior to therapy sessions,
      D-cycloserine has been shown to enhance the effects of therapy. This study hopes to identify
      reasons why D-cycloserine has this effect by measuring brain activity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP) therapy has become the treatment of choice for
      specific phobias. ERP involves systematic and repeated exposure to a feared or
      anxiety-provoking stimulus, leading to habituation and extinction of the fear response.
      Animal models of fear extinction have shown that acute administration of D-cycloserine (DCS)
      prior to exposure to a feared stimulus enhances extinction of that fear. A recent study in
      human subjects with height phobia (a specific phobia) has also demonstrated that DCS
      facilitates the effects of ERP therapy. Current theories postulate that DCS facilitates fear
      extinction by enhancing the learning process and increasing consolidation of memories, but
      the neural mechanisms underlying this process are not understood. The proposed research aims
      to elucidate these mechanisms by using fMRI to measure brain activation during 1) symptom
      provocation and verbal learning two hours post-medication, and 2)repeated symptom
      provocation and verbal recognition one week post-medication. This research will also examine
      the effects of DCS on cognitive functioning using neuropsychological testing both two house
      and one week post-medication.
