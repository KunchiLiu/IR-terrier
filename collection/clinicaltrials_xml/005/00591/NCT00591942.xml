      The restoration of indirect partial and full coverage restorations in dentistry necessitates
      the use of a luting agent to act as a means of mechanical and potentially, chemical
      retention of the restoration. Upon the introduction of the first generation of glass Ionomer
      cements for use as a luting agent, an elevated short-term post operative hypersentivity was
      reported. In part, this adverse event was considered to be due to a desiccating effect of
      the cement as water is utilized in the setting reaction and thus a desiccation of the
      dentinal tubules was proposed as a potential mechanism leading to disruption of the
      neurosensory odontoblasts. Further materials development in the field of dental cement
      luting agents has lead to the introduction to the current market of resin formulations that
      have an alternative mechanism of setting. Consequently, there are anecdotal reports of a
      decrease in the incidence of post-operative sensitivity but no comparison with the effect of
      conventionally used dentin desensitizing agents as a part of the bonding process of the
      restoration.

      The purpose of this trial is a single blinded parallel design randomized clinical trial to
      evaluate the perceived incidence of post-operative sensitivity when full coverage all
      ceramic crowns or short-span three unit fixed partial dentures (dental bridge) is fabricated
      in the posterior part of the mouth. The dental crowns or bridges will be bonded with
      conventional glass ionomer cement or a Urethane dimethacrylate / Bis-GMA composite resin
      dental cement. Outcome measures will be both objective clinical criteria and the use of a
      calibrated pain survey instrument.

      Background and Significance: The development of porcelain crowns for the predictable
      restoration of teeth has been brought about by the development of bonding techniques to
      enamel and dentin with the use of multi-step total etch adhesive systems along with the
      evolution in small particle hybrid resin composites as adhesive luting agents. One of the
      most common post-operative concerns of patients following delivery of full coverage crowns
      and bridges is sensitivity to thermal conditions in the mouth (cold water, ice cream, etc.)
      (Goodacre, Bernal et al. 2003). In order to understand the biological basis for these
      materials it is important to understand the anatomy and neurophysiology of dentin. The
      following is adapted from a paper provided by Dr. Charles Cox (Professor, University of
      Alabama School of Dentistry) concerning dentin structure and mechanisms for reduction of
      dentin hypersensitivity .

      Dentin is a vital tissue, harder than bone but weaker than enamel with a physiological
      elasticity preventing tooth fracture. Dentin is approx. 74% mineral; the organic phase being
      approx. 26% type-1 collagen with small amounts of proteins and water. The collagen matrix is
      secreted as a biologically &quot;plastic&quot; material, which hardens by a variety of mechanisms.
      Normal dentin is composed of millions of tubules or canals, running from the pulpal wall to
      the Dentin-Enamel Junction (DEJ). The dimensions of these tubules or canals varies depending
      on the position within the dentin structure. For instance, tubule diameter at the DEJ is
      0.06 µm, and 3.0 µm at the pulpal wall (approx. 60,000 tubules / mm2). Most tubules are
      filled with fluid, an odontoblast cell process, collagen, and occasional non-myelinated
      pulpal nerves coursing approx. 150 µm towards the DEJ (Ten Cate 1998).

      In normal (non-anesthetized) patients, Gysi (1900) reported that fluid distortion on the
      cavity floor caused sharp pain. Brännström et al. (1966, 1969, 1976, 1979, 1980, 1996)
      demonstrated dentin hypersensitivity (sharp pain) is the result of rapid fluid movement in
      the tubule complex, aggravated by aggressive air-drying. Physiological testing in various
      animal studies (Heyeraas 1985, Narhi 1983, 1985) confirmed the fluid pulsing or hydrodynamic
      mechanism (Brännström 1966) as the prime cause of sudden dentin pain. Physiologically, any
      rapid bi-directional fluid flow is the result of a sudden shift in tubule fluid from stimuli
      (i.e. cold or rapid airflow; Brännström 1996).

      Management of dentin hypersensitivity is only one part of a successful dental complete
      coverage restoration (dental crown or bridge). In evaluating the clinical service-life of
      porcelain crowns there are three aspects of the bonding environment that needs to be
      considered. These consist of the tooth preparation, the adhesive and the tooth or crown
      preparation and the fit of the porcelain restoration to the tooth preparation. All ceramic
      restorations need enamel and dentin reduction of at least 1.5 mm along with a smooth
      shoulder and avoidance of sharp edges to avoid crack formation on the intaglio surface,
      proper esthetics, physiological contours and strength of the final restoration.(Goodacre,
      Campagni et al. 2001) Dental preparation for full coverage restorations (1.5 to 2 mm
      clearance which often means 1.5 - 2 mm loss of tooth structure) are inherently
      non-conservative and with a reduced amount of remaining tooth structure there is an elevated
      risk of post-operative sensitivity.

      In today's society, having a dental restoration that provides minimal post-operative
      sensitivity is only part of the demand from patients. There is an increasing expectation for
      esthetic, &quot;life-like&quot; restorations that simulate if not replicate the natural tooth. This is
      complicated especially in patients with heavy occlusion or are missing teeth. The
      development of CAD/CAM milling technologies has laid the groundwork for use of high strength
      heat-pressed zirconia [tetragonal zirconia polycrystals (TZP) a yttrium partially stabilized
      polycrystal structure] as a supporting framework for supporting an esthetic, &quot;life-like&quot;
      Lucite-base veneering ceramic material to provide an all ceramic form of full coverage
      dental restorations for individual teeth or replacement of a single missing tooth with a
      3-united fixed partial denture (&quot;dental bridge&quot;). The use of press porcelain crown
      technology has allowed the improvement of fit of refractory die porcelain crown fabrication
      relative to conventional Pt foil techniques and may lead to greater predictability and
      reduced microleakage (with enhanced service life of the dental restoration). The potential
      for an enhanced service life may depend on a combination of silination with a bifunctional
      bis-GMA primer and dual cured composite resin luting agent which may seal microcracks within
      the intaglio surface of the porcelain and a sufficient bond to tooth structure for a
      reasonable service life.

    <description>Subjects who met the inlcusion/excluson criteria received two ceramic crowns or one three-unit dental bridge on posterior teeth. The crowns and dental bridge were cemented using two different dental adhesives. Follow-up to assess sensitivity of the crowns/bridges occur at 24 hrs. and 1 week post seating by telephone. Clinical visits to assess sensitivity and the integrity of the crowns/bridges occur at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months post seating of the restorations.</description>
