  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine efficacy of a new and combined treatment of laryngeal recurrent
      respiratory papillomatosis (RRP), by using a 585 nm pulsed dye laser (PDL) and a dietary
      supplement, diindolylmethane (DIM). We will compare this new treatment with PDL-only, in a
      total of 30 children (15 of each treatment), to determine whether this combined treatment
      would be effective and safe in preventing the RRP recurrence. This is the first study to
      combine PDL technique with DIM, to develop a new, voice-preserving and long-term effective
      method of managing laryngeal RRP in children.

    <textblock>
      Previous studies have demonstrated that PDL can be used to remove lesions on the vocal cords
      and elsewhere in the throat causing less damage to surface tissues than other commonly used
      lasers. In our proposed clinical study, we seek to compare treatment efficacy for RRP by
      combining PDL with DIM, versus PDL-only treatment, in a total of 30 children with laryngeal
      papilloma. We will determine whether this combined treatment would be effective and safe in
      preventing or delaying the RRP recurrence while preserving voice quality. 30 children will
      be divided randomly into two treatment groups, 15 in each. The experimental group will
      receive one-time PDL treatment, followed by 3-month oral administration of DIM and an
      additional 12 months with no treatment. The other group will be treated with PDL-only, as a
      control, and take a placebo pill for 3 months. All of the patients will be followed for a
      total of 15 months. We will compare lesion recurrence and laboratory tests between the two
      groups, to determine efficacy and safety of the new treatment. This is the first study to
      combine new PDL laser technique with DIM, to develop a new, voice-preserving and long-term
      effective method of managing laryngeal RRP in children.
