  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Health literacy is an integral part of the pathway for the successful transfer of
      information between patients and providers. Parents of children with Attention Deficit/
      Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) play an essential role in chronic care as they offer critical
      information to providers that drives appropriate education and disease management. We
      propose the development and evaluation of an electronic data entry tool that enables parents
      to communicate data essential to treatment of their children, regardless of their own
      literacy skills. The research plan addresses a question central to patient-centered
      information management: how does health literacy influence parents' report of data on ADHD
      and the process-level events that result from parent-provider communication? The following
      specific aims organize the clinical study: proposal: 1) To assess the effect of health
      literacy on successful completion of parent-reported ADHD health information in both
      paper-based and PCHR formats, and, 2): To determine the association between health literacy
      and process-level outcomes for ADHD that stem from parent-provider exchange of information.
      The formal evaluation will study a diverse cohort of parents in a randomized trial of data
      entry (paper versus PCHR) for ADHD-specific information. Primary care records for children
      of this cohort will be analyzed for the prior 12 month period. Both a retrospective
      examination of documented ADHD processes of care and a prospective evaluation of the utility
      of data from the PCHR will occur. Literacy level is a primary variable of interest
      throughout the evaluation.
