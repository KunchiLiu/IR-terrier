      The purpose of this study is to see whether acamprosate (Campral) will curb the desire to
      gamble in people with pathological gambling disorder.

    <textblock>
      Because the opiate antagonists appear to be effective in the treatment of pathological
      gambling (PG), it is reasonable to ask whether acamprosate (calcium acetylhomotaurine;
      Campral), also FDA approved for the treatment of alcoholism, can be used effectively to
      treat PG. Acamprosate is not an opioid antagonist; rather, it is assumed that its
      therapeutic effects are due to actions on GABA receptors. Acamprosate is structurally
      related to 1-glutamic, which is an excitatory neurotransmitter. It has been proposed that
      acamprosate decreases the effects of the naturally-occuring excitatory neurotransmitter
      glutamate in the body. Because chronic alcohol consumption disrupts this system, and the
      changes last many months after alcohol ingestion is stopped, it is possible that acamprosate
      restores the glutamate system towards normal. Regardless, acamprosate decreases the pleasant
      &quot;high&quot; associated with alcohol consumption, and thus decreases the frequency of relapse
      during abstinence. We hypothesize that acamprosate will have similar actions in persons with
      PG.
