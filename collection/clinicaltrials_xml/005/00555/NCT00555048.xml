      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as alemtuzumab, can find cancer cells and either kill
      them or deliver cancer-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Giving
      chemotherapy drugs, such as busulfan and cyclophosphamide, before a donor stem cell
      transplant helps stop the growth of cancer cells. When the healthy stem cells from a donor
      are infused into the patient they may help the patient's bone marrow make stem cells, red
      blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Sometimes the transplanted cells from a donor
      can make an immune response against the body's normal cells. Giving tacrolimus and
      methotrexate after the transplant may stop this from happening.

      PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the best dose of alemtuzumab when given together
      with busulfan and cyclophosphamide followed by a donor stem cell transplant and to see how
      well it works in treating patients with hematologic cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Identify the lowest dose of alemtuzumab that is associated with day 180
           transplant-related mortality ≤ 45%.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the incidence of life-threatening infection in patients receiving this
           treatment.

        -  Determine the incidence of grades III-IV acute graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) in patients
           receiving this treatment.

        -  Determine the survival at 1 year in patients receiving this treatment.

        -  Determine the incidence of disease relapse at 1 year in patients receiving this
           treatment.

        -  Determine the incidence of extensive chronic GVHD at 1 year in patients receiving this
           treatment.

        -  Determine the incidence of graft failure at day 100 in patients receiving this
           treatment.

      OUTLINE:

        -  Chemotherapy: Patients receive alemtuzumab IV over 2 hours on days -10 to -6, busulfan
           IV over 3 hours on days -7 to -4, and cyclophosphamide IV on days -3 and -2.

        -  Peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) transplantation: Patients undergo allogeneic
           filgrastim (G-CSF)-mobilized PBSC transplantation on day 0.

        -  Graft-vs-host disease prophylaxis: Patients receive tacrolimus IV continuously or
           orally twice daily on days -1 to 50 and methotrexate IV on days 1, 3, 6, and 11.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically.
