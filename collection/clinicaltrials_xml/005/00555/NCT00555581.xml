  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of imatinib mesylate
      (Gleevec) in patients with systemic sclerosis (scleroderma). Gleevec is a medication already
      FDA approved for the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), gastrointestinal
      stromal tumors (GIST), dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans tumors, Philadelphia
      chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia, hypereosinophilic syndrome, and aggressive
      systemic mastocytosis. In-vitro studies have suggested that imatinib may inhibit collagen
      production by scleroderma fibroblasts, and in mouse models of fibrosis imatinib has been
      shown to decrease skin thickness.

      This is a Phase IIa, single center, prospective open label clinical trial of Gleevec in
      patients with systemic sclerosis. All patients will be treated with active drug for 12
      months. The primary objective of this study will be to determine the safety and tolerability
      of Gleevec in patients with systemic sclerosis, but important secondary outcomes of
      relevance will be improvement in disease status as defined by skin scores and indices of
      pulmonary function.

      Patients who complete the initial phase (described above) of the study will be eligible to
      participate in an extension phase. The purpose of the extension phase of the study is to
      give patients who participated in the phase IIa clinical trial of Gleevec at the Hospital
      for Special Surgery the opportunity to continue Gleevec treatment if both the treating
      physicians and the patient are in agreement that Gleevec had acceptable safety and
      tolerability, as well as possible efficacy during the initial year of therapy.

      Further description of extension phase:

      Patients will first be evaluated for inclusion in the extension phase of the study at either
      the follow-up visit following three month withdrawal from Gleevec treatment or at the visit
      after the follow-up visit. Patients can undergo evaluation for inclusion in the extension
      phase up to six months following their completion of the initial one year trial. All
      patients evaluated for inclusion in the extension phase will sign a new informed consent
      form detailing the purpose and procedures associated with the extension phase at the initial
      visit. After the initial visit, patients who meet inclusion criteria will be required to
      undergo evaluation every three months for the 27 months following initiation of treatment,
      or more frequently if deemed clinically necessary. Treatment will consist of Gleevec, at
      doses ranging from 100 to 400 mg daily (100 mg pills will be distributed for oral
      administration). At each study visit, a history and physical exam will be performed and
      urine and blood tests will be conducted for disease activity and organ function. Additional
      blood for research may also be collected at study visits. The Modified Rodnan Skin Score
      will be measured to assess the degree of skin involvement associated with the patient's
      disease. Patients will also continue to complete questionnaires about their ability to
      function and quality of life.

      Patients will be financially responsible for all professional and clinical services, as well
      as all laboratory and diagnostic tests, associated with the extension phase of the study.
      All co-pays, deductibles and co-insurances will be paid by the participants. Any additional
      costs for parking and travel the patients incur as a result of participating in the
      extension phase will not be reimbursed by the study. Novartis Pharmaceuticals will donate
      drug supply.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age greater than or equal to eighteen years.

          2. Clinical diagnosis of diffuse systemic sclerosis by ACR criteria, with a stable
             modified Rodnan skin score in the one month preceding introduction of oral Gleevec
             therapy. The modified Rodnan skin score must be greater than or equal to sixteen at
             screening and initiation of therapy.

          3. Disease duration of less than or equal to 10 years.

          4. Estimated ejection fraction of greater than 50% by echocardiography
