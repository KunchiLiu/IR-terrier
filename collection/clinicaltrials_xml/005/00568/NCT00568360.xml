  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endoscopy is a standard part of the evaluation of patients with head and neck cancer used
      for determining the extent of tumor involvement. However, not all areas involved by tumor
      are apparent visually. Preliminary results indicate that compared with normal tissues,
      tumors have abnormal levels of capillary oxygenation. The purpose of this study is to
      determine the ability of non-pulsatile visible light tissue oxygen monitoring to
      differentiate normal and tumor tissue based on capillary oxygenation during endoscopy Should
      this be possible, this method could be used to mark tumor extent and invasion, even when
      that invasion is up to 5mm blow the tissue surface.
