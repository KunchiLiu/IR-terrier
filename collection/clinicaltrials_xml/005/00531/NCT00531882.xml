  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inflammation clearly contributes to the progression of the cystic fibrosis (CF) lung
      disease, and administration of the anti-inflammatory agent high-dose ibuprofen retards the
      rate of decline of pulmonary function. However, utilization of this valuable drug has been
      suboptimal because of its rare, but dramatic, adverse effects. Therefore, alternative
      anti-inflammatory agents are urgently needed. One strategy for identifying new
      anti-inflammatory agents is to determine the mechanism by which the only proven
      anti-inflammatory agent for the CF lung disease, high-dose ibuprofen, exerts its effect. If
      this were known, then other drugs that act by a similar mechanism become candidates for
      treating the CF inflammatory disease. The investigators have shown, in our preliminary
      studies, that high dose ibuprofen limits the delivery of neutrophils to an inflamed mucosal
      surface, the gingival crevices. The investigators plan to test pioglitazone and simvastatin,
      (ibuprofen (positive control)) to determine their anti inflammatory affects on neutrophil
      migration to the oral mucosa.

      The hypothesis to be tested is that pioglitazone, and/or simvastatin will reduce neutrophils
      in the oral mucosa after 10 days of therapy in mouthwashes of healthy volunteers. Ibuprofen
      will be used as a positive control.

      This study will provide pilot data from healthy volunteers to support an FDA Grant to be
      submitted at a future date.

      The entire study period for each subject will be 15 days, and consist of 3 periods defined
      as: Baseline (Day 1,2,3), Treatment (Day 3-10), and Recovery (Day 13-15). Healthy volunteers
      will be screened on Day 1 (and assessed for eligibility); Eligible subjects will be divided
      into 3 drug treatment groups pioglitazone, simvastatin and ibuprofen the positive control.
      The two treatment groups will consist of 4 healthy volunteers who meet the inclusion
      criteria. There will be 2 healthy volunteers in the positive control group. Group 1 will
      receive pioglitazone 30 mg once daily, Group 2 will receive simvastatin 40 mg daily and
      Group 3 the positive control will receive ibuprofen (15-23 mg/kg twice daily, maximum 3200
      mg/day) during the Treatment period and serve as the positive control group. This dose is
      25% of that prescribed to CF patients. As healthy volunteers are recruited, the first will
      be assigned to Group 1, the second to Group 2, and so on. After the third subject has been
      assigned to Group 3, this pattern of assignment will be repeated with subjects 4, 5 and 6,
      The following 4 healthy volunteers will be assigned to group 1 and 2 (7, 8, 9, 10).
