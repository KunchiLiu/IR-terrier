  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done to see what effects sedative drugs during surgery have on
      peoples' thinking processes after they wake up.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We give sedative drugs to patients having spinal anesthesia so they are &quot;asleep&quot; (sedated)
      while we are fixing their broken hips. The spinal anesthesia provides pain relief at the
      site of surgery, while the sedative drugs keep people &quot;asleep&quot; during the procedure. We want
      to find out whether the amount of sedation we give might (1) make patients be confused when
      they wake up or (2) have anything to do with how well patients can do their ordinary daily
      routines a few months after their surgery.
