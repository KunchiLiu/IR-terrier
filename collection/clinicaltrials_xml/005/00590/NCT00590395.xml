      This is a pilot study to investigate the ability of FDG-PET and PET/CT as a direct method of
      detecting infection and/or inflammation of the gallbladder.

    <textblock>
      HIDA scintigraphy is a nuclear medicine scan used to evaluate patients suspected of having
      acute cholecystitis (infection/inflammation of the gallbladder). Because it is an indirect
      test that looks for obstruction of the cystic duct structure, there are many causes for a
      false-positive HIDA study. There is a need for a more sensitive and specific test that can
      accurately assess gallbladder infection and/or inflammation.

      The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of FDG as a direct means of
      detecting patients with acute cholecystitis. FDG is an imaging agent that has previously
      been shown to accumulate in areas of infection and/or inflammation. The location and
      intensity of FDG accumulation in the body can be detected with a camera system called a
      &quot;positron emission tomography&quot; (PET) camera. In theory, this test should be effective in
      detecting acute infection and/or inflammation of the gallbladder.

      Consenting participants will receive injection of FDG one hour prior to the FDG-PET/CT
      examination. The participant will then be imaged using a PET/CT machine, which is a special
      camera system that is capable of performing both a PET and CT scan at the same time. A CT
      scan is an anatomical imaging test and, for this research study, will mainly be used to
      localize the area of 18FDG accumulation recorded by the PET scan. The examination will take
      approximately one hour.

    <description>20 patients with suspected acute cholecystitis and a positive HIDA will be included in the study. This is purposely a highly selective population which most likely will have surgical proof of the findings. Subjects will receive an FDG PET/CT exam to determine the presence of gallbladder inflammation/infection(cholecystitis). Please note that 18FDG is an FDA approved radiopharmaceutical.</description>
