  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out if an approved medicine that is used to lower
      cholesterol called Lipitor can slow or stop progressive narrowing of the aortic heart valve
      in patients with a condition called aortic stenosis. Patients who have aortic stenosis who
      volunteer for this study will take Lipitor for 2 years and will undergo a brief exam by a
      physician, labwork to measure cholesterol, and a routine heart ultrasound (sound picture of
      the heart) at the start of the study and every 6 months, stopping at 2 years.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single-center study assessing the effect of atorvastatin 40 mg/day
      (Lipitor, Pfizer) on the progression of calcific aortic stenosis in approximately 70
      patients with mild to moderate calcific AS of a tricuspid or bicuspid aortic valve. As a
      control population, published data on historical AS cohorts will be used, employing the
      accepted rate of progression of a decrease in aortic valve area of 0.1 cm²/year.
      Additionally, also for comparison, we will prospectively study a registry of AS patients who
      meet our entry criteria but are either currently already being treated with or refuse to
      take an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (referred to as the &quot;standard care&quot; group).

      All patient visits, laboratory studies, and echocardiograms will be performed at the
      Cleveland Clinic Foundation in Cleveland, Ohio with the exception of the 12-week visit ALT
      measurement which may be done at the patient's local doctor's office and the results faxed
      to Imaging Research. The 12-week follow-up assessment may be completed over the phone to
      establish any change in patient status since baseline, study medication compliance,
      concomitant medication use and to ascertain whether or not the appropriate laboratory test
      was obtained. Over a 2-year period, assessments will be conducted at baseline, 6, 12, 18,
      and 24 months.
