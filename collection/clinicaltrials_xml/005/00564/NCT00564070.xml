    <textblock>
      Depression is a serious illness that affects a person's mood, thoughts, and physical being.
      Common symptoms of depression include persistent feelings of anxiety, guilt, or
      hopelessness; irregular sleep and appetite patterns; lethargy; disinterest in previously
      enjoyed activities; excessive irritability and restlessness; suicidal thoughts; and
      inability to concentrate. Depression is highly comorbid, often occurring in the presence of
      one or more other disorders. Up to 15% to 20% of the time, people with diabetes are also
      depressed. Diabetes is a disease that interferes with the body's proper production and use
      of the hormone insulin, which is needed to convert food into the energy required to perform
      daily life activities. Self-care is a crucial component of diabetes treatment. However,
      symptoms of depression can interfere with behaviors necessary to carry out this care.
      Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has shown success in treating people with depression, but
      the effect of CBT on self-care behaviors and depression of those with diabetes is not well
      known. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of CBT for medical adherence and
      depression (CBT-AD) in people with a depressive mood disorder and type 2 diabetes.

      Upon study entry, all participants will complete various assessments, including a
      psychiatric diagnostic interview, a series of paper questionnaires, neuropsychological
      testing, blood sample analysis, and blood sugar monitoring. Next, all participants will meet
      with a nutritionist and a nurse diabetes educator. The nutritionist will help set goals for
      eating, physical activity, weight, and blood glucose. The nurse diabetes educator will
      review diabetes medication history and blood glucose self-monitoring equipment.

      Participants will then be randomly placed in one of two counseling groups. One group will
      meet for a single session that will be devoted to diabetes medical adherence. The other
      group will attend 10 to12 individual CBT sessions for diabetes medical adherence and
      depression management. The CBT sessions will last 45 to 50 minutes and will require practice
      of coping skills outside the sessions. Participants receiving CBT will also complete weekly
      assessments of depression, self-care, and diabetes medical adherence. All participants will
      be asked to monitor a prescribed medication with a pill cap for the course of the study. At
      Month 2, participants in both groups will also meet again with the nutritionist to review
      original goals and adjust them as necessary. Most of the previous study assessments will be
      repeated at Months 4, 8, and 12. The neuropsychological testing will be repeated only at
      Month 12.
