    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the efficacy of an individual motivational interview
      followed by group sessions of cognitive behavior therapy for reducing alcohol and
      marijuana-related harm as well as alcohol and marijuana use in incarcerated teens.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although substance abuse is a major problem among incarcerated teens, little is known about
      ways to effectively treat this population. Elucidation of effective therapies for reducing
      substance use among incarcerated teens is important for a number of reasons. For example, a
      number of empirical studies have demonstrated a strong relationship between substance use
      and a variety of delinquent and/or dangerous activities, including driving under the
      influence, perpetration or falling victim to violent crime, and engaging in risky sexual
      behavior, as well as increases in recidivism to illegal behavior. Unfortunately, substance
      abuse treatment frequently is unavailable to teens in the juvenile justice system, and when
      it is available, treatment often is provided in group format using untested interventions,
      or to teens that are unmotivated to change their behavior.

      The objective of the present study is to investigate ways to enhance group therapy
      engagement and reduce substance use (specifically targeting alcohol and marijuana) and
      related behaviors (e.g., injury, sexual risk-taking, and illegal behavior) among juvenile
      offenders. Both Motivational Interviewing (MI) and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) have
      independently demonstrated success in reducing adolescent substance use in both incarcerated
      and non-incarcerated samples, thus a motivation and skills-based intervention such as the
      combination MI/CBT approach proposed here, might prove effective in attaining these goals.

                  Special attention will be given to recruitment of girls and members of minority
                  groups, with periodic reminders to social workers to alert participants in these
                  groups and their families to our project.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  They do not meet the above inclusion criteria or informed consent is not obtained
             from parent or guardian.
