  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Protocol is intended to facilitate development and testing of new cardiovascular MRI
      software capabilities by UC Davis Research Faculty, as well as to facilitate the evaluation
      of new software capabilities provided by GE and Siemens.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This protocol will permit normal subjects, as well as patients with suspected or proven
      medical conditions, to undergo MRI studies using the new software capabilities. This
      Protocol is not restricted to imaging of a particular organ system or disease. The Protocol
      does not involve injection of any contrast agent, or other minimally-invasive or invasive
      procedure. It is intended only for those cases for which the only requirement of the subject
      is to relax and lie still while imaging is being performed.
