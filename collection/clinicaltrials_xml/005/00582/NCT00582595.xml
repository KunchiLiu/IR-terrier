    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this study is to obtain detailed information that will allow a careful
      assessment of psychopathology, quality of life and eating behavior pre-surgically and at
      regular intervals for 2 years after the surgical intervention.

      Hypotheses

        1. Patients undergoing bariatric surgery will experience significant decreases in the
           rates of psychopathology, in particular depressive illness, and significant
           improvements in quality of life, post-operatively.

        2. Untreated psychopathology that persists well beyond the surgery (e.g. to one-year
           follow-up) or that develops post-operatively will be associated with less weight loss
           and decreased quality of life.

        3. Untreated psychopathology at the time of bariatric surgery, including affective
           disorders and substance abuse/alcohol abuse will be associated with increased
           short-term (e.g. 90 day) complications (e.g. problems with plugging, vomiting, and
           dehydration)

        4. Syndromal/subsyndromal eating disorders prior to surgery including binge eating
           disorder and night eating syndrome will be associated with eating disorder symptoms and
           less weight loss at long-term follow-up.
