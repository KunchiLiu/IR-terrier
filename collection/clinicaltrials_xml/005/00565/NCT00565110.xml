    <textblock>
      The ADAPt-C collaborative depression care model is designed to: improve depression symptom
      reduction in the intervention group over the modestly enhanced usual care group of
      low-income, predominantly Hispanic, patients with cancer who are receiving care in an urban
      public sector care system; and to improve quality of life outcomes among intervention
      patients over enhanced usual care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This controlled trial has tested the effectiveness of a socio-culturally tailored depression
      care program that includes a patient-centered approach to antidepressant medication
      management or structured psychotherapy (Problem Solving Treatment (PST)), patient/family
      depression education, treatment maintenance and relapse prevention counseling. Intervention
      enhancements include: depression care management based on a stepped care depression
      treatment algorithm; extension of the oncology care management team with a master's degreed
      social worker, who acts as Cancer Depression Clinical Specialist (CDCS) and provides PST,
      treatment follow-up and feedback to the oncologist, and who facilitates patient-provider
      communication and health system and community resources navigation; a psychiatric
      consultant, who provides supervision of the CDCS and consultation and antidepressant
      medication prescription for individual patients; and a didactic for oncologists on
      depression management. Cultural sensitivity and competency enhancements include: patient
      choice of first line treatment (antidepressant medication/PST) and degree of family
      participation in their depression care; PST tailored for language and literacy of patients
      with cancer; bilingual, bicultural CDCS; Spanish educational materials; and communication
      facilitation. Enhanced Usual Care (EUC) patients will receive the care and services
      routinely provided patients with cancer plus an educational/resource pamphlet for patients
      and for family members(on depression and cancer, depression treatment, talking with your
      doctor about your depression, and medical center and community mental health care
      resources). With patient consent, the oncologist is informed if EUC patients screen positive
      for major depression/dysthymia.
