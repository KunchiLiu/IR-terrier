      Objective: Chronic epidural cortical stimulation (ECS) involves the neurosurgical placement
      of an electric wire on the surface of the brain with intermittent activation. Over time, ECS
      modulates local and distal connected brain regions. It is being currently applied over the
      motor cortex to treat intractable pain. Because of the important role played by the medial
      prefrontal cortex in mood regulation, the goal of this study is to apply this minimally
      invasive neurostimulation modality over medial prefrontal cortex in severely ill depressed
      subjects who have failed all other attempts at treatment.

      Hypothesis: Severely Treatment Resistant Unipolar Depressed Subjects with EpCS of medial
      prefrontal cortex will show a significant decrease in depression symptoms at 6 months
      post-implant when compared to baseline and to a matched control group treated with
      electroconvulsive therapy (ECT).

      Method: We will enroll 5 subjects with severe refractory depression in an open trial with a
      1 month placebo lead in, and for up to 1 years. We will also naturalistically follow 5
      matched control patients treated with ECT. Depressive and cognitive symptoms will be rated
      periodically to assess the safety and efficacy of this procedure.

      Significance: This study takes advantage of the expertise at MUSC with various
      neuromodulation technologies to begin answering the crucial role of targeted cortical brain
      stimulation and its potential role in treatment resistant depression. This is a crucial
      pilot study that might lead to an entire new class of therapies for depression.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        To be eligible for this study, a subject must meet all the following inclusion and
        exclusion criteria:

          -  Subject has a diagnosis of chronic (≥ two years) or recurrent (multiple prior
             episodes) depression and is currently experiencing a major depressive episode without
             psychotic features as defined by DSM IV criteria.

          -  Subjects may have a diagnosis or unipolar or bipolar depressive episode.

          -  Subject has not had an adequate response to 4 or more adequate antidepressant
             treatments in the current depressive episode according to the Antidepressant
             Treatment History Form (ATHF) (Sackeim et al 1997).

          -  Subject must be between the ages of 21 and 80.

          -  Baseline HDRS 24-item ≥ 20 (both visits 1 week apart)

          -  Subject must be able to complete the evaluations needed for this study including the
             functional imaging scans.

          -  Subject must have had a history of one successful course of ECT in the past.

          -  Subject must provide written informed consent.

          -  Subject is stable on all antidepressant medication for at least 4 weeks before the
             baseline visit or not be taking antidepressant medication prior to entering the
             study.

          -  Subject must be able to remain on current medication schedule for the first 19 weeks
             of the study.

          -  Subject is not on a medication known to increase the risk of cortical
             stimulation-induced seizures. These include theophylline, stimulant medications,
             bupropion, or supraphysiological doses of thyroid supplements.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        The presence of any of the following will exclude a subject from the study:

          -  The EpCS would (in the investigator's judgment) pose an unacceptable surgical or
             medical risk for the patient (including, but not limited to: history of serious
             cardiac or pulmonary problems, stroke, significant brain malformation, progressive
             neurological disease, central nervous system disease or injury, history of seizure,
             previous neurosurgical procedure with suspected brain tissue scarring that would
             increase the risks for seizure or cervical fracture).

             prior to the EpCS implant, the subject has made a suicide attempt or gesture or has
             made specific plans or preparation to commit suicide).

          -  Subject has a history of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or other psychotic
             disorder, active substance abuse or dependence (with the exception to caffeine and
             nicotine abuse) or a current major depressive episode that includes psychotic
             features (commonly referred to as psychotic depression) according to the DSM IV
             criteria.

          -  Subject with a diagnosis of dementia with a Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) ≤23.

          -  Female subjects with a positive urine pregnancy test.
