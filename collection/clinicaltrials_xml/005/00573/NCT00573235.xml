      The purpose of this study is to review patients with E. coli infections at the University of
      Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) from July 1, 2007 to June 30, 2010 to determine if these
      infections have arisen in the community rather than in hospitals or nursing homes.

      All samples provided to the investigators are deidentified by the honest broker and will be
      coded with numbers. The information linking these code numbers to the corresponding
      subjects' identities will be kept in a separate, secure location that only the honest broker
      has access to. The investigators on this study will keep the samples indefinitely. Samples
      will be kept in the investigator's laboratory located in Scaife Hall, room 812, 3500 Terrace
      Street. At no time with the research investigators have access to any patient identifers.
