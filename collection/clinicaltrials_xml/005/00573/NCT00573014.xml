    <textblock>
      The optimal method of clearing the cervical spine in obtunded trauma patients is unclear.
      Computed tomography (CT) identifies most injuries but may miss ligamentous injuries.
      Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging has been widely used to exclude ligamentous injuries. We
      postulate that with the new generation of CT scanners, MR imaging is not needed to rule out
      significant injuries. Our protocol for clearing the cervical spine in obtunded trauma
      patients depends on CT alone. We are prospectively following these patients and performing a
      clinical examination when they are awake to show this is a safe approach.

        Subjects will include all patients (including children) after blunt trauma in whom
        cervical spine injury has not been ruled out admitted to MetroHealth Medical Center from
        10/1/2004-9/30/2006. We are excluding patients with an obvious neurologic deficit
        attributable to the cervical spine. We are excluding patients with abnormalities of the
        cervical spine that are identified on either plain films or CT. We are also excluding
        those patients in whom the cervical spine can be cleared clinically due to normal mental
        status.
