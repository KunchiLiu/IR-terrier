    <textblock>
      The University of Alabama at Birmingham Recessive Polycystic Kidney Disease Core Center (UAB
      RPKDCC) has established a NIDDK-funded, interdisciplinary center of excellence in
      PKD-related research, with specific emphasis on recessive PKD. Among the five Cores, the UAB
      RPKDCC includes the ARPKD Clinical and Genetic Resource, a Core resource designed to develop
      a unique set of clinical, genetic, and educational resources for ARPKD. The Core has three
      primary objectives:

        1. To extend the observational study of ARPKD initiated by the North American ARPKD
           Database.

        2. To provide a mechanism for genetic evaluation of patients with both classic ARPKD and
           unusual phenotypes of recessive PKD.

        3. To develop educational tools for physicians and patients regarding the natural history,
           cause, development and effects of the disease, genetic testing, and clinical trials
           applicable to ARPKD.

      The Study protocol and the Informed Consent for the Clinical Database will be posted on the
      website (http://www.arpkdstudies.uab.edu/) for review by potential participants and
      follow-up discussions with the PI and/or Research Nurse Coordinator. In addition, materials
      in paper format can be sent to interested potential participants upon request.

      Two key elements will be required for patient enrollment: 1) certification that informed
      consent has been obtained, and 2) certification that permission for release of selected
      health information has also been obtained, including the date of signature. Once receipt of
      these items is confirmed, the following actions will proceed:

        1. the participant will be assigned a unique identifier in the database and a
           clinician-specific web field will be opened for that identifier.

        2. the participant/parents will confirm the name of their clinician to the database and
           notify their physician and/or genetic counselor (clinicians) of their intent to
           participate in this study.

        3. the clinician will access the Physician Link on the website, type in the patient name
           and the referring center, and if matched to the patient's report, will receive the
           unique identifier for that patient. Once this is done, the name of the patient will be
           deleted from the online database and only the unique identifier will be used. Each
           clinician permitted to access this website will be tracked with a login procedure that
           includes a process to verify who is entering the system.

        4. This unique identifier will allow the clinician to open the clinical database entry
           form and provide the information requested in each field. No names or initials will be
           collected in this data form, but gender and date of birth (which will be converted to
           age and only the month and year will be kept on file) will be requested.

        In view of the genetics and demographics of ARPKD in North America, we estimate that 50%
        of the subjects will be female; that 90% of the subjects will be Caucasian and the
        remainder will belong to the following racial/ethnic categories: 5% African-Americans; 3%
        Hispanics; 1% Asians; and 1% or less will be other categories.
