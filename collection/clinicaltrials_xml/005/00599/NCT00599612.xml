  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be an open label study conducted at one site. Six healthy male subjects will be
      enrolled to ensure at least four fully evaluable subjects. Each subject will receive a
      single 10 mg oral dose of GW856553 containing 50 microCi of [14C] GW856553. Urine and faecal
      samples will be collected until 216 h after dosing but subjects may be discharged after 168
      h if 90% of the dose is recovered and/or &lt;1% of the dose is excreted in a 24 h period. Blood
      and plasma will be collected at various sample times after dosing to measure parent drug and
      total drug-related material. Samples of urine, faeces and plasma will be transferred into a
      separate study to characterise and quantify metabolites in these matrices. Safety will be
      assessed by adverse event monitoring, vital signs, ECG and clinical laboratory tests.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy male aged between 30 and 60 years inclusive, at the time of screening.

          -  Body weight &gt;/ 50 kg (110 lbs).

          -  A body mass index (BMI) within the range of 18.5 to 29.9 kg/m2 inclusive.

          -  Signed and dated written informed consent prior to admission to the study.

          -  The subject is able to understand and comply with protocol requirements, instructions
             and protocol-stated restrictions.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any clinically relevant abnormality identified on the screening medical assessment,
             laboratory examination, or ECG (12-lead).

          -  Significant cardiac, pulmonary, metabolic, renal, hepatic, or gastrointestinal
             conditions that in the opinion of the investigator and/or GSK medical monitor, places
             the subject at an unacceptable risk as participant in this trial.

          -  QTc(b) &gt; 450msecs

          -  A definite or suspected personal or family history of adverse reactions or

             units (or an average daily intake of greater than 3 units). One unit is equivalent to
             a half-pint (284mL) of beer/lager; 25mL measure of spirits or 125mL of wine).

             will not introduce additional risk or interfere with the study procedures or outcome.

          -  Liver function tests (ALT, AST, ALP, GammaGT and bilirubin) &gt; upper limit of normal
             (ULN) at screening
