    <textblock>
      We hypothesize that variations in anatomic location of the arm lymphatic drainage system put
      the arm lymphatics at risk for disruption during a SLNB and / or ALND. Therefore, mapping
      the drainage of the arm during the procedure would decrease the likelihood of inadvertent
      disruption of the lymphatics and the subsequent development of lymphedema. A combination of
      radioactivity and blue dye will be used.

      Mapping Procedure:

      Each patient will receive an injection of 1.0 mCi of technetium-99m sulfur colloid into the
      normal breast tissue surrounding the primary cancer or biopsy cavity directed subareolar or
      around the tumor.

      If the radioactive SLN cannot be located prior to incision via gamma probe then the blue dye
      will be used in the breast either in the subareolar plexus or peritumorally at the
      discretion of the surgeon. For this contingency (expected to occur &lt;3% of the time), the
      blue dye will be used in the breast (and NOT the arm), as the prime concern is locating the
      SLN for staging.

      If the blue dye is unnecessary to find the sentinel node draining from the breast, then it
      will be injected dermally in the upper inner arm along the Biceps groove of the ipsilateral
      arm in order to locate the draining lymphatics from the arm. No more than 5cc of blue dye
      will be injected in either the subareolar plexus, peritumorally (intraparenchymal or
      dermally), or dermally in the patient's ipsilateral arm dependent upon the contingencies
      stated above. Site of all injections (radioactivity and/or blue dye) will be recorded.

    <description>During surgery, the technetium-99m sulfur colloid will be injected into the breast and the blue dye injected (if the patient is not allergic and it is not required to locate the SLN) in the patient's ipsilateral upper arm. The lymph node biopsy and/or dissection will be performed by the surgeon, according to standard practice.</description>
