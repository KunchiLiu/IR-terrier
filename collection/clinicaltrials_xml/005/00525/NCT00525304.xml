      This study will develop and evaluate the effectiveness of a self-management program for
      adults living with both schizophrenia and a co-occurring medical condition.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Schizophrenia is a life-long brain disorder affecting approximately 1 percent of Americans
      each year. Schizophrenia can be extremely disabling, causing people to hear voices,
      experience paranoia or hallucinations, and believe that others are controlling their
      thoughts. People with schizophrenia also experience increased rates of concurrent medical
      conditions, such as diabetes, respiratory illness, and heart disease. This can make holding
      a job or even caring for oneself very difficult. The purpose of this study is to develop and
      evaluate a self-management program for adults living with both schizophrenia and a
      concurrent medical condition.

      Participants in this open-label study will attend 10 to 16 group sessions led by two group
      leaders. Group sessions will meet each week for an hour during which participants will learn
      new skills to help them take responsibility for the daily management of chronic medical
      conditions. In addition to learning how to communicate more effectively with medical
      providers, participants will learn about healthy eating, the importance of physical
      activity, addictive behaviors that can worsen health conditions, and proper use of
      medications. Homework will be assigned weekly for participants to review skills learned in
      each session. After each session, participants will complete a survey to evaluate the
      session's effectiveness. At the end of the study, participants will attend one additional
      group meeting and an individual interview to discuss the overall effectiveness of the
      intervention and their experiences in the group sessions. The results of this study will be
      used to evaluate and improve the self-management program for future use.
