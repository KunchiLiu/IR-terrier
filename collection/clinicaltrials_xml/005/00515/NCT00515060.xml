      The goal of this clinical research study is to improve understanding of the sensory
      qualities of patients who have pain caused by cancer therapy. This information will add to
      the understanding of what causes this pain and may lead to better management of the pain.
      The specific goal is to define the sensory capacity of patients in their area of pain as a
      consequence of cancer therapy compared to another body area without pain.

      Study Participation:

      Participants will be contacted either before their initiation of chemotherapy or following
      their referral to pain management service for neuropathic cancer treatment-related pain.

      The sensory tests will take about 1 hour to complete. These tests will seek to find the
      threshold (a measure of sensitivity) at which you perceive stimuli, such as touch, coolness,
      warmth, hot/cold feeling and pinprick. You will be asked to rate the intensity of each of
      these stimuli that you perceive to be painful. You will also be asked to rate the intensity
      of stimuli that are at a fixed intensity above the pain threshold for most people. Your skin
      temperature using a radiometer, a scan of your fingers and/or toes, grooved peg board, a
      timed task to place pegs in slots, and pain scale rating will be collected. Each part of the
      sensory test are optional and will be collected when possible.

      You may either be tested at repeated intervals throughout your chemotherapy or at later
      follow-up dates to check the length of symptoms.

      Length of Study:

      Your participation will be complete once you have completed all the sensory testing.

      This is an investigational study. A total of 450 patients will be enrolled in this study.
      All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Since moderate pain, albeit brief, will be induced, this feasibility project will be
             limited to consenting adults, 18 years old or older, in which there is also a well
             established QST database.

          2. The subjects must be able to understand the nature of the study and have signed
             consent.

          3. The patients must either: a) have pain that has developed as a consequence of cancer
             therapy with either vinca alkaloids, taxanes, bortezomib, thalidomide, platinum-based
             compounds or ionizing irradiation. OR b) have no pain that has developed as a
             consequence of cancer therapy, and are just entering chemotherapy with taxanes, vinka
             alkaloids, bortezomib, thalidomide, or platinum-based compounds

          4. (For Healthy Controls) Willing to participate and have signed an informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who refuse to participate or who are determined incapable of completing the
             research.

          2. (For Healthy Controls) Receiving anti-coagulants, immunosuppressed or diabetic.
