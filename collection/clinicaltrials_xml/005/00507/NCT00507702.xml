        Tumors occur predominantly in the adult population after age 30, regardless of gender and
        ethnic background. Therefore, our study population will consist mainly of adult subjects.
        We do not have any exclusion criteria based on age range, gender or ethnic background.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients diagnosed with cancerous tumors based on biopsy or other clinical
             observations.

          2. Patients diagnosed with non-cancerous tumors based on biopsy or other clinical
             observations.

          3. Normal volunteers who do not have cancer or other medical conditions that may affect
             survival.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients will be excluded if, upon clinical observation, they are under a severe
             septic or inflammatory condition. In these conditions, human body immune response
             against sepsis or inflammation should be the predominant response, and may shield or
             block the immune response against tumors.

          2. Patients will be excluded if, upon clinical observation, they are under extremely
             illness situation like myocardial infarction. In such a case, the immune findings may
             be altered.

          3. Patients will be excluded if, upon looking through their medical records, significant
             information required for data analysis is missing. This is because that patients'
             medical records will help us connect our research findings with their clinical
             observations, and further provide guidelines for subsequent treatment options.
