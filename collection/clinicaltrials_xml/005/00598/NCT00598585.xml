          -  Age greater than 18 (because of concerns about radioactivity, we and the Cedars-Sinai
             and Harbor-UCLA IRBs have decided not to enroll subjects below the age of 18).

          -  Age less than 50. Because of concern of sildenafil exacerbating coronary artery

          -  Willingness to be off all medicines and supplements for 3 weeks prior to the study.

          -  Patients with psychiatric disorders (see below) will be included, if they could be
             off their medications, and if their psychiatric diagnosis clearly occurred after
             their fatigue symptoms began.

          -  Patients with concurrent fibromyalgia will be allowed to participate if the meet
             diagnostic criteria for CFS.

          -  Disabilities that would prevent them from participating in the study.

          -  Current use of prescription medicines (starting at 3 weeks prior to the study) and
             supplements (starting at 1 weeks prior to the study) except acetaminophen or aspirin.

             Patients with depression of such severity as to warrant treatment with
             anti-depressants will be excluded.

          -  Current abuse of illicit drugs or heavy ethanol use.

          -  Pregnant women will be excluded because of radioactivity exposure from the SPECT
             scans.

          -  Abnormal EKG

          -  Abnormal CBC, blood chemistries, thyroid function tests, and HIV, ANA, RF and ESR
