      This study is to assess whether utilizing endoscopic ultrasound(EUS) to guide treatment can
      improve durable fistula healing in patients with Crohn's perianal fistulas and to get
      preliminary information regarding the effectiveness of Adalimumab for Crohn's perianal
      fistulas.
