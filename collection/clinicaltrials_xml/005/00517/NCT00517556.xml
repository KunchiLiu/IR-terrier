  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary hypothesis is that continuous administration of an OCP (CCOCP regimen) will
      result in more pain relief than a traditional 21/7 administration in primary dysmenorrhea
      (PD) patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is well established that excess prostaglandin production in primary dysmenorrhea (PD)
      leads to ischemia of the uterine muscle, which consequently causes pelvic pain. A large
      number of drugs have been studied for pain relief in dysmenorrhea patients with non-steroid
      anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) being the most effective with the overall success rate of
      more than 75%. Oral contraceptive pills (OCP) are also an established treatment for PD with
      the success rate of 70%. Lately, OCP's have been used continuously in patients with
      endometriosis and had better pain control than traditional administration of OCP.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have contraindications to OCP therapy.

          -  Known or suspected secondary dysmenorrhea (major abdominal or pelvic surgery,
             endometriosis, pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), ovarian cysts, pathological vaginal
             secretion, chronic abdominal pain, inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel
             syndrome).

          -  Concomitant treatment with oral contraceptives, GnRH agonists and antagonists,
             antiandrogens, gonadotropins, anti-obesity drugs.

          -  The use of contraceptive implants, injectable contraceptives or intrauterine devices.
             The washout period on all these medications will be 3 months.

          -  Migraines, depression requiring hospitalization or associated with suicidal ideation
