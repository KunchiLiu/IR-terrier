      RATIONALE: Giving chemotherapy and total-body irradiation before a donor peripheral blood
      stem cell transplant helps stop the growth of cancer and abnormal cells and helps stop the
      patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. When stem cells from a donor
      are infused into the patient they may help the patient's bone marrow make stem cells, red
      blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Sometimes the transplanted cells from a donor
      can make an immune response against the body's normal cells. Removing the T cells from the
      donor cells before transplant may stop this from happening. Giving an infusion of the
      donor's T cells (donor lymphocyte infusion) after the transplant may help destroy any
      remaining cancer cells (graft-versus-tumor effect).

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying T-cell depletion in donor stem cell transplant
      followed by delayed T cell infusions in treating patients with hematologic cancer or other
      disease.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine if T-cell depletion of a peripheral blood progenitor cell (PBPC) graft
           followed by delayed add-backs of defined doses of donor lymphocytes decreases the rate
           of graft-versus-host disease and its complications in matched unrelated donor (MUD)
           allogeneic PBPC transplantation in patients with hematologic cancers or other diseases.

        -  Determine whether targeted T-cell dosages in the PBPC graft can be achieved in these
           patients by positive CD34+ selection using the Baxter Inc. Isolex 300i v. 2.5.

        -  Determine the effects of T-cell depletion on the rate of engraftment in these patients.

        -  Develop a MUD allogeneic transplantation regimen that will decrease overall
           treatment-related mortality in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a non-randomized study.

        -  Myeloablative preparative regimen: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV once daily on
           days -5 and -4 followed by total body irradiation twice daily on days -3, -2, and -1.
           Patients also receive tacrolimus on day -1 administered by continuous IV infusion over
           24 hours.

        -  Peripheral blood progenitor cell graft transplantation: Patients receive T-cell
           depleted, peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC) by IV infusion on day 0. Beginning 1
           day after completion of the PBPC infusion, patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF)
           subcutaneously once daily until blood counts recover.

        -  Post transplantation T cell add-backs: Patients receive defined doses of donor T cells
           by IV infusion on days 45 and 100, in the absence of active graft-versus-host disease
           (GVHD) requiring steroids*.

      NOTE: *A T cell add-back may be given in the presence of GVHD, if the investigator considers
      the risk from relapse or overwhelming viral infection to outweigh the risk of exacerbating
      GVHD.

      Patients will be followed periodically for relapse and survival.

After the first 10 patients are enrolled, accrual will halt temporarily until all 10 patients have been followed for 45 days post-transplant so that graft failure can be assessed. If 4 or more patients experience graft failure by day 45, the study will be terminated. Otherwise, the study will continue. Assuming the study continues, chimerism will continue to be monitored.
