    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn about the twisting or wringing motion of the heartbeat
      called torsion which can be seen on ultrasound. This study will help figure out if there is
      a difference in the how a heart twists at rest and with exercise in people with normal
      hearts compared to people with HCM (abnormally thickened heart muscle). Volunteers will have
      an echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart) while lying on a bed both at rest and while
      peddling a wheel located at at the foot of the bed. The patients will take about 1 to 1 1/2
      hours total and the study will be complete after this procedure.

      Left ventricular myocardial torsion (myocardial wringing motion) will be investigated by the
      use of tissue Doppler echocardiography in both normal and HCM (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy)
      patients. The objective of this study is to characterize the myocardial torsional behavior
      in normal and in HCM patients both at rest and while undergoing moderate physiological
      exercise.

      After a routine echocardiographic study, tissue Doppler echocardiogram will be performed
      before and during supine bicycle exercise. Stress EchoTM Bed with ergometer (supine bicycle)
      is used during exercise testing. Standard electrocardiogram and blood pressure will be
      monitored throughout the exercise testing. This procedure will take about 1 to 1 1/2 hours
      and will not involve any follow-up.
