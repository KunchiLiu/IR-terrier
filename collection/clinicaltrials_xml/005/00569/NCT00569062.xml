  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GW856553 is a novel compound, currently in development for the treatment of Major Depressive
      Disorder (MDD), and other indications. GW856553 inhibits a protein which is responsible for
      the production of some pro-inflammatory molecules, called cytokines. Increased blood levels
      of these molecules were seen in populations of MDD patients and this was more apparent in
      subjects with severe symptoms, psychomotor retardation and loss of energy. Aim of the
      present study is to assess whether GW856553, by inactivating this protein, is able to
      suppress the production of the cytokines, and ultimately relieving depression symptoms. In
      this study GW856553 or placebo is given to MDD patients 7.5md twice daily for 6 weeks.
