      RATIONALE: Vaccines may help the body build an effective immune response to kill cancer
      cells. Giving vaccine therapy after an autologous stem cell transplant may kill any cancer
      cells that remain after transplant.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well vaccine therapy works in treating patients
      who have undergone autologous stem cell transplant for high-risk lymphoma or multiple
      myeloma.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Assess immune reconstitution as measured by response to pneumococcal polyvalent
           vaccine, NK-cell activity against autologous lymphoblastoid cell lines, and
           cytomegalovirus and Epstein-Barr virus tetramer responses in patients who have
           undergone autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for high-risk lymphoma or
           multiple myeloma.

      Secondary

        -  Assess the absolute number of circulating regulatory T-cells and the function of these
           cells as measured by their expression of TGFβ and interleukin-10 (IL-10).

        -  Evaluate the effect of conditioning therapy on quality of life, including functional
           status, fatigue, and depression, in these patients.

        -  Correlate quality of life with inflammatory cytokine production of peripheral blood
           monocytes at specified time points.

        -  Provide baseline immune reconstitution and quality of life pilot data for comparison in
           future post-transplant immunotherapy trials.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive pneumococcal polyvalent vaccine intramuscularly once in weeks 9,
      17, and 25 after autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

      Blood samples are collected periodically for correlative and immunological studies.

      Quality of life (QOL) is assessed periodically using the QOL short form (SF-36, 4-week
      version), the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale (CES-D), and the
      Multidimensional Fatigue Symptom Inventory (MFSI-30).

    <description>The conjugate vaccine for Streptococcus pneumoniae will be administered during weeks 9, 17, and 25 after autologous HSCT - the study nurse will arrange for the vaccine to be administered at the specified time and the patient will be instructed to notify an investigator or study nurse of any side effects of vaccine administration. At the specified times, patients will fill out the quality-of-life assessment. All patients enrolled on this trial will have samples procured for all proposed laboratory correlative studies.</description>
