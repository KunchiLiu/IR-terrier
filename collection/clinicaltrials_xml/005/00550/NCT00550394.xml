      The purpose of this research study is to study the effects (both good and bad) of combining
      quetiapine and topiramate for treating symptoms of bipolar mania (an illness with periods of
      elation, excessive excitement, irritability, high energy, racing thoughts, poor sleep, poor
      judgment, reckless behavior) and to study the effects (both good and bad) of combining
      quetiapine and topiramate for reducing use of alcohol.

      Specific Aim 1: To collect preliminary data regarding the efficacy and tolerability of
      topiramate for the treatment of alcohol use disorders (alcohol abuse and dependence) in
      adolescents with bipolar disorder.

      Hypothesis 1: We hypothesize that topiramate in combination with quetiapine will lead to
      greater reduction in alcohol consumption (number of drinks per day, number of drinks per
      drinking day, and number of heavy drinking days) and greater abstinence (percentage of days
      abstinent) compared with quetiapine alone.

      Specific Aim 2: To obtain preliminary data regarding the efficacy of topiramate for reducing
      manic symptoms in adolescents with co-occurring alcohol use and bipolar disorders.

      Hypothesis 2: We hypothesize that the topiramate in combination with quetiapine will produce
      greater reduction in Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) scores than quetiapine alone.
