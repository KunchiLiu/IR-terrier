  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ABCB1-gene product P-glycoprotein is an integral membrane protein that actively
      transports substrates out of the intracellular compartment. One of the major sites of its
      action is the blood-brain-barrier. It is highly expressed in brain capillary endothelial
      cells and involved in limiting the access of substrates such as antidepressants to the CNS.
      A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of the ABCB1-gene was recently identified showing a
      different treatment response to antidepressant drugs depending on the genotype. Therefore,
      it is assumed that healthy subjects with different genotypes of that SNP will be associated
      with significantly different brain levels of the antidepressant escitalopram after 6 days of
      intake. For determining intracerebral escitalopram levels, a 19-F magnetic resonance
      spectroscopy will be used. Sleep recordings are a useful bio-marker for effects of
      antidepressants on the CNS. Selective 5-HT1-reuptake inhibitors (e.g. escitalopram) cause a
      suppression of REM sleep and a stronger fragmentation of sleep compared to untreated
      subjects. Higher plasma levels of antidepressants affected the sleep to a greater extent
      than lower levels. In line with this finding, we suppose that sleep EEG recordings of
      healthy subjects with different genotypes of the above mentioned SNP will be differently
      affected after taking 6 days escitalopram. In addition, there is good evidence that sleep is
      involved in various forms of memory processing. For example, it has been repeatedly shown
      that the performance in motor tasks (procedural learning) is correlated with the amount of
      stage 2 NonREM and REM sleep, respectively. Hence we hypothesize, that a drug-induced
      impairment of sleep (e. g. reduction of REM sleep) is associated with an impairment of
      procedural learning. In addition, effects of drug intake on the gene expression in
      lymphocytes and metabolic changes will be assessed. Functional magnetic resonance imaging
      will be applied to detect potential drug-induced changes of corticolimbic circuitries.
