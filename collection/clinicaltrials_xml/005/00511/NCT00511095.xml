  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to further evaluate the safety and seroprotective immune
      response of a new investigational hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccine, HEPLISAV™, in subjects
      11-55 years old. The primary hypothesis is that HEPLISAV™ is well tolerated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a major global health problem. Worldwide, it is
      estimated that 2 billion people have been infected previously and 350 million are
      chronically infected. While acute HBV infection is associated with significant illness, the
      risk of chronic infection is of great importance since 5-10% of infected adults will not
      clear the infection after the initial phase of the illness. About 25% of people who do not
      initially clear the infection will later develop chronic active hepatitis.

      This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of two injections of HEPLISAV™ in subjects
      11 to 55 years old. About 200 subjects will be included in the study. Once subjects have
      been consented and screened, they will receive a total of two injections over a 28-day
      period, with follow-up visits at 8, 12 and 28 weeks. Safety and tolerability will be
      evaluated by occurrence of adverse events, periodic laboratory tests, vital signs, and
      local/systemic reactogenicity.

      Comparison: This study does not include a control treatment; all subjects will receive
      treatment with HEPLISAV™.
