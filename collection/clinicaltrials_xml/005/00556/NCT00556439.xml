  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Giant cell arteritis (GCA) and Takayasu's arteritis (TAK) are diseases that cause swelling
      of the arteries in the head, neck, upper body, and arms. TAK specifically affects the aorta,
      the largest blood vessel in the body, and its branches. Therapies are available to improve
      the symptoms of GCA and TAK, but relapse often occurs, and better treatments are needed.
      Abatacept is a drug that interacts with certain cells in the body that are involved with GCA
      and TAK. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of abatacept in treating GCA and TAK and
      preventing disease relapse.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      GCA and TAK both cause inflammation in the lining of the arteries, which can interfere with
      the body's ability to carry oxygen to areas that need it. Symptoms of GCA include headaches,
      jaw pain, and blurred or double vision. Serious symptoms that occur less commonly are
      blindness and stroke. TAK symptoms include fever, fatigue, weight loss, arthritis, and
      non-specific aches and pains. There may also be tenderness near affected arteries.
      Researchers believe that GCA and TAK are diseases that are controlled by the body's immune
      system. Activated T-cells, specifically, are critical to the origin and development of these
      diseases. Abatacept is a medication that modulates the signal required for T-cell
      activation. This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of abatacept in treating
      GCA and TAK and preventing disease relapse.

      Participation in this study may last up to 4 years. Participants will receive abatacept
      intravenously on specified days during Months 1, 2, and 3. They will also receive daily
      prednisone, which will be started at a dose of 40 to 60mg, then tapered to 20mg by Month 3,
      and finally further tapered until discontinuation is reached. At Month 3, participants who
      have achieved remission will be randomly assigned under double-blind conditions to either
      continue abatacept or be switched to placebo infusions. Both treatments will be given once a
      month at study visits. Blood samples will also be collected at the monthly study visits to
      conduct laboratory-based studies. Participants who remain in remission will continue to
      receive abatacept or placebo monthly until the common closing date, defined as 12 months
      after enrollment of the 33rd participant for each disease.

    <description>This is a randomized withdrawal design protocol. All participants will receive abatacept and prednisone (a glucocorticoid) for the first 3 months. Abatacept will be given intravenously on selected days. Prednisone will be started at a dose of 40 to 60mg, then tapered to 20mg by Month 3, and finally further tapered until discontinuation is reached. At Month 3, participants who have achieved remission will be randomly assigned under double-blind conditions to receive monthly infusions of either abatacept or placebo. Participants who are assigned to abatacept at this point will be in Group A.</description>

    <description>Participants will receive a fixed dose of abatacept, approximating 10mg per kilogram of body weight. The following dosing rules will be followed:
Participants weighing less than 60kg will receive 500mg of abatacept.
Participants weighing 60 to 100kg will receive 750mg of abatacept.
Participants weighing more than 100kg will receive 1000mg of abatacept.
Abatacept will be administered in a 30-minute intravenous infusion on Days 1, 15, 29 (Month 1) and at Month 2. In the absence of toxicity or relapse, participants will remain on abatacept at the same dosage until randomization at Month 3. After randomization, only Group A participants will continue on abatacept.</description>
