        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with clinically stable persistent mild/moderate asthma within the 4 weeks
             preceding the screening visit, with the exclusion of other significant pulmonary
             diseases (e.g. chronic bronchitis, emphysema, bronchiectasis, cystic fibrosis or
             bronchopulmonary dysplasia)

          -  Subjects with a screening pre-bronchodilator FEV1 70% predicted (having abstained
             from bronchodilators for the required period). Predicted values are based on the
             NHanes normal ranges

          -  During the screening visit, subjects must demonstrate the presence of reversible
             airway disease, defined as an increase in FEV1 of 12.0% over the max of the three
             screening measures and an absolute change of 150 mL within 30 minutes following a
             single 400 mg salbutamol dose

          -  Male and females who are aged between 18 and 65 years of age.A female is eligible to
             enter and participate in the study if she is of:

               1. Non-childbearing potential (i.e., physiologically incapable of becoming
                  pregnant), including any female who is post menopausal. For the purposes of this
                  study, post menopausal is defined as 1 year without menses (FSH/LH will be also
                  tested to confirm menopausal status); or

               2. Child bearing potential, has a negative pregnancy test (urine) at screening and
                  pre-dose Day 1, and agrees to one of the following acceptable contraceptive
                  methods when used consistently and correctly (i.e., in accordance with the
                  approved product label and the instructions of a physician for the duration of
                  the study - screening visit to follow-up contact):

        Complete abstinence from intercourse from the screening visit, throughout the trial and
        for 7 (~5 half-lives of GSK256066) days after the completion of the trial; or Male partner
        was sterile prior to the female subject's entry into the study, or Implants of
        levonorgestrel inserted for at least 1 month prior to the study medication administration
        but not beyond the third successive year following insertion; or Injectable progestogen
        administered for at least 1 month prior to the study medication administration and
        administered for 1 month following study completion; or Oral contraceptive (combined or
        progestogen only) administered for a least one monthly cycle prior to study medication
        administration; or The contraceptive transdermal patch, Ortho Evra (if the subject is less
        than 89kg); or Double-barrier method - spermicide plus a mechanical barrier (e.g.,
        spermicide plus a male condom or a spermicide and female diaphragm.

        Recent data now shows that certain double-barrier methods have a failure rate below 1%
        [Trussell, 2003]. Specifically, these are a spermicide plus a mechanical barrier (e.g.,
        spermicide plus a male condom or a female diaphragm). This provides validated confirmation
        of the failure rate of the double-barrier method. Thus this method now meets the stated
        criterion for acceptable contraception in the EMEA guidelines [CPMP/ICH/285/95, 2000]; or
        Condom and occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal
        foam/gel/film/cream/suppository; or An intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system
        (IUS), inserted by a qualified physician, with published data showing that the highest
        expected failure rate is less than 1% per year; (not all IUDs meet this criterion)
        Acceptable IUDs: Tcu-380A (Paragard), TCU-380 Slimline (Gyne T Slimline), Tcu-220C,
        MULTILOAD-250 (MLCu-250) and 375, NOVA T and CUNOVAT (Novagard), Levonorgesterol (LNG-20)
        Intra-uterine System (Mirena/Levonova), and FlexiGard 330/CuFix PP330 (Gynefix). The
        device must be inserted at least 2 weeks prior to the Screen visit, and remain throughout
        the study and through the follow-up phase of the study or Any other methods with published
        data showing that the highest expected failure rate is less than 1% per year.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  As a result of medical interview, physical examination or screening investigations,
             the principle investigator or delegate physician deems the subject unsuitable for the
             study. Subjects must not have a systolic blood pressure above 145 mmHg or a diastolic

             neurological disease, endocrine disease or pulmonary disease (including but not
             confined to chronic bronchitis, emphysema, bronchiectasis or pulmonary fibrosis)

          -  Subjects will require normal serum creatinine clearance values at screening
             [calculated from serum creatinine by a predicting equation using Cockcroft-Gualt
             formula]. If the creatinine clearance value is greater than the upper limit of normal
             as determined by the local laboratory reference range, the Investigator will
             determine whether this is a clinically significant finding that would preclude
             participation

             prior to the first dose of study medication, unless in the opinion of the
             Investigator and Sponsor the medication will not interfere with the study procedures
             or compromise subject safety

          -  History of alcohol/drug abuse or dependence within 12 months of the study

          -  Abuse of alcohol defined as an average weekly intake of greater than 21 units or an
