  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic lung disease. Azithromycin, an
      antibiotic, may be beneficial at reducing the symptoms and severity of the disease. This
      study will analyze previously collected study data to evaluate the anti-inflammatory
      properties of azithromycin and determine how azithromycin affects the frequency and severity
      of COPD exacerbations.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      COPD is a disease in which the lung airways are partly damaged and obstructed, making it
      difficult to breathe. The most common cause is cigarette smoking, but breathing in other
      types of lung irritants, including pollution, dust, and chemicals, over a long period of
      time may also contribute to COPD. It is the fourth leading cause of death in the United
      States. Symptoms include coughing, excess mucus production, shortness of breath, wheezing,
      and chest tightness.

      Some bacterial infections may worsen COPD exacerbations. Current studies are examining if
      the macrolide antibiotic azithromycin may be beneficial at reducing the frequency and/or
      severity of COPD exacerbations. Azithromycin also has anti-inflammatory properties that may
      reduce the severity of COPD exacerbations by inhibiting the matrix metalloprotease
      (MMP)-catalyzed breakdown of collagen and the subsequent generation of PGP, a substance
      produced in response to collagen breakdown. An increase in PGP levels may indicate an
      increase in inflammation, which can worsen COPD symptoms. NHLBI's COPD Network Macrolide
      study includes people with COPD who were randomly assigned to receive either azithromycin or
      placebo for 1 year. For this current study, researchers will examine the Macrolide
      participants' previously collected blood samples, sputum samples, and study data, including
      information on COPD exacerbations and azithromycin effects. The purpose of this study is to
      examine the anti-inflammatory properties of azithromycin in people with COPD.
