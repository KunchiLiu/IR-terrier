  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Range of motion at ankle joint and subtalar joint will be assessed before and after
      utilization of ARM device. The changes in range of motion will be recorded and compared to
      literature.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess how effective a new device is in increasing range of
      motion and reducing stiffness in the foot and ankle of patients with acquired flatfoot,
      patients with plantar fasciitis, and those suffering from stiffness after cast removal or
      other lengthy immobilization.

      Project will utilize a physical therapist to measure range of motion and stiffness when
      patients are consented. Patients will be re-measured at six weeks following use of the
      device to assist in stretching ankle and foot muscles, and again at 10 weeks for final
      stiffness and range of motion assessment.

    <description>Patient ankle range of motion will be assessed at clinic visit. No stretching exercises with the device, but will be provided standard care through physiotherapist in acute cases, and no stretching exercises for chronic patients. Reassessment will be done at six weeks and 10 weeks.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Subjects will train using only one combination of movement, dorsiflexion with inversion. This is done by manipulating the ring so that the medial and anterior ropes are taut. Subject will start with 3 minute warm-up. Subject will then manipulate the ring so that the foot moves into dorsiflexion with inversion until a point of tolerable discomfort is felt; subject will hold this position for 30 seconds. Stretch will be repeated 10 times, each day, for six weeks. Reassessment will be done at six weeks and 10 weeks.</description>
