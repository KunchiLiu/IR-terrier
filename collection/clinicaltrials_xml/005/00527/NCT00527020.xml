    <textblock>
      GSK1018921 is a new drug under development for the treatment of schizophrenia. GSK1018921
      differs from other available drugs in its mode of action and it is assumed that it may have
      an effect in the treatment of so-called positive symptoms such as hallucinations and
      negative symptoms such as lack of drive. No clinical studies have been conducted with
      GSK1018921 in humans until now. This is the first study where this compound is administered
      to humans; the study has 2 parts: Part A is a dose escalation study, Part B is a
      pharmacodynamic portion in a separate group of healthy smoker volunteers.
