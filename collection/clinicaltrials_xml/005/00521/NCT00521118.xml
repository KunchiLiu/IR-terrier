      RATIONALE: A second curettage may be effective in treating persistent gestational
      trophoblastic tumor.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well a second curettage works in treating
      patients with persistent non-metastatic gestational trophoblastic tumor.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine the response to second curettage in patients with persistent,
           non-metastatic gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN).

      Secondary

        -  To evaluate if response to a second curettage is independent of the tumor burden as
           measured by the quantitative beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) assay at study
           entry.

        -  To evaluate if response to a second curettage is independent of the depth of myometrial
           invasion as measured sonographically following the initial curettage but prior to study
           entry (when persistent disease is first diagnosed).

        -  To estimate the frequency of complications related to a second curettage, specifically
           infection of the fallopian tubes or ovaries, hemorrhage associated with curettage, or
           operative injury to the uterus.

        -  To estimate the frequency of a change in the uterine histology between the first and
           second curettage.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients undergo a second curettage rather than standard treatment (immediate chemotherapy).
      Patients whose disease has transformed into choriocarcinoma, placental site trophoblastic
      tumor, or epithelioid trophoblastic tumor (histologically diagnosed at the second curettage)
      are removed from the study. All other patients undergo weekly beta-human chorionic
      gonadotropin (hCG) testing beginning 14 days after the second curettage and continuing until
      the beta-hCG level is normal. Patients then undergo further beta-HCG testing weekly for 4
      weeks and then monthly for 5 months. If the level does not regress to normal, or rises, or
      if metastatic disease is identified, the patient is removed from the study.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS:

          -  Histologically confirmed gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN) (complete or
             partial hydatidiform mole)

               -  No histologically confirmed choriocarcinoma, placental site trophoblastic tumor
                  (PSTT), or epithelioid trophoblastic tumor (ETT) on the first curettage

          -  Persistent, low-risk disease (based on FIGO/WHO 2002 staging and risk scoring
             criteria), as defined by 1 of the following criteria:

               -  Less than 10% decline in beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) levels, based
                  on four consecutive measurements over a 3-week period (plateau)

               -  Greater than 20% rise in beta-hCG levels, based on three consecutive
                  measurements over a 2-week period

               -  Beta-hCG level remains elevated above normal for ≥ 6 months
