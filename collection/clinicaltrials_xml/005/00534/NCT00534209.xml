      RATIONALE: Vaccines made from gene-modified tumor cells may help the body build an immune
      response to kill tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase I/II trial is studying the side effects of vaccine therapy
      and to see how well it works in treating patients with stage IIIB or stage IV non-small cell
      lung cancer who have finished first-line chemotherapy.

      OBJECTIVES:

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

        -  To establish safety of the B7 vaccine when used within 4 weeks of completing first line
           platinum based chemotherapy. (Phase I)

        -  To determine whether patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (stages IIIB/IV)
           who achieve a clinical response (stable disease, partial response, or complete
           response) on first-line platinum-based chemotherapy have an increased time to disease
           progression as a result of vaccination with an allogeneic B7.1 and HLA-A1 transfected
           tumor-cell vaccine. (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

        -  To evaluate the immune response (CD8) in B7-vaccinated patients as compared to
           controls. (Phase II)

        -  To evaluate the relationship of CD8 response in B7-vaccinated patients with
           progression-free survival. (Phase II)

        -  To evaluate the safety profile of the B7 vaccine. (Phase II)

        -  To evaluate the response rates on second-line chemotherapy (after disease progression)
           in the B7-vaccinated patients as compared to controls. (Phase II)

        -  To evaluate the overall survival in patients immunized with B7 vaccine as compared to
           controls. (Phase II)

        -  To evaluate the correlative immunological studies. (Phase II)

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

        -  Phase I (single site [University of Miami Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center]):
           Patients receive allogeneic B7.1 and HLA-A1 transfected tumor cell vaccine
           intradermally (ID) in weeks 1, 3, and 5. Treatment repeats every 6 weeks for 2 courses.
           If no more than 1 of 6 patients experience a probable or definitively treatment related
           adverse effect (i.e., grade 2 autoimmune or grade 3-4 of any type), patients proceed to
           the phase II portion of the study. If 2 or more (out of 6) patients experience
           treatment related adverse effects the study stops.

        -  Phase II (randomized): Patients are stratified according to study site (University of
           Miami Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center or Memorial Regional Hospital), type of
           prior first-line treatment (platinum and taxane vs platinum and gemcitabine), and
           presence of brain metastasis (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment
           arms.

             -  Arm I: Patients receive allogeneic B7.1 and HLA-A1 transfected tumor cell vaccine
                ID in weeks 1, 3, and 5. Treatment repeats every 6 weeks for 2 courses.

             -  Arm II: Patients receive a placebo vaccine as in arm I. Patients undergo blood
                sample collection periodically for correlative studies. Samples are analyzed for
                CD8, CD4, and NK response and PBL and TH1/TH2 bias, including levels of IL-1β,
                IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-13, IFN-γ, TNF-α via ELISA.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every
      6 months for 4 years, and then once a year thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 66 patients (6 patients for phase I and 60 patients for phase
      II) will be accrued for this study.
