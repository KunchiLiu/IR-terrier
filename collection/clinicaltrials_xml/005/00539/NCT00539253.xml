  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done to find out if using the contrast agent MultiHance can be used
      to show how a liver tumor responds to the chemotherapy given during Transcatheter Arterial
      Chemoembolization (TACE).

      MultiHance is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use as a contrast
      material for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans of the central nervous system. It is
      believed that using MultiHance may be able to help doctors tell normal liver cells apart
      from active tumor and from tumor affected by the chemotherapy. In this way, MultiHance may
      improve the way patients with hepatocellular carcinoma are managed clinically.

      We hypothesize that the Multi-Hance contrast material will provide better image definition
      of treated liver tumor(s) on MRI imaging in comparison to other commercially available
      contrast agents.
