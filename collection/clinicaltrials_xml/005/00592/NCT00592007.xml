  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this research study is to see if adding fulvestrant (Faslodex) to
      erlotinib (Tarceva) is effective in patients with stage IIIb/IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Erlotinib is an oral drug which is able to block endothelial growth factor receptor (EGFR).
      EGFR stimulates cancer cell growth. Fulvestrant (faslodex) block estrogen hormone from
      gaining access to tumor and stimulating the tumor cells to grow. Both of these drugs are
      already approved by FDA but have not been studied in this combination.

      We will study if the combination of these drugs will delay treatment failure. Lung cancer
      tumors in both males and females can be sensitive to estrogen. Only patients whose tumor
      expresses the estrogen will be eligible for the trial. Estrogen sensitivity will be tested
      on previously removed tumor specimens.

    <description>Upon enrollment, patients will continue to receive erlotinib daily orally at 150 mg/day or at 100 mg/day if 150 mg was associated with adverse events requiring dose reduction before enrollment in this study. Doses less than 100 mg/day will not be allowed. Fulvestrant will be added intramuscularly 500 mg Day 0, 250 mg Days 14 and 28. In cycles 2 and up, fulvestrant will be given 250 mg on day 28. Patients will receive this therapy until they progress.</description>
