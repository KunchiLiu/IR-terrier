    <textblock>
      This is a double-blinded study of subacromial corticosteroid injection (steroid injection to
      the shoulder) to treat shoulder pain in the paralyzed (hemiplegic) shoulder of chronic
      stroke survivors. This study is designed to evaluate pain relief of a standard steroid
      injection treatment, compared to a high dose treatment and a low dose treatment, for
      shoulder pain in stroke survivors. A total of 105 chronic stroke survivors with moderate to
      severe shoulder pain will be enrolled. All eligible participants will undergo an initial
      test injection to localize pain to the subacromial space. If this turns out to be positive,
      the subjects will be randomly assigned to one of three groups:

        1. low dose group which receives 20mg of steroid (triamcinolone) injection to the
           subacromial space of the affected shoulder;

        2. standard dose group which receives a standard 40mg of steroid (triamcinolone) injection
           to the subacromial space of the affected shoulder; or

        3. high dose group which receives 60mg of steroid (triamcinolone) injection to the
           subacromial space of the affected shoulder.

      Study participants will all rate their pain in weekly interviews. Laboratory-based measures
      also will be administered every 4 weeks. Subjects will be followed for a total of 13 weeks.

      The study will thus characterize the dose response of triamcinolone for the treatment of
      hemiplegic shoulder pain.

    <textblock>
      -  A total of 105 chronic stroke survivors with moderate to severe shoulder pain will be
           enrolled. Subjects will be enrolled in the study for 13 weeks. Subjects who complete
           the protocol will visit MetroHealth five times.

        -  Visit 1: Baseline information about demographics, past medical history, and
           inclusion/exclusion issues will be collected for study participants. Pertinent lab work
           will be performed to determine initial eligibility.

        -  Visit 2: All initially eligible participants also will undergo a test injection of
           lidocaine to localize the pain to the subacromial bursa (Neer's Test). A positive
           Neer's test is required to finalize eligibility for further participation. Participants
           who satisfy inclusion/exclusion criteria (including a positive Neer's test) will be
           randomized to high dose steroid, standard dose steroid, or low dose steroid via a
           computer generated random number table. The study participants and the observer will be
           blinded as to these groupings.

        -  After the initial Neer's test and randomization, participants will receive their
           assigned injection the same day. Participants then will be followed for an additional
           12 weeks, including three follow-up visits (Visits 3-5). The total participation time
           in this study will be 13 weeks.

        -  The primary outcome measure will be the BPI 12. The BPI is a pain questionnaire, which
           assesses the &quot;worst pain&quot; in the previous 7 days. Secondary outcome measures BPI 13-15
           (&quot;least pain&quot;, &quot;average pain&quot;, &quot;pain right now&quot;) also will be assessed together with
           BPI 12. There will be 4 additional secondary outcome measures, BPI 23 (which assess the
           degree to which shoulder pain interferes with daily activities), Fugl-Meyer Motor
           Assessment (a measure of poststroke motor impairment), pain free external rotation
           range of motion (ROM) and pain free abduction ROM.

        -  A blinded therapist will administer all outcome measures. The primary outcome will be
           assessed on a weekly basis via telephone (or in person during weeks of MetroHealth
           visits) starting on the day of Visit 1 and continuing to 12-weeks after steroid
           injection (i.e., for the 13 weeks of the subject's participation). Secondary measures
           BPI 13-15 will also be administered weekly along with BPI 12. The remaining secondary
           outcomes will be assessed in clinic visits at least every 4 weeks starting with Visit 2
           (Visits 2-5).
