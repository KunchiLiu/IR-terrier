  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The specific aim of this study is to determine if peanut allergen-specific SLIT will cause
      clinical desensitization and tolerance to develop in peanut-allergic young children.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In spite of increased recognition and understanding of food allergies, food-induced
      anaphylaxis remains the single most common cause of anaphylaxis seen in hospital emergency
      departments, accounting for about one third of anaphylaxis cases seen. It is estimated that
      about 30,000 food-induced anaphylactic events are seen in U.S. emergency departments each
      year and that about 200 fatal cases occur in the U.S. each year. Either peanuts or tree nuts
      cause more than 80% of these reactions. No treatments are available and avoidance is the
      only approved intervention.

      The goal of this study is to investigate peanut sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) as a
      treatment for children with peanut allergy. This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy
      and safety of peanut SLIT compared to placebo after 12 months. Mechanistic studies will be
      completed concurrently to understand changes in the allergic immune response related to
      peanut SLIT. The remainder of the study is designed to evaluate the efficacy of peanut SLIT
      in inducing lasting tolerance after discontinuation of the peanut SLIT.
