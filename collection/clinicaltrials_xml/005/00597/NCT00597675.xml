      The purpose of this study is to determine if mucosal peanut immunotherapy will make subjects
      who have peanut allergy less allergic and induce changes in their immune system.

    <textblock>
      Peanut allergy is known to cause severe anaphylactic reactions. Compared with other food
      allergies it tends to be more persistent and also its prevalence seems to be rising.
      Currently there is no proven treatment other than strict avoidance. We are attempting to
      decrease the risk of anaphylaxis on accidental ingestion by desensitizing subjects to peanut
      using peanut mucosal immunotherapy (MIT). We are also studying the effect of peanut MIT on
      the peanut specific immune response to determine if tolerance to peanut protein will
      develop. Children ages one to six with peanut allergy will be randomized to peanut MIT or
      placebo. Subjects will undergo a modified rush immunotherapy on the first day and then
      increase the doses at least every two weeks up to a maintenance dose of 4 grams (equivalent
      to about 13 peanuts). Doses will be taken daily at home except for dose increases which will
      be done on the research unit. Outcome variables of interest include response to double-blind
      placebo controlled food challenge, skin prick testing, peanut specific IgE, and adverse
      events. These results will be compared between the start and end of peanut MIT using
      appropriate statistical analysis.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject between 1 and 6 years of age

          -  Diagnosed peanut allergy by immunoglobin E to peanut (IgE to peanut) greater than or
             equal to 15 within past 6 months and have eaten peanut in diet resulting in a
             clinical reaction prior to diagnosis

          -  Diagnosed peanut allergy by immunoglobin E to peanut (IgE to peanut) greater than or
