  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and effectiveness of the device and
      delivery systems (transfemoral and transapical) in high risk, symptomatic patients with
      severe aortic stenosis.

      Subjects will undergo a physical exam and screening tests will be performed to determine if
      they are either A) a patient with a high surgical risk or B) not a candidate for surgery.
      They will then be randomized (like the flip of a coin) to have the investigational device
      implanted or to receive the current surgical or medical management available.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria Cohort A

          1. Patients must have co-morbidities such that the surgeon and cardiologist Co-PIs
             concur that the predicted risk of operative mortality is ≥15% and/or a minimum STS
             score of 10

          2. Patient has senile degenerative aortic valve stenosis with echocardiographically
             derived criteria: mean gradient &gt;40 mmHg or jet velocity greater than 4.0 m/s or an
             initial aortic valve area of &lt; 0.8 cm2

          3. Patient is symptomatic from his/her aortic valve stenosis, as demonstrated by NYHA
             Functional Class II or greater

          4. The subject or the subject's legal representative has been informed of the nature of
             the study, agrees to its provisions and has provided written informed consent as
             approved by the IRB of the respective clinical site

          5. The subject and the treating physician agree that the subject will return for all
             required post-procedure follow-up visits

             Cohort B All candidates for Cohort B of this study must meet #2, 3, 4, 5 of the above
             criteria and

          6. The subject, after formal consults by a cardiologist and two cardiovascular surgeons
             agree that medical factors preclude operation, based on a conclusion that the
             probability of death or serious, irreversible morbidity exceeds the probability of
             meaningful improvement. Specifically, the probability of death or serious,
             irreversible morbidity should exceed 50%.

        Exclusion Criteria

          1. Evidence of an acute myocardial infarction ≤ 1month before the intended treatment

          2. Aortic valve is a congenital unicuspid or bicuspid valve; or is non-calcified

          3. Mixed aortic valve disease (aortic stenosis and aortic regurgitation with predominant
             aortic regurgitation &gt;3+)

          4. Any therapeutic invasive cardiac procedure performed within 30 days of the index
             procedure, (or 6 months if the procedure was a drug eluting coronary stent
             implantation)

          5. Pre-existing prosthetic heart valve in any position, prosthetic ring, or severe
             (greater than 3+) mitral insufficiency

          6. Blood dyscrasias as defined: Leukopenia, acute anemia, thrombocytopenia, history of
             bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy

          7. Untreated clinically significant coronary artery disease requiring revascularization

          8. Hemodynamic instability requiring inotropic support or mechanical heart assistance.

          9. Need for emergency surgery for any reason

         10. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with or without obstruction

         11. Severe ventricular dysfunction with LVEF &lt;20

         12. Echocardiographic evidence of intracardiac mass, thrombus or vegetation

         13. Active peptic ulcer or upper GI bleeding within the prior 3 months

         14. A known hypersensitivity or contraindication to aspirin, heparin, ticlopidine, or
             clopidogrel, or sensitivity to contrast media, which cannot be adequately
             pre-medicated

         15. Native aortic annulus size &lt; 16mm or &gt; 24mm per the baseline echo as estimated by the
             LVOT

         16. Patient has been offered surgery but has refused surgery.

         17. Recent (within 6 months) CVA or a TIA

         18. Renal insufficiency and/or end stage renal disease requiring chronic dialysis

         19. Life expectancy &lt; 12 months due to non-cardiac co-morbid conditions.

         20. Significant aortic disease, including abdominal aortic or thoracic aneurysm defined
             as maximal luminal diameter 5cm or greater; marked tortuosity (hyperacute bend),
             aortic arch atheroma or narrowing (especially with calcification and surface
             irregularities) of the abdominal or thoracic aorta, severe &quot;unfolding&quot; and tortuosity
             of the thoracic aorta(applicable for transfemoral patients only).

         21. Iliofemoral vessel characteristics that would preclude safe placement of 22F or 24F
             introducer sheath such as severe obstructive calcification, severe tortuosity or
             vessels size less than 7 mm in diameter(applicable for transfemoral patients only).

         22. Currently participating in an investigational drug or another device study
