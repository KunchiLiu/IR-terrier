  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be randomized prospectively to one of two groups. One group will receive 5
      mg/kg of 1% lidocaine, and the other will receive .9 normal saline, instilled into their VAC
      sponge ½ hour prior to VAC dressing change. All patients will complete a pain assessment
      tool prior to receiving the instilled lidocaine/placebo, immediately after the procedure and
      1 hour after the procedure. Pain scores will then be compared between the lidocaine and
      placebo groups.

      Risks: Lidocaine toxicity is a potential risk, but 5 mg/kg of 1 % Lidocaine is below
      toxicity thresholds in an adult.

      • All Burn service patients (inpatients and outpatients in burn clinic) who are receiving
      VAC therapy will be screened for study inclusion criteria. Those with allergies to lidocaine
      will be excluded. Participants will be enrolled until a sample size of 80 wound VAC changes
      is achieved. Up to 4 VAC dressing changes can be included in this study per participant.
      Subjects will be randomized prospectively for each dressing change. Utilizing a randomized
      bracketed approach, patients will be assigned to one of two groups: Lidocaine group or
      Placebo group. The Pharmacy Research Center (PRC) will assign patient a study ID number and
      record it along with their medical record number on the Master Study ID List. They will then
      randomize the participants by drawing randomly shuffled green vs white index cards. (40
      white card = 0.9 normal saline and 40 green card = 5 mg/kg of 1% Lidocaine). They will draw
      up the appropriate amount of medication to be used, label it with the patients MR#, date,
      and administration instructions and deliver it to the nurse who is doing the VAC dressing
      change. They will keep the Master Randomization Data Collection Tool in a locked drawer in
      her office.
