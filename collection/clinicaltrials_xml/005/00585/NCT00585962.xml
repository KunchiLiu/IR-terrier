  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to determine if high doses of radiation using proton
      beam can be given safely with low and acceptable side effects. This study will also gather
      data to determine the ability of the proton beam to eradicate prostate cancer. Proton beam
      radiation is a very accurate kind of treatment that has been shown to affect less normal
      tissue than a regular radiation beam.

      -  Radiation therapy to the pelvis and prostate will be given once a day, 5 days a week
           (Monday-Friday), for 8 weeks. Each treatment takes about 10-20 minutes.

        -  Participants will be seen once a week for the entire 8 weeks by their study doctor to
           monitor and record any side effects. At the end of radiation therapy, participants will
           have a history and physical examination. Follow-up visits with the study doctor will be
           done at weeks 13 and 26 and then every 6 months for 3 years, then annually to year
           five.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with previously treated adenocarcinoma of the stages T1c-T2b and Gleason of
             equal to or greater than 5.

          -  PSA values of equal to or less than 15 ng/ml must be demonstrated within two months
             prior to study entry and greater than 3 weeks after prostate biopsy.

          -  Zubrod status 0-1.

          -  No evidence of distant metastasis.

          -  No evidence of other cancer. Prior malignancy does not exclude the patient if disease
             free for greater than five years.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinical stages T2c or above.

          -  PSA greater than 15.

          -  Any patient with T1c disease, a PSA less than or equal to 4 and Gleason sum less than
             6.

          -  Evidence of lymph node involvement if lymph node sampling performed.

          -  Previous prostate surgery to include: simple prostatectomy, TURP, hyperthermia and
             cryosurgery.

          -  Previous prostate radiation.

          -  Prior hormonal therapy.

          -  History of inflammatory bowel disease even if currently inactive or controlled on
             medication.

          -  Prior systemic chemotherapy.

          -  History of proximal urethral stricture requiring dilatation.

          -  Current and continuing anticoagulation with Coumadin or equivalent.
