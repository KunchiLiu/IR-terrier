  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether patients with chronic heart failure not due
      to coronary artery disease who require use of a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) for
      refractory heart failure can recover sufficient heart function to allow the pump to be
      explanted. The study aims to avoid the need for transplantation in these patients by using
      standard heart failure medications to reduce the size of the left ventricle and then using
      the investigational drug, clenbuterol, to further improve left ventricular function.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of this study is that patients with dilated nonischemic cardiomyopathy who
      require support with an implanted left ventricular assist device (LVAD) for chronic
      refractory heart failure can, with a specific two-staged medical regimen designed to enhance
      maximal reverse remodeling (an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, beta blocker,
      angiotensin receptor blocker, aldosterone antagonist and digoxin [stage 1]) and
      prevent/reverse myocardial atrophy (the β2 agonist clenbuterol [stage 2]), recover adequate
      left ventricular systolic function to allow LVAD explantation and subsequent
      intermediate-term survival without need for mechanical circulatory support or heart
      transplantation.

      Within one year of this study's start, a new LVAD became the standard of care for
      implantation, so the study device became an inferior standard of care shortly thereafter. By
      2012 the trial was stopped for futility in enrollment. Thus, certain original outcomes have
      been deleted, specifically because there was only a single subject explanted, multivariate
      analysis for sustainability of reverse remodeling following LVAD explantation and predictors
      of recovery of left ventricular function/remodeling and of LVAD removal could not be done.

      Similarly, and for lack of funding, biobank components were not collected; therefore no data
      exists to present biochemical, structural, cellular and molecular changes in the myocardium
      resulting from the HARPS protocol interventions, changes in systemic inflammation,
      circulating progenitor cells and growth factors, or DEXA scan based data: changes in body
      mass, lean muscle mass, muscle strength and maximal and submaximal exercise capacity. All
      remaining outcome measures have been edited to more precisely show the outcome measures
      intended.
