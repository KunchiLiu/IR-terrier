      The purpose of this study is to determine a dose of the investigational drug betahistine
      that is both well tolerated and potentially effective in treating the symptoms of atypical
      depression. Atypical depression is characterized by the ability of the person's mood to
      improve temporarily in response to positive events, as well as features such as increased
      appetite, increased sleep and severe fatigue.
