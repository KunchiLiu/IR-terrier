          4. Patients may have documented resistance or intolerance to interferon-alpha, imatinib,
             hydroxyurea, or anagrelide, but must have been demonstrated to be phlebotomy
             dependent requiring 6 or more phlebotomies per year to maintain the target HCT.

          5. Patients may have newly diagnosed PV.

          6. Patients may have had inadequate phlebotomy control on hydroxyurea or imatinib.

          7. Adequate Organ Function

               -  Total bilirubin &lt; 2.0 times the institutional Upper Limit of Normal (ULN)

               -  Hepatic enzymes (AST, ALT ) ≤ 2.5 times the institutional ULN

               -  Serum Na, K+, Mg2+, Phosphate and Ca2+³ Lower Limit of Normal (LLN)

               -  Serum Creatinine &lt; 1.5 time the institutional ULN

               -  Hemoglobin, Neutrophil count, Platelets, PT, PTT all Grade 0-1

          8. Ability to take oral medication: dasatinib tablets may be swallowed whole, or may be
             ingested as a solution. Dasatinib tablets can be dissolved in juice, and can then be
             administered through a nasogastric tube.

          9. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must have:

               -  A negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to the start of
                  study drug administration

         10. Persons of reproductive potential must agree to use an adequate method of
             contraception throughout treatment and for at least 4 weeks after study drug is
             stopped.

         11. Signed written informed consent including HIPAA according to institutional guidelines

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients receiving busulfan within six weeks of Study Day 1.

          2. Patients receiving treatment with interferon-alpha within 4 weeks of Study Day 1.

          3. Patients receiving treatment with imatinib within 14 days of Study, Day 1.

               -  Pleural or pericardial effusion of any grade

               -  Clinically-significant coagulation or platelet function disorder (e.g. known von
                  Willebrand's disease)

               -  Diagnosed acquired bleeding disorder within one year (e.g., acquired anti-factor
                  VIII antibodies)

               -  Ongoing or recent (≤ 3 months) significant gastrointestinal bleeding

                  including: (Patients must discontinue drug 7 days prior to starting dasatinib)

               -  The concomitant use of H2 blockers or proton pump inhibitors with dasatinib is
                  not recommended. The use of antacids should be considered in place of H2
                  blockers or proton pump inhibitors in patients receiving dasatinib therapy.

               -  Patient agrees to discontinue St. Johns Wort while receiving dasatinib therapy

               -  Patient agrees that IV bisphosphonates will be withheld for the first 8 weeks of
