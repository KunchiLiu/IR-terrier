      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of lenalidomide in the treatment of
      relapsed or refractory classic Hodgkin lymphoma(cHL).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), an uncommon but significant subtype of lymphoma, is divided into
      classical HL (cHL) and nodular lymphocyte predominant HL (NLPHL). Progress has been made in
      cHL therapy resulting in 5-year failure free survival rates between 61%-89% even in the
      setting of advanced stage or bulky disease. Patients who relapse however, have a variable
      prognosis ranging from a 8-year overall survival rate of less than 8% for patients who never
      achieve a remission to 54% for patients with a complete remission lasting greater than 12
      months. High dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell support is the standard of care for
      patients with relapsed cHL but for those that relapse despite aggressive salvage therapy 20
      - 50%, with median remission durations of approximately 6 months. Furthermore, a subset of
      relapsed HL patients may not be candidates for aggressive salvage regimens. These novel
      salvage therapies are needed for relapsed/refractory cHL, especially agents without serious
      late toxicities are particularly attractive in this disease. Advances in the understanding
      of HL pathogenesis and lenalidomide's mechanisms of action provide substantial rationale for
      evaluating lenalidomide in HL patients.

          -  Understand and voluntarily sign an informed consent form.

          -  Able to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol requirements

          -  Females of childbearing potential (FCBP)â€  must agree to use two reliable forms of
             contraception simultaneously or to practice complete abstinence from heterosexual
             intercourse during the following time periods related to this study: 1) for at least
             28 days before starting study drug; 2) while participating in the study; and 3) for
             at least 28 days after discontinuation from the study. The two methods of reliable
             contraception must include one highly effective method (i.e. intrauterine device
             (IUD), hormonal [birth control pills, injections, or implants], tubal ligation,
             partner's vasectomy) and one additional effective (barrier) method (i.e. latex
             condom, diaphragm, cervical cap). FCBP must be referred to a qualified provider of
             contraceptive methods if needed.

          -  FCBP must have two negative serum or urine pregnancy tests (sensitivity of at least
             50 mIU/mL) prior to starting study drug. The first pregnancy test must be performed
             within 10-14 days prior to the start of study drug and the second pregnancy test must
             be performed within 24 hours prior to prescribing lenalidomide for Cycle 1
             (prescriptions must be filled within 7 days as required by RevAssist) and must either
             commit to continued abstinence from heterosexual intercourse or begin TWO acceptable
             methods of birth control, one highly effective method and one additional effective
             method AT THE SAME TIME, at least 28 days before she starts taking lenalidomide. The
             subject may not receive study drug until the Investigator has verified that the
             results of these pregnancy tests are negative.

          -  Men must agree to use a latex condom during sexual contact with females of
             childbearing potential while participating in the study and for at least 28 days
             following discontinuation from the study even if he has undergone a successful
             vasectomy.

          -  All patients must be counseled at a minimum of every 28 days about pregnancy
             precautions and risks of fetal exposure.

             and have not yet undergone stem cell transplantation should not be enrolled.

          -  Use of any other anti-cancer drug or therapy, including experimental, within 30 days
             of enrollment.

          -  Known hypersensitivity to thalidomide.

          -  The development of erythema nodosum if characterized by a desquamating rash while
             taking thalidomide or similar drugs.

          -  Any prior use of lenalidomide.

          -  Known positive for HIV or infectious hepatitis, type A, B or C.
