      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as clofarabine and cytarabine, work in different
      ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them
      from dividing. Colony-stimulating factors, such as G-CSF, may increase the number of immune
      cells found in bone marrow or in peripheral blood and may help the immune system recover
      from the side effects of chemotherapy. Giving clofarabine and cytarabine together with G-CSF
      may kill more cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of clofarabine and
      to see how well it works when given together with cytarabine and G-CSF in treating patients
      with myelodysplastic syndromes.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of clofarabine when administered with
           low-dose cytarabine and filgrastim (G-CSF) in patients with intermediate-2 or high-risk
           myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS).

        -  To evaluate efficacy as measured by hematologic response rates in patients who are
           treated with this novel combination of drugs and who are not candidates for more
           intensive treatment for intermediate-2 and high-risk MDS.

      Secondary

        -  To assess effects on quality of life of this patient population.

        -  To assess the time to acute myeloid leukemia transformation or death.

        -  To assess cytogenetic response rates.

        -  To assess changes in flow cytometric patterns.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, nonrandomized, dose-escalation study of clofarabine followed by
      a phase II study.

        -  Phase I: Patients receive clofarabine IV over 1 hour and low-dose cytarabine
           subcutaneously (SC) on days 1-5. Patients also receive filgrastim (G-CSF) SC beginning
           1 day prior to the start of chemotherapy and continuing through completion of
           chemotherapy until blood counts recover. Treatment repeats every 6 weeks for up to 10
           courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of clofarabine until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

        -  Phase II: Patients receive clofarabine at the MTD, cytarabine, and G-CSF as in phase I.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, prior to course 4, and after completion of study
      therapy.

      Patients undergo bone marrow biopsy at baseline and prior to courses 3, 6, and 8 for
      evaluation of treatment response. Bone marrow samples are analyzed for myeloblast phenotypic
      expression profiles, which include the following parameters: percentage of CD34-positive
      myeloblasts; antigen expression density of CD13, CD34, CD45, and CD117; and aberrant
      myeloblast expression of CD4, CD11c, CD15, and CD56.

    <description>Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) is defined to be the dose cohort below which 2 out of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicities or the highest dose cohort, if 2 limiting toxicities are not observed at any dose cohort. These will be presented as actual rates. Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) will be defined according to oncology standards based on NCI CTC version 2 grading criteria (DLT = &gt; grade 3 non-hematological toxicity or any &gt; 4 hematological toxicity that persists for more than 4 weeks and in the opinion of the investigator is felt not to be due to disease).</description>
