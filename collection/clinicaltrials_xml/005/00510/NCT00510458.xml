  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Total hip replacement surgery is considered to be a very successful surgical procedure for
      the treatment of degenerative joint disease. The purpose of the study is to evaluate a large
      size (36mm, 40mm or 44mm) femoral (hip) head called the LFIT™ Anatomic CoCr Femoral Head
      (Low Friction Ion Treatment). The large size femoral heads will be used with the Trident®
      X3® polyethylene (plastic) inserts and will be compared with a historical control. Study
      Hypothesis: The linear wear rate for hips implanted with the LFIT™ Anatomic CoCr Femoral
      Head is no worse than 0.08 mm wear per year at 5 years post-surgery.

    <measure>Linear Wear Rates</measure>
    <time_frame>5 Years Post-Surgery</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate the linear wear rates of X3® polyethylene inserts mated with LFIT™ Anatomic CoCr Femoral Heads at 5 years postoperative. It is expected that the mean linear wear rate is not more than 0.08 mm per year or 0.05 mm per year superior to the reference control, which was 0.13 mm per year. The reference control was determined from the control group within the Post-approval Study of the ABC and Trident® Systems.</description>

    <measure>Harris Hip Score (HHS) score change from preop to postop intervals</measure>
    <time_frame>preop, 1, 3, and 5 Years</time_frame>
    <description>The Harris Hip Score (HHS) assesses pain, function, joint deformity and range of motion. Scores can range from 0 to 100 with 0 being the worst and 100 being the best score. A score of 80-100 is considered good-excellent and a score of less than or equal to 79 is considered fair-poor. 90-100 = excellent 80-89 = good 70-79 = fair 0-69 = poor</description>

    <measure>HHS pain score change from preop to postop intervals</measure>
    <time_frame>preop, 1, 3, and 5 Years</time_frame>
    <description>This subscore of the overall HHS provides the patient with 6 possible answers to choose from ranging from no pain/ignores it to totally disabled/crippled/pain in bed/bedridden. A maximum of 44 points is possible for this subscore indicating no pain/ignores it.</description>

    <time_frame>preop, 1, 3, and 5 Years</time_frame>
    <description>This subscore of the overall HHS includes the total points for five different ranges of motion (flexion, abduction, external rotation, internal rotation, adduction) into one subscore of a maximimun of 5.025 points which equals more range of motion.</description>

    <measure>SF-12 Health Survey score (physical and mental) change from preop to postop intervals</measure>
    <time_frame>preop, 1, 3, and 5 Years</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-12 Health Survey is a 12-item patient completed questionnaire to measure general health and well-being. It includes a physical and mental status component score; each ragning from 0-100. Low values represent a poor health state and high values represent a good health state.</description>

    <measure>Lower Extremity Activity Scale score change from preop to postop intervals</measure>
    <time_frame>preop, 1, 3, and 5 Years</time_frame>
    <description>The LEAS is completed by the participant to assess activity level. Activity levels were ordered in terms of intensity from 1 to 18, with 18 indicating the highest activity level.</description>

No radiographic indications of progressive radiolucent lines ≥ 2 mm in thickness around the entire acetabular component
No radiographic indication of migration of ≥ 3 mm or ≥ 5° of the acetabular component
No radiographic indication of progressive radiolucent lines ≥ 2 mm thickness around the entire femoral component

          1. Patient is candidate for a primary cementless total hip replacement, and a
             posterolateral surgical approach is planned.

             Shell size 52mm or larger.

          3. Patient has primary diagnosis of Non-Inflammatory Degenerative Joint Disease (NIDJD).
             Patient must have diagnosis of osteoarthritis (OA), traumatic arthritis (TA),
             avascular necrosis (AVN), slipped capital epiphysis, pelvic fracture, femoral
             fracture, failed fracture fixation, or diastrophic variant
