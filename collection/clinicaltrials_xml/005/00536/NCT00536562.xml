      The purpose of this study is to determine, in patients following a TIA, whether a 6-month
      case-managed exercise based multi-factorial cardiac rehabilitation program (CR), similar to
      those used in patients following a heart attack, can significantly improve exercise
      capacity, reduce cholesterol, reduce depression, and improve thinking ability.

      Similar risk factors predispose patients to both cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events.
      Two hundred consecutive patients from Stroke Prevention Clinics (SPC) at London Health
      Sciences Centre and the Ottawa Hospital (100 patients from each site) who have sustained a
      Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) or mild non-disabling stroke will participate in a
      randomized controlled trial in which they will either receive Usual Care (UC) as delivered
      by the SPC, or enter the existing multi-disciplinary 6-month comprehensive cardiac
      rehabilitation (CR) intervention at LHSC and Ottawa in addition to receiving UC. This study
      seeks to determine the benefits of providing a CR program to TIA/mild non-disabling stroke
      patients.
