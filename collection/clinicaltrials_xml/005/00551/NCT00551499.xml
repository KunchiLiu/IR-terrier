      The primary objective of this study is to compare the Apnea- Hypopnea Index in HF patients
      with concomitant CSA, after 12 weeks of CRT alone to CRT in combination with one night of
      overdrive pacing. Secondary objectives are to evaluate the effects of a single night of
      overdrive pacing applied after 12 weeks of CRT vs. CRT alone on breathing events, sleeping
      events, and neurohormonal markers. An additional secondary objective of the study is to
      compare the efficacy of CRT in HF patients with concomitant CSA to HF patients without
      concomitant CSA.

    <textblock>
      Sleep apnea is a common and often undiagnosed disorder associated with substantial
      cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. In recent years studies have been published
      presenting the relationship between heart failure (HF) and central sleep apnea (CSA). CSA
      associated with Cheyne-Stokes respiration is a form of periodic breathing in which central
      apneas and hypopnea alternate with periods of hyperventilation, characterized by a regular
      crescendo-decrescendo oscillation of tidal volume, which is thought to be caused by
      dysfunction of central respiratory control. Unlike, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), CSA
      likely arises as a consequence of HF.Since 2002, several results have reported on the
      benefit of atrial overdrive (AOP) pacing in patients suffering from sleep apnea. These
      results could not be confirmed for obstructive sleep apnea in several subsequent studies.
      Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) has been proposed as another potential therapeutic
      pacing approach for CSA by two recently published investigations.The combined therapeutic
      impact of AOP and CRT (CRT+AOP) so far has not been investigated.We aimed to evaluate the
      effect of CRT alone and CRT+AOP on CSA in patients with CHF.

    <description>The CSA group will undergo 2 sleep evaluation on two consecutive nights, during which the device will be programmed according to the randomization scheme (one night CRT, DDD/45 and the other CRT, DDD/15 bpm over mean nocturnal heart rate). The mean nocturnal heart rate over the last week is derived from the device memory.</description>
