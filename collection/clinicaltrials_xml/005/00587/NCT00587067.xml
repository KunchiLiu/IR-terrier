  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II study aims to evaluate regional chemotherapy in patients with unresectable
      primary hepatic malignancy. Specifically, eligible patients with hepatocellular carcinoma
      and peripheral cholangiocarcinoma, considered unresectable after review by the Hepatobiliary
      Surgery service, will undergo hepatic artery pump placement and continuous infusion of FUDR.
      The protocol includes radiological and biological correlative studies.

      This phase II study aims to evaluate regional chemotherapy in patients with unresectable
      primary hepatic malignancy. Specifically, eligible patients with hepatocellular carcinoma
      and peripheral cholangiocarcinoma, considered unresectable after review by the Hepatobiliary
      Surgery service, will undergo hepatic artery pump placement and continuous infusion of FUDR.
      The protocol includes radiological and biological correlative studies.

      The primary objectives of the study are 1.) to assess the efficacy of continuous hepatic
      arterial infusion (HAI) of FUDR and dexamethasone (DEX) in patients with unresectable
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) and 2.)to assess
      patient tolerability of this therapy stratified by degree of underlying hepatic parenchymal
      disease, as determined on liver biopsy. Secondary objectives are 1.) to use dynamic MRI to
      evaluate changes in tumor perfusion during treatment and to correlate these findings with
      radiographic tumor response and 2.) to investigate molecular genetic changes associated with
      these tumors using comparative genomic hybridization and cDNA array from tumor and liver
      biopsy specimens obtained at the time of operation. All patients enrolled in the study will
      begin HAI FUDR at 0.16 mg/kg/day. An initial cohort of 12 patients will be enrolled and
      treated. Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) related to FUDR is defined by changes in liver
      function blood tests that are unrelated to disease progression or mechanical biliary
      obstruction. Modifications in the FUDR dose may be required. A patient will be considered
      intolerant of therapy if treatment must be stopped due to DLT at least once during the first
      3 months. Treatment will continue as long as there is at least stable disease and acceptable
      toxicity.

      If, in the initial cohort, 4 or more patients (&gt; 30%) are intolerant of therapy or if there
      are not at least 2 responders, then the study will be terminated. Otherwise, accrual will
      continue to a maximum of 35 patients.

    <description>[0.16* mg/kg/day X 30 ml] / pump flow rate
* If the patient is &gt;25% above ideal body weight, the dose of FUDR will be calculated from an average of the patients actual and ideal body weights. For example, for a patient who is 5ft. 10 inches and weighs 100kg: Ideal Body Weight (kg) = 50 + (2.3 X height in inches over 5 feet) = 50 + (2.3 X 10) = 73 Weight Used for dose calculation = (100 + 73)/2 = 86.5 Therefore, FUDR Dose will be = (0.16 X 86.5 X 30)/Flow Rate If no dose modification due to toxicity is required, the dosages given above (adjusted for changes in weight and pump flow rate) will be repeated on Day 1 of Week 1 of Cycle 2 and all subsequent cycles.</description>
