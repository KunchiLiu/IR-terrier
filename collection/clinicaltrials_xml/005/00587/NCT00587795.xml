      Objectives:

      - To obtain clinical evidence for the safety and efficacy in using the StabilAir Wrist
      Fracture Brace for the following cases:

        1. Acute (emergency department) treatment of non-displaced, stable extra- articular distal
           radius fractures;

        2. To obtain comparative data between traditional therapies (sugar tong, plaster backslab,
           long arm or short arm cast) and the use of the StabilAir brace for each patient
           qualified by specific criteria.

      This will provide a complete cost-of-care analysis from one modality to the other.

      Hypothesis:

      1) For stable, non-displaced fractures, the StabilAir Brace is as effective as a sugar tong
      splint in the acute setting. 2) In cases where full forearm immobilization is initially
      preferred, the StabilAir is effective as a follow-up to sugar tong splitting once the need
      for full immobilization has passed.

      The benefit of utilizing a product of this type in the acute or follow-up setting is that it
      is an adjustable fit, &quot;off-the-shelf&quot; device, which can be quickly and comfortably applied
      to the patient. It can then transition effectively to be the product of choice for the
      remainder of treatment through rehabilitation since it will protect, stabilize, and support
      the injury while adapting to changing patient conditions and needs. Because it is removable
      (late but not early in fracture core period) there are potential benefits to comfort and
      hygiene. Therefore, the total cost of care is reduced by using one product from the progress
      of the injury to fracture reduction and through to recovery (rather than a variety of
      products that require investment in materials, time, and personnel for cast changes and
      potential fracture re-reduction. In the initial treatment period, the StabilAir Brace will
      be firmly held in place by a peripheral &quot;guard wrap&quot; and will only be removed under the
      supervision of the treating surgeon. Only when clear evidence of fracture healing is present
      would the patient be allowed to physically remove the brace.

      Data Collection and Study Design:

      This will be a single center, prospective, randomized controlled trial. We will collect data
      from 80 patients with undisplaced distal radius fractures. Half will be treated with the
      plastic back slab or sugar tong splint (if there is ulnar styloid fracture) and half will be
      treated with the StabilAir splint. The initial treatment, which occurs upon the patient's
      arrival at the emergency room and prior to study randomization, will require full forearm
      and wrist immobilization in the acute phase treated with sugar tong splinting. At the
      patient's follow-up visit, which will happen ≤10 days post injury and initial evaluation,
      when it is determined that full forearm immobilization is no longer necessary, patients will
      be informed of the study, consented, and randomized (as in the flip of a coin) to one of the
      two study groups using a computerized randomization process that will be controlled by the
      study coordinator. One study group will consist of patients that are treated with either
      sugar tong splint or plaster casting and the other study group will consist of patients
      treated with the StabilAir brace. Throughout entire study, the sugar tong splint/casting
      patients will be the control group.

      Patients will be asked to return for the following visits after they are randomized:

        -  10-14 days post randomization

        -  35 to 42 days (5 to 6 weeks) post randomization

        -  77 to 84 days (11 to 12 weeks) post randomization;

        -  And at 12 and 24 months At each visit they will have x-rays of their wrist and an exam
           with the physician. In addition, they will be asked to complete the DASH and PRWE
           questionnaires regarding their general health, daily activities and pain.

      The decision for treatment will be made using the LaFontaine criteria. If there is a
      combination of 3 or less LaFontaine criteria (displacement, comminution, distal radio-ulnar
      joint injury, age &gt;60 years), and no intra-articular involvement, then the patient fits
      criteria for inclusion. Exclusion criteria include intra-articular fractures, excessive
      comminution, open fractures, and failed closed reduction of the fracture requiring open
      reduction. Patients with loss of reduction requiring secondary treatment will be excluded.

      Assessment of Results:

      The results of treatment will be assessed by clinical, radiographic and patient assessment
      criteria. Clinical objective assessment will be performed by the Gartland-Werley score and
      Mayo Wrist Score. Radiographic assessments were made by the Stewart Score and measures of
      dorsal angulation, radial shortening, radio-ulnar test. Functional scores will include the
      DASH (disabilities arm, shoulder, hand) and PRWE (patient related wrist evaluation).

      Acute Care (ED) Nondisplaced and/or No Forearm Immobilization Required

      Outcome Measurements:

        -  Initial displacement vs position of distal fragment at 8 weeks (Bunger et al. method)

        -  End fragment position of StabilAir brace patients vs traditionally treated patients

        -  Statistical comparison with paired T-test. We will be comparing radiographic parameters
           (intrarticular or displaced, Dorsal angulation , Shortening, radial inclination), and
           outcome scores from the DASH and PRWE to identify any significant differences based
           upon an n = 40. We predict assuming a two-sample t-test is used to compare the two
           arms, you will have 80% power to detect an effect size of 0.90 (almost 1 SD).

      Materials:

        -  StabilAir Wrist fracture orthoses

        -  Stockinets (extra supply for subsequent application to patient)

        -  Hand-bulb and pressure gauge

        -  Patient data collection forms - initial and follow-up

        -  Cast and sugar tong materials

        -  Patient surveys

      Patient Inclusion Criteria:

        -  Males and Females Age ≥ 18 yrs

        -  Undisplaced distal radial fractures (with/without ulnar styloid fractures)

      Patient Exclusion Criteria:

        -  Age &lt; 18 yrs

        -  Intra-articular fracture - displaced

        -  Loss of reduction after cast or brace treatment

        -  Excessive comminution (&gt; 50% metophysis)

        -  Failed closed reduction (Unacceptable alignment s/p CR: Short &gt;2mm; Dorsal angulation
           &gt;0° (neutral), Radial inclination &lt; 15°)

        -  Ipsilateral ulna fractures (not styloid)

        -  Open fracture

        -  Senile or dementia or lack of understanding of treatment

        -  Previous fracture distal radius

        -  Patients with displaced fractures that require pin fixation, external fixation, plate
           fixation or who qualify for &quot;crystalline injection fracture healing protocol&quot; are
           excluded from the study Results

      Tabular format to show:

        1. Anatomical scores (radiographic scores - Stewart)

        2. Functional scores (DASH, PRWE)

        3. Objective motion and grip strength

        4. Wrist scores (Mayo or Krimmer wrist score)

        5. Summarize statistical trends.

      Discussion:

      Do the results agree with or support the hypothesis? Is there a clear difference between
      treatment types? Is there potential for loss of reduction quotes with use of an aircast
      brace? Is there a greater number of patients converted over from standard cast or sugar tong
      splint treatment to ORIF vs external fixation (assuming similar fracture stability criteria)
      in compression to the Aircast Stabilair Brace? Positive feedback indicating benefits to
      patient's clinical outcome and level of comfort and hand functional use comparing cast
      treatment vs bracing.
