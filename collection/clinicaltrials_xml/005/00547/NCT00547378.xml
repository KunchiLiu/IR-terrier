      The purposes of this study are:

        1. To provide evidence from a randomized controlled trial that InterStim Therapy provides
           better relief of symptoms of OAB than standard medical treatments in current use.

        2. To fulfill the requirements of the FDA-mandated post-approval study of the safety of
           the tined lead using a minimally invasive approach.

    <textblock>
      Approximately 30 million Americans meet the criteria for overactive bladder (OAB). Urinary
      voiding dysfunction symptoms impose a significant physical and psychosocial impact on
      individuals, including loss of self-esteem and a decrease in the ability to maintain an
      independent lifestyle. These symptoms can substantially affect a subject's daily activities.

      Patients with OAB are managed with diet modification, bladder training or retraining, pelvic
      muscle rehabilitation, medication and biofeedback. Medications are used as the first-line
      therapy for urgency frequency and urinary urge incontinence.

      InterStim Therapy utilizes sacral nerve stimulation and is indicated in the US for the
      treatment of urinary retention and the symptoms of OAB, including urinary urge incontinence
      and significant symptoms of urgency-frequency alone or in combination, in subjects who have
      failed or could not tolerate more conservative treatments.

      InSite OAB Protocol 1634 consists of two phases; Phase I which is the randomized portion of
      the trail and Phase II the non-randomized portion.

      Phase 1: A minimum of 60 subjects randomized to InterStim and a minimum of 60 subjects
      randomized to SMT.

      Phase 2: Non-randomized, all qualified subjects will receive InterStim, approximately 297
      enrolled Subjects previously enrolled in Protocol 1634 for Urinary Urge Incontinence and
      Protocol 1635 for Urgency-Frequency will be included in Phase I of the new Protocol 1634 of
      OAB.
