  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical trial cohort tests the effect of adding low dose
      cyclophosphamide to treatment with NY-ESO-1 ISCOM® vaccine, in patients with measurable
      advanced malignant melanoma (unresectable stage III or metastatic melanoma).

      This clinical trial cohort tests the combination of NY-ESO-1 ISCOMATRIX® vaccine given after
      low dose cyclophosphamide in patients with advanced melanoma.

      NY-ESO-1 protein is an immune target found in many cancers including melanoma. ISCOMATRIX®
      adjuvant enhances immune responses. Low dose cyclophosphamide has been shown to suppress a
      population of lymphocytes called &quot;regulatory T cells&quot;. Regulatory T cells can interfere with
      immune responses in patients with cancer. The rationale for treating this new cohort of
      patients in the study is to use a small dose of cyclophosphamide to suppress the regulatory
      T cells and thus try to increase patient responses to the NY-ESO-1 ISCOMATRIX® vaccine.

      Eligible patients will receive three intramuscular injections of NY-ESO-1 ISCOM® vaccine at
      approximately four-week intervals (week 1, week 5, week 9). Low dose cyclophosphamide will
      be administered by intravenous infusion one day prior to the each NY-ESO-1 ISCOM® vaccine.

      Tumor evaluations (CT scans and physical evaluations), safety evaluation (blood tests and
      medical reviews) and immunological testing (special DTH skin tests and blood immunology
      tests) will be performed before, during and at the end of the 11 week treatment cycle.
      Treatment may continue for further cycles unless there is a reason to remove the patient
      from study.
