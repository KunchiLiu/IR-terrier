  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety and effectiveness of combining a drug known
      as Lovastatin to the chemotherapy drug cytarabine. Lovastatin is currently used to lower
      blood cholesterol levels and lab data suggests that it increases the anti-leukemia activity
      of cytarabine. This research is being done because high doses of cytarabine induce
      remissions in only about 25% of patients with acute myeloid leukemia.

    <description>The subject will receive high dose cytarabine as well as lovastatin. The subject will take doses of lovastatin twice a day, about 12 hours apart. On the third day, the subject will begin high-dose cytarabine IV over 3 hours, twice a day, starting 1 hour after the lovastatin dose for 5 days.</description>

    <description>Cytarabine dosage: 3.0 g/m2 IV over 3 hours every 12 hours on days 3-7. Lovastatin dosage: The first dose level will be lovastatin at 0.5 mg/kg/day. After each patient reaches day 14 subsequent patients will be treated at incrementally increasing doses that are 1 mg/kg/day, 2 mg/kg/day, 4 mg/kg/day, 8 mg/kg/day, 12 mg/kg/day, 18 mg/kg/day, and 24 mg/kg/day. If MTD is not reached at this dose of 24 mg/kg/day further dose escalations will occur with a 33% increase in dose at each level rounded to the nearest mg/kg/day.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with primary refractory AML (that is no prior remission). Patients who have
             greater than 10% AML blasts in the bone marrow or blood upon recovery from two cycles
             of standard cytarabine- and anthracycline-based induction chemotherapy are eligible.
             Patients who have received etoposide and/or 6-thioguanine during remission induction
             will be eligible.

          -  Patients with relapsed AML. Patients must have had a documented remission lasting &gt;
             30 days at some point during their prior therapy. Their current relapse must be
             untreated. Relapse is defined as the presence of greater than 10% AML blasts in the
             bone marrow or blood after having had a documented remission.

          -  Patients who have received a high-dose cytarabine containing regimen (&gt;2 g/m2/dose)
             within 3 months prior to registration on this protocol are not eligible.

          -  No active CNS involvement. A lumbar puncture prior to treatment is not required and
             should not be performed in the absence of significant CNS symptoms or signs.

          -  Non-pregnant and non-nursing. Treatment under this protocol would expose an unborn
             child to significant risks. Women and men of reproductive potential should agree to
             use an effective means of birth control.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Although NOT considered formal Exclusion Criteria, study physicians are strongly
        encouraged as part of this decision-making process to recognize that the following may
        increase the risks to a subject entering this protocol:

          -  Other serious illnesses which would limit survival to &lt;2 years, or a psychiatric
             condition which would prevent compliance with treatment or informed consent.

          -  Performance Status &gt; 2.

          -  Uncontrolled or severe cardiovascular disease, diabetes, pulmonary disease, or
             infection, which in the opinion of the treating physician, would make this protocol
             treatment unreasonably hazardous for the patient.

          -  Patients with a &quot;currently active&quot; second malignancy other than non-melanoma skin
             cancers. Patients are not considered to have a &quot;currently active&quot; malignancy if they
             have completed therapy and considered by their physician to be at less than 30% risk
             of relapse within one year.

          -  Patients who have received any investigational agent within the prior 4 weeks.
