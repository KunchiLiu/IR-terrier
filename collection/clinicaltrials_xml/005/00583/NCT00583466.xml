  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For removal of large flat lesions of the gastro-intestinal tract injection of a solution
      under the lesion creates a &quot;safety&quot; cushion and protects from damage to the gastrointestinal
      tract wall. Various solutions are currently used, but some of them are easy to inject but
      quickly dissipate (normal saline),other solutions are more longer lasting (hydroxypropyl
      methylcellulose, hyaluronic acid, etc) but are very difficult to inject and can be expensive
      and not always available. We decided to use blood drawn from the patient for injection under
      the lesion. We performed previously animal experiments which demonstrated that blood is easy
      to inject and creates a protective cushion which lasts longer than other fluids which are
      currently used for protective cushion creation.
