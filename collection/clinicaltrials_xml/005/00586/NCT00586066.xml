      The purpose of this study is to see whether Memantine improves memory function in subjects
      with bipolar disorder who have minimal symptoms. Secondary analyses will test the role of
      Memantine in improving residual mood symptoms (depression and mania) in subjects with
      bipolar disorder.

      We hypothesize that in subjects with bipolar disorder who have minimal symptoms Memantine
      will be effective in improving cognitive functions, as measured by the difference in
      neuropsychological test scores at the beginning and at the end of the trial.

    <textblock>
      A large proportion of subjects with bipolar disorder experience significant cognitive
      dysfunction, even when euthymic, after adequate treatment. The cognitive deficits in
      asymptomatic patients with bipolar disorder are very important for the subject's
      psychosocial function. In this population, cognitive deficits have been associated with poor
      psychosocial functioning, such as inability to hold a job. Memantine is a glutamate
      N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist which has shown efficacy in cognitive
      dysfunction due to moderate to severe Alzheimer disease.

      Demonstrating the role of Memantine in reducing cognitive dysfunction in minimally
      symptomatic subjects with bipolar disorder promises to provide important clinical
      information, which could lead to improvements in well-being and functional status for large
      populations of subjects with bipolar disorder.
