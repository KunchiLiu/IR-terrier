      Introduction: There is currently no long-term study, which compares the outcomes of partial
      tonsillectomy to conventional tonsillectomy. We hypothesize that there will be little
      significant tonsillar regrowth with partial tonsillectomy.

      Background and Significance: Tonsillectomy is the most common major surgical procedure
      performed on children in the United States with nearly 300,000 procedures performed each
      year, primarily for the indication of obstructive sleep disordered breathing (OSDB).
      Conventional (total) tonsillectomy removes the tonsillar capsule, and partial tonsillectomy
      preserves the capsule by shaving away the tonsils using an endoscopic microdebrider. Partial
      tonsillectomy results in less pain, fewer days to normal activity and diet, and fewer days
      of analgesics than total tonsillectomy. There are no significant differences between the
      techniques in blood loss or postoperative life improved Historical evidence suggests that
      eventually there will be tonsillar regrowth with partial tonsillectomy. However, in a 2003
      follow-up report of 243 children undergoing partial tonsillectomy and 107 undergoing
      complete tonsillectomy from 1998 through 2002 for OSDB there was no evidence of significant
      tonsillar regrowth. (1) We will follow-up children undergoing partial or complete
      tonsillectomies at the Cleveland Clinic from 1998 through 2002. There will be standardized
      tonsillar examinations by two observers, with a third observer in cases of significant
      disagreement, and questionnaires evaluating sleep apnea and daytime sleepiness, and number
      of tonsillar infections.

      If there are a large number of children with recurrent tonsillar symptoms post partial
      tonsillectomy, the procedure should be abandoned. However, if follow-up reveals comparable
      tonsillar symptoms for partial and the total tonsillectomy, perhaps the partial procedure
      should replace the total tonsillectomy as the standard operation to relieve tonsillar OSDB.
      This could eventually result in millions of less lost days of work and school in the United
      States.
