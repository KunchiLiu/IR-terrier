      This study will utilize a randomized double-blind design to evaluate whether initial
      treatment with two anti-depressant medications (escitalopram and bupropion) results in more
      rapid remission and greater over-all remission rates than either monotherapy in 240
      depressed subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Depression is a major public health problem due to its prevalence and accompanying
      dysfunction and costs. Depression is undertreated, but even when treatment is adequate and
      effective, sources of delay in current pharmacologic strategies include: mechanistic delays,
      those related to the physiologic and behavioral effects of antidepressants; dosing delays in
      identifying the effective dose; and programmatic delays in identifying an effective agent
      using sequential monotherapy. This study will randomize 240 patients with DSM-IV Major
      Depressive Disorder to 12 week double blind treatment with combined escitalopram and
      bupropion or each antidepressant administered alone to evaluate whether combined
      escitalopram and bupropion result in more rapid remission and greater over-all remission
      than monotherapy. Preclinical and clinical studies suggest that bupropion might prevent one
      mechanistic delay inherent in escitalopram monotherapy. Rapid dose escalation may counter
      dosing delays. The simultaneous use of two known antidepressant medications may alleviate
      programmatic delays inherent in usual sequential monotherapy. Six months follow up and
      careful assessment of adverse events will address tolerability, acceptability,
      sustainability, and pharmacoeconomic concerns. If successful, this study might have a
      significant impact on clinical practice, public health, and depression's cost consequences.
