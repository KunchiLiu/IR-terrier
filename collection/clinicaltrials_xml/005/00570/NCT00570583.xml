      This study seeks to examine clinical, genetic, and neuroanatomical variables related to mood
      and cognitive outcomes of depression in late life. We plan to study the following SPECIFIC
      AIMS:

      Aim 1. To compare cognitive outcomes among older adults with and without depression, and to
      examine depression and cognitive outcomes in patients with cognitive impairment or
      neuroimaging changes.

      Aim 2. To examine the role of genes in long-term depression outcomes in the elderly.

      Aim 3. To determine neuroanatomical and neuropathological correlates of late-life depression
      outcomes.

      We will test the following hypotheses:

      Hypothesis 1. Compared with non-depressed elderly controls, depressed elderly patients will
      have an increased incidence of development of mild cognitive impairment and dementia.

      Hypothesis 2. Depressed subjects with mild cognitive impairment will have a worse depression
      course compared with depressed subjects who do not have mild cognitive impairment.

      Hypothesis 3. Depressed subjects with worsening deep white matter disease and smaller
      hippocampal volumes on longitudinal (baseline to two year) magnetic resonance imaging brain
      scans will have a worse depression course and more cognitive decline compared with depressed
      subjects without these brain changes.

      Hypothesis 4. Depressed subjects with the 5HTTLPR short allele will have a worse depression
      course compared with depressed subjects without these risk genes.

      Hypothesis 5. Depressed subjects with the apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon-4 allele and
      vascular risk gene polymorphisms such as ACE receptor will have an increased risk of
      cognitive decline compared with depressed subjects without these risk genes.

      Hypothesis 6. Compared with brains of non-depressed controls, brains of depressed subjects
      will demonstrate increased density of blood vessels in the prefrontal cortex, including
      orbital frontal cortex and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.

      Hypothesis 7. Compared with brains of non-depressed controls, brains of depressed subjects
      will demonstrate decreased packing density of prefrontal cortex neurons with pyramidal
      morphology.

      Hypothesis 8. Compared with non-demented depressed subjects, depressed individuals who
      become demented will have more neuritic plaques, neurofibrillary tangles and cerebrovascular
      pathology.

      We will examine secondary aims related to 1) mortality and 2) social factors, with the
      following hypotheses:

        1. Depressed subjects with a larger increase in volume of hyperintensities will have a
           higher mortality rate.

        2. Subjects with poor social support and functional status will have worse depression and
           cognitive outcomes.
