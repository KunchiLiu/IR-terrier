  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to find out if a new anti-cancer drug, dasatinib
      (Sprycel®), previously approved for treatment of some forms of leukemia, will be safe and
      helpful in treating patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer.

      This is a research study because the study drug, dasatinib (Sprycel®), has not been
      evaluated for safety or effectiveness in patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer.
      The drug is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treatment of some forms of
      leukemia; thus, dasatinib (Sprycel®) is not an investigational drug. It has been given
      safely to hundreds of patients already. However its safety and usefulness in this study
      population (prostate cancer) is unknown.

      Subjects who agree to participate will take 150mg (3 pills) of dasatinib (Sprycel®) daily by
      mouth for as long as the drug benefits them. During this time, the subject will periodically
      return to the office for blood/urine tests, X-rays, imaging scans, and/or to complete
      questionnaires.

             corrected

          -  Subjects may not be enrolled with any of the following: History of a significant
             bleeding disorder unrelated to cancer, including diagnosed congenital bleeding

          -  Subjects must meet the following restrictions: Subjects may not have a concurrent
             medical condition which may increase the risk of toxicity, including pleural or
             pericardial effusion of any grade, or uncontrolled hypertension; Concomitant use of
             H2 blockers or proton pump inhibitors with dasatinib is not recommended (The use of
             antacids should be considered in place of H2 blockers or proton pump inhibitors in
             patients receiving dasatinib therapy); Patient must discontinue St. Johns Wort while
             receiving dasatinib therapy; Subjects must not use intravenous bisphosphonates during
             the first 8 weeks of dasatinib therapy due to risk of hypocalcemia; Subjects may not
             be receiving any restricted cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) inhibitors (If the
             investigator feels that any of these agents should be given as uniquely useful for a
             clear diagnosis, the situation should be discussed with the Principal Investigator,
             and a clear monitoring program should be planned)

          -  Subjects may not have evidence of untreated intracranial metastases, or untreated
             prostate cancer producing spinal cord compression
