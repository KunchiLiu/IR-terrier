  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test whether the combination of two medications, tenofovir and
      emtricitabine, are safer and more effective for treating chronic hepatitis B than tenofovir
      alone. Chronic hepatitis B is a liver disease caused by infection with the hepatitis B
      virus. Several medications, including standard and pegylated interferon and the anti-viral
      drugs lamivudine, adefovir, entecavir and telbivudine, are currently used to treat the
      disease. Problems are associated with all of these agents, however, including development of
      viral resistance with long-term therapy of the anti-virals. Since many patients require
      long-term therapy to prevent their disease from worsening, a major goal of new approaches to
      treatment is to prevent the development of viral resistance. Combination treatment has been
      shown to be an effective strategy in preventing this resistance.

      Tenofovir is an anti-viral drug approved for use in patients with HIV infection. In small
      studies in patients infected with both HIV and hepatitis B, tenofovir lowered the level of
      hepatitis B virus in the blood, with no viral resistance reported when used for up to 5
      years. Emtricitabine is an anti-viral drug similar to lamivudine and is effective at
      lowering viral load and improving liver damage.

      Patients 18 years of age and older with chronic hepatitis B may be eligible for this study.
      Participants are admitted to the NIH Clinical Center for a complete medical history and
      examination, including blood and urine tests, chest X-ray, electrocardiogram, abdominal
      ultrasound, Fibroscan (ultrasound exam of the liver that measures the amount of scarring),
      bone mineral density scan and liver biopsy. They are then randomly assigned to take
      combination treatment with tenofovir plus emtricitabine or tenofovir alone for at least 48
      weeks. During the treatment period, patients visit the Clinical Center for blood tests and a
      physical examination every 2 weeks for the first month and then every 4 to 12 weeks. After
      48 weeks, patients are readmitted to the Clinical Center for a complete evaluation that
      includes all the tests done at the start of therapy, including a liver biopsy. Patients who
      seem to have improved with treatment may continue therapy for up to 192 weeks, when they are
      again admitted to the Clinical Center for a complete medical evaluation and liver biopsy.
      Patients whose condition has not improved after 48 weeks of treatment have their treatment
      changed or stopped and continue to have regular outpatient clinic visits for 24 more weeks.

    <textblock>
      Chronic hepatitis B is a major cause of cirrhosis, end-stage liver disease and
      hepatocellular carcinoma and affects approximately 1.25 million Americans. Six medications
      have been licensed for use in chronic hepatitis B in the United States, but their relative
      benefit and long-term efficacy remain unclear. In previous studies, we have shown that
      maintained suppression of HBV DNA can be achieved with nucleoside analogues and that
      suppression is associated with marked improvements in disease. In this randomized study, we
      propose to evaluate long-term therapy with tenofovir alone or in combination with
      emtricitabine (FTC). Forty treatment-naive patients with chronic hepatitis B will be
      enrolled in the primary study. After medical evaluation and liver biopsy, patients will be
      stratified by hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) status and randomized to receive either
      tenofovir alone or in combination with FTC. Treatment will be continued long-term (at least
      four years) and patients will be carefully monitored for side effects, serum
      aminotransferase and HBV DNA levels. Patients will undergo repeat liver biopsy and
      assessment of antiviral resistance at 1 and 4 years. The primary endpoint of therapy will be
      the maintained suppression of HBV DNA to below 10(2) copies/ml (lower limit of detection of
      current assays). The study will assess the relative efficacy and safety of combination
      versus mono-therapy. A separate group of 60 previously treated patients will also be
      enrolled and randomized to mono- or combination-therapy to assess the safety profile of
      these agents. The primary analysis will be conducted on the entire study cohort.
