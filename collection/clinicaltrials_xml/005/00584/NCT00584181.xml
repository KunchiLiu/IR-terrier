    <textblock>
      Lung and heart-lung recipients at the University of Texas Medical Branch who have
      participated in the &quot;Assessment of Cough Reflex in Lung Transplant Recipients&quot; study who
      meet the specific study inclusion/exclusion criteria will have one study visit where they
      will undergo lung volume measurements, followed by high resolution CT scan of the lungs
      within 2 hours. After the initial CT scan, patients will be given a standard dose of
      Atrovent, followed thirty minutes later by repeat lung volume measurements and CT scan.
