      Study Objectives:

      The objectives of this two-part, primary immunization and booster dose, study are to
      continue to collect safety data on Rift Valley Fever (RVF) Vaccine, Inactivated (TSI-GSD
      200); and, to continue to collect immunogenicity data on Rift Valley Fever (RVF) Vaccine,
      Inactivated (TSI-GSD 200) and analyze interim data to determine whether a 6-month dose is
      indicated; and, to provide potential protection for personnel at risk for occupational
      exposure to the RVF virus and collect data on incidence of occupational RVF infection
      (subclinical and clinical) in immunized personnel.
