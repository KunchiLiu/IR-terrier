      The specific aim of this study is to validate the pharyngeal constriction ration, a
      surrogate measure of pharyngeal strength on fluoroscopy by comparing it with simultaneous
      pharyngeal manometry. Combined videofluoroscopic swallowing studies with pharyngeal
      manometry are commonly used in the evaluation of dysphagia. However, no published study has
      compared the results of simultaneous pharyngeal manometry with objective timing and
      displacement measures on videofluoroscopy. These objective measures, such as the pharyngeal
      constriction ratio, were developed here at UCD and are not yet routinely used by other
      practitioners. A secondary aim of this study will be to corroborate recent data in the
      literature suggesting that the presence of feeding tube through the upper esophageal
      sphincter does not affect the oropharyngeal phase of deglutition. This topic is currently
      under hot debate in the speech language pathology realm and has important implications for
      the evaluation of hospitalized patients with dysphagia.
