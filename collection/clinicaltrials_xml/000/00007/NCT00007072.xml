      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the safety and efficacy of azacitidine and phenylbutyrate in treatment of
      patients with thalassemia major.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Patients receive azacitidine IV continuously on days 1-4 and oral
      phenylbutyrate three times a day on days 14-42. Bone marrow needle aspiration is performed
      on days 6, 14, and 42 to assess disease response to treatment. If no response on day 42, a
      second course of azacitidine and phenylbutyrate begins 7 days later.

      Patients are followed weekly for 3 months and then monthly thereafter.

        PROTOCOL ENTRY CRITERIA:

        --Disease Characteristics--

        Diagnosis of thalassemia major Progressive disease defined as: Increasing transfusion
        requirement or difficulty in maintenance of hemoglobin levels greater than 7 g/dL as a
        consequence of autologous or allogeneic antibodies OR Increasing extramedullary
        hematopoiesis causing compression phenomena OR Disease with complications of iron overload
        despite traditional transfusion and iron chelation therapy (e.g., heart failure, decreased
        cardiac ejection fraction, endocrinopathy, or evidence of progressive liver dysfunction)

        Standard transfusion therapy or iron chelation therapy must be contraindicated

        --Prior/Concurrent Therapy--

        See Disease Characteristics
