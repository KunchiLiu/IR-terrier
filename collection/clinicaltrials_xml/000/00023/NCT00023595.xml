      BACKGROUND:

      Congestive heart failure afflicts approximately five million Americans and is the leading
      cause of hospitalization in Americans over the age of 65. Most cases of congestive heart
      failure are due to CAD. Surprisingly little is known about the relative benefits of medical
      versus surgical therapy for patients with obstructive coronary disease and congestive heart
      failure. Randomized studies of medical therapy versus bypass surgery for obstructive
      coronary disease were conducted in the 1970s and did not include the systematic use of
      aspirin, arterial conduits, or lipid-lowering medications. In addition, patients with
      ejection fractions below 35% were specifically excluded from the three large randomized
      studies of medical therapy versus bypass surgery. While observational data from the 1970s
      and early 1980s suggest a survival advantage associated with bypass surgery in patients with
      low ejection fraction and congestive heart failure, biases favoring the referral of the
      fittest of such patients for bypass surgery may have confounded these comparisons. In
      addition, medical therapy for congestive heart failure has improved dramatically over the
      past two decades. Thus, the choice of medical therapy versus bypass surgery for patients
      with congestive heart failure and obstructive coronary disease is usually decided by
      guesswork. This study is designed to provide a solid answer.

      PURPOSE:

      STICH is a multicenter, international, randomized trial that addresses two specific primary
      hypotheses in patients with clinical heart failure (HF) and left ventricular (LV)
      dysfunction who have coronary artery disease amenable to surgical revascularization. The
      first hypothesis is that restoration of blood flow by means of coronary revascularization
      recovers chronic LV dysfunction and improves survival, as compared to intensive medical
      therapy alone. The second hypothesis is that surgical ventricular restoration (SVR) to a
      more normal LV size improves survival free of subsequent hospitalization for cardiac cause
      compared to CABG alone. Patients eligible for either medical therapy or CABG, but not
      eligible for the SVR procedure (Stratum A), will be randomized in equal proportions to
      medical therapy alone versus CABG plus medical therapy. Patients eligible for all three
      therapies (Stratum B) will be randomized in equal proportions to medical therapy alone, CABG
      plus medical therapy, and CABG plus SVR plus medical therapy. Patients whose severity of
      angina or CAD makes them inappropriate for medical therapy alone (Stratum C) will be
      randomized in equal proportions to CABG plus medical therapy versus CABG plus SVR plus
      medical therapy. The overall target is to recruit 1200 patients into Hypothesis One and
      1,000 patients into Hypothesis Two. Secondary endpoints include the role of myocardial
      viability, morbidity, economics, and quality of life. Core laboratories for quality of
      life/economics, cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR), echocardiography (ECHO),
      neurohormonal/cytokine/genetic (NCG), and radionuclide (RN) studies ensure consistent
      testing practices and standardization of data necessary to identify eligible patients and to
      address specific questions related to the stated hypotheses.

      IMPORTANCE OF RESEARCH:

      The most common cause of HF is no longer hypertension or valvular heart disease as it was in
      previous decades, but rather CAD. HF is a common worldwide disease and CAD is a frequent
      cause of HF initiation and progression. HF is responsible for approximately 1 million
      hospitalizations and 300,000 fatalities annually. The prevalence of HF is increasing,
      largely due to enhanced survival following acute myocardial infarction and other
      manifestations of CAD. No randomized trial has ever compared directly the long-term benefits
      of surgical, medical, or combined surgical and medical treatment of patients with ischemic
      HF. The STICH trial is the first trial to compare the long term benefits of surgical and
      medical treatment in patients with ischemic HF. Although modern medical therapy for HF
      modestly improves quality of life, a more aggressive approach with the surgical therapies
      being studied in the STICH trial may produce even greater improvements. The common clinical
      practice of not offering CABG to patients with LV dysfunction in regions found to be
      nonviable on noninvasive studies is not evidence-based. Since only those patients for whom
      intensive medical therapy is the only reasonable therapeutic alternative are excluded from
      this study, the results of the STICH trial should be applicable to most patients with CAD,
      HF, and systolic LV dysfunction. The results of the STICH trial will also establish whether
      measurements of neurohormonal and cytokine levels and genetic profiling are useful for
      directing patient management decisions, for monitoring the effectiveness of therapy, and for
      refining the optimal approach for selecting the treatment strategy most likely to be
      effective for the many of these patients.

      ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND OTHER ISSUES:

      The study is currently in an extended follow-up mode for patients enrolled in Hypothesis 1
      (H01). The last patient follow-up is anticipated in late fall of 2015. Patient recruitment
      into Hypothesis 2 (H02) was completed in January 2006, with 1,000 patients enrolled
      worldwide. All recruitment ended on May 4, 2007, with total of 2,212 patients enrolled, and
      1,212 patients enrolled into Hypothesis One (H01). To date, the study has already recruited
      more patients (815) than the number of patients enrolled in a landmark clinical trial of
      bypass surgery known as the Coronary Artery Surgery Study (CASS). The CASS trial, conducted
      almost 30 years ago, was the largest trial of bypass surgery until the current STICH trial.
