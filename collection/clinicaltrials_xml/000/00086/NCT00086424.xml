      BACKGROUND:

      Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) is the main mediator of effects of growth hormone (GH)
      and an important regulator of cell cycle/differentiation and inhibitor of apoptosis.
      Consistent with laboratory studies showing potentially beneficial effects of IGF-I on the
      cardiovascular and cerebrovascular systems, GH-deficient individuals have high
      cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality and evidence of premature atherosclerotic disease
      that is reversible with GH replacement. In addition, several epidemiological and clinical
      studies have shown an association between low serum IGF-I levels and myocardial infarction
      (MI) and congestive heart failure (CHF) among persons without frank abnormalities of the
      GH/IGF-I axis.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      The study is the first prospective investigation to assess whether serum levels of IGF-I and
      two of its important binding proteins, IGFBP-3, and IGFBP-1, are associated with incidence
      of confirmed incident cardiovascular disease (CVD) events in older male and female adults.
      Specimens and data for this study will be obtained from the Cardiovascular Health Study
      (CHS), a large, multi-center NHLBI-funded prospective cohort study of 5,888
      community-dwelling men and women 65 years or older. The study uses an efficient case-cohort
      study design to select specimens for testing, involving evaluation of 750 incident
      myocardial infarction (MI)/fatal coronary heart disease (CHD) cases, 500 incident stroke
      cases, 750 incident congestive heart failure (CHF) cases, and a comparison sub-cohort of 750
      individuals selected at random from the study population. The study examines the association
      between baseline serum IGF-I, IGFBP-1, and IGFBP-3 level and the future occurrence of first
      incident MI/fatal CHD, ischemic stroke, and CHF. Multivariate regression models are used to
      control for potential confounding factors including age, sex, race/ethnicity, anthropometry
      and body composition, fasting and 2-hour post-load glucose and insulin levels, dietary
      intake, physical activity, hormone replacement therapy and other medications, and other CVD
      risk markers such as lipids, inflammatory factors, and coagulation/fibrinolysis markers.
