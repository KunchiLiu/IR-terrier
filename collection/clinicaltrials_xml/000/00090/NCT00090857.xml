      RATIONALE: Chemoprevention therapy is the use of certain drugs to try to prevent the
      development or recurrence of cancer. Letrozole may be effective in preventing the
      development or recurrence of breast cancer in postmenopausal women who are at increased risk
      of developing breast cancer because of elevated estradiol levels.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying how well letrozole works in preventing
      breast cancer in postmenopausal women with elevated estradiol levels.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Compare the safety, acceptability, and adherence to letrozole vs placebo in
           postmenopausal women at increased risk for the development or recurrence of breast
           cancer based on elevated plasma estradiol levels.

        -  Compare the effects of these regimens on menopausal symptoms (including hot flushes,
           weight changes, sexual functioning, and genitourinary effects), blood lipid levels,
           markers of bone turnover, and multidimensional quality of life in patients treated with
           these regimens.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the effect of letrozole-induced reduction of plasma estradiol levels on
           mammographic percent breast density in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study.
      Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral letrozole once daily for 1 year. Patients may then receive
           additional oral letrozole once daily for up to 4 years.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo once daily for 1 year. Patients may then receive
           oral letrozole once daily for up to 5 years.

      In both arms, treatment continues in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or diagnosis of
      invasive breast cancer, ductal carcinoma in situ, or any non-breast primary cancer.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline and then at 3, 6, and 12 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 110 patients (73 for arm I and 37 for arm II) will be accrued
      for this study.
