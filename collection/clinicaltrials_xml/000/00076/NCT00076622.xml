    <textblock>
      This study will examine therapeutic and adverse effects of continuing versus discontinuing
      antidepressant medication in nursing home residents who have had no more than a single
      episode of depression and who no longer have depressive symptoms.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are approximately 1.6 million nursing home residents in the United States. More than
      one third of these residents are taking antidepressant medications (ADs). Although ADs are
      effective, evidence suggests that they can lead to significant adverse events, including an
      increased risk of falls and bone fractures. Many depressed nursing home residents suffer
      from an initial episode of late-life depression and do not meet guideline-based
      recommendations for maintenance treatment. This study will examine the benefits and risks of
      long-term AD treatment in depressed nursing home residents whose single episode of
      depression has been in continuous remission for at least six months.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to either continue or discontinue AD treatment.
      Participants will be monitored over a period of one year for recurrence of depression and
      related symptoms, as well as for the occurrence of falls, fractures, and other adverse
      events. Medical chart review, self-reported mood symptoms, and depression scales will be
      used to assess participants.
