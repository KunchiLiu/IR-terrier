  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if individuals with diabetes are at increased risk
      of hearing impairment or tinnitus (the perception of ringing or noises in the ears or head).
      An important goal of this research is also to obtain a better understanding of possible
      interactions between hearing disorders and other chronic conditions, such as diabetes.
      Participation in this research will be for a few hours only, to be scheduled at the
      participant's convenience and according to the testing schedules of the different clinics
      involved.
