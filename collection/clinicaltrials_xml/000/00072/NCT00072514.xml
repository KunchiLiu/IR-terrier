      This pilot phase II trial studies the side effects and how well giving gemcitabine
      hydrochloride, carboplatin, dexamethasone, and rituximab together works in treating patients
      with previously treated lymphoid malignancies. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as
      gemcitabine hydrochloride, carboplatin, and dexamethasone, work in different ways to stop
      the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.
      Monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab, can block cancer growth in different ways. Some
      block the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Others find cancer cells and help kill
      them or carry cancer-killing substances to them. Giving more than one drug (combination
      chemotherapy) and giving monoclonal antibody therapy with chemotherapy may kill more cancer
      cells

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the feasibility and safety of Gemcitabine/Carboplatin/Dexamethasone with or
      without Rituximab in previously treated lymphoid malignancies (rituximab will only be
      evaluated in CD20 positive malignancies).

      II. To determine the efficacy of the above regimen. III. To determine the ability to proceed
      to blood stem peripheral blood collection following the above regimens (the impact of above
      regimen on stem cell reserve).

      IV. To determine remission duration.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups.

      GROUP I: CD20-NEGATIVE LYMPHOMAS

      GROUP II: CD20-POSITIVE LYMPHOMAS

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3-4 weeks and then every 6
      months for 5 years.

    <description>In Group 1 (CD20-NEGATIVE LYMPHOMAS), patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8, carboplatin IV over 30-60 minutes on day 1, and dexamethasone orally (PO) on days 1-4. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
In Group 2 (CD20-POSITIVE LYMPHOMAS), patients receive treatment as in group I. Patients also receive rituximab IV on day 8. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.</description>
