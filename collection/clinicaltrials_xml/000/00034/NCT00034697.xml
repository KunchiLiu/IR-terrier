  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Brain metastases from solid tumors are diagnosed in more than 300,000 patients annually.
      Nonsmall cell lung cancer accounts for the majority of CNS mets. Treatment with whole brain
      radiation and steroids will improve neurologic symptoms in about 50% of patients although
      survival is short. This study will test the safety and efficacy of temozolomide in
      combination with radiation therapy in the treatment of patients with brain mets form
      nonsmall cell lung cancer.
