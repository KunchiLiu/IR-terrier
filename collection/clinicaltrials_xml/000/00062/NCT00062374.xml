  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is studying how well giving irinotecan together with cisplatin works in
      treating patients who are undergoing surgical resection for locally advanced cancer of the
      stomach or gastroesophageal junction. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as irinotecan and
      cisplatin, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or
      die. Combining more than one chemotherapy drug and giving them before surgery may shrink the
      tumor so that it can be removed during surgery.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the correlation of FDG-PET/CT imaging early in the preoperative treatment
      program of locally advanced gastric cancer with histologic response assessment and patient
      outcome, defined as overall and progression-free survival.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of preoperative chemotherapy with irinotecan and
      cisplatin in the treatment of locally advanced gastric cancer.

      II. To examine the biology of locally advanced gastric cancer and the response to
      chemotherapy by DNA microarray technology and by histopathology.

      III. To obtain preliminary data on biodistribution, dosimetry and explore the potential
      clinical usefulness of FLT PET in patients with locally advanced gastric cancer undergoing a
      novel combination neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, nonrandomized, multicenter study.

      Neoadjuvant chemotherapy: Patients receive cisplatin IV over 30 minutes followed by
      irinotecan IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, 22, and 29. Treatment repeats every 6 weeks for
      2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Surgery: Within 4 weeks after completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, patients undergo
      radical subtotal or total gastrectomy with lymph node dissection.

      Patients undergo fluorodeoxyglucose FDG-PET/CT at baseline. Some patients undergo additional
      FDG-PET/CT scans in weeks 3 and 6. Approximately 5 patients undergo fluorothymidine
      FLT-PET/CT at baseline, during week 3, and/or before surgical resection.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 2 years, and then
      annually thereafter.
