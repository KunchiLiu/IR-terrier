  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine whether pegaptanib sodium (Macugen) is safe and
      effective in slowing the leakage of fluid within the retina and thereby stabilizing or
      improving vision when compared to placebo injections. A total of 176 patients will be
      enrolled
