      Patients who agree to participate in this trial will be screened for the FLT 3 mutation by
      bone marrow exam. They will have a physical exam, blood test, EKG, chest x-ray, bone marrow
      aspirate and a pregnancy test. Patients will be required to have weekly blood test and bone
      marrow aspirate monthly.

        Inclusion criteria:

          1. Patients:

             with AML who are not candidates for myelosuppressive chemotherapy or with AML who
             have relapsed disease or are refractory to standard therapy and not likely to require
             cytoreductive therapy within one month or with MDS subtypes RAEB, RAEB-T or CMML.

          2. Patients with a relevant FLT3-ITD mutation or D835Y point mutation

          3. Patients at least 18 years or older

          4. Patients with WHO performance status of 0 to 2 with a life expectancy of at least 3
             months

          5. Patients must not be treated within 4 weeks after any prior therapy

          6. Written informed consent obtained according to local guidelines

        Exclusion criteria:

        entry into the study:

          1. Patients who had prior allogeneic, syngeneic, or autologous bone marrow transplant or
             stem cell transplant less than 2 months previously.

          2. Female patients who are pregnant or breast feeding, or adults of childbearing age not
             employing an effective method of birth control.

          4. Impairment of gastrointestinal (GI) function or GI disease that may significantly
             alter the absorption of PKC412.
