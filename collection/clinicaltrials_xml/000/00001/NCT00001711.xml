  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Magnetic resonance is an imaging technique that uses magnetic fields and radio waves to
      create images of the body. The technology used in magnetic resonance imaging continues to
      improve. Advancements in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) requires researchers to study new
      techniques in normal volunteers in order to understand how to use them in patients with
      diseases.

      In this study researchers plan to do a variety of diagnostic tests including magnetic
      resonance imaging on normal volunteers. The studies may involve injections of contrast
      media, substances injected into the blood of participant that improves the image created by
      the MRI scanner. The study is not expected to benefit the participants. However, information
      gathered from the study may be used to improve diagnostic techniques and develop new
      research studies.

      Technical evaluation of magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy will be performed on
      subjects who are eligible and willing to volunteer to have a research MRI performed. These
      studies may involve the intravenous administration of commercially available MR contrast
      media, glucagon or secretin. Some scans may require gastrointestinal contrast such as water
      or dilute gadolinium or barium. We also use inhaled carbogen as a contrast media. The
      results will be used to evaluate the performance of various pulse sequences, gradient coils,
      and rf coils on human subjects and will provide essential ground work for specific patient
      protocols.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Any subject above the age of 18 who is capable of giving informed consent.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        A subject will be excluded if he/she has a contraindication to MR scanning implanted metal
        clips or wires of the type which may concentrate radiofrequency fields or cause tissue
        damage from twisting in a magnetic field. Examples include: aneurysm clip, implanted
        neural stimulator, implanted cardiac pacemaker or autodefibrillator, cochlear implant,
        ocular foreign body (e.g., metal shavings), any implanted device (pumps, infusion devices,
        etc), shrapnel injuries.

        For studies involving the injection of Gadolinium based contrast a serum Creatinine
        obtained within one week of the MRI examination. All subjects with a calculated eGFR less
        than 60 will be excluded from having a contrast enhanced MRI, but will not be excluded
        from the protocol for non contrasted MRI studies.

        To assess whether subjects are normal eligible to participate, they will be asked to fill
        out a questionnaire. Subjects will be excluded if it is deemed that they have a condition
        which would preclude their use for technical development (e.g. paralyzed hemidiaphragm,
        morbid obesity, claustrophobia etc.) or present unnecessary risks (e.g. pregnancy, surgery
        of uncertain type, symptoms of pheochromocystoma or insulinoma, etc.). Lactating women and
        subjects with hemoglobinopathies, asthma, or renal or hepatic disease will be excluded
        from studies involving the administration of contrast agents.
