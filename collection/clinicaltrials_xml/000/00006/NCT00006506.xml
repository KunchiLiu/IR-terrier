      The purpose of this protocol is to establish data distribution and oversight procedures for
      a new repository of data collected from participants in clinical trials and epidemiologic
      studies sponsored by the Institute.

      The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) seeks to establish a data repository
      as described above. The well-characterized population samples in such a repository represent
      will constitute a valuable scientific resource. In order to take full advantage of such a
      resource and maximize its research value, the data must be made available, under appropriate
      terms and conditions, to the largest possible number of qualified investigators in a timely
      manner. Many of the data sets currently at the NHLBI or soon to come to the NHLBI are from
      research studies in which the informed consents do not clearly state that the data will be
      made available to researchers other than those involved in the original research. This
      protocol is intended to establish the conditions and processes by which NHLBI will provide
      data sets to investigators and to establish oversight procedures by NHLBI's Investigational
      Review Board.

    <textblock>
      The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) has established a data repository
      consisting of the collected data from participants in numerous clinical trials and
      epidemiologic studies sponsored by the Institute. These well-characterized population
      samples represent rare and valuable scientific resources. In order to take full advantage of
      such resources and maximize their research value, it is important that data collected with
      public funds be made available, under appropriate terms and conditions, to the largest
      possible number of qualified investigators in a timely manner. Data distribution procedures
      have been established and administered by the NHLBI. These procedures require modification
      or elimination of data to protect participant privacy, and require that the recipient of the
      data sign a data distribution agreement and obtain an IRB approval from their institution
      prior to receipt of the data.
