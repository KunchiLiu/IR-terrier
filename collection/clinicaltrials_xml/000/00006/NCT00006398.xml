  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn whether timolol is useful in preventing or delaying
      the appearance of gastroesophageal varices, a complication that may develop in the future as
      a consequence of liver disease. Cirrhosis causes an increased resistance of blood flowing
      through the liver. This leads to an increased pressure in the portal vein (the vein that
      takes blood to your liver). High portal pressure is responsible for the appearance of
      complications of chronic liver disease such as varices and variceal bleeding (bleeding from
      veins in your esophagus). Timolol belongs to a group of medications called beta-blockers.
      Beta-blockers decrease high portal pressure and previous studies have shown that
      beta-blocker pills are useful in preventing bleeding from varices in patients who already
      have varices. A more desirable effect would be if these pills could prevent not only
      bleeding from varices but the appearance of varices (and therefore of bleeding).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Liver biopsy compatible with cirrhosis.

          -  Absence of gastroesophageal varices.

          -  An increased hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) (6mmHg).

          -  Age over 18 and below 76 years.

          -  Informed, written consent.

          -  Absence of exclusion criteria.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Presence of ascites that requires specific treatment (diuretics, paracentesis,
             peritoneo-venous shunt, etc).

          -  Proven hepatocellular carcinoma by radiological or histological criteria.

          -  Splenic or portal vein thrombosis by Doppler-ultrasound.

          -  Presence of any concurrent disease that is expected to decrease life expectancy to
             less than one year.

          -  Patients taking diuretics, beta-blockers, clonidine, prazosin, nitrates, molsidomine
             and any drug which may have an effect on splanchnic hemodynamics/portal pressure.

          -  Patients participating in other pharmacological randomized clinical trials.

          -  Patients with primary biliary cirrhosis and primary sclerosing cholangitis will also
             be excluded since these entities have a slower progression of the disease, are
             usually enrolled in other clinical trials and are transplanted at an earlier stage.

          -  Contraindications to beta-blockers: asthma, COPD with positive broncoconstrictive
             test, heart failure, A-V block, aortic valve stenosis, organic psychosis,
             insulin-dependent diabetes, hypersensitivity to beta-blockers.

          -  Women who are pregnant, nursing or of childbearing potential and who are not using
             oral or mechanical contraception.
