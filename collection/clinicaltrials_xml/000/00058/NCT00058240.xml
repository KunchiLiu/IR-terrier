  <brief_title>Flavopiridol in Treating Patients With Previously Treated Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia or Lymphocytic Lymphoma</brief_title>

      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of flavopiridol in treating
      patients with previously treated chronic lymphocytic leukemia or lymphocytic lymphoma. Drugs
      used in chemotherapy such as flavopiridol work in different ways to stop cancer cells from
      dividing so they stop growing or die.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the toxicity profile, dose-limiting toxicity, and maximum tolerated dose of
      flavopiridol administered as a 30 minute loading dose followed by a 4-hour infusion once
      weekly for 4 consecutive weeks every 6 weeks.

      II. To determine the safety and feasibility of performing dose escalation to 80 mg/m2 (30
      mg/m2 30-minute IV bolus followed by 50 mg/m2 4-hour IV infusion) beginning dose 2 in
      patients who do not experience severe tumor lysis requiring hemodialysis during dose 1.

      III. To determine the pharmacokinetics and cellular pharmacodynamics of flavopiridol
      administered in this schedule.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the complete response (CR) and overall response rate (CR + PR) of
      flavopiridol in patients with previously-treated CLL administered as a 30 minute loading
      dose followed by a 4 hour infusion once weekly for 4 consecutive weeks every 6 weeks.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive a loading dose of flavopiridol IV over 30 minutes followed by a 4-hour
      infusion on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Treatment repeats every 6 weeks for up to 6 courses in
      the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of flavopiridol until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. After the MTD is determined, 12 additional
      patients are accrued and treated as above at the recommended phase II dose.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 2 months and then every 3
      months for 2 years.
