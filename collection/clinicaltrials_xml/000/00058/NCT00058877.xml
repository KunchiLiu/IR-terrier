  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is trying to determine whether Barrett's esophagus and associated
      esophageal cancers, specifically esophageal adenocarcinoma are inherited in certain
      families. Persons who are affected with Barrett's esophagus or esophageal cancer
      (adenocarcinoma type) are asked to complete a questionnaire that determines their habits and
      asks a detailed family history. Family members of patients seen at University Hospitals of
      Cleveland are also being recruited for screening tests of their esophagus. The investigators
      plan to eventually screen family members at all participating institutions. This research
      will eventually lead to the identification of inherited genetic changes that cause Barrett's
      esophagus and esophageal cancer. It will help the investigators develop better methods for
      preventing or identifying esophageal cancer at an early curable stage.
