      RATIONALE: Chemoprevention therapy is the use of certain substances to try to prevent the
      development or recurrence of cancer. Fruit and vegetable extracts may be effective in
      preventing the recurrence or further development of head and neck cancer.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying how well fruit and vegetable extracts
      work in preventing the recurrence of stage I, stage II, stage III, stage IVA, or stage IVB
      head and neck cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare the disease-free survival of patients with stage I-IV (including stage IVA and
           IVB) head and neck cancer treated with fruit and vegetable extracts vs placebo.

        -  Compare the effect of these extracts on biomarkers (p27 expression, cell proliferation
           of Ki-67, DNA damage, and T-cell function) in these patients.

        -  Correlate changes in biomarkers with other factors (e.g., site and stage of the
           original tumors, tobacco/alcohol use, or depression) in patients treated with these
           extracts.

        -  Compare serum carotenoids and antioxidant levels (vitamins A, C, and E) at baseline and
           posttreatment in patients treated with these extracts.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study. Patients are
      stratified according to tobacco use (yes vs no), alcohol consumption (yes vs no), and tumor
      stage at diagnosis (I vs II vs III vs IVA vs IVB). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2
      treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral fruit and vegetable extracts twice daily.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo twice daily. Treatment in both arms continues for
           12 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed annually for 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 200 patients (100 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 18 months.
