  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC) have become the preferred source of hematopoetic
      stem cells for allogeneic transplantation because of technical ease of collection and
      shorter time required for engraftment. Traditionally, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor
      (G-CSF) has been used to procure the peripheral blood stem cell graft. Although regimens
      using G-CSF usually succeed in collecting adequate numbers of PBPC from healthy donors,
      5%-10% will mobilize stem cells poorly and may require multiple large volume apheresis or
      bone marrow harvesting. Although G-CSF is generally well tolerated in healthy donors, it may
      be associated with bone pain, headache, myalgia and rarely life threatening side effects
      like stroke, myocardial infarction and splenic rupture.

      AMD3100, is a bicyclam compound that inhibits the binding of stromal cell derived factor-1
      (SDF-1) to its cognate receptor CXCR4. CXCR4 is present on CD34+ hematopoetic progenitor
      cells and its interaction with SDF-1 plays a pivotal role in the homing of CD34+ cells in
      the bone marrow. Inhibition of the CXCR4-SDF1 axis by AMD3100 releases CD34+ cells into the
      circulation, which can then be collected easily by apheresis. Recently, a published report
      demonstrated that large numbers of CD34+ cells were rapidly mobilized in healthy volunteers
      following a single subcutaneous injection of AMD3100. Remarkably, the number of CD34+ cells
      collected by apheresis following a single injection of AMD3100 was comparable to the number
      of CD34+ cells collected from historical controls receiving 5 days of G-CSF prior to stem
      cell mobilization. Although the study population is relatively small, side-effects to this
      agent have been mild and transient with no serious complications having been reported. The
      ability to collect a large quantity of PBPC with a single injection of this drug makes this
      an attractive agent for mobilizing donors of allogeneic PBPC. However, the immunologic
      profiles of AMD3100 mobilized cells, in terms of lymphocyte content (T cell, B cell, NK
      cell, immuno-regulatory T cell), T cell polarization status (TH1 versus TH2), status of
      antigen presenting cells (DC1 versus DC2), alloreactive potential, and preservation of
      reactivity to infectious agents (e.g. EBV, CMV) are unknown. Consequently, whether AMD3100
      mobilized PBPC would be suitable for use as an allograft is uncertain. In this study we will
      collect PBPCs following a single subcutaneous injection of AMD3100 from healthy donors who
      have previously had PBPC collected using standard G-CSF mobilization. The AMD3100 mobilized
      cells, G-CSF mobilized cells, and circulating cells prior to both AMD3100 and G-CSF
      mobilization will be analyzed in terms of cellular content and function of lymphocytes, NK
      cells, and antigen presenting cells. AMD3100 mobilized PBPC will be collected for the
      purpose of research studies and will not be used for therapeutic purposes.

      purpose of research studies and will not be used for therapeutic purposes.

      The primary objective is to characterize the cellular content and immunological properties
      of an AMD3100 mobilized PBPC in donors who have previously under gone mobilization with
      G-CSF, and to further study its safety and efficacy as a peripheral blood stem cell
      mobilizer.

      The primary endpoint is the ratio of Th1 (intracellular IFN-gamma plus) versus Th2
      (intracellular IL-4 plus) T-cells in the apheresis products collected from individual donors
      undergoing G-CSF and AMD3100 hematopoietic progenitor cell mobilization.

      Secondary endpoints include the cellular content and other immune properties of AMD3100
      mobilized cells yields of hematopoietic progenitor cells, immune cells, and other cellular
      subsets collected by apheresis in subjects undergoing G-CSF and AMD3100 mobilization and the
      safety profile of AMD3100.
