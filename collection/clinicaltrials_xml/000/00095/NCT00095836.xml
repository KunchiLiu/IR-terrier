      RATIONALE: Gefitinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking the enzymes necessary
      for their growth.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of gefitinib in treating patients who
      have locally advanced or metastatic thyroid cancer that did not respond to iodine therapy.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the all-measurable-disease response rate in patients with iodine-refractory
           locally advanced or metastatic thyroid cancer treated with gefitinib.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine progression-free and overall survival of patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label study.

      Patients receive oral gefitinib once daily. Treatment continues in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 27 patients will be accrued for this study.
