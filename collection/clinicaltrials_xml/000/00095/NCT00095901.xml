      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as capecitabine, work in different ways to stop
      tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of capecitabine in treating patients who
      have locally recurrent or metastatic nasopharyngeal cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the overall response rate (complete response and partial response) in
           patients with previously treated recurrent locoregional or metastatic carcinoma of the
           nasopharynx treated with capecitabine.

      Secondary

        -  Determine median progression-free survival of patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine median overall survival of patients treated with this drug.

        -  Correlate tissue thymidine phosphorylase (TP) levels with response to this drug in
           these patients.

        -  Correlate the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) status of these patients with response to this
           drug.

        -  Correlate survival with the EBV status of patients treated with this drug.

        -  Correlate TP levels with EBV status of patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a nonrandomized, multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral capecitabine twice daily on days 1-14. Treatment repeats every 21
      days.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 39 patients will be accrued for this study.
