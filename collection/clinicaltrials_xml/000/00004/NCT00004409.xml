      OBJECTIVES:

      Evaluate the safety and efficacy of collagenase in improving flexion deformity, range of
      motion, and grip strength in patients with residual Dupuytren's disease.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, investigator-blinded, placebo-controlled study.

      Patients receive a single dose of either collagenase or placebo into the target finger on
      day 0. Patients who do not respond at the 1 month follow up visit may receive an injection
      of open label collagenase, if IgE antibody levels are no greater than 15 ng/mL.

      Following treatment, patients use a nighttime extension splint for 4 months and perform
      finger flexion/extension exercises. Patients are followed at 1, 7, and 14 days, and at 1, 2,
      3, 6, 9, and 12 months, for each joint treated.
