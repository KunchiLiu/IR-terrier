      RATIONALE: Inserting the gene for interleukin-12 into a person's cancer cells may make the
      body build an immune response to kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of gene therapy in treating patients
      who have unresectable, recurrent, or refractory head and neck cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the safety and tolerability of interleukin-12 gene in patients with
      unresectable, recurrent, or refractory squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. II.
      Evaluate the efficacy of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive interleukin-12 gene by intratumoral
      injection twice during week 1 and once weekly during weeks 2-7 in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 28-34 patients will be accrued for this study.
