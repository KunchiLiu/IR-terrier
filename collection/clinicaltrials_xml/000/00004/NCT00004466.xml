      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the effect of atorvastatin on the plasma levels of lipids, Lp(a), and
      apoproteins for treating hyperlipidemia in children with nephrotic syndrome in whom
      proteinuria and hyperlipidemia persist after other appropriate measures to treat their
      primary disease have been exhausted.

      II. Determine the safety and tolerability of atorvastatin in these patients.

      III. Provide preliminary data for a future investigation into the potential effect that
      lowering cholesterol levels may have on the rate of progression of renal insufficiency in
      such patients.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE:

      This is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, multicenter study.

      After 3 months of low cholesterol diet, patients are randomized to receive atorvastatin
      tablets daily (arm I) or placebo tablets daily (arm II) for 3 months. Arm I patients receive
      increasing doses of atorvastatin every 4 weeks until individual maximum tolerated doses
      (MTDs) are determined.

      After 3 months of treatment, all patients are given atorvastatin in a 6-9 month open label
      extended evaluation. Arm I patients receive atorvastatin for an additional 6 months and arm
      II patients receive atorvastatin for 9 months with increasing doses of atorvastatin every 4
      weeks for the first 3 months until MTDs are determined.

      Patients are followed every 6-8 weeks for one year.

        PROTOCOL ENTRY CRITERIA:

        --Disease Characteristics--

        Chronic hyperlipidemia with treatment-resistant nephrotic syndrome; Must have received at
        least 2 months of therapy with steroids on a daily or alternate basis

        LDL cholesterol at least 160 mg/dL

        --Prior/Concurrent Therapy--
