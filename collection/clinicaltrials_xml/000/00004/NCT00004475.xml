      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Establish linkage in families with hereditary pancreatitis between the phenotype and a
      chromosomal locus (loci) that contains the responsible gene.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a genetics study. Blood samples are collected from patients and
      family members. DNA is extracted from the blood and used for genotypic analysis and linkage
      analysis.

      Patients do not necessarily receive the results of the genetic testing and the results do
      not influence the type or duration of treatment.
