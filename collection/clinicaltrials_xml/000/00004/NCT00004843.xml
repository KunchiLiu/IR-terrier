      OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the efficacy of surgery vs no surgery in patients with mild
      asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism.

      II. Assess the quality of life, morbidity, and mortality of these patients.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified by
      gender. Patients are randomized to receive surgery or follow up without surgery.

      Patients receive parathyroidectomy (current standard care) or long term follow up without
      parathyroidectomy.

      Quality of life is assessed before the study and then every 6 months. All patients are
      followed every 6 months until death.
