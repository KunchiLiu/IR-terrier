      OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate whether hemodialysis providing a 2-pool, variable volume urea
      kinetic modelling value of 1.05 versus 1.45 reduces mortality and morbidity in patients with
      end stage renal disease.

      II. Compare the efficacy of high versus low flux dialyzer membranes.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified by
      center, age, and diabetes prior to dialysis initiation.

      Patients are randomly assigned to 1 of 4 groups: moderate dose dialysis, low flux membrane;
      high dose dialysis, low flux membrane; moderate dose dialysis, high flux membrane; or high
      dose dialysis, high flux membrane. Moderate dose is a target eKt/V of 1.05 and high dose is
      1.45. The dose and delivery of dialysis are measured monthly by the equilibrated fractional
      clearance of urea (eKt/V) calculated with double pool kinetics.

      Patients are dialyzed 3 times a week in the shortest possible time (minimum 2.5 hours),
      adjusted for adequate fluid removal. General medical care, protein and calorie intake, and
      dialyzer reuse and other aspects of dialysis therapy are standardized. The protocol document
      lists approved dialyzers; no unsubstituted cellulosic membranes are permitted.

      The intervention phase of this study is 5 years. Patients are followed for survival.
