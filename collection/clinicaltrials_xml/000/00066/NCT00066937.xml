  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the combination of cognitive-behavioral
      treatment and nortriptyline are more effective than each treatment alone in reducing the
      pain and disability associated with TMD.

      This is a randomized, controlled trial evaluating pharmacological (nortriptyline vs. active
      placebo - benztropine) and psychological (cognitive-behavioral therapy vs. disease
      education) treatments for pain and disability due to temporomandibular joint disorder (TMD).
      Patients 18 to 65 years old meeting RDC criteria for TMD and other eligibility criteria
      complete a 3-week baseline monitoring phase prior to randomization. Active treatment
      consists of weekly visits for 8 week, then maintenance treatment for 6 months. Outcome
      measures include pain, physical and psychosocial function and are assessed at
      post-treatment, 3-months, and 6-months
