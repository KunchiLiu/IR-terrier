      BACKGROUND:

      Sleep apnea is potentially a life-threatening disorder commonly associated with the aging
      process. Often sleep apnea is accompanied by considerable morbidity for both physical and
      mental health; the associated excessive daytime sleepiness, cardiovascular abnormalities,
      and cognitive impairment impact greatly on daytime functioning. In 1990, the prevalence of
      sleep apnea in the general population was undetermined, and there was much speculation
      regarding its natural history.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      For the prevalence study, 4,364 randomly-sampled men selected from the general population
      and stratified by age were evaluated for risk factors for sleep apnea. A total of 741 men
      found to be at risk were evaluated in the sleep laboratory to determine the degree, if any,
      of sleep apnea or sleep disordered breathing. Prior to recording subjects in the sleep
      laboratory, a thorough history was obtained from each subject and a physical examination
      completed. All men entering into the first four years of the prevalence portion of the study
      who were found to have sleep apnea or sleep disordered breathing were reevaluated yearly
      over a five year period in the natural history part of the study. The natural history
      portion also included 150 men previously studied in the sleep laboratory for apnea but who
      were not part of the random sample of 4,000 and who were not part of the prevalence study.
