      BACKGROUND:

      The study was part of an NHLBI initiative on &quot;CVD Nutrition Education for Low Literacy
      Skills&quot;. The initiative originated within the Prevention and Demonstration Branch of the
      DECA, was approved by the September 1988 National Heart, Lung, and Blood Advisory Council,
      and released in July 1990.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      The study had three phases. The goal of Phase I was to develop two innovative care modules
      that used demographic, psycho-social, nutritional, and behavioral information to
      individually tailor nutrition treatment programs for southern patients with less than ninth
      grade reading skills. Counselor Directed innovative care consisted of a structured
      assessment and intervention package of simply written, graphically-oriented printed
      materials to guide the patient and health counselor (nutritionist, health educator, nurse,
      or physician). Computer Assisted innovative care used a user-friendly, interactive, computer
      assisted program permitting more sophisticated tailoring to individual needs, conveying
      nutrition information in a vivid, understandable format, and extending the services of the
      health counselor. The investigators used focus groups of patients with low literacy skills
      to aid in concept development and refinement of intervention delivery strategies. Reliable
      and valid assessments of readability and comprehension helped further refine the materials.

      In Phase II, a randomized trial was conducted to determine if the innovative modules
      produced a meaningful reduction in cholesterol and overall cardiovascular risk compared to
      standard care. Subjects with high cholesterol and low literacy skills served by four
      community health centers were randomly assigned to one of four groups: Innovative
      Care-Counselor Directed, Innovative Care-Computer Assisted, Standard Care, and Usual Care
      for dietary treatment of cholesterol, obesity, and hypertension. Standard Care involved the
      same amount of time and health counselor exposure as Innovative Care, but used currently
      available materials. Usual Care patients were referred to their usual provider for
      treatment. After four months and again at one year, changes in lipids, blood pressure, and
      weight were assessed..

      Phase Ill consisted of a feasibility study to test the ability of both innovative care
      modules to reach low literacy adults through county health departments, worksites, and
      churches. Results of the feasibility assessment helped refine a dissemination strategy using
      the state health department as a centralized coordinating agency, and county health
      departments to implement the interventions at the community level.
