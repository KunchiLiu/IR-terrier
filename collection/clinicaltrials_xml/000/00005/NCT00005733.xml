      BACKGROUND:

      Asthma is a serious chronic disease affecting about 12 million Americans; about 3 million
      are children. The study was part of an initiative, &quot;Developing and Implementing at the State
      and Local Level Educational Strategies and Interventions for Controlling Asthma in Inner
      City and High Risk Populations&quot;, released in February 1993 by the National Asthma Education
      Program of the Office of Prevention, Education and Control.
