  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate patients with a variety of endocrine disorders in order to 1) learn
      more about conditions that affect the endocrine glands (glands that secrete hormones) and 2)
      to train physicians in endocrinology.

      Patients of all ages with endocrine-related conditions may be eligible for evaluation under
      this protocol. Those enrolled may be required to provide blood, saliva, urine or stool
      samples, and to undergo ultrasound examination of the thyroid gland, ovaries or testes,
      adrenal glands or other parts of the body. Laboratory or X-ray studies may be done for
      diagnostic or treatment purposes. In some cases, patients will receive medical or surgical
      treatment for their disorder. Patients and family members of patients with a hereditary
      disorder may be asked to provide a blood sample for genetic analysis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This protocol is designed to allow inpatient and outpatient evaluation of patients with a
      variety of endocrine disorders for purposes of research and physician education in our
      accredited endocrinology training programs, and to allow for small pilot studies in normal
      volunteers. The research-directed evaluations may include blood, saliva, urine or stool
      samples, and/or ultrasound examinations. In some patients with endocrine disorders,
      laboratory or radiological studies will be performed to confirm the diagnosis or to aid in
      the management of the patient, as would be done in current clinical practice. In some cases,
      the patient will receive medical or surgical treatment for their disorder. The purpose of
      these evaluations or treatments will be to support our clinical training or research
      missions.
