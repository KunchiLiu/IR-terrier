  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine whether estrogen administration in postmenopausal women can alter
      the response to changes in brain chemistry brought about by dietary manipulation. Women who
      are recently menopausal (50-60 yrs. of age) and over 20 years postmenopausal (&gt;70 yrs. of
      age) will take estrogen or placebo for three months. At the end of that time they will
      participate in three challenges using dietary techniques to briefly change the relative
      amounts of neurotransmitters in the brain that are believed to be related to mood regulation
      (serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine). Previous research has shown that these dietary
      manipulations can briefly produce negative changes in mood. The investigator hypothesizes
      that estrogen administration will blunt or buffer these negative effects in a quantifiable
      way. The investigator believes that this will provide a direct test of the ability of
      estrogen to meaningfully change the brain chemistry of mood in a clinically measurable and
      positive way. The proposed procedure will also allow assessment of the effects of estrogen
      on brain neurotransmitter systems after many years of very low estrogen levels.
