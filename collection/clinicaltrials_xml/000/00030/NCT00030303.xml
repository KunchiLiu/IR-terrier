      RATIONALE: Vaccines made from a person's white blood cells may make the body build an immune
      response to kill cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of vaccine therapy in treating patients
      who have chronic myelogenous leukemia.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the feasibility of vaccination with autologous heat shock protein 70 in
           patients with chronic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this vaccination in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo leukapheresis to obtain peripheral mononuclear cells (PMNCs). Heat
      shock protein 70 (HSP70) is derived from the autologous PMNCs. Patients receive HSP70
      intradermally once weekly for 8 weeks.

      Patients are followed for 2 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10 patients will be accrued for this study.
