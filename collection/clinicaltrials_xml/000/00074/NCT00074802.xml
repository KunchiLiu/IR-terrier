  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine whether the addition of cognitive behavioral therapy can improve
      the effectiveness of the medication paroxetine (PaxilÂ®) in treating individuals with social
      anxiety disorder.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Social anxiety disorder is a prevalent and disabling condition for which effective long-term
      treatments need to be identified. Paroxetine is effective in treating the acute symptoms of
      social anxiety, but longer-term management remains a challenge. Cognitive behavioral therapy
      (CBT) has been effective in treating depression and panic disorder symptoms; it may also be
      effective in augmenting paroxetine response and reducing relapse after medication
      discontinuation. This study will examine the effects of paroxetine treatment alone and in
      combination with CBT.

      Participants in this study will receive paroxetine for 12 weeks. After 12 weeks,
      participants will be randomly assigned to either add weekly sessions of CBT to their
      treatment or to continue taking paroxetine alone for another 16 weeks. After the 16-week
      treatment period, participants will have their treatments tapered and will be followed for
      an additional 24 weeks. Social anxiety symptoms, rates of remission, and quality of life
      will be assessed.
