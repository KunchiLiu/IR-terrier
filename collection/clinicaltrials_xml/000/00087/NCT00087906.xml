      BACKGROUND:

      Background. COPD is a common chronic health condition. Because current medical treatments
      have minimal impact on disease progression, a strategy to prevent COPD-related disability
      would have important clinical and public health benefits.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      The study will test a specific conceptual model of how disability develops in COPD. The aims
      are: (1) To evaluate the impact of respiratory impairment, especially pulmonary function
      impairment, on the risk of functional limitation in COPD. Using a control group, to
      elucidate the prevalence of respiratory impairment, functional limitation, and disability
      that is directly attributable to COPD. (2) In adults with COPD, to delineate the
      longitudinal effect of functional limitation on the risk of incident disability. The
      investigators hypothesize that development of functional limitation, and not pulmonary
      function impairment, is the major determinant of disability. (3) To determine the
      prospective impact of disability on the risk of future adverse health outcomes. The
      investigators will assemble a prospective cohort of 1200 randomly sampled adults with COPD
      who are members of a large regional health maintenance organization. A matched control group
      of 300 subjects will be recruited. Subjects will undergo a detailed physical assessment that
      measures respiratory impairment (e.g., pulmonary function) and functional limitation (e.g.,
      lower extremity function, muscle strength, exercise performance, and cognitive function).
      Structured telephone interviews will ascertain disability outcomes at baseline and 18-month
      prospective follow-up. The investigators will also study the modulating effects of specific
      risk factors and protective factors on the progression from functional limitation to
      COPD-related disability, including psychological factors, environmental exposures, and
      health care process factors.

        We recruited persons with COPD for what we came to term the &quot;FLOW study.&quot; The original
        project was funded to complete two interviews and a single research clinic evaluation. In
        addition to completing this original program of work successfully, we also carried out
        follow-up research clinic visits for 667 subjects. These supplemental examinations were
        made possible through research funding support from the Flight Attendants Medical Research
        Foundation (FAMRI).
