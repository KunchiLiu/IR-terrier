      This study will collect brain tissue samples for research purposes from patients undergoing
      surgery to treat epilepsy. The standard surgical procedure for medically intractable
      epilepsy i.e., epilepsy that cannot be controlled with medicine requires removal of more
      brain tissue than is needed for diagnostic study. This extra tissue, which would otherwise
      be discarded, will be used for research purposes. In addition, a blood vessel in the scalp,
      called the superficial temporal artery, is also normally cut during surgery, and a piece of
      this vessel will be taken for research use.

      Patients 4 years of age or older who undergo surgery for medically intractable epilepsy may
      be eligible for this study.

      Brain tissue collected under this protocol will be used for studies of brain cells in other
      diseases and of serotonin receptors. Any remaining brain tissue will be frozen for use in
      future research. The superficial temporal artery will be used for comparison with carotid
      arteries (a neck artery that supplies the brain) from patients with blockage of this blood
      vessel.

      This is a protocol to perform research studies on tissues that are removed in the operating
      room during surgical procedures for medically intractable epilepsy. Our aim is to acquire
      and supply useful tissue specimens for intramural NIH research projects.

      The investigators will be free to select which patients will undergo surgery. However, the
      total number of patients that can be enrolled in the protocol will be restricted. This
      protocol is not designed to test any new treatments. Any treatment under this protocol will
      be based on the current standard of care for epilepsy surgery. The goal of the surgical
      procedure is to remove the epileptic focus. Standard procedures to be performed are 1)
      anterior temporal lobectomy or 2) amygdalohippocampectomy for temporal lobe epilepsy, and 3)
      focal cortical resection for epilepsy that arises outside the temporal lobe. These are the
      research aspects of the protocol: 1) Any brain tissue that is removed and is not required
      for diagnostic studies will be used for laboratory studies, consistent with institutional
      guidelines. 2) Meningeal samples, dura only, will be taken to examine for tissue markers of
      lymphatic vessels. 3) Blood tests to test for immune and inflammatory mediators will be
      performed. 4) Saliva will be collected to test for immune and inflammatory markers.

      Participants in this protocol will be evaluated for potential eligibility for other NINDS
      clinical trials as they are developed. However, they will not be required to enter any
      protocol and their decision to participate will be entirely voluntary. No more than 120
      patients will be accepted in this protocol.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        To be eligible for entry into the study, candidates must meet al the following criteria:

          1. Be 4 years of age or older.

          2. Have simple or complex partial seizures.

          3. Seizures must persist despite medical therapy.

          4. Able to give informed consent, or, assent if a child.

          5. Have been determined by the NINDS neurology staff to have medically intractable
             epilepsy.

          6. Have agreed to undergo brain surgery to treat medically intractable epilepsy.

          7. Have agreed to allow some of the tissue removed during the surgery to be used for
             research.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Candidates will be excluded if they:

          1. Are pregnant. (Women of childbearing age will be tested with a urine pregnancy test
             and will have agreed to avoid being pregnant by practicing a reliable form of
             contraception or by abstinence from sexual intercourse.)

          2. Cannot have an MRI scan as determined by the radiologist.

          3. Have a bleeding disorder that cannot be corrected before testing or treatment.

          4. Are unable to understand the risks of the testing and surgical therapy. (A clinical
             neuropsychologist that is not an investigator for this protocol examines all patients
             before epilepsy surgery. She will determine if a subject is unable to understand
             risks, unable to reach reasonable decisions and incompetent to give informed consent.
