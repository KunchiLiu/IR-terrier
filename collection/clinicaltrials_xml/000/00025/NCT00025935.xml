      This study seeks to learn more about the symptoms of severe mood dysregulation in children
      and adolescents ages 7-17. Children and adolescents with severe mood dysregulation (SMD)
      display chronic anger, sadness, or irritability, as well as hyperarousal (such as insomnia,
      distractibility, hyperactivity) and extreme responses to frustration (such as frequent,
      severe temper tantrums). Researchers will describe the moods and behaviors of children with
      these symptoms and use specialized testing and brain imaging to learn about the brain
      changes associated with this disorder.

      A.Objective:

      The past decade has seen a dramatic increase in focus on pediatric bipolar disorder (BD), as
      the number of children receiving the diagnosis has escalated . Discussion has centered on
      the diagnostic boundaries of bipolar disorder, and whether nonepisodic severe irritability
      is a developmental presentation of mania. Beginning in 2002, our work defined a specific
      phenotype [severe mood dysregulation (SMD)] including youth with chronic angry mood with
      behavioral outbursts and hyperarousal symptoms. The purpose of this work has been to examine
      similarities and differences between youth with BD and SMD, and address the nosological
      question of whether the diagnosis of BD should be separated from a chronic angry mood with
      behavioral outbursts and hyperarousal symptoms similar to those present in children and
      adolescents with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Before this work began,
      there was substantial debate, with little evidence to support either position.

      Over the last decade, there has been substantial progress suggesting these might be best
      viewed a separate conditions, but important questions remain. In 2013 the Diagnostic and
      Statistical Manual (DSM) added Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder, (DMDD) that is very
      similar to SMD in that it shares features of severe irritability. Future work needs to
      address the relationship between classic presentations of BD (as in protocol 00-M-0198) and
      SMD, as defined in this protocol or DMDD as defined in the DSM. Data suggest that there is a
      strong likelihood for those DMDD/SMD in youth to develop Major Depression. Thus, youth with
      Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) (with and without prior DMDD) are an important comparison
      group. We are examining the developmental trajectory, phenomenology, behavioral correlates,
      and underlying neural mechanisms of chronic irritability and MDD in youth. Our overall goal
      is to gain a clearer understanding of the course and neurophysiology these disorders to
      inform treatment and improve the outcome for children with irritability and depression. In
      order to advance this aim this protocol has 3 objectives:

        1. to use longitudinal techniques to characterize the clinical and physiological
           manifestations of irritability in youth with SMD or DMDD, and in youth who are
           significantly irritable yet fall short of fully meeting criteria (and thus are
           subthreshold for DMDD).

        2. to identify and follow longitudinally behavioral, neuropsychological,
           neurophysiological, and neuroanatomical correlates of DMDD, and compare them to
           pediatric disorders that bear some similarities (BD, and attention deficit
           hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), MDD, subthreshold DMDD) and to typically developing
           youth.

        3. to examine genetic and familial correlates of full and sub-threshold SMD,DMDD, and MDD.

      B. Study population:

      There are 4 separate populations being studied in this protocol:

        1. Children and adolescents between the ages of 7-17 years old who meet criteria for SMD
           or DMDD or subthreshold DMDD.

        2. Healthy volunteer children and adolescents between the ages of 7-17 years old

        3. Healthy volunteer adults between the ages of 18-25 years old.

        4. Children and adolescents between the ages of 12-17 years old who meet criteria for
           major depressive disorder (MDD)

      C.Design:

      For children and adolescents with SMD or full or subthreshold DMDD and/or MDD, this study is
      an outpatient characterization and longitudinal follow-along design. Once determined to be
      eligible, individuals come for an initial assessment, and then return at 1-2-year intervals
      until age 25 for clinical interviews, behavioral tasks, and structural and functional MRI.

      For healthy volunteer children, adults and parents of healthy volunteer children, this study
      is an outpatient cross-sectional study that includes clinical interviews, behavioral tasks,
      and structural and functional MRI.

      For all individuals, genetic material from saliva or blood is obtained under protocol
      01-M-0254.

      D.Outcome measures:

      This study will examine between-group differences in clinical, behavioral, genetic,
      neuroanatomical, and neurophysiological variables in individuals with SMD or full or
      subthreshold DMDD and/or MDD, BD (BD, see protocol 00-M-0198), and healthy volunteers.

      Children with SMD or full or subthreshold DMDD and/or MDD may also be compared on these
      features to those with other disorders (e.g. anxiety, depression) who are studied under Dr.
      Daniel Pine s protocol 01-M-0192 in order to elucidate differences between SMD or DMDD and
      these conditions.

      Longitudinal clinical, behavioral, and neuroanatomical data will also be obtained.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA: CHILDREN WITH DMDD, SUBTHRESHOLD DMDD, OR SMD:

        (for patients with DMDD or subthreshold DMDD, 1 through 6 must be met; for those with SMD,
        we also add 7):

          1. Ages 7-17 at the time of recruitment; will be followed in the longitudinal component
             of the study until age 25.

          2. Abnormal mood (specifically, anger, sadness, and/or irritability), present at least
             half of the day most days, and of sufficient severity to be noticeable by people in
             the child s environment (e.g. parents, teachers, peers).

          3. Compared to his/her peers, the child exhibits markedly increased reactivity to
             negative emotional stimuli that is manifest verbally or behaviorally. For example,
             the child responds to frustration with extended temper tantrums (inappropriate for
             age and/or precipitating event), verbal rages, and/or aggression toward people or
             property. Such events occur, on average, at least three times a week. For
             subthreshold DMDD such tantrums occur on average at least once per week.

          4. The symptoms in # 2, and 3 above are currently present and have been present for at
             least 12 months without any symptom-free periods exceeding two months.

          5. The onset of symptoms must be prior to age 12 years.

          6. For DMDD and SMD, the symptoms are severe in at least in one setting (e.g. violent
             outbursts, assaultiveness at home, school, or with peers) and at least mild
             (distractibility, intrusiveness) in a second setting. For subthreshold DMDD, there
             must be evidence of impairment causing distress to the child or to those around
             him/her in at least one setting.

          7. For a diagnosis of SMD we add: Hyperarousal, as defined by at least three of the
             following symptoms: insomnia, agitation, distractibility, racing thoughts or flight
             of ideas, pressured speech, intrusiveness

        4.1. has no exclusionary criteria for MRI scanning

        4.2. is failing his/her treatment as defined as:

        4.2.1. The child s current CGAS score less than or equal to 60.
