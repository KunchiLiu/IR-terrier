      This multi-center collaborative study will establish a database of information about stroke
      in infants and children.

      Children 0 to 18 years of age who: 1) have had an ischemic stroke after January 1, 2003; 2)
      have a history of spastic hemiplegic or quadriplegic cerebral palsy and X-ray evidence of
      ischemic stroke after January 1, 2003; or 3) are diagnosed with ischemic stroke defined by a
      new focal neurologic deficit lasting 24 hours or more and presumed due to vessel obstruction
      or narrowing may be eligible to participate this study.

      Participating children have their medical and research records reviewed for information
      about their stroke. The information is gathered and entered into an internet database.
      Parents may be interviewed to obtain additional information, if needed. No identifying
      information is entered into the database, so that the child's participation remains
      anonymous. The resulting registry may allow physicians to better diagnose, treat, and
      prevent stroke in children, and will help in developing and conducting new clinical trials
      to study this disease.

      OBJECTIVES: This is the first multi-center, multi-national study of children with stroke. It
      seeks to build a network of investigators, and baseline disease data, to enable childhood
      stroke clinical trials to be developed.

      STUDY POPULATION: Infants and children with ischemic stroke (arterial ischemic stroke and
      sinovenous thrombosis).

      DESIGN: This study is a prospective cohort study conducted consecutively at over 70 centers
      worldwide. This cohort will be used to develop and apply standardized protocols in a study
      setting for the diagnosis, etiological investigation, treatment, and outcome assessment of
      infants and children with ischemic stroke (arterial ischemic stroke and sinovenous
      thrombosis). Children, with diagnosis of stroke made after January 2003, will be
      prospectively enrolled into a web-based data entry system.

      OUTCOME MEASURES: This study will quantify outcome event rates (initial stroke
      characteristics, recurrent stroke, mortality, neurologic deficits), which can be used in
      designing future intervention studies and determining sample sizes. Analysis will be
      primarily descriptive. Some predictor testing for outcomes within strata may be utilized for
      web-based data.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Children, 0 to 18 years of age, with an event of ischemic stroke after January 1, 2003;

        Children, 0 to 18 years of age, with a history of spastic hemiplegic or quadriplegic
        cerebral palsy with radiographic evidence of ischemic stroke occurring after January 1,
        2003;

        A diagnosis of ischemic stroke (arterial ischemic stroke or sinovenous thrombosis) as
        defined by a new focal neurologic deficit lasting greater than or equal to 24 hours and

        tomography (CT), magnetic resonance (MR), or Doppler ultrasonography;

        Informed consent of the parent; and

        Informed assent of the child, when available.

        Preterm children (less than 36 weeks gestation);

        Children greater than 18 years of age;

        Children with an event of ischemic stroke prior to January 1, 2003.
