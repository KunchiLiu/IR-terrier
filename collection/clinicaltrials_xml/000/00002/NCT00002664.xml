      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver
      tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Colony-stimulating factors
      such as G-CSF may increase the number of immune cells found in bone marrow or peripheral
      blood, and may help a person's immune system kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of monoclonal antibody therapy plus G-CSF
      in treating patients with metastatic colorectal cancer that has not responded to treatment
      with fluorouracil.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the response rate, duration of response, and survival after treatment
      with monoclonal antibody 17-1A and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor in
      patients with colorectal cancer metastatic to nonhepatic sites and refractory to
      fluorouracil. II. Describe the toxicities associated with this regimen. III. Assess the
      quality of life in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Biological Response Modifier Therapy. Colorectal antigen 17-1A murine monoclonal
      antibody, MOAB 17-1A, NSC-377963; Granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor
      (Immunex), GM-CSF, NSC-613795.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: There will be 30 evaluable patients accrued into this study over
      approximately 1 year.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically confirmed carcinoma of the colon or rectum with
        radiologically confirmed metastases or clinically confirmed incurability No hepatic or CNS
        metastases Progression following fluorouracil (5-FU) alone or with a modulator (e.g.,
        leucovorin, PALA, levamisole, interferon) Measurable disease outside prior radiotherapy
        fields The following are not considered measurable: Pleural effusion or ascites
        Osteoblastic lesions or evidence of disease on bone scan alone Progressive irradiated
        lesions alone Bone marrow involvement Brain metastases Malignant hepatomegaly by physical
        exam alone Chemical markers (e.g., CEA)
