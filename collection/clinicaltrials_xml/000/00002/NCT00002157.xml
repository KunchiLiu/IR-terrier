  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To allow patients with HIV-associated wasting to receive thalidomide treatment at 1 of 2
      doses. To gain safety and efficacy data from a broader base of patients with HIV-associated
      wasting in order to support Celgene's pivotal placebo-controlled study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients are randomized to receive thalidomide at 1 of 2 doses for 12 weeks initially, with
      response assessed at weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12. Patients failing the low dose will be eligible
      to increase the dose to the higher dose. Treatment may continue indefinitely. After 12
      weeks, patients continuing treatment are evaluated every 2 months for up to 6 additional
      months, then every 6 months thereafter.
