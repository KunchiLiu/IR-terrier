    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies pentostatin and donor lymphocyte infusion in preventing graft
      rejection in patients who have undergone donor stem cell transplant. Giving pentostatin and
      an infusion of the donor's T cells (donor lymphocyte infusion) after a donor stem cell
      transplant may stop the patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. The
      donated stem cells may replace the patient's immune cells and help destroy any remaining
      cancer cells (graft-versus-tumor effect). Sometimes the transplanted cells from a donor can
      also make an immune response against the body's normal cells. Giving pentostatin before
      donor lymphocyte infusion may stop this from happening.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the safety and efficacy of the combined use of pentostatin and donor lymphocyte
      infusion (DLI) in patients with low or falling donor T-cell chimerism to prevent graft
      rejection after transplantation both from matched related donors (MRDs) or unrelated donors
      (URDs).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the incidence of graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) infections and disease
      response, if persistent disease is present.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of donor lymphocyte infusion.

      GROUP I: Patients receive pentostatin intravenously (IV) over 20-30 minutes on day -2 and
      DLI over 15-30 minutes on day 0. Treatment may repeat once beginning with an escalated or
      same cluster of differentiation (CD)3-dose at least 4 weeks if persistent donor T-cells are
      documented, no GvHD has developed, and the chimerism status worsens or, if chimerism status
      is unchanged after at least 8 weeks with two subsequent tests of chimerism 4 weeks apart.

      GROUP II (initiated if patients in group I do not achieve sustained engraftment and improved
      chimerism): Patients receive treatment as in group I. Patients also receive cyclosporine
      orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days -3 to 56 and mycophenolate mofetil PO once daily (QD)
      on days 0 to 27. Treatment continues in the absence of GvHD.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for 2 years and
      then annually thereafter.

    <description>A regimen will be considered successful if 20 patients are enrolled, at least 13 demonstrate improved chimerism. If fewer than 5 patients have shown improvement in chimerism then it can be at least 75% confident that the true rate of improvement is less than 0.53. Enrollment to the regimen will stop and the next regimen will be opened. Enrollment to a regimen may also be stopped at any time it becomes impossible to achieve 5 of 10 or 13 of 20 successful improvements.</description>
