      RATIONALE: Biological therapies such as lenalidomide use different ways to stimulate the
      immune system and stop cancer cells from growing. Monoclonal antibodies such as rituximab
      can locate cancer cells and either kill them or deliver cancer-killing substances to them
      without harming normal cells. Combining lenalidomide with rituximab may kill more cancer
      cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the how well giving lenalidomide with or without
      rituximab works in treating patients with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic
      leukemia.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the best cytostatic response rate (including complete response, partial
           response, or stable disease) in patients with relapsed or refractory chronic
           lymphocytic leukemia treated with lenalidomide (CC-5013).

      Secondary

        -  Determine the cytostatic response rate in patients who progress on CC-5013 and are then
           treated with CC-5013 and rituximab.

        -  Determine the safety of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Determine time to progression in patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, non-randomized, pilot study.

      Patients receive oral lenalidomide (CC-5013) once daily on days 1-21. Treatment repeats
      every 28 days for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients who achieve complete response (CR) receive 2 additional courses beyond
      CR.

      Patients with disease progression receive oral CC-5013 once daily on days 1-21 and rituximab
      IV on days 1, 8, and 15 during the first treatment course and on days 1 and 15 of all
      subsequent courses. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of
      further disease progression. Patients who achieve CR receive 2 additional courses beyond CR.

      Patients are followed at 1 month and then every 3 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 45 patients will be accrued for this study within 1.5 years.
