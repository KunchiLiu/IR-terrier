    <textblock>
      This pilot study on the impact of a non-commercialism policy in Seattle schools will assess
      and evaluate obesity-related health outcomes of a real-life policy decision, recently voted
      on and adopted by the Seattle School Board. The policy reduces the exposure to advertising
      and other marketing pressures, including those from commercial food vendors.
