      This 6-month study will compare the effectiveness of citalopram (CelexaÂ®), hypericum (St.
      John's Wort), and placebo for the treatment of minor depression.

      Minor depression is highly prevalent, causes substantial morbidity and disability, presents
      a serious risk factor for the development of major depressive disorder, yet is under
      recognized and under treated. Researchers have determined that patients with minor
      depression frequently seek treatment from general practitioners and are often treated with
      prescription antidepressants. There is a need to evaluate the effectiveness of St. John's
      Wort in the management of minor depression. If the proposed study demonstrates the efficacy
      of St. John's Wort and/or citalopram, it will suggest treatment paradigms that can be tested
      and applied in primary care settings.

      Patients who meet screening criteria enter a 2-week washout period (or, for fluoxetine, a
      4-week washout period) during which no psychotropic medication is permitted. Participants
      are then randomly assigned to St. John's Wort, citalopram, or placebo for 12 weeks.
      Participants who respond to treatment by Week 12 continue to take their originally assigned
      double-blind medication for up to 26 weeks. At Week 12, nonresponders to placebo are crossed
      over to 1 of the 2 active treatments. Patients who remain nonresponders to that active
      treatment are crossed over to the alternative active treatment, with the investigator
      maintaining blind status. Participants have study visits at screening, during the washout
      period, at baseline, and every 2 weeks thereafter for the course of the study. At the
      screening visit, Week 12, and Week 20, patients undergo a complete blood count with
      differential and other routine laboratory tests.
