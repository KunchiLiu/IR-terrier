      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as yttrium Y 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan and rituximab,
      can locate cancer cells and either kill them or deliver radioactive cancer-killing
      substances to them without harming normal cells. Combining yttrium Y 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan
      with rituximab may kill more cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining yttrium Y 90 Ibritumomab
      tiuxetan with rituximab in treating patients who have relapsed or refractory diffuse large
      B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the best overall response in patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse
           large B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma treated with yttrium Y 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan and
           rituximab.

        -  Determine the event-free survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study.

        -  Radioimmunotherapy: Patients receive indium In 111 ibritumomab tiuxetan IV over 10
           minutes on day 1 (for imaging only); yttrium Y 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan IV over 10
           minutes on day 8; and rituximab IV over 3-4 hours on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, and 36.

        -  CNS prophylaxis: Patients receive CNS prophylaxis comprising intrathecal (IT)
           methotrexate or IT cytarabine on days 15, 22, 29, and 36 OR IT cytarabine (liposomal)
           on days 15 and 29.

        -  Maintenance rituximab: Patients are assessed for response at week 14. Beginning at
           month 6, patients with stable or responding disease receive maintenance therapy
           comprising rituximab IV over 3-4 hours once weekly for 4 weeks. Maintenance therapy
           repeats every 6 months for 2 years (total of 4 courses) in the absence of disease
           progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
