      The purposes of this are:

        -  To determine the highest doses of Taxol and Navelbine that we can safely give to
           patients;

        -  To determine what kind of side effects are caused by the combination of Taxol,
           Navelbine and G-CSF;

        -  To determine whether the combination of Taxol, Navelbine and G-CSF is more effective
           than standard therapy in treating metastatic breast cancer and prolonging life;
