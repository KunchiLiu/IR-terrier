      To examine the associations of common variation in inflammation/thrombosis genes with
      intermediate quantitative phenotypes and subclinical coronary atherosclerosis in the
      Coronary Artery Risk Factor Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) Study, a large, bi-racial
      cohort study.

      BACKGROUND:

      Atherosclerosis is a major determinant of coronary heart disease and is determined by the
      interplay of genetic and environmental risk factors. Although atherosclerosis tends to
      aggregate in families, it does not exhibit classical Mendelian segregation. Thus, the genes
      that determine an individual's risk of atherosclerosis likely involve multiple sites within
      genes and interactions between genes, all of which define a genetic risk that is modified by
      the host environment.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      The genetic epidemiology study examines the associations of common variation in
      inflammation/thrombosis genes with intermediate quantitative phenotypes and subclinical
      coronary atherosclerosis in the Coronary Artery Risk Factor Development in Young Adults
      (CARDIA) Study, a large, bi-racial cohort study. The set of 25 candidate genes involve
      pathways (cytokines, chemokines, and their receptors; cellular adhesion molecules; and,
      coagulation proteins) and include several receptor-ligand pairs. Using cladistic analysis
      and the resources of the Program in Genomic Applications (PGA), the investigators will
      identify a limited set of single nucleotide polymorphisms (range 3-10 SNPs per gene) that
      characterize common haplotypes in these candidate genes within persons of African descent
      and European descent. DNA from the CARDIA Year 10 examination (n = 3,950 subjects) will be
      genotyped for the selected variants that characterize the common haplotypes. Data on the
      presence of common variants and haplotypes will be incorporated into the CARDIA Study
      database. Levels of two important intermediate phenotypes, fibrinogen and C-reactive protein
      (CRP) were previously determined. Non-invasive assessment of coronary atherosclerosis,
      defined as the presence of coronary artery calcification (CAC), was obtained on CARDIA
      participants at the Year 15 exam. Analyses will be stratified by race/ethnicity and focus on
      the associations of the common haplotypes with fibrinogen, CRP, and CAC measured in early
      adult life. Secondarily, the investigators will explore possible gene-gene and
      gene-environment interactions. The proposed multi-disciplinary collaboration should enhance
      the sensitivity and specificity of efforts to assess the associations of common variation in
      sets of inflammation/thrombosis candidate genes and cardiovascular risk in young adults.
