  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients have high-risk neuroblastoma, a form of cancer typically found in children. The
      patients previously participated in a gene transfer research study using special immune
      cells. More information about that study follows.

      The body has different ways of fighting infection and disease. No one way seems perfect for
      fighting cancers. This research study combines two different ways of fighting disease,
      antibodies and T cells, hoping that they will work together. Antibodies are types of
      proteins that protect the body from bacterial and other infections. T cells, also called
      cytotoxic T lymphocytes or CTLs, are special infection-fighting blood cells that can kill
      some tumor cells. Both antibodies and T cells have been used to treat patients with cancers
      and while they have shown promise, they have not been strong enough to cure most patients.

      The antibody used in this study is called 14g2a. It first came from mice that have developed
      immunity to human neuroblastoma. This antibody sticks to neuroblastoma cells because of a
      substance on the outside of these cells called GD2. 14g2a and other antibodies that bind to
      GD2 have been used to treat people with neuroblastoma. For this study 14g2a has been changed
      so that instead of floating free in the blood, it is now joined to T cells. When an antibody
      is joined to a T cell in this way it is called a chimeric receptor.

      T lymphocytes or CTLs can kill tumor cells but there normally are not enough of them to kill
      all tumor cells. Some researchers have taken T cells from a person's blood, grown more of
      them in the laboratory and then given them back to the patient. Sometimes an antibody or
      chimeric receptor is attached to these T cells to help them bind to tumor cells. These
      chimeric receptor-T cells seem to kill some of the tumor, but they don't last very long in
      the body and so the tumor eventually comes back. We have found that T cells that are also
      trained to recognize the virus that causes infectious mononucleosis, Epstein Barr Virus
      (EBV), can stay in the blood stream for many years. By joining the 14g2a antibody to the
      CTLs that recognize EBV, we believe we will make a cell that can last a long time in the
      body (because they are EBV-specific) and recognize and kill neuroblastoma cells (because an
      antibody that can recognize these cells has been placed on their surface).

      Patients received treatment with the immune cells described above. They may want to receive
      an additional dose of these cells. This is being offered as an option because their
      neuroblastoma has returned and they have enough cells remaining to provide the patients with
      an additional dose. These 14g2a antibody CTLs are an investigational product not approved by
      the Food and Drug Administration.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Earlier, the patient gave us blood to make 14g2a chimeric receptor-T cells and 14g2a
      chimeric receptor-EBV CTLs in the laboratory. These cells were grown and frozen for the
      patient. The patient received treatment with these cells. However, there are enough cells
      remaining that we are able to offer to treat the patient with an additional dose if they
      would like.

      As with the original treatment, the patient will be given an injection of cells into the
      vein through and IV. Before the injection is received, the patient will be given a dose of
      Benadryl and Tylenol. The injection will take about 2 minutes. We will follow the patient in
      the clinic after the injection for 3 hours. The treatment will be given by the Center for
      Cell and Gene Therapy at Texas Children's Hospital.

      Medical tests before treatment--

      Before being treated, the patient will receive a series of standard medical tests:

        -  Physical exam

        -  Blood tests to measure blood cells, kidney and liver function

        -  Measurements of tumor by scans and bone marrow studies if the bone marrow may show
           evidence of disease

      Medical tests during and after treatment:

      The patient will receive standard medical tests when they are getting the infusions and
      after:

        -  Physical exams

        -  Blood tests to measure blood cells, kidney and liver function

        -  Measurements of tumor by scans and bone marrow studies if the bone marrow had evidence
           of disease 6 weeks after each infusion

      Because the patient has received cells with a new gene in them the patient will be followed
      for a total of 15 years to see if there are any long term side effects of gene transfer. If
      they have a procedure related to their tumor (for example a biopsy or tumor resection), we
      will request permission to obtain a tissue sample. This will help investigators learn more
      about T cell and CTL treatment of neuroblastoma. In the event of death, we will request
      permission to perform an autopsy to learn more about the effects of these infusions on the
      disease.
