    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil works in
      preventing graft-versus-host disease in patients who have undergone total-body irradiation
      (TBI) with or without fludarabine phosphate followed by donor peripheral blood stem cell
      transplant for hematologic cancer. Giving low doses of chemotherapy, such as fludarabine
      phosphate, and TBI before a donor peripheral blood stem cell transplant helps stop the
      growth of cancer cells. It also stops the patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's
      stem cells. The donated stem cells may replace the patient's immune system and help destroy
      any remaining cancer cells (graft-versus-tumor effect). Sometimes the transplanted cells
      from a donor can also make an immune response against the body's normal cells. Giving
      tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil after the transplant may stop this from happening.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the incidence of grade III/IV graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after
      conditioning with 200 centigray (cGy) TBI alone or Fludarabine (fludarabine phosphate)/200
      cGy TBI followed by tacrolimus (Tac)/mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) immunosuppression in
      patients with hematologic malignancies.

      II. To estimate the incidence of chronic extensive GVHD.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the incidences of graft rejection.

      II. To estimate overall survival 1-year after conditioning.

      III. To evaluate the incidences of grades II-IV acute GVHD.

      IV. To evaluate the rates of disease progression and/or relapse-related mortality.

      V. To estimate the rate and duration of steroid use for the treatment of chronic GVHD.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I (nonmyeloablative conditioning with fludarabine phosphate and TBI): Patients receive
      fludarabine phosphate intravenously (IV) on days -4 to -2 and undergo TBI on day 0.

      ARM II (nonmyeloablative conditioning with TBI): Patients undergo TBI on day 0.

      All patients then undergo allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation on day 0 and
      receive tacrolimus orally (PO) every 12 hours on days -3 to 180, with taper on day 56, or
      tacrolimus IV if unable to tolerate PO; and mycophenolate mofetil PO every 12 hours on days
      0-27 or mycophenolate mofetil IV if unable to tolerate PO.

      Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for 2 years and
      then annually for 3 years.

             (serum creatinine &gt; 2.0) will likely have further compromise in renal function and
             may require hemodialysis (which may be permanent) due to the need to maintain
             adequate serum tacrolimus levels

          -  DONOR: Related donor who is HLA genotypically identical at least at one haplotype and
             may be phenotypically or genotypically identical at the allele level at HLA-A, -B,
             -C, -DRB1, and -DQB1

          -  DONOR: Donor must consent to filgrastim (G-CSF) administration and leukapheresis

          -  DONOR: Donor must have adequate veins for leukapheresis or agree to placement of
             central venous catheter (femoral, subclavian)

          -  Patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML)

          -  Life expectancy severely limited by diseases other than malignancy

          -  Any current central nervous system (CNS) involvement with disease refractory to
             intrathecal chemotherapy

          -  Presence of circulating leukemic blasts (in the peripheral blood) detected by
             standard pathology for patients with AML, ALL or CML

          -  Fertile men or women unwilling to use contraceptives during and for up to 12 months
             post treatment

          -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients

          -  Patients with active non-hematologic malignancies (except non-melanoma skin cancers);
             this exclusion does not apply to patients with non-hematologic malignancies that do
             not require therapy

          -  Patients with a history of non-hematologic malignancies (except non-melanoma skin
             cancers) currently in a complete remission, who are less than 5 years from the time
             of complete remission, and have a &gt; 20% risk of disease recurrence; this exclusion
             does not apply to patients with non-hematologic malignancies that do not require
             therapy

          -  Fungal pneumonia with radiological progression after receipt of amphotericin
             formulation or mold-active azoles for greater than 1 month

          -  Karnofsky score &lt; 50 for adult patients

          -  Lansky-Play performance score &lt; 50 for pediatric patients

          -  Symptomatic coronary artery disease or ejection fraction &lt; 35% or other cardiac
             failure requiring therapy (or, if unable to obtain ejection fraction, shortening
             fraction of &lt; 26%); ejection fraction is required if age &gt; 50 years or there is a
             history of anthracycline exposure or history of cardiac disease; patients with a
             shortening fraction &lt; 26% may be enrolled if approved by a cardiologist

          -  Poorly controlled hypertension

          -  Diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) &lt; 30%, total lung capacity
             (TLC) &lt; 30%, forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) &lt; 30% and/or receiving
             supplementary continuous oxygen; the FHCRC principal investigator (PI) of the study
             must approve enrollment of all patients with pulmonary nodules

          -  Liver function abnormalities: Patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of liver
             disease would be evaluated for the cause of liver disease, its clinical severity in
             terms of liver function, and the degree of portal hypertension; patients will be
             excluded if they are found to have fulminant liver failure, cirrhosis of the liver
             with evidence of portal hypertension or bridging fibrosis, alcoholic hepatitis,
             esophageal varices, a history of bleeding esophageal varices, hepatic encephalopathy,
             uncorrectable hepatic synthetic dysfunction evinced by prolongation of the
             prothrombin time, ascites related to portal hypertension, bacterial or fungal liver
             abscess, biliary obstruction, chronic viral hepatitis with total serum bilirubin &gt; 3
             mg/dL, and symptomatic biliary disease

          -  Patients with active bacterial or fungal infections unresponsive to medical therapy

          -  DONOR: Age less than 12 years

          -  DONOR: Identical twin
