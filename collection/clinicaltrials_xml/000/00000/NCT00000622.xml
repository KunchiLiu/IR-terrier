      The purpose of this study is to evaluate current and novel therapies and management
      strategies for children with asthma. The emphasis is on clinical trials that help identify
      optimal therapy for children with different asthma phenotypes, genotypes, and ethnic
      backgrounds and children at different developmental stages.

      BACKGROUND:

      Asthma is a complex disease that often starts early in life. Exacerbations can be triggered
      by a number of agents such as allergens, respiratory infections, environmental tobacco smoke
      and pollutants, drugs, chemicals, exercise, cold air, infections, and strong emotion, making
      asthma therapy difficult and sometimes complicated. Multiple medications are often required
      to treat symptoms (bronchodilator agents such as beta-2 adrenergic agonists, theophylline,
      and anticholinergics) as well as the underlying disease process (anti-inflammatory agents
      such as inhaled and systemic corticosteroids, cromolyn sodium and nedocromil, and
      leukotriene modifiers).

      The prevalence of asthma is increasing in all age groups, but most particularly in children
      under the age of 18 years. In 1992, the prevalence of self-reported asthma among persons
      under 18 years of age was 7.2 percent, compared to 5.1 percent among all persons. The most
      rapid increase in asthma has occurred in children under 5 years old, with rates increasing
      over 160 percent over the past 15 years. Among all ages, over 450,000 hospitalizations,
      5,000 deaths, and more than 100 million days of restricted activity are due to asthma every
      year. Yet the burden of asthma disproportionately affects children. For example, asthma
      hospitalization rates are highest among persons age 0 to 4 years and have increased over 28
      percent in the last 15 years; mortality rates increased faster among those aged 5 to 12
      years than among those aged 15 to 34 years, and neither changes in disease coding nor
      improved recognition of asthma fully explain these increases. Nearly one-third of children
      restrict their activities due to asthma, including participation in physical education and
      sports.

      Despite major advances in understanding the etiology and pathophysiology of asthma and the
      development of new therapeutic modalities to control symptoms and prevent exacerbations,
      effective therapies are not widely used in the pediatric health care community. Furthermore,
      the long-term effects and side effects of asthma medications in children, especially
      children under the age of 12 years, are not well understood. Much remains to be learned
      about the impact of asthma therapy at different ages and at different points in the natural
      history of the asthma in altering the progression, chronicity, or severity of the disease.

      There is an urgent need to rapidly evaluate new and existing therapeutic approaches for
      children with asthma and to disseminate the findings to health care professionals, patients,
      and the public. There are several reasons why a pediatric asthma clinical research network
      will accelerate clinical research and meet this need. The highly variable and sometimes
      complicated clinical manifestations of asthma often make it difficult to accumulate a large
      number of comparable patients in one center. Furthermore, uniformity in treatment protocols
      may reduce the number of patients needed at each clinical center. Also, the network
      mechanism will help pool the necessary clinical expertise and administrative resources to
      facilitate the conduct of multiple and novel therapeutic trials in a timely, efficient
      manner. This, in turn, would promote rapid dissemination of research findings to health care
      professionals.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      This is a multicenter study performing multiple therapeutic trials for children with asthma.
      One outcome of the Network will be to promote rapid dissemination of the findings from these
      clinical studies to the health care community. Therapeutic trials may involve
      investigational drugs, drugs already approved but not currently used in childhood asthma,
      and drugs currently used in the treatment of asthma. The Network ends in May 2009.

      The following protocols are under way or have been completed:

      Prevention of Early Asthma in Kids (PEAK) began recruitment in January 2001 and evaluated
      whether administering inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) to 24- to 48-month-old children at risk
      of developing asthma prevented the development of persistent asthma. All subjects were
      expected to be randomized prior to December 2001 with study completion by September 2004.
      The study was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel comparison of inhaled
      fluticasone to placebo. There was a 4-week run-in period to qualify and characterize
      children. A total of 285 children were randomized to one of two treatment groups; one
      receiving active treatment, the other placebo. The study was based on a continuous treatment
      schedule for a period of 24 months, followed by an observation period of 1 year during which
      the main outcomes were assessed. The primary outcome measure was the number of asthma-free
      days. Secondary outcomes included number of exacerbations, use of asthma medications, and
      lung function. The study has three specific objectives: (1) to assess if chronic therapy
      with ICS initiated in children 4 years or less at high risk of developing asthma can prevent
      the development of significant asthma at 4 to 6 years of age; (2) to determine if asthma
      therapy as described above can prevent both losses in lung function and the development of
      bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) associated with early onset asthma; and (3) to assess
      potential side effects that may be associated with long-term use of inhaled steroids in
      early life. PEAK study outcomes were presented at the 2005 annual meetings of the American
      Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology and the American Thoracic Society. A manuscript
      has been submitted for publication by the New England Journal of Medicine.

      Characterizing the Response to Leukotriene Antagonist and Inhaled Corticosteroids (CLIC)
      began in August 2001 in children ages 6 to 17 with mild to moderate asthma. The study was a
      randomized, double-blind crossover comparing montelukast to inhaled fluticasone propionate
      in mild-to-moderate persistent asthma in 144 children. There was a 5- to 10-day run-in
      period to qualify and characterize patients. Children were randomized to one of two
      crossover treatment sequences with 8-week periods of either an active ICS, fluticasone
      propionate, or an active leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA), montelukast. During the
      active treatment period for one drug, the participant received a placebo for the alternative
      drug. The first 4 weeks of the second treatment period were considered a sufficient period
      for washout of study medication used in the first period of each treatment sequence. The two
      crossover sequences were stratified according to clinical center, age category, and FEV1
      percent predicted category by using the minimization method of randomization. Outcome
      parameters were determined every 4 weeks during the 16-week treatment phase. The primary
      outcome measure was percentage change in prebronchodilator FEVI from baseline to the end of
      each treatment period. Results were published in the February 2005 issue of the Journal of
      Allergy and Clinical Immunology.

      Acute Intervention Management Strategies (AIMS) is a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy,
      placebo-controlled parallel comparison study to determine if the initiation of an ICS or
      LTRA with an inhaled beta2-agonist (albuterol) at the onset of respiratory tract illness
      (RTI)-associated symptoms increases the proportion of symptom-free days over the entire
      treatment period during the 5- to 9-month study period. There will be a 2-week period to
      qualify and characterize children who at this time have no lower respiratory tract symptoms
      other than mild cough. A total of 244 children were randomized to one of three treatment
      groups and followed for the remainder of the fall-winter-early spring season, during which
      participants received one of the following regimens for 7 days at the first sign of
      RTI-associated symptoms: (1) active ICS and placebo LTRA and albuterol inhalation treatments
      four times daily; (2) active LTRA and placebo ICS and albuterol inhalation treatment four
      times daily; or (3) placebo ICS and placebo LTRA and albuterol inhalation treatments four
      times daily.

      Pediatric Asthma Controller Trial (PACT) is a study to determine the comparative
      effectiveness of ICS, an LTRA, or a combination medication of ICS and long-acting
      beta2-agonist in children with mild asthma. The study addresses a critical question facing
      primary care physicians about the optimal choice for initiating daily long-term treatment in
      children. The primary study outcome is the percentage of days without asthma during the
      12-month treatment period. Recruitment began in August 2002. A total of 300 children were
      assigned to one of three active treatment arms for 12 months: active ICS, a combination of
      active ICS and salmeterol, or active montelukast (LTRA). Major outcomes on the follow-up of
      277 children were presented in May 2005 at the American Thoracic Society meeting.
