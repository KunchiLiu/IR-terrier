      RATIONALE: Vaccines made from cancer cells may make the body build an immune response to
      kill cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of vaccine therapy in treating patients
      who have acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the feasibility of generating a vaccine comprising CD40-activated autologous
           leukemic cells for patients with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).

        -  Determine the feasibility of this regimen in patients with B-cell ALL.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Assess the ALL-specific immunity in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Assess the generation of immunity to control antigens in patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  Determine, in a preliminary manner, the effect of this regimen on tumor response in
           these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Autologous acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells are harvested, cultured with CD40
      ligand, pulsed with keyhole limpet hemocyanin, and then irradiated.

      Beginning a minimum of 1 week after tumor cell collection, patients receive vaccination with
      autologous CD40-activated ALL cells subcutaneously and intradermally on weeks 0, 2, 4, and 6
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of 4
      vaccinations, patients who have more aliquots of vaccine available from the initial tumor
      cell collection may receive additional vaccinations every 2 weeks in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Vaccination may be postponed for a maximum of 1 year
      after tumor cell collection in patients who receive chemotherapy and/or allogeneic stem cell
      transplantation.

      Patients are followed at approximately 2 months after last vaccination.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients will be accrued for this study.
