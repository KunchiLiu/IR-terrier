      This study will evaluate the effectiveness of both drug and non-drug treatments in
      preventing depression after a stroke.

    <textblock>
      The development of depression after a stroke is a serious condition that can have negative
      effects on thought, emotions, and overall daily functioning, particularly in the first year
      following the stroke. Evidence suggests that antidepressants may be used to prevent
      post-stroke depression. This study will treat nondepressed stroke patients with
      antidepressants or problem solving therapy (PST) to determine the most effective treatments
      for preventing depression.

      Participants in this study will be randomly assigned to receive PST, escitalopram, or
      placebo (an inactive pill) for 12 months. Participants who display depressive symptoms for 2
      weeks or more will be removed from the study. After 12 months, treatment will be
      discontinued and participants will be monitored for an additional 6 months.
