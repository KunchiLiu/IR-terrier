    <textblock>
      This clinical trial studies how well giving fludarabine phosphate together with total-body
      irradiation (TBI) before donor peripheral blood stem cell transplant works in treating
      patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic leukemia. Giving low doses
      of chemotherapy, such as fludarabine phosphate, and TBI before a donor peripheral blood stem
      cell transplant helps stop the growth of cancer cells. Giving chemotherapy before or after
      peripheral blood stem cell transplant also stops the patient's immune system from rejecting
      the donor's stem cells. The donated stem cells may replace the patient's immune cells and
      help destroy any remaining cancer cells (graft-versus-tumor effect). Sometimes the
      transplanted cells from a donor can also make an immune response against the body's normal
      cells. Giving cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil before and after the transplant may
      stop this from happening.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether nonmyeloablative allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
      (HSCT) from matched-related donors can improve the probability of survival 18 months after
      treatment for fludarabine (fludarabine phosphate)-refractory, fludarabine phosphate,
      cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (FCR)-failed, or del 17p chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)
      beyond that observed in historical controls (30%).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the rate of relapse with allogeneic HSCT using nonmyeloablative conditioning
      for patients with fludarabine-refractory, FCR-failed, or del 17p CLL compared with
      historical data on autologous HSCT.

      II. To estimate the incidence of grade 2-4 acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and
      chronic GVHD in patients with CLL treated with low-dose TBI, fludarabine, peripheral blood
      stem cell (PBSC) infusion and immunosuppression with cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil.

      III. To characterize the rate and types of infections with this regimen.

      IV. To estimate the rate of transplant-related mortality in the first 200 days.

      OUTLINE:

      NONMYELOABLATIVE CONDITIONING: Patients receive fludarabine phosphate intravenously (IV) on
      days -4 to -2 and TBI on day 0.

      TRANSPLANT: Patients undergo allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplant on day 0.

      GVHD PROPHYLAXIS: Patients receive cyclosporine orally (PO) every 12 hours on days -3 to 180
      with taper beginning on day 56 and mycophenolate mofetil PO every 12 hours on days 0-27.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 12 and 18 months and then
      annually for 5 years.
