      RATIONALE: Antineoplastons are naturally-occurring substances that may also be made in the
      laboratory. Antineoplastons may inhibit the growth of cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial studies the effectiveness of antineoplaston therapy in treating
      patients who have metastatic, recurrent, or refractory primitive neuroectodermal tumors.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the safety and possible effectiveness of antineoplastons A10 and AS2-1 in
           patients with incurable primitive neuroectodermal tumors outside the central nervous
           system.

        -  Describe response, tolerance to, and side effects of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label study.

      Patients receive gradually escalating doses of antineoplastons A10 and AS2-1 by intravenous
      injection 6 times daily until the maximum tolerated dose is reached.

      Treatment continues for 2 months in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease
      progression. Patients achieving complete response (CR) continue treatment for an additional
      8 months after reaching CR.

      Tumors are measured every 2 months for 1 year and then every 3 months for 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study.
