      RATIONALE: Antineoplastons are naturally-occurring substances that may also be made in the
      laboratory. Antineoplastons may inhibit the growth of cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well antineoplaston therapy works in treating
      patients with progressive or recurrent stage IV melanoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the safety and possible effectiveness of antineoplastons A10 and AS2-1 in
           patients with progressive or recurrent stage IV melanoma.

        -  Describe response, tolerance to, and side effects of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open label study.

      Patients receive gradually escalating doses of antineoplaston A10 and antineoplaston AS2-1
      by intravenous injection 6 times daily until the maximum tolerated dose is reached.

      Treatment continues for at least 3 months in the absence of toxicity and disease
      progression. Patients achieving complete response (CR) continue treatment for an additional
      8 months after reaching CR.

      Tumors are measured every 2 months for the first year and every 3 months for the second
      year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study.
