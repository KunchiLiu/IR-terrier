      RATIONALE: Antineoplastons are naturally occurring substances that may also be made in the
      laboratory. Antineoplastons may inhibit the growth of cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial studies the effectiveness of antineoplaston therapy in treating
      patients who have metastatic or unresectable colon cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the antitumor activity of antineoplastons A10 and AS2-1 in patients with
           adenocarcinoma of the colon by determining the proportion of patients who experience an
           objective tumor response.

        -  Evaluate the response to, tolerance to, and side effects of this regimen in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive gradually escalating doses of antineoplaston A10 and
      antineoplaston AS2-1 by intravenous injection 6 times daily until the maximum tolerated dose
      is reached. Treatment continues for at least 12 months in the absence of disease
      progression. Patients achieving complete response (CR) continue treatment for at least 8
      months after reaching CR.

      Tumors are measured at least every 2 months for 1 year and then every 3 months for 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study.
