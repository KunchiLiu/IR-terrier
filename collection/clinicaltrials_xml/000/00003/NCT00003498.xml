      RATIONALE: Antineoplastons are naturally-occurring substances that may also be made in the
      laboratory. Antineoplastons may inhibit the growth of cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well antineoplaston therapy works in treating
      patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma that has not responded to high-dose chemotherapy and
      bone marrow transplantation.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the safety and possible effectiveness of antineoplastons A10 and AS2-1 in
           patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who have failed high-dose chemotherapy and bone
           marrow transplantation.

        -  Describe the response to, tolerance to, and side effects of this regimen in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label study.

      Patients receive gradually escalating doses of intravenous antineoplaston A10 and
      antineoplaston AS2-1 6 times per day until the maximum tolerated dose is reached. Treatment
      continues for at least 12 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. After 12 months, patients with responding or stable disease may continue
      treatment.

      Tumors are measured every 8 weeks for 6 months, every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months
      for years 3 and 4, and then annually for years 5 and 6.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study.
