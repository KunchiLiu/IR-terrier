      RATIONALE: Antineoplastons are naturally occurring substances that may also be made in the
      laboratory. Antineoplastons may inhibit the growth of cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial studies the effectiveness of antineoplaston capsules in
      treating patients who have stage IV non-small cell lung cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Demonstrate the antitumor activity of antineoplaston A10 and AS2-1 capsules in patients
           with non-small cell lung cancer by determining the proportion of patients who
           experience an objective tumor response.

        -  Evaluate the adverse effects of and tolerance to this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label study.

      Patients receive antineoplaston A10 and AS2-1 capsules orally six to seven times a day.
      Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Tumors are measured every 4 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 2 years, and then
      annually for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study.
