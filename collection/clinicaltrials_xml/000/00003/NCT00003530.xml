      RATIONALE: Antineoplastons are naturally occurring substances that may also be made in the
      laboratory. Antineoplastons may inhibit the growth of cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial studies the effectiveness of antineoplaston therapy in treating
      patients who have primary liver cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the response, tolerance to, and side effects of antineoplaston A10 in
           patients with incurable primary liver cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is an open label study.

      Patients receive gradually increasing doses of antineoplaston A10 by arterial infusion daily
      until the final dose level is reached.

      Therapy continues for at least 2 months in the absence of unacceptable toxicity and disease
      progression. Patients achieving complete response (CR) continue treatment for an additional
      2 months after reaching CR.

      Tumors are measured every month for the first 2 months, every 2 months for the first year,
      and every 3 months for the second year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study.
