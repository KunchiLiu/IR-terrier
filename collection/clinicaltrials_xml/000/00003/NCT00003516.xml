      RATIONALE: Antineoplastons are naturally occurring substances that may also be made in the
      laboratory. Antineoplastons may inhibit the growth of cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial studies the effectiveness of antineoplaston therapy in treating
      patients who have stage III or stage IV prostate cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the antitumor activity of antineoplaston A10 and AS2-1 capsules in patients
           with stage III or IV adenocarcinoma of the prostate by determining the proportion of
           patients who experience an objective response.

        -  Evaluate the adverse effects of and tolerance to this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label study.

      Patients receive gradually escalating doses of antineoplaston A10 and antineoplaston AS2-1
      capsules 6 to 7 times a day until the maximum tolerated dose is reached. Treatment continues
      for at least 3 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Tumors are measured every 4 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 2 years, and then
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study.
