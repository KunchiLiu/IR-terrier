    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well giving combination chemotherapy and peripheral blood
      stem cell transplant followed by aldesleukin and sargramostim works in treating patients
      with inflammatory stage IIIB or metastatic stage IV breast cancer. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy, such as busulfan, melphalan, and thiotepa, work in different ways to stop the
      growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. A
      peripheral stem cell transplant may be able to replace blood-forming cells that were
      destroyed by chemotherapy. This may allow more chemotherapy to be given so that more tumor
      cells are killed. Aldesleukin may stimulate the white blood cells to kill breast cancer
      cells. Giving aldesleukin together with sargramostim may kill more tumor cells

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the event-free survival and survival of patients treated for inflammatory
      (Stage IIIb) and responsive stage IV breast cancer with BUMELTT and PBSC support and low
      dose immunotherapy with IL2 and GM-CSF.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      II. To determine the toxicity of a combination of low-dose IL-2 and GM-CSF in patients
      following HDC with BUMELTT and PBSC support.

      OUTLINE:

      PREPARATIVE REGIMEN: Patients receive busulfan orally (PO) once every 6 hours on days -8,
      -7, and -6; melphalan IV over 30 minutes on days -5 and -4; and thiotepa IV over 2 hours on
      days -3 and -2.

      TRANSPLANTATION: Patients undergo autologous peripheral blood stem cell infusion on day 0.

      POST-TRANSPLANT THERAPY: All patients receive tamoxifen citrate* PO once daily beginning
      prior to aldesleukin (IL-2) and sargramostim (GM-CSF) therapy and continuing for 5 years or
      until relapse (estrogen receptor [ER]- or progesterone receptor [PR]-positive patients) OR
      until completion of IL-2/GM-CSF therapy (ER-negative or PR-negative patients). Eligible
      patients receive IL-2 subcutaneously (SC) daily and GM-CSF SC 3 times weekly for 12 weeks
      beginning 30-100 days after transplantation. Patients may receive radiotherapy after
      completion of IL-2/GM-CSF treatment if no prior radiotherapy was given before
      transplantation.

      *Stage IV patients not receiving IL-2/GM-CSF therapy who received tamoxifen citrate as part
      of adjuvant therapy and subsequently failed, receive oral anastrozole once daily for 5 years
      or until progression instead of tamoxifen.

      [*For postmenopausal patients, the choice and duration of hormonal therapy given in addition
      to or an alternative to tamoxifen therapy will be at the physician's discretion]

      Patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then
      annually thereafter.
