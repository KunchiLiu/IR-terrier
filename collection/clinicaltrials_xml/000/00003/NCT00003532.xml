      RATIONALE: Antineoplastons are naturally-occurring substances that may also be made in the
      laboratory. Antineoplastons may inhibit the growth of cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial studies the effectiveness of antineoplaston therapy in treating
      patients who have stage III or stage IV ovarian cancer

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Study the safety and possible effectiveness of antineoplastons A10 and AS2-1 in
           patients with incurable stage III or IV ovarian cancer.

        -  Describe response to, tolerance to, and side effects of this regimen in this patient
           population.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label study.

      Patients receive gradually escalating doses of antineoplaston A10 and antineoplaston AS2-1
      by intravenous injection 6 times daily until the maximum tolerated dose level is reached.

      Treatment continues for at least 3 months in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease
      progression. Patients achieving complete response (CR) continue treatment for an additional
      8 months after achieving CR.

      Tumors are measured every 2 months for 1 year and then every 3 months for 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study.
