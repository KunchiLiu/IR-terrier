      RATIONALE: Antineoplastons are naturally-occurring substances that may also be made in the
      laboratory. Antineoplastons may inhibit the growth of cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial studies the effectiveness of antineoplaston therapy in treating
      patients who have refractory or recurrent intermediate-grade stage II, stage III, or stage
      IV non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the safety and possible effectiveness of antineoplastons A10 and AS2-1 in
           patients with serious or immediately life threatening refractory or recurrent
           intermediate grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

        -  Describe response to, tolerance to, and side effects of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label study.

      Patients receive gradually escalating doses of antineoplaston A10 and antineoplaston AS2-1
      by intravenous injection 6 times daily until the maximum tolerated dose is reached.
      Treatment continues for 12 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients achieving complete response, partial response, or stable disease continue
      treatment.

      Tumors are measured at least every 8 weeks for 6 months, every 3 months for 1.5 years, every
      6 months for 2 years, and then annually for 2 years.

      Patients are followed for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS:

          -  Histologically proven stage II, III, or IV intermediate-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma
             that has not responded to or has relapsed after a standard primary chemotherapy
             regimen plus at least 1 standard second-line salvage chemotherapy regimen NOTE: A new
             classification scheme for adult non-Hodgkin's lymphoma has been adopted by PDQ. The
             terminology of &quot;indolent&quot; or &quot;aggressive&quot; lymphoma will replace the former
             terminology of &quot;low&quot;, &quot;intermediate&quot;, or &quot;high&quot; grade lymphoma. However, this
             protocol uses the former terminology.

        PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS:
