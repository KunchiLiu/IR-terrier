      RATIONALE: Antineoplastons are naturally-occurring substances that may also be made in the
      laboratory. Antineoplastons may inhibit the growth of cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial studies the effectiveness of antineoplaston therapy in treating
      patients who have advanced head and neck cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Provide treatment with antineoplastons A10 and AS2-1 to patients with incurable cancer
           of the head and neck.

        -  Describe response to, tolerance to, and side effects of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label study.

      Patients receive gradually escalating doses of antineoplaston A10 and antineoplaston AS2-1
      by intravenous injection six times per day until the maximum tolerated dose is reached.

      Treatment continues for at least 2 months in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. After 2 months, patients with stable or responding disease may
      continue treatment. Patients achieving complete response (CR) continue treatment for 8
      months beyond CR.

      Tumors are measured every 2 months for 1 year and then every 3 months for 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study.
