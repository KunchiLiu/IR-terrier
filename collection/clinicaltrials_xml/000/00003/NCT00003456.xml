      RATIONALE: Antineoplastons are naturally-occurring substances that may also be made in the
      laboratory. Antineoplastons may inhibit the growth of cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial studies the effectiveness of antineoplaston therapy in treating
      patients who have glioblastoma multiforme.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the objective response rate to escalating doses of antineoplastons A10 and
           AS2-1 in patients with glioblastoma multiforme.

        -  Assess tolerance to and side effects of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive gradually escalating doses of intravenous antineoplaston A10 and
      antineoplaston AS2-1 6 times daily until the maximum tolerated dose is reached. Treatment
      continues for at least 2 months in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease
      progression. Patients achieving complete response (CR) continue treatment for an additional
      8 months after CR.

      Tumors are measured after 1 month, every 1-2 months for 2 years, every 3 months for 1 year,
      every 4 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 1 year, and then annually thereafter.
