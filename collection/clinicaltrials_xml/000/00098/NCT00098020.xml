  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Retinoids are analogues of vitamin A that regulate cellular differentiation, leading to
      therapeutic use in skin disease and malignancy. In animal models of kidney disease,
      retinoids restore podocyte phenotype toward normal and reduce proteinuria. The objective of
      this phase II trial is to evaluate safety and develop preliminary evidence of efficacy of
      retinoid treatment in patients with podocyte disease. The study is an open-label trial of
      isotretinoin (13-cis retinoic acid). The study will be performed under the auspices of an
      IND from the FDA. We will enroll 10 adult patients with biopsy-proven minimal change disease
      (MCD), focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), or collapsing glomerulopathy (CG).
      Inclusion criteria will include a prior trial of immunosuppressive therapy and proteinuria
      greater than or equal to 3.5 g/d while on angiotensin antagonist therapy.

      The duration of the trial will be 6 months with possible additional 6-month extension for
      patients who only develop partial response (PR) or limited response (LR). Those who have
      complete response (CR) will continue the treatment for one additional month, for no more
      than 7 months total. Non-responders will stop at the end of 6 months. The primary clinical
      endpoint will be reduction in proteinuria as compared to the baseline value assessed by
      paired t test. The secondary clinical endpoints will be the fraction of patients who achieve
      (CR) or (PR) at 6 months and at one year, confirmed on urine collections four weeks apart.
      Retinoid therapy will be discontinued at the time a CR is confirmed, one month after the
      first detection of CR. Follow-up will last one year after cessation of drug therapy.
      Patients who have had CR or PR, but experience a relapse with greater than 3.5 g/d
      proteinuria during follow-up will be eligible for further retinoid therapy.

      All Participants will have an option of undergoing two research kidney biopsies: 1) at
      baseline, unless renal biopsy has been done within 24 weeks of enrollment and 2) when the
      diagnosis of CR or increased proteinuria is confirmed or alternatively upon completing 6
      months of therapy (patients who exit the trial before 6 months due to non-renal adverse
      events will not undergo renal biopsy) or; 3) when one year of therapy is completed for those
      undergoing 6-month extension. Histologic endpoints will include change in linear extent
      podocyte foot process effacement, extent of podocyte proliferation, and expression of
      podocyte genes at the RNA and protein levels. Laboratory endpoints will include serum and
      urine cytokine levels and urine levels of podocyte proteins, including nephrin. Toxicity
      screening will include serum and urine chemistries, psychological profiles, radiographic
      films of cervical, thoracic spines and calcanei, and bone mass assessment with dual photon
      excitation absorptiometry (DEXA) at spine and hip.

      Patients who have had a CR or PR but experience a relapse with &gt;2.0g/g proteinuria during
      follow-up will be eligible for further retinoid therapy. Patients will undergo a renal
      biopsy prior to initiating therapy, in order to evaluate the extent of glomerular injury and
      interstitial fibrosis, unless they have had a kidney biopsy within the preceding 24 months
      that is available for review. Laboratory endpoints will include serum and urine cytokine
      levels and urine levels of podocyte proteins, including nephrin. Toxicity screening will
      include serum and urine chemistries, psychological profiles, radiographic films of cervical,
      thoracic spines and calcanei, and bone mass assessment with dual photon excitation

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Patients with podocyte diseases, MCD, FSGS (including primary, secondary, and
             adaptive variants), and CG (including HIV-associated variant), who meet the following
             criteria:

             --An adequate renal biopsy, defined as having minimum 10 glomeruli for light
             microscopy and minimum 3 glomeruli for electron microscopy, unless the podocyte
             disease is diagnostic on fewer glomeruli. Patients who have non-diagnostic or
             technically inadequate biopsies will be offered the opportunity to undergo a research
             biopsy to determine eligibility. For some patients who have had a non-diagnostic or
             technically inadequate biopsy, a repeat renal biopsy may be clinically indicated in
             an effort to diagnose and treat a potentially serious kidney disease.

          -  Greater than or equal to 16 years of age. The rationale for excluding younger
             children is that retinoids may carry greater toxicity in children, as there are
             reports of premature epiphyseal closure, development of slender long bones, and
             periostial thickening.

          -  Prior treatment with at least two immunosuppressive agents that have been shown to
             induce remission in MCD and FSGS: glucocorticoids, cyclosporine, tacrolimus,
             cyclophosphamide, chlorambucil, and mycophenolate mofetil. Therapy with each agent
             must last at least 8 weeks. Exemptions will be made for those with contraindications
             to these medications or those who cannot tolerate these medications. The rationale is
             to recruit patients who have failed conventional therapy. All patients will be off
             immunosuppression for at least 4 weeks before starting retiniods in order to avoid a
             confounding effect.

          -  Three first void urine protein/creatinine ratios &gt; 2 g/g obtained within one month
             prior to enrolling in the study. These urine collections will be obtained after the
             patient has been on a stable dose of ACE inhibitor or ARB for at least 4 weeks (the
             maximal antiproteinuric effect of these medications occurs after 4 weeks). The
             rationale is that patients with nephrotic-range proteinuria are at high risk for
             progressive renal disease, justifying participation in a clinical trial with novel
             agents. Patients with steroid-sensitive frequently relapsing MCD will not be required
             to have used ACE inhibitor or ARB, as steroids alone are typically sufficient therapy
             to induce remission.

          -  If hypertensive: blood pressure of less than or equal to 140/90 on a stable dose of
             ACE inhibitor or ARB for at least 1 month or greater than or equal to 75 percent of
             measurements before the entry of the study. The rationale is that uncontrolled
             hypertension can exacerbate proteinuria.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Pregnancy, breastfeeding, or unwillingness to use at least two contraceptive methods
             (at least one of which must be primary, including tubal ligation, partner vasectomy,
             oral contraceptives, implanted contraceptives, and intrauterine device). The
             rationale is that retinoids are teratogenic and are excreted in breast milk.

          -  Abnormal liver function test, including AST, ALT, total bilirubin, or protime. The
             rationale is that retinoids can be hepatotoxic. The only exception will be the
             following: if the cause of abnormality of LFTs is felt to be due to a specific
             hepatotoxic drug such as a statin and the levels are less than 2 times the upper
             limit of the normal AND normalize upon holding the offending drug, patients may be
             considered for study participation after consultation with hepatology service.

          -  Hypertriglyceridemia greater than 500 mg/dL despite statin/fibrate therapy. The
             rationale is that retinoids can increase lipids, particularly triglyceride as this
             can lead to pancreatitis.

          -  Any medical conditions requiring concurrent immunosuppression, as this pilot study is
             designed to evaluate the effect of retinoids as a monotherapy.

          -  Any medical conditions requiring concurrent use of tetracycline, minocycline, or
             doxycycline, due to enhanced risk of increased intracranial pressure.

          -  Hypersensitivity to retinoids.

          -  Presence of any unstable cardiovascular disease, uncontrolled diabetes with
             hemoglobin A1c greater than 8 percent, chronic inflammatory or infectious conditions
             except HIV-1 infection. Retinoids have been associated with chest pain of unclear
             etiology, increased serum glucose, myelosuppression and increased risk of infection.
             The etiology of infection is not clear but may be related to myelosuppression.

          -  Those with HIV-1 infection must not have any evidence for opportunistic infectious
             complications and have CD4 count greater than or equal to 200. Both tretinoin and
             isotretinoin have been safely studied in HIV-infected patients for other indications.

          -  GFR less than 40 ml/min/1.73m(2) estimated by 5-variable MDRD equation, as the
             metabolities of retinoids are excreted in part in urine, and there is a concern for
             increased toxicity. In participants less than 18 years of age, we will use Schwartz
             equation.

          -  Expansion of glomerulus or interstitial formation on the biopsy.

          -  Untreated depression, as retinoids have been associated with depression, suicidal
             ideation, and aggressive behavior. If patients manifest significant depressive
             symptoms, they will be included in the study only if assessed and agreed by a
             psychiatrist (either at NIH or other) and if they have regular follow-up visits with
             a psychiatrist.

          -  Factors that increase the risk of renal biopsy. These include the following:
             unwillingness to accept blood transfusion, bleeding diathesis, single kidney, small
             kidneys (less than 9.5 cm).
