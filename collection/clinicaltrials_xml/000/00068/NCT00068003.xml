  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      The NCI Surgery Branch has developed experimental therapies that involve taking white blood
      cells from patients' tumor or from their blood, growing them in the laboratory in large
      numbers, and then giving the cells back to the patient.

      Objective:

      This study will collect white blood cells from normal volunteers and white blood cells
      and/or tumor cells, from patients who have been screened for and are eligible for a NCI
      Surgery Branch treatment protocol. The cells collected from normal volunteers will be used
      as growth factors for the cells during the period of laboratory growth. The cells and/or
      tumor from patients will be used to make the cell treatment product.

      Eligibility:

      Patients must be eligible for a NCI Surgery Branch Treatment Protocol

      Normal Volunteers must meet the criteria for blood donation

      Design

      Both patients and normal Volunteers will undergo apheresis. Patients will then undergo
      further testing as required by the treatment protocol.

      There is no required follow up for normal volunteers.

      BACKGROUND:

      There are numerous clinical trials underway in the Surgery Branch, NCI in which patients are
      administered autologous lymphocytes with anti-tumor activity generated from either
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) or tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL). All
      adoptive cell therapy protocols require that certain cell criteria be evaluated and met
      prior to enrollment.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To obtain autologous blood, stem cells and/or tumor tissue from patients currently with
           cancer for laboratory analysis and ex vivo generation of autologous anti-tumor
           lymphocytes for future enrollment on a Surgery Branch adoptive cell therapy clinical
           trial, or for research purposes.

        -  To obtain allogeneic PBMC via apheresis, or blood samples from healthy volunteers for
           use in generating anti-tumor patient lymphocytes ex vivo, or for research.

        -  To obtain PBMC via apheresis, blood samples, and skin biopsies from subjects with
           spontaneous vitiligo for research purposes. (With amendment-X, no longer enrolling in
           this cohort)

        -  To conduct genomic, proteomic and immunologic research studies on samples collected.

      ELIGIBILITY:

      Patients with cancer must be 16 years of age or older and meet the laboratory safety testing
      for infection included in all the cell therapy treatment trials.

      Healthy volunteers must meet the safety evaluation criteria established by the FDA for
      donation of blood products including HIV, HCV, HTLV, CMV, HBsAg, HBc, Trypanosoma cruzi,
      syphilis, and West Nile Virus. They must also meet the strict behavioral and medical history
      requirements.

      DESIGN:

      Once a cancer patient is determined to be a potential candidate for one of the Surgery
      Branch clinical trials, they will undergo an apheresis and/or tumor resection for future
      treatment and/or research purposes. In addition, this protocol will allow for the pheresis
      of healthy volunteers for allogeneic PBMC used in generating autologous antitumor
      lymphocytes in the laboratory, or for research purposes.

      No treatments, investigational or standard therapy, will be administered on this protocol.

        -  ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR PATIENTS WITH A CURRENT DIAGNOSIS OF CANCER:

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Patients must have a form of cancer currently being studied with adoptive cell
             therapies in the Surgery Branch.

          -  Ability of subject or Legally Authorized Representative to understand and sign the
             Informed Consent Document.

          -  Patients must be greater than or equal to 16 years of age.

          -  Clinical performance status of ECOG 0 or 1.

          -  Seronegative for HIV (The experimental treatments being evaluated depend upon an
             intact immune system. Patients who are HIV seropositive can have decreased immune
             competence and thus be less responsive to the experimental treatment and more
             susceptible to its toxicities).

          -  Seronegative for hepatitis B surface antigen and seronegative for antibody to
             hepatitis C. If hepatitis C antibody test is positive, then patients must be tested
             for the presence of antigen by RT-PCR and be HCV RNA negative.

          -  If Surgery is required to obtain TIL for cell acquisition, the expected procedure
             must be associated with minimal morbidity and minimal hospitalization.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Active systemic infections, coagulation disorders, or other major medial illnesses of

          -  Patients who cannot give proper informed consent to the adoptive cell experimental
             therapy due to an active psychiatric disorder or inability to understand the nature
