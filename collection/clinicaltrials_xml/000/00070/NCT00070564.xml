      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and
      paclitaxel, use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or
      die. Combining more than one drug and giving them after surgery may kill any remaining tumor
      cells. It is not yet known which combination chemotherapy regimen is more effective in
      treating resected breast cancer.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is comparing 2 different regimens of combination
      chemotherapy to see how well they work in treating patients who have undergone surgery for
      stage I, stage II, or stage III breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare the disease-free survival of patients with node-positive or high-risk
           node-negative breast cancer treated with 2 different schedules of adjuvant doxorubicin,
           cyclophosphamide, and paclitaxel.

        -  Compare the overall survival of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the toxic effects of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Correlate outcome with putative prognostic markers in patients treated with these
           regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2
      treatment arms (arms V and VI) (arms I-IV closed 11/10/10).

        -  Arm I: (closed 11/10/10) Patients receive doxorubicin IV and cyclophosphamide IV on day
           1 and pegfilgrastim subcutaneously (SC) on day 2 or filgrastim (G-CSF) SC on days 3-10.
           Treatment repeats every 14 days for 6 courses.

      Beginning 2 weeks after completion of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide, patients receive
      paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day 1 and pegfilgrastim SC on day 2. Treatment repeats every
      14 days for 6 courses.

        -  Arm II: (closed 11/10/10) Patients receive doxorubicin IV on day 1, oral
           cyclophosphamide on days 1-7, and G-CSF SC on days 2-7. Treatment repeats every 7 days
           for 15 courses.

      Beginning 2 weeks after completion of cyclophosphamide, patients receive paclitaxel and
      pegfilgrastim as in arm I.

        -  Arm III: (closed 11/10/10) Patients receive doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and
           pegfilgrastim or G-CSF as in arm I.

      Beginning 2 weeks after completion of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide, patients receive
      paclitaxel IV over 1 hour on day 1. Treatment repeats every 7 days for 12 courses.

        -  Arm IV: (closed 11/10/10) Patients receive doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and G-CSF as
           in arm II.

      Beginning 2 weeks after completion of cyclophosphamide, patients receive paclitaxel as in
      arm III.

        -  Arm V: Patients receive doxorubicin IV and cyclophosphamide IV on day 1 and
           pegfilgrastim SC on day 2. Treatment repeats every 14 days for 4 courses. Patients
           receive doxorubicin IV and cyclophosphamide IV on day 1 and pegfilgrastim SC on day 2.
           Treatment repeats every 14 days for 6 courses.

      Beginning 2 weeks after completion of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide, patients receive
      paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day 1 and pegfilgrastim SC on day 2. Treatment repeats every
      14 days for 6 courses.

        -  Arm VI: Patients receive doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and pegfilgrastim as in arm V.

      Beginning 2 weeks after completion of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide, patients receive
      paclitaxel IV over 1 hour on day 1. Treatment repeats every 7 days for 12 courses.

      In all arms, treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      In all arms patients with HER2/neu-positive tumors also receive trastuzumab (Herceptin®)
      weekly or every 3 weeks beginning concurrently with paclitaxel OR 3 months after the last
      dose of paclitaxel and continuing for up to 52 weeks.

      In all arms, patients with estrogen-receptor or progesterone-receptor positive tumors
      receive hormonal therapy beginning within 28 days of the completion of adjuvant chemotherapy
      or radiotherapy (if given).

      After finishing study treatment patients are followed up every 6 months for 5 years and then
      once a year for up to 15 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3,250 patients will be accrued for this study.
