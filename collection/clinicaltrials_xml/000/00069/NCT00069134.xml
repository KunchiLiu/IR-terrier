  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is believed that the organs of severely malnourished children malfunction because harmful
      compounds called oxidants injure the tissues in these organs. In a healthy person oxidants
      are made harmless because another compound called glutathione neutralizes them. Glutathione
      is made from three amino acids that we get from the protein we eat in our food. We found
      that malnourished children were not making enough glutathione because they lacked one of
      these amino acids called cysteine. In this study we determine why malnourished children do
      not have sufficient cysteine, and we will feed malnourished children a whey-based diet which
      is rich in cysteine during their treatment to determine whether they will make more
      glutathione. This in turn may make their organs recover faster. These findings will let us
      know whether malnourished children can recover faster if they are given more cysteine during
      the early phase of treatment.

buccal tissue protein synthesis, small intestine structure, integrity and function (i.e. mixed mucosal and mucins protein synthesis rate, mucosal GSH synthesis and concentration, villous height and area and crypt depth, intestinal absorptive capacity and degree of mucosal leakiness, and synthesis of the starch digestive enzymes sucrase-isomaltase and maltase-glucoamylase, plus in vivo starch digestion and absorption) in groups of age- and gender-matched children with edematous SCU in the severely malnourished state.
