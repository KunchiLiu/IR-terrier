  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the side effects and how well sirolimus works as secondary
      therapy in treating patients with chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) that did not
      respond to prior treatment. Sirolimus may be an effective treatment for chronic GVHD

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the safety of sirolimus administered at a dose which provides steady-state,
      whole blood trough levels of 5-10 ng/mL in patients with chronic GVHD.

      II. To determine whether administration of sirolimus provides benefit for patients with
      chronic GVHD that has not responded adequately to previous systemic treatment.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive sirolimus orally (PO) once daily (QD). Patients continue to receive
      prednisone and cyclosporine or tacrolimus at the discretion of the managing physician.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.
