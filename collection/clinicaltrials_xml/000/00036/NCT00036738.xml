    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is studying how well fludarabine phosphate and total-body irradiation
      followed by donor peripheral blood stem cell transplant work in treating patients with acute
      lymphoblastic leukemia or chronic myelogenous leukemia that has responded to previous
      treatment with imatinib mesylate, dasatinib, or nilotinib. Giving low doses of chemotherapy,
      such as fludarabine phosphate, and total-body irradiation (TBI) before a donor peripheral
      blood stem cell transplant helps stop the growth of cancer cells. It may also stop the
      patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. The donated stem cells may
      replace the patient's immune system and help destroy any remaining cancer cells
      (graft-versus-tumor effect). Giving an infusion of the donor's T cells (donor lymphocyte
      infusion) after the transplant may help increase this effect. Sometimes the transplanted
      cells from a donor can also make an immune response against the body's normal cells. Giving
      mycophenolate mofetil and cyclosporine after the transplant may stop this from happening.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether the rate of leukemia relapse can be decreased for patients with
      chronic myelogenous leukemia in blast crisis (CML-BC) and Philadelphia chromosome positive
      acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL) responsive to imatinib mesylate (or either dasatinib
      or nilotinib for patients who have imatinib-resistant disease or who are intolerant of
      imatinib) followed by nonmyeloablative hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT)
      compared to historical controls given high-dose conventional allogeneic HSCT or
      chemotherapy.

      II. To determine whether the rate of transplantation-related mortality (TRM) can be
      decreased for patients with CML-BC and Ph+ ALL responsive to imatinib mesylate (or dasatinib
      or nilotinib) followed by nonmyeloablative HSCT compared to historical controls given
      high-dose conventional allogeneic HSCT or chemotherapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate whether donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) can be safely used in patients with
      mixed or full donor chimerism as preemptive therapy to eliminate minimal residual disease.

      OUTLINE:

      INDUCTION THERAPY: Patients continue to receive imatinib mesylate orally (PO), dasatinib PO,
      or nilotinib PO once or twice daily until day -2 and resume on day 14 or when blood counts
      recover after peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) transplantation.

      NONMYELOABLATIVE CONDITIONING: Patients receive fludarabine intravenously (IV) on days -4 to
      -2; and undergo TBI on day 0.

      TRANSPLANTATION: Patients undergo allogeneic PBSC transplantation on day 0.

      GRAFT-VERSUS-HOST-DISEASE (GVHD) PROPHYLAXIS: Patients receive mycophenolate mofetil (MMF)
      PO every 12 hours on days 0-27 (related donor recipients) or every 8 hours on days 0-96 with
      taper on day 40 (unrelated donor recipients). Patients also receive cyclosporine IV or PO
      every 12 hours on days -3 to 56, followed by taper on days 57-180 (related donor recipients)
      or on days -3 to 100, followed by taper on days 101-177 (unrelated donor recipients).

      DONOR LYMPHOCYTE INFUSION: Patients with persistent disease and no GVHD after stopping GVHD
      prophylaxis receive donor lymphocyte infusion IV over 30 minutes once every 28 days for 3
      doses.

      Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed up periodically for 2 years and then annually thereafter for 5 years.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients =&lt; 12 years of age must be approved by Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research
             Center (FHCRC) principal investigator (PI) in advance

          -  Patients with a history of Ph+ ALL or CML-BC who, after receiving imatinib mesylate,
             (or either dasatinib or nilotinib) have &lt; 15% blasts on morphologic marrow
             evaluation; patients with no detectable Ph+ ALL by morphologic or molecular assays
             (complete remission) will be accepted

          -  An appropriately human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matched related or unrelated donor
             must be prospectively identified who will be available to donate filgrastim (G-CSF)
             mobilized stem cells

          -  RELATED DONOR:

               -  Related donor who is HLA genotypically identical at least at one haplotype and
                  may be genotypically or phenotypically identical at the allele level at HLA-A,
                  -B, -C, -DRB1, and -DQB1;

               -  Donor must consent to G-CSR administration and leukapheresis;

               -  Donor must have adequate veins for leukapheresis or agree to placement of
                  central venous catheter (femoral, subclavian)

          -  HLA-MATCHED UNRELATED DONOR:

               -  FHCRC matching allowed will be grades 1.0 to 2.1; unrelated donors who are
                  prospectively matched for HLA-A, B, C, DRB1 and DQB1 by high resolution typing;
                  only a single allele disparity will be allowed for HLA-A, B, or C as defined by
                  high resolution typing

               -  A positive anti-donor cytotoxic crossmatch is an absolute donor exclusion;
                  donors are excluded when preexisting immunoreactivity is identified that would
                  jeopardize donor hematopoietic cell engraftment; this determination is based on
                  the standard practice of the individual institution; the recommended procedure
                  for patients with 10 of 10 HLA allele level (phenotypic) match is to obtain a
                  panel reactive antibody (PRA) screens to class I and class II antigens for all
                  patients before HCT; if the PRA shows &gt;10% activity, then flow cytometric or B
                  and T cell cytotoxic cross matches should be obtained; the donor should be
                  excluded if any of the cytotoxic cross match assays are positive; for those
                  patients with an HLA class I allele mismatch, flow cytometric or B and T cell
                  cytotoxic cross matches should be obtained regardless of the PRA results

               -  Patient and donor pairs homozygous at a mismatched allele in the graft rejection
                  vector are considered a two-allele mismatch, i.e., the patient is A*0101 and the
                  donor is A*0102, and this type of mismatch is not allowed

               -  Only G-CSF mobilized PBSC only will be permitted as a HSC source on this
                  protocol

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Central nervous system (CNS) involvement with leukemia refractory to intrathecal
             chemotherapy; prior to HSCT (all patients must receive a diagnostic lumbar puncture
             (LP) with intrathecal (IT) chemotherapy as per standard practice)

             months following treatment

          -  Patients with active non-hematologic malignancies (except non-melanoma skin cancers);
             this exclusion does not apply to patients with non-hematologic malignancies that do
             not require therapy

          -  Patients with a history of non-hematologic malignancies (except non-melanoma skin
             cancers) currently in a complete remission, who are less than 5 years from the time
             of complete remission, and have a &gt; 20% risk of disease recurrence; this exclusion
             does not apply to patients with non-hematologic malignancies that do not require
             therapy

          -  Females who are pregnant or breastfeeding

          -  Patients who are human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive

          -  Patients with poorly controlled hypertension despite multiple antihypertensives

          -  Adults: Karnofsky score &lt; 60

          -  Patients with cardiac ejection fraction &lt; 35% (or, if unable to obtain ejection
             fraction, shortening fraction of &lt; 26%); ejection fraction is required if age &gt; 50
             years or there is a history of anthracycline exposure or history of cardiac disease;
             patients with a shortening fraction &lt; 26% may be enrolled if approved by a

             with pulmonary nodules

          -  Patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of liver disease would be evaluated for
             the cause of liver disease, its clinical severity in terms of liver function, and the
             degree of portal hypertension; patients will be excluded if they are found to have
             fulminant liver failure, cirrhosis of the liver with evidence of portal hypertension,
             alcoholic hepatitis, esophageal varices, a history of bleeding esophageal varices,
