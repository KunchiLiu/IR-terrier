  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treatment of HIV-infected patients involves combining drugs from different classes of
      anti-HIV drugs. One preferred regimen for adults is 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase
      inhibitors (NRTIs) and 1 protease inhibitor (PI). For children, this regimen may be too
      complicated or the drugs may be too difficult to take by mouth. The purpose of this study is
      to determine the long-term safety and effectiveness of daily didanosine (ddI), efavirenz
      (EFV), and emtricitabine (FTC) in pediatric patients who have taken few or no anti-HIV
      drugs.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anti-HIV treatment options are limited for pediatric patients because combination therapies
      recommended for adults may not be appropriate for children or adolescents. Few PIs are
      available in formulations appropriate for pediatric patients, and complex dosing schedules
      and food requirements may be detrimental to treatment adherence. A once-daily regimen of the
      NRTIs ddI and FTC and the nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) EFV has been
      shown safe and well tolerated in adults. This study will evaluate the long-term safety and
      efficacy of a ddI, FTC, and EFV regimen in pediatric patients.

      Patients will be followed for a maximum of 192 weeks; all patients will receive ddI, EFV,
      and FTC together once daily. Study visits will occur at study entry, Weeks 2 and 4, and
      every 4 weeks thereafter. Blood collection, medical history assessment, and a physical exam
      will occur at all visits; urine collection will occur at selected visits. Intensive
      pharmacokinetic (PK) studies will be done at Weeks 2 and 12 to determine if dose adjustments
      are required for any of the drugs. If virologic failure is determined, PK studies will be
      repeated 4 weeks after adjustments in therapy. Parents or guardians will be asked to
      complete treatment adherence questionnaires at some visits. Some patients may also be asked
      to participate in an additional PK study after Week 16 or week 96.
