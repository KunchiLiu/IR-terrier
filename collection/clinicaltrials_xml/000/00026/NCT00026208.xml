      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor
      cells. Combining chemotherapy with radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving combination chemotherapy together
      with low-dose radiation therapy works in treating patients with stage I or stage IIA
      Hodgkin's lymphoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Evaluate the freedom from progression in patients with stage I or IIA Hodgkin's
           lymphoma with a favorable prognosis treated with Stanford V-C chemotherapy comprising
           cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vinblastine, prednisone, vincristine, bleomycin, and
           etoposide with low-dose radiotherapy.

        -  Minimize the early and late effects of treatment in these patients by avoiding staging
           laparotomy and its consequences, limiting cumulative doses of chemotherapy, and
           reducing the dose of radiotherapy to moderately bulky sites of disease.

        -  Assess early and late treatment-related toxicity, freedom from second disease
           progression, and overall survival at 5 and 10 years in patients treated with this
           regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive Stanford V-C chemotherapy comprising cyclophosphamide IV over 30-60 minutes
      weekly on weeks 1 and 5; doxorubicin IV and vinblastine IV over 5 minutes once weekly on
      weeks 1, 3, 5, and 7; oral prednisone every other day on weeks 1-8; vincristine IV and
      bleomycin IV over 5 minutes once weekly on weeks 2, 4, 6, and 8; and etoposide IV over 60
      minutes on days 1 and 2 of weeks 3 and 7. Beginning 2-3 weeks after completion of
      chemotherapy, patients undergo low-dose radiotherapy 5 days a week for approximately 3
      weeks.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 80 patients will be accrued for this study within 5 years.
