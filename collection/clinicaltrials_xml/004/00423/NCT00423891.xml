    <measure>Mean Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration (Cmax) and Mean Trough Observed Plasma Concentration (Cmin) of Entecavir in LVD-naive and LVD-experienced Participants, by Age Cohort</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 14</time_frame>
    <description>Cmax and Cmin were derived from plasma concentration of ETV versus time and measured in nanograms per milliliters (ng/mL). Blood samples were obtained before study drug administration and at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 24 hours after study drug administration on Day 14 (+/- 4 days) for the PK assessment. Plasma samples were analyzed for ETV with a validated method using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry detection. Note: PK parameters were summarized for only Groups A and B. PK assessment was optional for Group C participants (NA-experienced participants who were included with the September 2011 country-specific protocol amendment). No Group C participants chose to participate in the PK assessment.</description>

      <recruitment_details>Study started June 2007, currently ongoing. Cohort 1: age ≥ 2 to ≤ 6 years; Cohort 2: &gt;6 to ≤ 12 years; Cohort 3: age &gt;12 to ≤18 years. Groups A and B: lamivudine-naive and experienced participants, respectively. Nucleoside/tide analog - treatment-experienced participants (Group C) added September 2011 via country-specific amendment to protocol.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>64 enrolled. 48 treated. Participants received a minimum of 48 weeks study drug but depending on response to drug, could remain on treatment for up to a total of 120 weeks. Participants were to receive post dosing follow up after last dose, for a total of 5 years on-study (on and off study drug).</pre_assignment_details>

          <description>Participants with less than (&lt;) 1 week of prior LVD therapy and with no LVD therapy within 24 weeks prior to enrollment were included in Group A. Prior to Pharmacokinetic (PK) assessment, Cohort 1 (age ≥ 2 years to ≤ 6 years) and Cohort 2 (&gt;6 years to ≤ 12 years) received ETV oral solution, 0.015 mg/kg up to 0.5 mg, once a day (QD) and Cohort 3 (age &gt;12 years to ≤18 years) received ETV oral solution, 0.015 mg/kg up to 0.5 mg, or ETV tablets, 0.5 mg, QD. Following PK analysis, those who met the specified dosing requirements (at least 0.5 mg/day) and could tolerate swallowing ETV tablets were allowed to choose either formulation. Entecavir (ETV) was administered for a maximum of 120 weeks.</description>

        <title>Mean Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration (Cmax) and Mean Trough Observed Plasma Concentration (Cmin) of Entecavir in LVD-naive and LVD-experienced Participants, by Age Cohort</title>
        <description>Cmax and Cmin were derived from plasma concentration of ETV versus time and measured in nanograms per milliliters (ng/mL). Blood samples were obtained before study drug administration and at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 24 hours after study drug administration on Day 14 (+/- 4 days) for the PK assessment. Plasma samples were analyzed for ETV with a validated method using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry detection. Note: PK parameters were summarized for only Groups A and B. PK assessment was optional for Group C participants (NA-experienced participants who were included with the September 2011 country-specific protocol amendment). No Group C participants chose to participate in the PK assessment.</description>

        <title>Mean Apparent Total Body Clearance (CLT/F) of Entecavir in LVD-naive and LVD-experienced Participants, by Age Cohort</title>
        <description>CLT/F was calculated by dividing the dose of ETV by AUC(TAU) of ETV and was measured in liters per hour (L/h). Blood samples were obtained before study drug administration and at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 24 hours after study drug administration on Day 14 (+/- 4 days) for the PK assessment. Plasma samples were analyzed for ETV with a validated method using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry detection. PK assessment was optional for Group C participants (NA-experienced participants who were included with the September 2011 country-specific protocol amendment). No Group C participants chose to participate in the PK assessment.</description>
