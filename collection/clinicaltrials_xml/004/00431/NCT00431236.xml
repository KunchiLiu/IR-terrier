    <textblock>
      This is a Phase III trial designed to demonstrate that casopitant when added to
      dexamethasone and ondansetron is more effective in the prevention of vomiting then
      dexamethasone and ondansetron alone, in patients who receive a cisplatin-based highly
      emetogenic chemotherapy.

        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Subject understands the nature and purpose of this study and the study procedures and
             has signed an informed consent form for this study to indicate this understanding.

          -  Males or females of at least 18 years of age.

          -  Diagnosed with a malignant solid tumor and is scheduled to receive their first course

             cisplatin infusion and be completed no more than 6 hours after the initiation of the
             cisplatin infusion. Chemotherapy agents of minimal to low emetogenic potential may be
             given on Day 1 following cisplatin or on any subsequent study day. Taxanes (e.g.
             paclitaxel, docetaxel) may be administered on study Day 1 only following cisplatin.

        Clcreat (ml/min) = (140-age [yr]) x body wt [kg] 72 x serum creatinine [mg/dl] For
        females: multiply creatinine clearance by a factor of 0.85. OR Clcreat (ml/min) = (140-age
        [yr]) x body wt [kg] serum creatinine [µmol/L] K=1.05 for females K=1.23 for males

                       pregnant, including any female who is post-menopausal. For purposes of this
                       study, postmenopausal is defined as one year without menses)

                    2. child-bearing potential: must have a negative serum pregnancy test result

             trial to account for elimination of the drug (minimum of three days)

          -  if subjects indicate they will remain abstinent during the period described above,
             they must agree to follow GSK guidelines for the consistent and correct use of an
             acceptable method of birth control should they become sexually active.
