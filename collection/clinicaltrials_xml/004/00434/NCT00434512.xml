  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GSK has constructed a new HIV immunogen comprised of conserved parts of the HIV virus (gag,
      pol and nef). The principal objectives of this study are to evaluate the reactogenicity and
      safety of this candidate vaccine with or without a GSK proprietary adjuvant system at three
      different doses and to evaluate the CD4+ T-cell response in terms of proportion of
      responders to the antigens two weeks after the second vaccination.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, observer-blind, randomized, dose-escalating, staggered study with 6
      groups: 3 groups of 50 subjects receiving the adjuvanted candidate vaccine, at 3 different
      doses and 3 groups of 10 subjects receiving the non-adjuvanted candidate vaccine in water
      for injection, at 3 different doses. The vaccination schedule will be 0-1 month. Blood
      samples will be collected at 8 visits. The duration of the study will be approximately 14
      months for each subject. Rationale for Protocol Posting Amendment: The third vaccination
      will be cancelled and the visit at Month 7 will be postponed to Month 9. The Protocol
      Posting has also been updated in order to comply with the FDA Amendment Act, Sep 2007.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  A male or female between and including 18-40 years at the time of first vaccination.

          -  Written informed consent obtained from the subject prior to any study procedure.

          -  Subjects who the investigator believes that they can and will comply with the
             requirements of the protocol.

          -  Good general health without significant medical history, physical examination
             findings, or clinically significant abnormal laboratory results.
