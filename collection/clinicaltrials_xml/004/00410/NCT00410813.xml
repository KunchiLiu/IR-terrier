      RATIONALE: Dasatinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying two different schedules of dasatinib to
      compare how well they work in treating patients with stage IV breast cancer that has spread
      to the bone.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare the progression-free survival of patients with stage IV bone
           metastasis-predominant breast cancer treated with 1 of 2 treatment schedules of
           dasatinib.

        -  Compare the response rate (complete and partial, confirmed and unconfirmed) in patients
           treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the MUC-1 antigen response rate (CA 15-3 or CA 27-29) in patients treated with
           these regimens.

        -  Compare the circulating tumor cell response rate in patients treated with these
           regimens.

        -  Compare the anti-osteoclast activity, as measured by changes in bone turnover markers,
           in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the frequency and severity of toxicities of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Compare the pain profiles of these patients and explore changes over time.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      concurrent trastuzumab (Herceptin®) treatment (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2
      treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral dasatinib once daily.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral dasatinib twice daily. In both treatment arms, treatment
           continues for at least 24 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
           toxicity.

      Blood samples are acquired from patients once weekly in weeks 1, 4, 8, 16, and 24. Samples
      are analyzed for tumor markers, circulating tumor cells, and bone markers.

      Patients complete a self-reported brief pain inventory questionnaire at baseline and once in
      weeks 8, 16, and 24.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3-6 months for up to 2
      years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 80 patients will be accrued for this study.

    <description>Complete Response (CR) is complete disappearance of all measurable and non-measurable disease. No new lesions, no disease related symptoms. Normalization of markers and other abnormal lab values. Partial Response (PR) is greater than or equal to 30% decrease under baseline of the sum of longest diameters of all target measurable lesions. No unequivocal progression of non-measurable disease. No new lesions. Confirmation of CR or PR means a repeat scan at least 4 weeks apart documented before progression or symptomatic deterioration. Progression is 20% increase in sum of longest diameters of target measurable lesions over smallest sum observed and/or unequivocal progression of non-measurable disease and/or appearance of new lesion/site or death due to disease without prior documentation of progression and without symptomatic deterioration. Symptomatic deterioration is global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment without objective evidence of progression.</description>
