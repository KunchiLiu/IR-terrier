  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is studying how well giving bevacizumab together with lenalidomide and
      dexamethasone works in treating patients with relapsed or refractory stage II or stage III
      multiple myeloma. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block cancer growth in
      different ways. Some block the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Others find
      cancer cells and help kill them or carry cancer-killing substances to them. Bevacizumab and
      lenalidomide may stop the growth of multiple myeloma by blocking blood flow to the cancer.
      Dexamethasone may stimulate the immune system in different ways and stop cancer cells from
      growing. Giving bevacizumab together with lenalidomide and dexamethasone may kill more
      cancer cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the overall response rate (complete response and partial response) in patients
      with relapsed or refractory stage II or III multiple myeloma treated with bevacizumab,
      lenalidomide, and dexamethasone.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine time to progression in these patients. II. Determine the toxicity and
      tolerability of this regimen. III. Determine the effect of bevacizumab and lenalidomide on
      markers of myeloma activity in myeloma cells and stromal cells, including interleukin-6,
      macrophage inflammatory protein-1Î±, vascular endothelial growth factor, and STAT3.

      IV. Assess local cytokine milieu using tissue microarrays of bone marrow biopsy specimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, open-label study.

      Patients receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1 and 15, oral lenalidomide on
      days 1-21, and oral dexamethasone on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Blood samples are collected at baseline and before courses 2 and 4. Blood samples are
      examined for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and VEGF receptor (VEGFR)
      polymorphisms by pyrosequencing and VEGF, VEGFR1, VEGFR2, interleukin-6, and macrophage
      inflammatory protein 1 by immunoenzyme techniques. Relationships between plasma cell myeloma
      and stroma and the effect of study treatment on these relationships are examined in tissue
      sections of bone marrow before and after treatment utilizing microvessel density
      measurements, VEGF staining, and STAT3 staining (by immunohistochemistry and fluorescent in
      situ hybridization [FISH]).

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for at least 5
      years.

    <description>Responses will be analyzed by descriptive statistics and summarized in tabular format (frequency tables). Furthermore, two-sided 95% confidence intervals for the proportions of subjects with a confirmed anti-tumor response will be computed using the method proposed by Chang, which takes into account the multiplicity problem associated with the two-stage testing procedure. The objective response rate will be estimated by using Whitehead's bias-adjustment approach.</description>

    <measure>Time to progression (TTP)</measure>
    <time_frame>The number of days from the day of first drug administration to the day the patient experiences an event of disease progression or death, assessed up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>TTP will be summarized using point estimates of the median time to progression and associated 95% confidence intervals. The data will be presented graphically using Kaplan-Meier plots. Exploratory analysis, including multivariate Cox regression with demographic variables and markers of myeloma activity as covariates, may be performed.</description>
