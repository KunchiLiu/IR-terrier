      The purpose of this study is to observe the effects of certain anti-HIV medications on
      mitochondrial activity and fat cell death. This study will enroll participants from another
      study, ACTG A5202, who are on treatment regimens that do not include zidovudine, stavudine,
      or other thymidine-containing anti-HIV medications.

      The main objective of this study is to observe the effects of anti-HIV medication lacking
      thymidine on mitochondrial metabolism and adipocyte apoptosis (fat cell death). Changes in
      mitochondrial metabolism and increases in adipocyte apoptosis are associated with
      lipoatrophy. Lipoatrophy is a common condition characterized by loss of subcutaneous fat and
      can be caused by many anti-HIV medications. This study will examine the metabolic
      consequences of the use of thymidine analogue-sparing treatment regimens.

      This study will evaluate HIV infected patients who are enrolled in ACTG A5202, starting
      their first nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI)-containing regimen. This
      regimen will include either tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine (TDF/FTC) or
      abacavir/lamivudine (ABC/3TC), which are thymidine-sparing regimens. The changes in
      mitochondrial activity and fat cell death will be compared between participants taking
      thymidine-sparing regimens (TDF/FTC or ABC/3TC) and thymidine-containing regimens.

      This study will last for 96 weeks, with two study visits occurring at entry and another
      visit at Week 96. During each visit, a dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan and
      blood collection will occur, and a fat biopsy will be performed in the lower abdomen under
      local anesthetic.
