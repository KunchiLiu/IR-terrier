      The primary objectives of the trial are:

        1. To establish the safety and efficacy of the use of bivalirudin (+ bail-out GP IIb/IIIa
           inhibitors) compared to the use of unfractionated heparin + GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors in
           patients with acute myocardial infarction undergoing a primary angioplasty strategy.

        2. To establish the safety and efficacy of the slow rate release paclitaxel-eluting TAXUS™
           stent compared to an otherwise identical uncoated bare metal EXPRESS2™ stent.

      Prospective, 2 x 2 factorial single blind, randomized, multi-center trial of 3400 patients
      enrolled at up to 200 centers. Patients will be randomized 1:1 in the emergency room to a)
      anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin plus routine GP IIb/IIIa inhibition vs. b)
      bivalirudin and bail-out GP IIb/IIIa inhibition. Following angiography, patients with
      lesions eligible for stenting will then undergo a second randomization (3:1) to stent
      implantation with either a) a slow rate-release paclitaxel-eluting stent (TAXUS™) or b) an
      otherwise identical uncoated bare metal stent (EXPRESS2™).
