  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pharmacologic boosting of protease inhibitors with ritonavir has become standard practice in
      antiretroviral therapy. Patients are instructed to take ritonavir at the same time as its
      accompanying protease inhibitor. However, ritonavir is unpopular with many patients because
      of its large size and because of the recommended need for refrigeration. This study will
      test the hypothesis that adherence to ritonavir is inferior to adherence to its accompanying
      protease inhibitor in patients receiving such therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study staff will employ MEMS caps to prospectively measure adherence to ritonavir and
      its accompanying protease inhibitor over 24 weeks of follow-up. Paired sample t-tests will
      be employed to compare adherence to the two agents, and secondary analyses will be conducted
      to evaluate the chronologic concordance of ritonavir and accompanying protease inhibitor
      dosing.
