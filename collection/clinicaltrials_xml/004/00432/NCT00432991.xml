  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to investigate if the incidence of nausea and vomiting
      that subjects experience during and after a Cesarean section can be reduced by giving a shot
      of the drug ephedrine into the thigh muscle at the time of spinal anesthesia administration.

      This research project is designed to study the medication ephedrine, when it is given as a
      routine part of the anesthesia for elective Cesarean section. Ephedrine is a medication that
      is widely used in labor and in vaginal and operative (Cesarean section) deliveries to help
      maintain a woman's blood pressure within its normal range, especially after spinal and
      epidural anesthesia has been administered. The purpose of this study is to determine if
      ephedrine, when given intramuscularly (&lt;IM&gt; as a shot in the muscle), at the time of spinal
      anesthesia administration, can help to decrease the incidence of nausea and vomiting
      subjects experience during and after a Cesarean section. This study will compare women who
      receive ephedrine to a similar group of women who receive a normal saline placebo. In
      addition to looking at the difference in the incidence of nausea and vomiting
      perioperatively, this study will also evaluate if the administration of IM ephedrine helps
      the baby to receive more blood from the placenta after anesthesia has been administered to
      the mother. This will be evaluated by performing a simple blood test, drawn from the
      umbilical cord, after the baby is born.
