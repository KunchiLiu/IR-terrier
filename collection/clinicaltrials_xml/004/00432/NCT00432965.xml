    <textblock>
      To determine if topical negative pressure therapy delivered by the V.A.C.® device is
      clinically efficacious and cost effective in the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers.

      The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of V.A.C.® Therapy to moist wound
      therapy of diabetic foot ulcers. The primary objective is to determine the effect of V.A.C.®
      Therapy on the incidence of complete wound closure. Secondary objectives include: evaluating
      the acceleration of ulcer closure or facilitation of surgical closure, reduction of ulcer
      surface area over time, reduction in complications, the quality of life and the average
      total cost of care.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Presence of a calcaneal, dorsal or plantar diabetic foot ulcer ≥ 2 cm2 in area after
             debridement. (If more than one ulcer is present, all wounds will be treated using the
             same method, but only one ulcer will be studied.)

          -  DFU equivalent to Stage 2 or greater, as defined by Wagner's Scale system (See
             Appendix E)

          -  Evidence of adequate perfusion by one of the following on the affected
             extremity,(within the past 60 days):Dorsum transcutaneous oxygen test (TcPO2) with
             results of ≥30 mmHg, or ABIs with results of ≥0.7 and ≤1.2 and toe pressures with
             results of ≥30 mmHg, or Doppler arterial waveforms, which are triphasic or biphasic
             at the ankle in the affected leg.

          -  Age ≥ 18 years of age

          -  HbA1c ≤ 12% (collected within the last 90 days.)

          -  Evidence of adequate nutrition by one of the following:

          -  Lab results reflecting Pre-Albumin &gt;16 mg/dl and Albumin level is &gt;3 g/dl (during the
             seven days prior to the study period), or a nutritional consult will be done and with
             appropriate supplementation started. Proper documentation on CRFs is needed.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with recognized active Charcot abnormalities of the foot, as evidence by
             clinical symptoms that interfere with either randomized treatment group

          -  Ulcers resulting from electrical, chemical, or radiation burns, or venous
             insufficiency

          -  Untreated infection or cellulites at site of target ulcer

          -  Presence of untreated osteomyelitis

          -  Collagen vascular disease

          -  Malignancy in the ulcer

          -  Presence of necrotic tissue

          -  Uncontrolled hyperglycemia

          -  Concomitant medications that include (washout period of 30 days for corticosteroids,
             immunosuppressive medications, or chemotherapy)

          -  Open amputations

          -  Prior V.A.C. therapy within 30 days.

          -  Current or prior normothermic (Warm-UP®) or HBO therapy within 30 days.

          -  Current or prior treatment with recombinant or autologous growth factor products
             within the past 30 days. (Examples: Regranex or Procuren)

          -  Current or prior treatment with skin or dermal substitutes and dressings (Examples:
             Apligraft, Dermagraft, or Integra) with living cells capable of producing growth
             factors (Example: Oasis) within the past 30 days.

          -  Current use of any enzymatic debridment agent (Example: Acuzyme /Panafil) during the
             active treatment phase of the study
