  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study's purpose is to evaluate the long-term safety of open-label tolvaptan regimens to
      determine the maximally-tolerated dose and acquire pilot efficacy data in patients with
      ADPKD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease is a genetic disease classified by the
      formation of fluid-filled cysts in the kidneys. The accumulation of these cysts causes the
      kidneys to enlarge several times the normal size and leads to the eventual loss of renal
      function and ultimately results in renal failure in end-stage patients. This is a disease
      with life-threatening implications to those who have it and their family members who may
      also be affected. Aside from early antihypertensive control and dietary protein restriction,
      which are presumed to offer a modest degree of protection, most surviving patients require
      renal replacement therapy (dialysis and transplant) and suffer from high morbidity and
      mortality.

      A rationale for use of tolvaptan in these genetic disorders has been proven, in principle,
      through use of a variety of animal models. In these models, tolvaptan is effective in
      halting or reversing the progression of this renal disease.

      The current study is being undertaken in order to evaluate whether tolvaptan, an oral AVP
      inhibitor, will maintain an adequate safety profile and show a potential clinical benefit by
      reducing total renal volume in the hopes of making an impact upon disease progression.
