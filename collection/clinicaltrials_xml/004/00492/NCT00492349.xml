  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The principal aim of the project is to conduct an off-label adjunctive clinical trial
      evaluating varenicline as a treatment for core neurobiological and clinical deficits in
      schizophrenia, in addition to evaluating for smoking cessation in schizophrenia patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, placebo controlled clinical trial in schizophrenia patients. Outcome
      measures include biomarkers and clinical symptoms and functions, and smoking cessation.
      Neurobiological and cognitive markers will be measured for short term (2 weeks) and
      longer-term (8 weeks). Current schizophrenia treatments are mostly ineffective against
      primary negative symptoms and the cognitive and information processing deficits associated
      with the disorder. Previous research has identified several neurophysiological deficits in
      schizophrenia that are enduring, frequently occurring before psychosis, and mark the disease
      liability. These schizophrenia endophenotypes provide important targets for novel treatment
      development as they represent the core deficits of the disorder. We hypothesize that
      sustained nicotinic and dopaminergic modulation by varenicline may ameliorate the core
      neurobiological deficits seen in schizophrenia patients, which would lead to subsequent
      clinical improvement. Neurobiological and neurocognitive markers and clinical and functional
      measures will be obtained to determine 1) short-term effect of varenicline on biomarkers;
      and 2) longer-term improvement in clinical symptoms, smoking cessation, and functions; and
      how biomarker changes predict these improvements.
