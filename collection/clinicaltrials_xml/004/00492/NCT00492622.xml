  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the blood drug levels of two prescribed medications,
      immediate-release omeprazole 40 mg powder and delayed-release omeprazole 40 mg capsule to
      determine which drug is better absorbed in patients with a slow stomach emptying
      (gastroparesis). Delayed-release omeprazole has a protective coating to prevent the drug
      omeprazole from being neutralized by stomach acid. Immediate-release omeprazole has sodium
      bicarbonate (antacid) which neutralizes the stomach acid, eliminating the need for a
      protective coating. Immediate-release omeprazole suspension may have a more rapid
      pharmacokinetic profile and greater overall drug absorption in gastroparesis.

      Hypothesis: Immediate-release omeprazole suspension may have a more rapid pharmacokinetic
      profile and greater overall drug absorption in gastroparesis. This will result in shorter
      time to maximal drug concentration, greater maximal concentration, and greater total area
      under the curve of the concentration vs. time plot.

      Primary Objective: To compare the pharmacokinetics of omeprazole between immediate-release
      suspension and delayed-release capsules in patients with heartburn associated with
      gastroparesis.

      Study design: randomized, open-labeled, crossover treatment for 7 days with 10-14 days
      washout. Pharmacokinetic studies will be performed after 7 days on study drug.
