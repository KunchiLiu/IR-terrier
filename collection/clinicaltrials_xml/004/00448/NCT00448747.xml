  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The diagnosis of GH deficiency (GHD) in adults is established by laboratory testing in
      patients with an appropriate clinical history of hypothalamic pituitary disease. Two tests
      that are considered to be gold standard tests for the diagnosis of GHD are the insulin
      tolerance test (ITT) and GHRH combined with arginine. However, these tests are either
      bothersome (given intravenously) to the patient or are linked with side effects. Therefore,
      an orally available compound like AEZS-130(formerly ARD-07), if demonstrated to be safe and
      providing adequate sensitivity and specificity could be a welcome alternative and/or
      complement to the current available tests.

      The intent was to recruit 40 AGHD patients and 40 normal control subjects into this trial,
      but the original sponsor (Ardana Biosciences Ltd.) discontinued the study for financial
      reasons before this was completed. At the time of withdrawal of GHRH from the market in
      2008, 42 AGHD patients and 10 normal controls had completed the study at 9 US sites. This
      study is now being reactivated to complete the remaining 30 matched control subjects.

      Additionally upon agreement with the FDA in a SPA, 10 additional adult grown hormone
      deficient and their matched control will be enrolled into this trial for a total treated
      population approximatively 100 subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thirty control subjects (i.e., without AGHD) will be matched to the 30 AGHD patients who
      were not previously matched. Matching will be based upon gender, age, BMI, and estrogen
      status for females. They will receive one oral dose of AEZS-130 followed by serial blood
      draws for growth hormone, IGF-1 and PK determinations. There will be no cross over due to
      the unavailability of GHRH (Geref) in the United States. Under Amendment #4 to this
      protocol, 10 additional AGHD subjects will be enrolled and matched as described above.
