  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a randomized trial of a cardiopulmonary self-management intervention to improve
      functional capacity, health-related quality of life, and to reduce health care utilization.
      Two hundred (100 in each group) will be recruited from VA Puget Sound Health Care System
      over four years. Outcomes will be measured at three points: at entry, at the end of the 6
      month intervention, and 12 months after entry. Change in functional capacity at the end of
      the intervention program is the primary outcome.

      This study is a randomized, controlled trial of a cardiopulmonary exercise and
      self-management intervention to improve functional capacity, health related-related quality
      of life, and to reduce health care costs in medically fragile, elderly patients with chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or heart failure (HF). Specific aims include: (1) To
      determine the benefits of a combined outpatient/home-based exercise, self-management program
      on function al capability (daily activity, six-minute qalk distance, symptoms), (2) to
      determine the effects of exercise/self-management on quality of life, health status,
      cardiopulmonary function, and gait and balance, (3) to test the theoretical self-regulation
      model for mediating effects on major outcome variables, and (4) to compare health care
      resource utilization and expenditures between the intervention and usual care groups in
      order to conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis of the program. The primary outcome upon
      which the study is powered is functional capability measured by daily physical activity.
      Outcomes will be measured at three time points: at entry and following the intervention at 6
      and 12 months. Two-hundred (100/group) will be recruited from the VA Puget Sound Health Care
      System outpatient clinics. The study will be carried out over four years. Inclusion criteria
      include standard criteria for severe COPD or HF, optimal medical management, willingness to
      participate in an outpatient exercise/self-management program, working phone,
      hospitalization for HF, COPD, or related illness in the past two years or at least two
      outpatient visits for same over the past year. Exclusion criteria include unstable disease
      or recent surgery, supplemental oxygen requirement at rest more than 4 LPM, already
      participating in regular exercise three times a week, inability to ambulate, uncontrolled
      mental illness, alcohol or drug abuse and life expectancy less than one year. The
      intervention consists of a month long program of two 2-hour visits a week incorporating
      equal time for endurance and strength training as well as individually-tailored instruction
      in self-management of their heart/lung disease. Usual care control is an 8-week standard
      cardiopulmonary exercise program, two days a week for an hour with some self-management
      content.
