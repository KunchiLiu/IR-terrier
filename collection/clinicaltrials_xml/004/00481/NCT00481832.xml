      The purpose of this trial is to develop an alternative treatment for patients with poor risk
      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. This trial uses a combination of high dose chemotherapy with stem
      cell transplant using the patient's own cells. This is followed with non-myeloablative
      transplant using stem cells from a related or unrelated donor to try and generate an
      anti-lymphoma response from the new immune system.

    <textblock>
      Currently, patients with recurrent or primary refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma are treated
      with second-line chemotherapy (usually 2-3 courses) for the purpose of cytoreduction and to
      establish sensitivity to chemotherapy. Thereafter, peripheral blood progenitor cells are
      mobilized with cyclophosphamide and granulocyte colony stimulating factor, apheresed and
      cryopreserved. The standard high dose regimen consists of augmented carmustine, etoposide
      and cyclophosphamide. Unfortunately, there are subgroups of patients with poor outcomes
      using autologous transplantation including those with transformed lymphoma as well as
      patients who do not attain a minimal disease state due to chemoresistant disease.

      Past studies conducted at Stanford have included a group of 17 patients with transformed
      lymphoma who received autologous transplants, the median EFS and OS were 1.48 and 2.7 years
      respectively with a 7-year survival of only 20%. In comparison, patients with chemosensitive
      follicular lymphoma who received the same regimen also had a poor median EFS of 1.3 years,
      but the median survival was 6.7 years. The outcomes for patients with chemotherapy-resistant
      relapsed NHL is also poor with EFS in the range of 20% in many studies of autologous
      transplantation.

      These groups of patients have limited disease control and survival with standard
      chemotherapy regimens, and although they often have excellent cytoreduction with the
      high-dose chemotherapy regimen, relapse remains the primary cause of treatment failure. The
      current trial utilizes a similar approach that has been taken with patients with multiple
      myeloma, who appear to benefit from an allogeneic graft-versus-tumor effect, using a
      combined autologous and non-myeloablative allogeneic transplant regimen to reduce
      transplant-related complications. Eligible patients will be treated with high-dose
      chemotherapy using BCNU, etoposide and cyclophosphamide with autologous hematopoietic cell
      support as a method of cytoreduction. Approximately 60-120 days after the autologous
      transplant, patients will receive an allogeneic transplant using a preparative regimen of
      total lymphoid irradiation and anti-thymocyte globulin in an attempt to develop a
      graft-versus-lymphoma effect.
