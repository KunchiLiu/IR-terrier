  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the present study is to determine whether or not primary human mammary
      epithelial cells are competent for use in molecular studies of transepithelial
      electrophysiology focusing on the function of the tight junction protein claudin 3.

      Human breast Tissue will be removed from mastectomy specimens and used as a source to
      generate epithelial cells for study.
