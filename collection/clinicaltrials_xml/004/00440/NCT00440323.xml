        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Body weight =50 kg and BMI within the range 18.5-29.9 kg/m2 inclusive

          -  Healthy as judged by responsible physician.

          -  No clinically significant abnormality identified on the medical or laboratory
             evaluation and 12-lead ECG;

          -  The subject shows a normal sleep pattern on the basis of the evaluation of both PSG
             screening nights. Normal sleep will be defined as follows: LPS (Latency to
             persistence Sleep) &lt;30min., SE (Sleep Efficiency) &gt;85%, apnea/ hypopnea index &lt; 10,
             periodic leg movements (PLM) with arousal index &lt; 10. The apnea/hypopnea index is
             defined as &quot;the number of apneas and hyponeas divided by the total sleep time (TST)
             expressed in hours&quot;. PLMI is defined as &quot;the number of periodic leg movements
             associated with arousals or awakening divided by the total sleep time (TST) expressed
             in hour&quot;.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  A positive result for the pre-study urine drug/ alcohol breath screen.

          -  Abuse of alcohol.

          -  Subject complains of sleep disturbances and /or is receiving treatment for sleep
             disorders.
