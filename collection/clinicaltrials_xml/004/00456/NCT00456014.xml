      This study will use pre-treatment positron emission topography and functional magnetic
      resonance imaging scans of the brain to predict the most effective antidepressant treatment
      for people with major depressive disorder.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Major depressive disorder (MDD) is characterized by a combination of symptoms that can
      interfere with a person's ability to work, study, sleep, eat, and enjoy activities that were
      once pleasurable. Studies have shown that as little as 50% to 60% of individuals with MDD
      may respond to the first antidepressant medication prescribed. Currently psychiatrists lack
      tools that allow them to select the treatment plan that is most likely to benefit a
      particular individual. Some of the chemical abnormalities in the brains of people with MDD
      are detectable on positron emission topography (PET) scans. There are distinct differences
      in the PET scans of people with MDD who respond to treatment with a selective serotonin
      reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), people with MDD who do not respond to SSRI treatment, and people
      who do not have MDD. This study will use pretreatment PET and functional magnetic resonance
      imaging (fMRI) scans of the brain to predict which antidepressants will be most effective in
      people with MDD. This may help to reduce the trial and error currently associated with
      antidepressant treatment.

      Participants in this study will undergo one PET scan and one fMRI scan. Within 3 days of the
      scan, all participants will begin taking escitalopram, an SSRI, at a daily dose of 10 mg, or
      desipramine, a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (NRI), starting at 50mg and titrating to a
      therapeutic level. After 4 weeks, participants who have responded to treatment will continue
      for an additional 4 weeks on the current dose. Participants who are on escitalopram who do
      not respond to the medication at the end of 4 weeks will begin taking 20 mg of escitalopram
      per day. After 8 weeks on either medication, participants for whom medication does not
      succeed in relieving MDD symptoms will undergo a second antidepressant trial within the same
      class if this has not been done previously. Non-remitters to 2 within-class medication
      trials will be switched to the medication in the other group. Study visits will occur weekly
      for the first 4 weeks and then every other week for the remainder of the study. At visits,
      participants will meet with their psychiatrists to discuss how they have been feeling since
      the last visit, review medication side effects, and complete depression rating
      questionnaires. Outpatient participants will receive a total of 5 months of treatment for
      depression.
