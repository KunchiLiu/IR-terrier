  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will look at the effect of exenatide, a drug which has been approved for the
      treatment of type 2 diabetes, on body weight, appetite and energy expenditure among
      moderately obese women without diabetes.

      The study is 35 weeks long and includes 19 outpatient visits. Participants will receive
      exenatide for 16 weeks and placebo for 16 weeks with a 3 week rest period in between.
      Neither participants nor investigators will know whether exenatide or placebo is being
      administered. Participants will be started randomly on either exenatide or placebo.

      Our hypothesis is that treatment with exenatide will curb appetite and lead to weight loss
      and may lead to changes in energy expenditure.

      This study will examine the effect of exenatide on body weight, energy expenditure, satiety,
      sleep, and metabolic parameters in healthy, moderately obese women (BMI 28-35 kg/m2). We
      will look at 2 populations of women, one with normal glucose metabolism and one with
      impaired glucose homeostasis (IGH)--either impaired fasting glucose (IFG, fasting glucose
      101-125 mg/dL) or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT, glucose 140-199 mg/dL 2h after a 75g oral
      glucose load). This is a randomized, double blind, crossover study with two 16-week
      treatment periods separated by a 3-week washout period. There are 19 study visits over 35
      weeks.

      The goals of this study are 1) to examine the effect of exenatide on body weight and
      dysglycemia in populations in which this medication has not been studied, namely obese women
      with and without IGH and 2) to investigate possible mechanisms of weight loss through
      measurements of energy expenditure, hunger, satiety, nausea, and sleep.

      The primary outcome of this study is weight loss. We will calculate absolute and relative
      change in body weight from baseline to week 16 (the first treatment period) and from week 19
      to week 35 (the second treatment period). Body weight will be measured at every study visit
      which will also allow us to assess the absolute and relative change from baseline throughout
      the entire study.
