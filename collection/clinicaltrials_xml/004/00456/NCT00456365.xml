      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the medication pravastatin will ameliorate
      renal and cardiovascular disease over a 3-year period in children and young adults with
      autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most common hereditary kidney
      disease, affecting 1 in 400 to 1000 individuals and accounting for 4% of end-stage renal
      disease in the United States and 8-10% in Europe. The condition is characterized by
      progressive development of kidney cysts with kidney enlargement and associated loss of
      kidney function. High blood pressure and cardiovascular disease are common in patients with
      ADPKD. Although the condition is often thought to affect primarily adults, it is clear that
      the disease can be present in the fetus and young children.

      This study is designed to determine if treatment with the medicine pravastatin can slow the
      progression of kidney and heart disease when initiated early in life in patients with ADPKD.
      We will assess differences between pravastatin and placebo study groups over the three-year
      study period with respect to: 1) total kidney volume as assessed by magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI); 2) left ventricular mass index as assessed by MRI; 3) urinary albumin
      excretion; and 4) endothelial-dependent vasodilation as assessed by brachial ultrasound. A
      total of 100 subjects will be enrolled in this research study. This study will involve
      pediatric subjects because we believe that early intervention is critical if we are to
      decrease the morbidity and mortality associated with this condition. If pravastatin is shown
      to be effective in ameliorating progression of renal and cardiovascular disease in this
      study, routine management of people with this condition will be drastically altered.
