    <textblock>
      Trial of effects of minocycline as &quot;add-on&quot; therapy to adults with asthma with a history of
      requiring at least one episode of oral steroid therapy to control the disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study of adult asthmatics given
      minocycline 150 mg po BID or placebo as add-on therapy for eight weeks each. Each eight week
      arm is separated by a four week wash-out. Spirometry is performed at the baseline and end of
      each arm. Daily symptoms scores, peak flow rates, and oral steroid requirements are
      recorded. A standardized asthma quality of life symptoms assessment is made every four weeks
      (AQLQ, Juniper).
