  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adults who sustain brain damage due to stroke, traumatic injury or surgery may develop
      difficulty finding words. This study compares the effectiveness of two behavior-based
      programs to improve picture naming ability in these individuals.

      Difficulty finding words is common in patients with aphasia subsequent to left hemisphere
      stroke. This study will compare two cognitive therapies for the treatment of acquired word
      finding difficulties. The therapies use different types of cues. All participants will
      receive both therapies. Participants in this study will undergo a comprehensive and detailed
      assessment of language and other cognitive skills. The two treatments will be compared for
      their efficacy.
