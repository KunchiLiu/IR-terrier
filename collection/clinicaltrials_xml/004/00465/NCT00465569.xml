      The purpose of this study is to determine if small oral doses of milk protein are safe and
      effective in decreasing sensitivity to cow's milk in allergic children.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-center, clinical trial involving children aged 6 to 21 years
      with persistent cow's milk allergy. These children will be recruited from 2 sites (Johns
      Hopkins and Duke University) and will undergo initial screening and double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, food challenge (DBPCFC) to confirm threshold dose for reactivity to
      milk. Patients will be treated with milk oral immunotherapy (OIT) or placebo for 22-30
      weeks. Those who reach an adequate maintenance dose for OIT will undergo a second DBPCFC.
      Those who develop desensitization will continue with daily milk intake and undergo a third
      DBPCFC. Those in the treatment group who are not desensitized will return to strict
      avoidance. Those in placebo group will be offered to begin treatment or continue with strict
      milk avoidance. Symptom and diet information will be collected initially and at regular
      intervals. Bloodwork, skin prick tests (SPTs), pulmonary function tests (PFTs), and oral
      secretion samples will be done initially and at periodic intervals.
