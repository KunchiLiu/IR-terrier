      RATIONALE: Vaccines made from a tumor antigen may help the body build an effective immune
      response to kill tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and how well vaccine therapy
      works in treating patients who have received first-line therapy for Hodgkin's lymphoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine immunologic responses in patients who have completed first-line therapy for
           Hodgkin's lymphoma treated with Hodgkin's antigens-GM-CSF-expressing cell vaccine.

        -  Determine the durability of these immunologic responses in these patients.

        -  Determine the utility of an Epstein-Barr virus reporter system for monitoring cellular
           vaccine responses.

        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of this vaccine in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Beginning 4-6 months after last chemotherapy, patients receive Hodgkin's
      antigens-GM-CSF-expressing cell vaccine on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up to
      4 courses.

      Immunologic responses are serially monitored along with disease status.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 35 patients will be accrued for this study.
