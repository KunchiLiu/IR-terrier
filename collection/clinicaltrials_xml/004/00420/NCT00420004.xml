      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Meet criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD) without psychotic features.

          -  Have education level and a degree of understanding such that the patient can
             communicate with the site study personnel.

          -  Judged to be reliable and agree to keep all appointments for clinic visits, tests,
             and procedures, including venipuncture, and examinations required by the protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have had any additional, ongoing psychiatric condition other than major depression or
             dysthymia that was considered the primary diagnosis within 6 months of Visit 1.

          -  Have a lifetime history of Bipolar I or II Disorder, psychotic disorder, or a
             factitious disorder.

          -  Are judged to be at high risk for imminently harming themselves or others.

          -  Have a serious medical illness, including any cardiovascular, hepatic, respiratory,
             hematologic, endocrinologic, neurologic disease, or clinically significant laboratory
             or ECG abnormality. Clinically significant lab abnormalities are those which, in the
             judgment of the investigator, indicate a serious medical problem or require
             intervention.

          -  Have any diagnosed medical condition which could be exacerbated by treatment with
             LY2216684 including hypertension, increased heart rate, arrhythmias, heart disease,
             narrow angle glaucoma, or urinary hesitancy.
