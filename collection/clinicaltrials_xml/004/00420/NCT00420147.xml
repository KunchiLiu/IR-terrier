  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The five-year goal of this project is to investigate the effect of in-shoe wedged orthoses
      on lower extremity function in patients with knee osteoarthritis. In general, our aims
      address the immediate effects of orthoses, the long-term effects of orthoses, and the
      immediate and long-term treatment effects comparing medial versus lateral wedged orthoses.
      The investigators hypothesize the wedged orthosis will result in altered gait mechanics that
      reflect a reduction in knee joint forces, reduced knee joint pain and increased function
      during weight bearing activities.

      Introduction: In shoe wedged orthoses have been shown to be an effective conservative
      approach in reducing pain in patients with osteoarthritis (OA). The mechanism responsible
      for this pain reduction is not well-understood. It is not known whether placing a medial or
      lateral wedge in the shoe results in alterations in lower extremity alignment, knee joint
      moments or some combination of the two. In addition, it has been suggested that patients
      with lateral knee joint OA (treated with medial wedges) respond more favorably than those
      with the more commonly diagnosed medial knee joint OA. Finally, the longterm effects of this
      intervention on OA patients' functional status as well the progression of their OA has not
      been studied. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to examine the effect of in-shoe
      wedged orthoses in patients with knee OA on static alignment measures, dynamic lower
      extremity mechanics and functional measures. In addition, the longterm effect of this
      treatment will also be examined. Methods: 120 patients between the ages of 40-70 yrs with
      knee OA (grades I-IV) will be recruited from within the medical community. Subjects with a
      diagnosis of unilateral knee OA of greater than 3 months duration, as defined by the
      American College of Rheumatology Guidelines, will be included. 60 subjects with medial joint
      OA and 60 with lateral joint OA will be recruited. 30 subjects within each group will be
      assigned to a treatment or control group such that groups will be balanced in terms of OA
      severity (determined by grade). The treatment group will receive custom molded orthotics
      with a medial (for lateral OA) or lateral (for medial OA) wedge. Both the treatment and
      control groups will be tested initially and then again 1 year later. The dependant variables
      will include static alignment measures (tibiofemoral and mechanical axis angles),
      biomechanical variables (frontal plane rearfoot and knee angles and moments) and functional
      scores (WOMAC functional assessment score and VAS pain score during walking and stair
      negotiation). Statistics: A series of two-way ANOVAs will be used to test hypotheses in aims
      1 and 3. This design will include 2 levels of group (medial OA and lateral OA) and three
      levels of trials (pretest, wedge at initial, wedge at 1 yr.). Another series of two-way
      ANOVAs will be used to test hypotheses in aim 2. This design will include 2 levels of group
      (control and treatment) and two levels of trial (pretest and 1 yr posttest). Significance
      will be determined at a level of p&lt;.05.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosed unilateral knee osteoarthritis by a qualified physician

          -  Recent (within 3 months of entrance into the study) radiographic confirmation of OA
             grade (I-IV) as evidenced by joint space narrowing and the presence of osteophytes

          -  A score of 50-90 mm on a 100 mm visual analogue pain scale for walking

          -  Ability to walk independently without the use of assistive devices

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of lower extremity joint surgery or other lower extremity injury that would
             hinder ambulation

          -  Severe foot deformity that would prevent the accommodation of the wedged orthotic
             device

          -  Other disease process such as neurologic, cardiac, or oncologic, that would hinder
             one's ability to ambulate

          -  Any condition, such as diabetes, that results in loss of sensation in the lower
             extremities
