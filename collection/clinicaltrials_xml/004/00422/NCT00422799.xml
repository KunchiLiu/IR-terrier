  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, we are trying to find out if the combination of these two drugs is effective
      in treating Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (WM). The combination of these two drugs has not
      been studied for patients with relapsed or refractory macroglobulinemia. The U.S. Food and
      Drug Administration (FDA) has approved bortezomib for the treatment of multiple myeloma, a
      cancer that is closely related to Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia.

      -  Participants will receive 6 cycles of the study treatment with bortezomib and
           rituximab. Each cycle is 28 days long (4 weeks).

        -  Participants will receive Rituximab intravenously once a week for the first and fourth
           cycles only. Participants will receive bortezomib once a week for three weeks on and
           one week off every cycle, for a total of 6 cycles.

        -  During the rituximab infusion, the participants blood pressure and pulse will be
           monitored frequently. The rate of infusion may be decreased depending upon the side
           effects that are experienced.

        -  Blood samples will be collected before the first dose and on follow up with every
           cycle. Blood counts will also be performed every week.

        -  Routine physical exams will be performed at each evaluation. A PET/CAT scan of the
           chest, abdomen and pelvis at the end of treatment. This scan is required to assess the
           response of the participants disease.

        -  In order to learn more on how bortezomib and rituximab affect WM, a bone marrow biopsy
           will be performed.

        -  We anticipate that participants will complete the active therapy over a period of 6
           cycles provided that they are benefiting from therapy and have not had any serious side
           effects. The participant will be followed every three months for 2 years for office
           visits and laboratory tests.
