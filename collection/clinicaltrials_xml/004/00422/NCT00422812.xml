  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Staccato Prochlorperazine is being developed to treat patients suffering from acute migraine
      headaches. In October 2005, we completed a 75 patient, multi-center, double-blind
      placebo-controlled Phase 2A clinical trial in patients suffering from moderate to severe
      acute migraine headaches. This Phase 2B clinical trial of Staccato Prochlorperazine has been
      initiated to assess the efficacy and safety in outpatients with migraine headache with or
      without aura.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male and female patients between the ages of 18 to 70 years, inclusive.

          2. Patients who have migraine headache with or without aura (diagnosis according to
             International Headache Society guidelines) for at least 6 months.

          3. Patients who have a history of migraine and have had at least 3 migraine attacks in
             the last 3 month period (but not more than 8 migraine attacks per month). Current and
             past migraine medication history must be recorded.

          4. Patients who agree to: not use the study drug within 72 hr of a prior migraine
             attack, and to use the investigational medication when they have a pain rating of
             Moderate or Severe (on a None, Mild, Moderate or Severe Scale) prior to dosing.

          5. Patients who speak, read, and understand English sufficiently well and are willing
             and able to provide written informed consent on an IRB approved form prior to the
             initiation of any study procedures.

          6. Patients who are willing and able comply with the study schedule and study
             requirements, and agree to return to the clinic within 5 working days of use of the
             investigational treatment.

          7. Patients who are in good general health prior to study participation as determined by
             a detailed medical history, physical examination, 12-lead ECG, blood chemistry
             profile, hematology, urinalysis and in the opinion of the Principal Investigator.

          8. Female participants (if of child-bearing potential and sexually active) and male
             participants (if sexually active with a partner of child-bearing potential) who agree
             to use a medically acceptable and effective birth control method throughout the study
             and for one week following the end of the study. Medically acceptable methods of
             contraception that may be used by the participant and/or his/her partner include
             abstinence, birth control pills or patches, diaphragm with spermicide, intrauterine
             device (IUD), condom with foam or spermicide, vaginal spermicidal suppository,
             surgical sterilization and progestin implant or injection. Prohibited methods
             include: the rhythm method, withdrawal, condoms alone, or diaphragm alone.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who are currently taking tricyclic antidepressants, valproate, divalproex,
             barbitals, thiazolidinediones, phenothiazines, benzodiazepines, lithium or any

             (subarachnoidal bleeding, stroke, brain tumor) must be excluded.

         11. Patients who have any other disease(s), by history, physical examination, or
             laboratory abnormalities (ALT or AST &gt; 2-fold the upper limit of normal, Bilirubin &gt;
             1.5 mg/dL, or creatinine &gt; 1.8 mg/dL) or that in the investigator's opinion, would
             present undue risk to the patient or may confound the interpretation of study results
             must be excluded.

         12. Patients who have a history of asthma or chronic obstructive lung disease should be
