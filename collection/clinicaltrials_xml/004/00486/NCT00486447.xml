      Single Positron Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) in patients with an intermediate risk
      of CAD.

      This study is a prospective, multi-center, within-subject comparative study. One hundred
      fifty (150) subjects with CATH procedures are needed in the study. Approximately 300
      subjects who meet all of the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be enrolled. The study
      population will consist of subjects with symptoms suspected of and at intermediate-risk for
      ischemic heart disease, which are referred for MPS for a definitive diagnosis of CAD.

      Each subject will undergo the following procedures:

        -  A Myocardial Perfusion Study (MPS) procedure, as standard of care;

        -  An IV contrast-enhanced cardiac CT (CCTA) procedure;

        -  A CATH procedure when the MPS and/or cardiac CT examination is deemed positive or
           equivocal and at the discretion of the referring physicians, as a standard-of-care
           procedure.

      When both the MPS and CCTA are normal, the subject is not required to undergo a CATH
      procedure, but will enter into follow-up. The research staff at each site will perform
      follow-up for each subject at 12 months (± 15 days) and 24 months (± 15 days) and 36 months
      (± 15 days) after the completion of the cardiac CT procedure.
