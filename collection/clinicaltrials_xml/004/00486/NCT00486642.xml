  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial is studying how well giving pazopanib with or without
      bicalutamide works in treating patients with prostate cancer that did not respond to hormone
      therapy. Pazopanib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed
      for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Androgens can cause the growth of
      prostate cancer cells. Antihormone therapy, such as bicalutamide, may lessen the amount of
      androgens made by the body. Giving pazopanib hydrochloride together with bicalutamide may be
      an effective treatment for prostate cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the therapeutic activity of GW786034 (pazopanib hydrochloride) with and
      without bicalutamide in the treatment of hormone-refractory prostate cancer using prostate
      specific antigen (PSA)-response rate.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate objective tumor response in patients with measurable disease. II. To estimate
      the median time to progression. III. To investigate the safety and tolerability of GW786034
      with and without bicalutamide.

      IV. To estimate the median duration of PSA-response. V. To determine the steady state levels
      of GW786034 with and without bicalutamide.

      VI. To investigate the correlation between prior exposure to bicalutamide and non-steroidal
      anti-androgens with response and survival outcomes.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive pazopanib hydrochloride orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28.

      ARM II: Patients receive pazopanib hydrochloride PO QD on days 1-28. Patients also receive
      bicalutamide PO QD on days 8-28 of course 1 and on days 1-28 in all subsequent courses.

      Courses in both arms repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 4 weeks for 12 weeks.
