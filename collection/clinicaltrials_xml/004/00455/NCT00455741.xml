      The purpose of the study is to study the effects of aging, estrogen and progesterone on the
      brain. Specifically, we want to look at how the hypothalamus and pituitary (two small glands
      in the brain) respond to estrogen. The pituitary gland is controlled by the hypothalamus.
      The hypothalamus secretes GnRH (Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone) that signals the pituitary
      to secrete the reproductive hormones, LH (Luteinizing Hormone) and FSH (Follicle Stimulating
      Hormone). These hormones act on the ovaries and signal the ovaries to produce estrogen and
      progesterone. Estrogen in the bloodstream then acts on the brain to stop this system when
      the blood has sufficient estrogen levels. This is called estrogen feedback. This study will
      determine which areas of the brain are affected by estrogen feedback by administering
      estrogen and progesterone, both natural hormones.

      The transition to menopause is characterized by a decline in the numbers of functional
      ovarian follicles followed by a decrease in levels of inhibin A and B and complex changes in
      estradiol, which include an initial increase followed by an inevitable decrease. Therefore,
      there are dynamic changes in the hypothalamic-pituitary feedback from the aging ovary, prior
      to the ultimate loss of feedback that occurs with the complete cessation of ovarian
      function. While there is ample evidence that the loss of ovarian function is a major
      contributor to the menopause, there is evidence from animal models that primary age-related
      neuroendocrine changes may also contribute to reproductive aging. Specifically, there is
      evidence for changes in the hypothalamic and pituitary responses to estrogen negative and
      positive feedback. An understanding of the age-related changes in the physiology of the
      hypothalamic and pituitary responsiveness to gonadal steroid feedback is critical in
      determining whether hypothalamic and pituitary changes per se contribute to the menopause
      and the impact of the loss of reproductive function on the brain.

        Two groups of postmenopausal women, young (age 45-55) and old (age 70-80) who meet the
        following criteria:

          -  History of natural menopause defined by the absence of menses for at least 12 months
             (or history of surgical menopause defined as bilateral oophorectomy)

          -  On no hormonal medication or herbal supplements and/or over the counter menopause
             therapy for a minimum of 2 months prior to study

          -  Normal TSH, PRL and CBC, and Factor V activity

          -  Normal BUN and Creatinine (&lt; 2 times the upper limit of normal)

          -  BMI between 18 to 30 kg/m2

          -  No absolute contraindications to the use of physiologic replacement doses of estrogen
             and/or progesterone and no history of coronary artery disease

          -  On no medications thought to act centrally on the GnRH pulse generator. An increased
             FSH measured at the screening visit will be consistent with menopause. If the initial
             determination is low, a repeat sample may be drawn.

          -  No prior history of breast cancer or blood clots

          -  Non-smokers or smokes less than 10 cigarettes/day

          -  No prior history of allergic reaction to any dyes used with x-rays or scans and/ or
             any other contraindications to PET scans

          -  Will not have metal implants, pacemakers, aneurysm clips, implanted hearing aids
             and/or any other contraindications to MRI scan
