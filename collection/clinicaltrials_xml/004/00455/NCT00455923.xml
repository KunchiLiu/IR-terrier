    <textblock>
      An 18 months randomised double-blind study with two parallel arms with start dose of inhaled
      SERETIDE 50/100mcg BD or FLIXOTIDE 100mcg BD, Phase I is 6 months where the patient will be
      up-titrated until well controlled is achieved, After 6 months the treatment continues
      without changes during 9 months = PhaseII. The aim is to investigate and evaluate the
      assumption that the combination therapy with SERETIDE controls mild persistent asthma better
      than inhaled corticosteroids(FLIXOTIDE) alone.
