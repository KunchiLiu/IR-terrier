  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Relacatib is being developed for the treatment of osteoporosis, osteoarthritis and possibly
      other bone disorders. Recent results suggest that relacatib interacts with the way our
      bodies metabolise drugs and so some drugs which are commonly prescribed to the intended
      target patient population could be affected by giving relacatib at the same time. The
      purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of repeat dose administration of relacatib
      on the way subjects bodies metabolise three commonly prescribed medications in the
      osteoarthritis population: ibuprofen, acetaminophen, and atorvastatin.
