      Purpose of this study is to examine the effectiveness of an experimental psychotherapy (talk
      therapy) for the treatment of bipolar II depression. The name of this psychotherapy is
      Interpersonal and Social Rhythm Therapy for Bipolar II Depression (IPSRT-BPII). Subjects
      will be randomly assigned to receive either IPSRT-BPII or the medication Seroquel
      (quetiapine) to manage their symptoms of bipolar II depression. Subjects will receive the
      assigned therapy for up to 20 weeks.

      The proposed pilot study is an experimental design intended to investigate the preliminary
      efficacy of Interpersonal Social Rhythm Therapy for Bipolar II Depression (IPSRT-BPII). A
      total of 56 eligible subjects with a diagnosis of bipolar II disorder will be randomly
      assigned to one of two treatment groups : Seroquel (n=28) or IPSRT-BPII (n=28). Following
      baseline assessment, all participants will undergo up to 20 weeks of their assigned
      treatment. Patients assigned to IPSRT-BPII who fail to respond (at least 50% reduction in
      HRSD-25 scores and YMRS ≤ 10) by week 12 will have Seroquel added to IPSRT-BPII. Subjects
      who achieve remission (defined as 3 consecutive weeks where both HRSD-25 and YMRS scores
      average ≤ 7) and have participated in the trial for a minimum of 12 weeks will be moved into
      a continuation phase where they will receive maintenance treatment (bi-monthly therapy
      sessions and/or pharmacotherapy) until week 20. Patients who do not achieve remission by
      Week 20 will be discontinued from treatment and referred for follow-up care. All subjects
      (remitters and non-remitters) will be assessed at 20 weeks.

    <description>IPSRT is comprised of three components: psychoeducation, social rhythm therapy, and standard IPT as developed for unipolar depression.
Psychoeducation focuses on a) the illness and its consequences, b) treatment options and associated side effects, and c) prodromal symptoms/detection of early warning symptoms.</description>

    <description>Subjects will be started at 100 mg/day titrated to a maximum of 800 mg /day
Day 1-BID doses totaling 100 mg/day, increased to 400 mg/day on Day 4 in increments of up to 100 mg/day in BID divided doses, by Day 6 begin titration up to a maximum dose of 800 mg/day in increments no greater than 200 mg/day.
This titration schedule may be adjusted based on the subject's response and ability to tolerate Seroquel.
Subjects who are unable to tolerate the study medications, or for whom the study medications are an inappropriate clinical choice, will be treated openly by a clinic physician according to the standard of care guidelines designated by the American Psychiatric Association (2002) for the treatment of bipolar disorder. Subjects receiving standard of care treatment will continue to be seen and assessed per the protocol schedule.</description>

             psychotic at time of evaluation);

          2. Unwilling or unable to comply with study requirements;

          3. Meets DSM-IV criteria for borderline personality disorder or antisocial personality
             disorder;

          4. Active substance abuse within the past 6 months(episodic abuse related to mood
             episodes will not exclude a subject);

          5. Currently a high suicide risk, as assessed by an active plan and intent to behave in
             a way that risks ending ones life;

          6. Non-English speaking;

             treatment with pharmacotherapy

          8. Currently applying for disability because of psychiatric illness (we have found that
             these individuals have a vested interested in appearing to remain ill which
             potentially confounds outcome scores).

          9. Women who are pregnant, lactating or plan to become pregnant during their study
             participation.
