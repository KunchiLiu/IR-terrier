  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GSK233705 is a high-affinity specific muscarinic receptor (mAChR) antagonist which is being
      developed for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. This is a randomised,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose ascending, parallel group study to examine the
      safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of twice daily inhaled doses of
      GSK233705B for 7 days, in COPD subjects.
