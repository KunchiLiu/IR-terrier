  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study compares two different brands of thyroxine (thyroid hormone). Currently,
      pharmacists may be substituting generic formulations of thyroid hormone without your doctor
      knowing about this. Although a small difference in thyroid function is not significant in
      most healthy children, adolescents and adults, in infants and toddlers even a small
      difference in thyroid function can have important harmful consequences on brain development.
      The purpose of the present study is to learn whether the difference between brands of
      thyroid hormone that are currently being substituted is sufficient to cause a difference in
      thyroid function.

      This study is an unblinded, randomized controlled cross-over study, which involves taking 2
      different forms of levothyroxine sequentially over a 16 week period. Subjects will have a
      total of 3 visits over this time period. At the first visit, subjects are randomized to
      receive either generic (Sandoz) levothyroxine or Synthroid (Abbott) brand of levothyroxine.
      Blood is drawn for baseline thyroid function studies and other markers which are influenced
      by thyroid hormone at each visit. The second visit is the cross-over visit, and the final
      visit is a close-out visit, after which each subject will resume taking their previous
      formulation of levothyroxine.
