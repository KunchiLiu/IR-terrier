      RATIONALE: Lenalidomide may stop the growth of kidney cancer by blocking blood flow to the
      tumor.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well lenalidomide works in treating patients
      with advanced or unresectable kidney cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Evaluate the best response in patients with advanced or unresectable renal cell
           carcinoma (RCC) treated with lenalidomide.

        -  Evaluate the response duration, time to tumor progression, and survival of patients
           with advanced RCC treated with lenalidomide.

        -  Evaluate the safety of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label study.

      Patients receive oral lenalidomide daily on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 26 patients will be accrued for this study.
