  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial combines dose dense chemotherapy with Doxorubicin and Cyclophosphamide (AC)
      followed by standard every 3 week docetaxel and GW572016 for neoadjuvant treatment of
      her2neu positive stage II/III breast cancer. GW572016 or Lapatinib, the investigational
      agent, acts as a duel inhibitor of both epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and ErbB-2
      (Her2/neu) tyrosine kinase activity. EGFR and ErbB2 receptors are frequently over-expressed
      or altered in human cancers including breast cancer. This study plans to determine the
      antitumor activity of this regimen and its effectiveness of preventing tumor growth and
      spread.

      This trial combines dose dense chemotherapy with Doxorubicin and Cyclophosphamide (AC)
      followed by standard every 3 week docetaxel and GW572016 for neoadjuvant treatment of
      her2neu positive stage II/III breast cancer. GW572016 or Lapatinib, the investigational

      antitumor activity of this regimen and its effectiveness of preventing tumor growth and
      spread.

      The primary objective of the study is to improve pathological complete response rates with
      the addition of dual EGFR blockade. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy which achieves pathologic
      complete responses (pCR) has been shown to predict improved long-term survival and serves as
      a surrogate for clinical outcome. By using this primary endpoint we can obtain statistical
      data with smaller patient numbers and at a lower overall cost. Additionally, we hope to
      correlate clinical and radiologic outcomes with gene expression data.

                       should be used.

          -  Eligibility of patients receiving medications or substances known to affect, or with
             the potential to affect the activity or pharmacokinetics of GW572016 will be
             determined following review of their use by the Principal Investigator

               -  Antacid use is prohibited 1 hour before and 1 hour after GW572016 dosing.

               -  All herbal (alternative) medicines are prohibited. In addition please see
                  section 6.6 of the protocol regarding medications that are prohibited during the
                  administration of GW572016 and for the duration of GW572016.

          -  The effects of GW572016 on the developing human fetus at the recommended therapeutic
             dose are unknown. For this reason, women of child-bearing potential and men must

          -  HIV-positive patients receiving combination anti-retroviral therapy are excluded from
             the study because of possible pharmacokinetic interactions with GW572016. Appropriate

             when indicated.

          -  Patients with GI tract disease resulting in an inability to take oral medication,
             malabsorption syndrome, a requirement for IV alimentation, prior surgical procedures
