      This study is to examine the safety of daptomycin in patients with End Stage Renal Disease.

      Patients with moderate or severe renal insufficiency (CLcr &lt;50 mL/min) are not only at
      increased risk of infection, but also have worse outcomes from a given infection. In fact,
      infection accounts for the second leading cause of mortality among patients with end-stage
      renal disease (ESRD). Many of these infections are due to sepsis, primarily rising from the
      vascular access and peritoneal catheter sites.

      This is an open label, non-randomized, non-comparative Phase 1 study designed to evaluate
      the PK profile, safety and tolerability of i.v. daptomycin. Non-infected subjects with end
      stage renal disease undergoing HD or CAPD will be enrolled in this in-patient study.
