  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of the study is to estimate the time from the first dose of LY573636 to
      the date your physician determines that your disease has progressed or worsened.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will receive a 2-hour intravenous infusion of study drug (LY573636) once every 21
      days or 28 days depending on their target dose. Radiological imaging scans will be performed
      before the first dose of study drug and then after every other treatment. Patients will be
      assessed for clinical progression at every visit and for response approximately every 42
      days or 56 days (every other cycle).
