          3. Patients who have a history of migraine and have had at least 3 migraine attacks in
             the last 3 month period (but not more than 8 migraine attacks in the last month).

          4. Patients who have been pain free for at least 48 hours since the end of their last

          5. Patients who have not taken any acute migraine or pain medication within 48 hours
             prior to dosing (including OTC products).

          6. Patients who have a pain rating of Moderate or Severe (on a None-Mild-
             Moderate-Severe Scale) prior to dosing.

          7. Patients who speak, read, and understand English and are willing and able to provide

          8. Patients who are willing and able to comply with the study schedule and requirements,
             are willing and able to travel to the Clinical Research Unit (CRU) for treatment and
             stay at the CRU for approximately a 4-6 hour period, and agree to return to the
             clinic within 5 working days of use of the investigational treatment.

          9. Patients who are in good general health prior to study participation as determined by
             a detailed medical history, physical examination, 12-lead ECG, blood chemistry
             profile, hematology, urinalysis, and in the opinion of the Principal Investigator.

         10. Female participants (if of child-bearing potential and sexually active) and male
