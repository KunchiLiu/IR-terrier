  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out if a new investigational hepatitis B virus vaccine,
      HEPLISAV™, is safe and effective compared with Engerix-B® vaccine in subjects 11-55 years
      old. The primary hypothesis is that the seroprotective immune response of HEPLISAV™ is at
      least as good as that of Engerix-B®.

      This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of two injections of HEPLISAV™, compared
      with three injections of a commercially available hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccine,
      Engerix-B®, in subjects 11 to 55 years old. About 1,740 subjects will be included in the
      study. Once subjects are consented, screened, and randomized to treatment, all subjects will
      receive a total of three injections over a 24-week period, with a follow-up visit at 28
      weeks. Subjects randomized to Engerix-B® will receive 3 injections of active vaccine, while
      subjects randomized to HEPLISAV™ will receive 2 injections of active vaccine plus 1
      injection of placebo. Safety and tolerability will be evaluated by occurrence of adverse
      events, periodic laboratory tests, vital signs, and local/systemic reactogenicity.

      Comparison: Subjects will receive treatment with either HEPLISAV™ or the comparator vaccine,
      Engerix-B®.
