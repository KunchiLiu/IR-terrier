      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of 60mg of MCI-186 via
      intravenous drip once a day in patients with ALS whose severity is classified as grade III,
      based on the changes in the revised ALS functional rating scale (ALSFRS-R) scores after 24
      weeks administration in double-blind, placebo-controlled manner. And in addition, this study
      will be performed to examine the safety of MCI-186 to ALS patients who met severity
      classification III.

             and so on, or they need to be administered antibiotics to infection.

          -  Patients who complain the difficulty in breathing caused by deteriorating the
             respiratory function.

          -  Patients with such complications as Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, dementia,
             renal failure, or other severe complication, and patients who have the anamnesis of
             hypersensitivity to edaravone.

          -  Pregnant, lactating, and probably pregnant patients, and patients who want to become
