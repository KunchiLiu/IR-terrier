  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For advanced head and neck cancer, combined radiation and chemotherapy prevents recurrences
      and for many patients, improves survival. While combined cisplatin and radiation or
      cetuximab and radiation is more effective than radiation alone, approximately 50% of these
      patients will still recur. A more aggressive approach may be needed for these patients to
      prevent recurrence and death. The strategy of using multiple chemotherapy drugs with
      radiation given twice a day has been tested at Mount Sinai and University of Chicago.
      Approximately 80% of patients are cured with this strategy. While cure rates are higher than
      standard chemotherapy and radiation and the treatment is tolerable, side effects during
      treatment are common. We propose replacing a chemotherapy drug with a less toxic, targeted
      therapy called cetuximab. Our goal is to reduce toxicity while maintaining or improving cure
      rates for these patients.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 18 years or older

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of squamous cell or poorly
             differentiated carcinomas of the head and neck or lymphoepithelioma

          -  No prior chemotherapy or radiotherapy

          -  Prior surgical therapy will consist only of incisional or excisional biopsy, and
             organ sparing procedures such as debulking of airway-compromising tumors or neck
             dissection in a patient with an existing primary tumor

          -  Karnofsky performance status of &gt;= 70%

          -  Intact organ and bone marrow function

          -  Obtained informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Demonstration of metastatic disease (i.e. M1 disease).

          -  Patients with a history of severe allergic reaction to docetaxel or other drugs
             formulated with polysorbate 80. History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds
             of similar chemical or biologic composition to cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil, or
             hydroxyurea.

          -  Other coexisting malignancies or malignancies diagnosed within the previous 3 years
             with the exception of basal cell carcinoma, cervical cancer in situ, and other
             treated malignancies with no evidence of disease for at least 3 years.

          -  Prior surgical therapy other than incisional or excisional biopsy and organ-sparing
             procedures such as debulking of airway-compromising tumors or neck dissection in a
             patient with an unknown primary tumor. Any non-biopsy procedure must have taken place
             less than 3 months from initiating protocol treatment.

          -  Incomplete healing from previous surgery

          -  Pregnancy or breast feeding (men and women of child-bearing potential are eligible
             but must consent to using effective contraception during therapy and for at least 3
             months after completing therapy)

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure (CHF), unstable angina pectoris,
             cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit
             compliance with study requirements

          -  Patients with clinically significant pulmonary dysfunction, cardiomyopathy, or any
             history of clinically significant CHF are excluded. The exclusion of patients with
             active coronary artery disease will be at the discretion of the attending physician.

          -  Uncontrolled active infection unless curable with treatment of their cancer.
