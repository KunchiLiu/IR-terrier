      The purpose of this study is to assess the effects of the treatment combination of the
      commercially available chemotherapy drugs, docetaxel and liposomal doxorubicin, and a blood
      thinner Enoxaparin on pancreatic cancer. The main goal of the study is to find out if this
      combination chemotherapy and enoxaparin increases the number of individuals whose tumors
      shrink.

      The objective of the study is to determine the safety and efficacy of the combination of
      docetaxel and liposomal doxorubicin chemotherapy combined with enoxaparin in patients with
      advanced pancreatic cancer.

      Docetaxel (TAXOTERE) belongs to the group of anticancer drugs called mitotic inhibitors.
      Liposomal doxorubicin (Doxil) is an anthracycline, and is thought to prevent nucleic acid
      synthesis that is needed to make DNA. Enoxaparin (Lovenox) is an anticoagulant. We are
      interested in combining chemotherapy with the blood thinner enoxaparin because there is a
      scientific link between blood clotting and malignancy.

      This research is being done to improve on currently available chemotherapy treatments for
      advanced pancreatic cancer. The main goal of the study is to find out if this combination
      chemotherapy and enoxaparin increases the number of individuals whose tumors shrink. Another
      purpose of this study is to find out how this study treatment effects blood clotting levels
      in individuals. We will also determine the incidence of elevated D-dimer and the effect of
      this regimen on the level of D-dimer, and collect safety data on this regimen.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically-confirmed pancreatic carcinoma, with at least one lesion measurable by
             CT scan with a longest diameter of &gt; 10mm, (other than bone) that has either not been
             previously irradiated, or if previously irradiated, has demonstrated progression
             since the radiation therapy based on RECIST criteria.

          -  Locally-advanced unresectable disease or be ineligible for neo-adjuvant therapy
             (Stage III disease, unresectable and medically unfit for neo-adjuvant treatment or
             decline chemo radiation treatment) or have metastatic disease.

          -  18 years of age or greater. Female patients with child-bearing potential must have a
             negative pregnancy test at screening. All patients of reproductive potential must
             agree to practice effective contraception in order to participate in this study for
             duration of treatment and for 3 months post.

          -  WBC &gt;3000 cells/mm3 with segments over 1800, hemoglobin &gt;10 g/dl, platelets &gt;150,000
             cells/mm3, creatinine &lt;1.5 mg/dl.

          -  Hepatic function: Total Bilirubin &lt;/= ULN. AST and ALT and Alkaline Phosphatase must
             be within the range allowing for eligibility. In determining eligibility the more
             abnormal of the two values (AST or ALT) should be used.

          -  ECOG performance status of &lt;/= 2 and an expected survival of at least 3 months.

          -  Stable neurological status without clinical evidence of CNS metastases and/or stroke.
             Peripheral neuropathy must be &lt;/= Grade 1.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Chemotherapy or radiation therapy within the preceding 4 weeks. Patients must never
             have had docetaxel or liposomal or regular doxorubicin.

             than 4 weeks prior to study entry. Fine needle aspirations or venous access devices
             are allowed if placed &gt; 7 days before study treatment begins.

          -  Presence of active or suspected acute or chronic uncontrolled infection, including
             abscess or fistula
