      This study uses transplantation to treat patients with problems in their immune system. The
      immune system cells come from the bone marrow where they grow from special cells called stem
      cells. Giving patients stem cells from someone else may help to cure many patients with
      certain immune diseases. This is called 'bone marrow transplantation'. This procedure can
      have side effects that are life-threatening. To try to make transplantation safer we are
      using lower doses of the medications used in preparing the patient for the transplant.

      'Conditioning' treatments are given to patients to create space in their bone marrow. This
      lets the cells of the donor go into the bone marrow and produce normal immune cells. This
      study will use lower doses of a drug called busulfan and lower doses of radiation than what
      are currently being used in other kinds of bone marrow transplantation for other diseases.

      Another problem that can occur with bone marrow transplantation is 'graft-versus-host
      disease'. This happens when the cells of the donor attacks different parts of the patient s
      body. This study will use a medicine called sirolimus instead of the usual medicine,
      cyclosporine, to prevent graft-versus-host disease.

      To go onto this study, you must have:

        1. A severe immune deficiency, such as chronic granulomatous disease or leukocyte adhesion
           deficiency.

        2. Have problems from the disease that call for stem cell transplantation.

        3. You must also be between the ages of 3 and 65 years.

      Two groups of patients are included in this study:

        1. Patients who have a brother or sister that have stem cells that match the patient. This
           is known as an allogeneic matched sibling transplant.

        2. Patients who do not have a matched sibling donor but have a donor that matches in the
           National Marrow Donor Program. This is know as matched unrelated donor transplantation.

      Patients will have the following procedures:

        -  To create space in the bone marrow, patients are given two drugs, Campath-1H and
           busulfan. To prevent the body from getting rid of the donated cells, patients are given
           sirolimus. On the day before the BMT, patients in the matched unrelated donor group
           also receive a low-dose of whole-body radiation. This will further improve the chances
           that the patients body will accept the donor cells.

        -  Patients will get the donor stem cells through an intravenous (IV) line that goes into
           a vein in their body. The cells make their way to the bone marrow space and slowly
           refill the marrow over the next several weeks. Patients will usually stay in the
           hospital for 30 days after the transplant.

        -  For the first 3 months after the transplant, patients are watched closely. The patients
           will have frequent visits to the clinic. During these visits the patient will have a
           physical examination and blood tests. The doctor and nurse will also check any symptoms
           the patient may have. At day 100 after the transplant a sample of bone marrow is taken.

        -  Patients will continue to be followed periodically for at least 5 years after the
           transplant.

    <textblock>
      Congenital immunodeficiencies - including chronic granulomatous disease, leukocyte adhesion
      deficiency and others - comprise a group of disorders in which the immune system fails to
      develop normally due to a genetic defect. As a result, affected patients suffer from
      recurrent infections and have a significantly shortened life expectancy. The current
      management of these patients is limited to close surveillance for infections, administration
      of prophylactic antimicrobials, and rapid and aggressive treatment of suspected and
      documented infections with broad-spectrum antibiotics. Although often effective, these
      treatments can require long hospitalizations, impacting on the overall quality of life
      significantly, and lead to significant morbidity, such as renal failure and deafness.

      Currently, the only available cure for these disorders is bone marrow transplantation, which
      most commonly uses an HLA-matched related sibling as the donor (Allogeneic Stem Cell
      Transplantation). However, as only 30% of patients in the general population have an HLA-
      matched related sibling, allogeneic related transplantation is often not an option,
      resulting in the need for matched unrelated donor transplantation. The National Marrow Donor
      Program serves as both a national registry of volunteers who are willing to donate
      progenitor cells to eligible recipients as well as a repository of cord blood products.
      Despite continued improvement in the use of transplantation schemas including the
      development of nonmyeloablative regimens there remain significant morbidity and mortality
      associated with transplantation, in particular, graft versus host disease (GvHD).

      GvHD is a result of the graft recognizing host antigens as foreign, typically in the
      presence of inflammation, and results in a type of iatrogenic autoimmune disease. For
      patients with non-malignant diseases, the aim of the transplant is solely to replace the
      defective or deficient cell population. Furthermore, as a graft versus tumor effect is not
      required, regimens designed to establish tolerance induction and/or stable mixed chimerism
      may be preferable for cure in this patient population; therefore, alternate transplant
      strategies can and should be used to further suppress the development of any GvHD effects.
      To reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with transplantation, we propose to use a
      combination of uniquely designed conditioning regimens to achieve adequate engraftment in
      congenitally immunodeficient patients and subset of patients with
      autoinflammatory/immunodysregulatory conditions, using either alloPBSC transplantation for
      patients with an HLA-matched related sibling donor, or MUD transplantation for those without
      an appropriate HLA-matched related sibling donor. For the alloPBSC transplantation (Group
      1), we propose using a novel busulfan-based, nonmyeloablative conditioning regimen combined
      with Campath-1-H or h-ATG, an immunosuppressive monoclonal antibody, and sirolimus, a
      tolerance inducing immunosuppressant used for GvHD prophylaxis. For the MUD transplantation
      (Group 2), we will also use a similar conditioning regimen, with a few modifications (due to
      the increased risk of graft rejection with HLA-matched but unrelated cells) to perform
      matched unrelated and cord blood transplantation in patients with immunodeficiencies. Given
      its novelty, this combination will be tested in a pilot trial and will be compared to
      historical controls.
