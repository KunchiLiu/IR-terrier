      This study is a cross sectional observational study to evaluate the prevalence of HLA-B*5701
      in the major French ethnotypes.

      Any HIV-1 infected subject will be eligible for this study including antiretroviral therapy
      (ART) na√É-ve and experienced subjects irrespective of abacavir use, as well as subjects
      previously tested for HLA-B*5701. Subjects will be approached during a standard clinic
      visit, and all subjects will be consented prior to any study specific procedure. Subjects
      will be asked to provide a tissue sample (cheek cells and blood sample) which will be used
      to assess HLA-B*5701 status by central and local methodologies.
