  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy, safety and tolerability, of AKR-501
      tablets, as compared to placebo, in the treatment of patients with chronic Idiopathic
      Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP).

    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, multi-center, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging,
      parallel-group study. The PK and PK/PD relationship of AKR-501 will also be studied.
      Approximately 65 eligible patients will be randomized in a 3:3:3:3:1 ratio in a
      double-blinded fashion into one of five parallel treatment groups to receive daily doses of
      either AKR-501 2.5, 5, 10 or 20 mg or placebo for 28 days, respectively. Each AKR-501 dosing
      group will consist of 15 patients while the placebo group will consist of 5 patients. All
      study patients will be evaluated weekly (Days 3, 5, 7, 14, 21 and 28) for safety, efficacy,
      and (Days 7, 14, 21, and 28) AKR-501 pharmacokinetics while receiving study treatment with a
      final assessment for safety and effectiveness to be done 2 weeks after the last study dose
      (Day 42).

      At the completion of Visit Day 28±1, patients who complete 28±1 days of study dosing will be
      assessed for eligibility to enroll into the rollover Study 501-CL-004 based on this visit.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Men and women ≥ 18 years of age.

          2. Confirmed diagnosis of ITP according to American Society of Hematology (ASH)
             Guidelines ≥ 3 months prior to Day 1.

          3. If ≥ 60 years old, must have had either a bone marrow biopsy consistent with ITP
             within past 3 years or a good response (platelet count &gt; 100,000/mm^3) to a previous
             ITP treatment.

          4. Are refractory or relapsed after at least one prior ITP therapy (patients who are
             refractory and failed to achieve a platelet count ≥ 50,000/mm^3 despite steroids or ≥
             30,000/mm^3 to other prior ITP therapies, such as splenectomy, danazol, or
             immunosuppressive drugs. For patients who are relapsed, the platelet counts must be
             below 50,000/mm^3 if using steroids or 30,000/mm^3 if not prescribed steroids.)

          5. Patients receiving maintenance corticosteroids may be enrolled, as long as the
             corticosteroids have been administered at a stable dose (same milligram amount ± 10%)
             for ≥ 2 weeks prior to Screening Visit A and the investigator does not foresee the
             need to change the steroid dose during study participation. Patients should remain on
             this stable corticosteroid dose during study participation.

          6. Patients receiving stable dosages of cyclosporine A, mycophenolate mofetil,
             azathioprine or danazol may also be enrolled. The dosages of all these medications
             must be stable for at least 3 months prior to AKR-501 administration.

          7. Platelet count:

               -  Patients not receiving steroids (no steroid treatment for &gt; 2 weeks prior to the
                  Screening Visit A): platelets &lt; 30,000/mm^3 at Screening Visit A and within 96
                  hours prior to Day 1 (Screening Visit B)

               -  Patients receiving steroids: platelets &lt; 50,000/mm^3 at Screening Visit A and
                  within 96 hours prior to Day 1 (Screening Visit B).

          8. Women of child-bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test at Screening
             Visit A and Screening Visit B. (Childbearing potential is defined as any woman who
             has not been surgically sterilized and is premenopausal or peri-menopausal i.e., any
             menstrual flow within 12 months of Screening Visit A).

          9. Women of child-bearing potential and all men must agree to practice a medically
             approved form of contraception (one of the following must be used: condoms (male or
             female) with a spermicidal agent, diaphragm, or cervical cap with a spermicidal
             agent, IUD, hormonal contraception, abstinence).

         10. Willing and able to provide written informed consent before any study-related
             procedure.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Women who are pregnant and/or lactating.

          2. Splenectomy procedure performed 4 weeks prior to AKR-501 administration.

          3. Use of the following drugs or treatments prior to Day 1:

                  intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG).

          4. Participation in a clinical trial involving any investigational agent within 4 weeks
             of Day 1.

          5. Exposure to eltrombopag or AMG -531.

          6. Significant medical conditions or diseases as determined by the Investigator (e.g.,

             comply with protocol.

             requirements or give informed consent, as determined by the Investigator.

         14. History of, or current psychiatric illness likely to interfere with ability to comply
