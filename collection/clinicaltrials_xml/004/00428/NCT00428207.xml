      The purpose of this study is to determine:

        1. whether there is a difference between insulin aspart and insulin lispro in continuous
           insulin pump therapy

        2. whether duration of the insulin infusion set placement effect blood sugar control if
           the infusion set is in place for longer then 72-96 hours

    <textblock>
      Insulin instability in pump infusion systems can result in unexplained hyperglycemia in
      patients on continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) therapy. We have noted that some
      pump patients develop glycemic instability with use of insulin lispro, and that this
      resolves with change to insulin aspart. Several patients using lispro have reported noting a
      whitish precipitate in the infusion set, and in two cases we have examined the catheters and
      confirmed biochemically that this precipitate was insulin. Furthermore, in vitro studies
      indicate that insulin aspart is more resistant to isoelectric precipitation than insulin
      lispro. Although it has been rare for patients to notice a visible precipitate in the pump
      catheter, there is a subset of patients using lispro who have noted that their blood glucose
      levels will tend to rise 2 or more days after the insertion of a new pump infusion system.
      These findings mirror bench studies showing that the relative stability differences between
      aspart and lispro in pump infusion systems becomes more apparent over time.

      The endpoints examined in previous randomized clinical trials comparing aspart and lispro
      were not directed specifically at assessing the effect of insulin type on glycemic
      stability. In these previous studies, pump infusion systems were changed every 48 hours
      whereas most pump patients routinely replace their infusion catheters only every 72-96
      hours; this discrepancy may account for the failure of these trials to demonstrate the
      difference in the stability of insulin aspart and lispro that has been noted in clinical
      practice.

      This investigator-initiated clinical trial is intended to assess the safety and efficacy of
      CSII with insulin aspart compared to insulin lispro with use of pump infusion catheters for
      up to 96 hours.

    The differences in treatment could be better observed and monitored by using a continuous

    <description>Glycemic stability will be assessed by MAGE (Mean Amplitude of Glycemic Excursion)(5), M value of Schlichtkrull, standard deviation &amp; coefficient of variation using 7 point finger stick blood glucose measurements performed 48-96 hours after insertion of the pump infusion catheter. Data collected 48 to 72 hours post-catheter insertion will be analyzed separately from the data collected 72 to 96 hours post-catheter insertion. The mean of the measurements taken throughout the study will be used for calculation of the primary endpoint.</description>

    <description>Subjects will be randomly assigned to one of the two insulins by the statistician working in the study via random number generation. Half of the patients will begin with insulin aspart, and then will be crossed over to insulin lispro. The insulin sequence will be reversed for the other half of the patients.
Period 1: four weeks using insulin aspart in the pump, followed by Period 2: four weeks using insulin lispro in the pump, or vice versa depending on randomization.</description>
