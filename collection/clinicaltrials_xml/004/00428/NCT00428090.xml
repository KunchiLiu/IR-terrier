  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rosiglitazone (RSG) has been tested and is approved as a treatment for type II diabetes
      mellitus, a disease that occurs when the body ineffectively uses glucose. RSG XR, the
      investigational drug, is an extended-release form of RSG. This study tests whether RSG XR
      safely provides benefit to people with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD). RSG XR is
      a new approach to AD therapy and this study tests whether one's genes alter the
      effectiveness of RSG XR. Glucose is used by cells to make energy that they need to live.
      Changes in the ability of cells to use of glucose can lead to diseases like diabetes.
      Glucose levels may be lower in the brains of AD patients, and their brain cells may also use
      glucose less well than in unaffected people. The proper function of brain cells may be
      critical to memory and thought. If brain cells use glucose poorly, this might impact AD.
      Drugs that help brain cells properly use glucose may help a person maintain normal memory
      and thinking. Data suggesting that RSG may help AD patients was first seen in a small study
      at the Univ. of Washington and then from a larger international GSK study. In the first
      study, those receiving RSG once daily for 6 months scored better on 3 tests of memory and
      thought than those who did not receive RSG. In the GSK study, those that benefited most from
      therapy with RSG XR had a specific genetic pattern. They lacked the gene that caused them to
      produce apolipoprotein E e4 (APOE e4). Subjects who have the APOE e4 gene may have two
      copies, one from each parent, or they may have only one APOE e4 gene meaning that they
      inherited either the APOE e2 or APOE e3 version of the gene from one parent. Subjects with
      one copy of the APOE e4 gene remained fairly stable while those with two copies of APOE e4
      continued to worsen during the 6-month treatment. This study will directly test the effect
      of RSG XR on people who either have or lack the APOE e4 gene.
