  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to determine whether LY573636 is effective in treating
      platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. Patients will receive an intravenous infusion of study
      drug once every 28 days. CT scans and CA-125 tests will be done before the first dose and
      then after every other treatment.
