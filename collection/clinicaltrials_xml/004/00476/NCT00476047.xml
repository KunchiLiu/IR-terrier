      This phase II trial studies how well tositumomab and iodine I 131 tositumomab works in
      treating patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma
      (SLL) that have had their first decrease in or disappearance of signs and symptoms of cancer
      (first remission). Monoclonal antibodies, such as tositumomab and iodine I 131 tositumomab,
      may block cancer growth in different ways by targeting certain cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the progression-free survival at 2 years following administration of
      131I-tositumomab (tositumomab and iodine I 131 tositumomab) in patients with CLL/SLL who
      achieve a complete remission (CR) or partial remission (PR) with prior therapy.

      II. To improve the response rate by administering 131I-tositumomab to patients who have
      achieved a PR not a CR after any prior therapy.

      III. To eliminate residual disease (documented by flow cytometry or polymerase chain
      reaction [PCR]) using 131I-tositumomab in patients who have achieved a CR after any prior
      therapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the toxicities of 131I-tositumomab in 1st remission patients with previously
      treated CLL/SLL.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive tositumomab and iodine I 131 tositumomab intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes
      on day 0 and then again 7-14 days later over 30-60 minutes.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up weekly for 3 months, every 3
      months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.

             first treatment patients with CLL must have been either Rai stage III/IV disease or
             Rai stage I/II with evidence of disease activity as defined by the National Cancer
             Institute (NCI) 1996 guidelines, and patients with SLL must have been Stage III or IV
