  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to assess if the rate of febrile reactions following the
      co-administration of a booster dose of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines with standard infant
      vaccines is lowered when paracetamol is given prophylactically and to assess the impact of
      pneumococcal conjugate vaccine on pneumococcal and H. influenzae nasopharyngeal carriage
      compared to control group receiving meningococcal conjugate vaccine (GSK134612).

      This protocol posting deals with objectives &amp; outcome measures of the booster phase. The
      objectives &amp; outcome measures of the primary phase are presented in a separate protocol
      posting (NCT number = NCT00370318).
