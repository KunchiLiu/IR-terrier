  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Symptoms of Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS) can be attributed largely to dysfunction of
      the autonomic nervous system in opiate exposed neonates. Vagal tone is a readily available
      measure of autonomic nervous system functioning. NAS is a widely variable disorder with
      poorly understood pathophysiology; while all opiate exposed infants will exhibit some signs
      and symptoms of NAS, only approximately Â½ have severe enough symptoms to require
      pharmacologic therapy. This research seeks to determine the relationship between infant
      vagal tone and NAS severity. The determination of a link between newborn vagal tone and NAS
      severity could result in the prediction of infants at risk for severe NAS and provide these
      infants and mothers with intensified services and early treatment, thereby shortening the
      course of NAS in the infant.

    <description>An EKG will be obtained using a Physio-control EKG monitor (R wave Electronics of Florida) in standard application, with three chest leads. The EKG data is inputted into a vagal tone monitor (Delta Biometrix, Bethesda MD) which computes vagal tone from the EKG signal. This data is then transferred to a disk which is analyzed off-line.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Term infant (&gt;= 37 weeks by 1st or second trimester sonogram),

          -  In utero opiate exposure (either heroin or methadone) requiring a minimum of three
             day infant hospitalization after birth

          -  Delivery to a client active in drug abuse treatment

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Significant medical complications in the infant

          -  Circumcision within 24 hours of the proposed EKG/vagal tone measurement (circumcision
             has been found to affect vagal tone)
