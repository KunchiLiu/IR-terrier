  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects with advanced or metastatic (spread to other parts of the body) breast cancer that
      is HER2/neu-positive will take part in this study. This type of breast cancer has a high
      amount of a protein called HER2. HER2 is part of a family of receptors found on both cancer
      and normal cells. This family of receptors is important for cell growth and is found in many
      tumor types. The purpose of this research study is to compare an approved treatment for
      breast cancer capecitabine, also called Xeloda速, to the combination of capecitabine plus an
      experimental drug, lapatinib also known as Tykerb速, for treatment of advanced or metastatic
      breast cancer that is HER2/neu-positive.Capecitabine is an approved type of chemotherapy
      used to treat certain cancers including breast cancer. Capecitabine fights cancer by
      interfering with the ability of cells to divide and tumor growth. Lapatinib (Tykerb速) is
      considered &quot;investigational&quot;, which means the drug has not been approved by the US Food and
      Drug Administration (FDA) for sale as a prescription or over-the-counter medication.
      Lapatinib may slow or stop cancer cells from growing by inhibiting the growth of cancer
      cells. However, this theory has not been proven. The addition of the study drug (lapatinib)
      to capecitabine may help stop cancer cells as well as or better than capecitabine alone.
      Other studies have demonstrated activity and tolerability of lapatinib either alone or in
      combination with capecitabine in the treatment of breast cancer.Subjects will receive
      capecitabine and lapatinib. A treatment period will be 21 days long. This period is known as
      a &quot;cycle&quot;. All medications will be given by mouth. Subjects will take capecitabine for 2
      weeks straight (Day 1-14) followed by a 1 week without capecitabine (Day 15-21). Doses of
      lapatinib will be taken daily continuously for 21 days (Day 1-Day 21) which means that
      subjects will still take lapatinib on the week that they do not take capecitabine (Day
      15-21). Subjects will continue to receive these medications unless they experience severe,
      serious and/or excessive side effects, the cancer becomes worse, the subjects wishes to no
      longer participate or the study doctor feels it is not in the best interest to continue
      treatment.Tests and procedures such as physical exam, blood tests, CT or MRI, ECG, ECHO
      and/or MUGA tests will be conducted at one or more of the following time points: before the
      study starts, before each cycle, every 6 and 12 weeks, and after the last dose of
      capecitabine/lapatinib treatment.
