      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of the combination of mitoxantrone and
      GM-CSF on time to progression in patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer. To date,
      there are no curative treatments for prostate cancer that has become hormone-refractory.
      Treatments appropriate for prostate cancer at this stage include docetaxel, which, in
      combination with prednisone, has recently been shown to lead to a survival benefit, and
      mitoxantrone, which, to date, has been shown to lead to a more favorable outcome than
      steroids alone, but without a survival benefit. GM-CSF is a cytokine that is thought to lead
      to an enhanced antitumor immune response, presumably through induction of tumor necrosis
      factor and interleukin-1 expression, as well as growth and proliferation of macrophages and
      dendritic cells. Both preclinical models and Phase II studies have suggested that GM-CSF as
      a single agent may have antitumor activity in advanced prostate cancer. To date, the use of
      GM-CSF for the treatment of prostate cancer has been explored in different contexts, and,
      more specifically, as a single agent in androgen-independent prostate cancer (AIPC) and
      hormone-refractory prostate cancer (HRPC), in combination with thalidomide in hormone-naïve
      prostate cancer and androgen-dependent advanced prostate cancer with ketoconazole in AIPC,
      and finally with CTLA4 in HRPC. For patients with HRPC who have failed first line
      chemotherapy, few, non-curative options are available, one of them involving the use of
      mitoxantrone. On the basis of GM-CSF's mechanism of action, the addition of GM-CSF to a
      mitoxantrone-containing regimen may lead to enhanced antitumor activity in patients with
      HRPC.
