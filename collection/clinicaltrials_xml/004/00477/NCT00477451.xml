      We are developing Staccato™ Alprazolam for the treatment of Panic attacks associated with
      panic disorder. This study will provide an initial assessment of efficacy, and to continue
      to describe the tolerability and pharmacokinetics, of a single inhaled dose of Staccato
      Alprazolam on a doxapram-induced panic attack in patients with panic disorder.

      The study will be conducted at multiple centers. A total of 42 male and female panic
      disorder patients will be studied. The first 6 subjects will receive Staccato Alprazolam 1
      mg open label to validate the dose selection. The remaining 36 subjects will be treated with
      either Staccato Alprazolam at the chosen dose; or with Staccato Placebo in a double blind,
      randomized order.

             months of study entry must be excluded.

             on the test day must be excluded.

          3. Subjects who are taking benzodiazepines, SSRIs, or medication that is effective for
             the prevention or treatment of the patient's panic disorder (i.e., no patient will be

          9. Female subjects who are breastfeeding or have a positive pregnancy test must be
             excluded.

         10. Subjects who have any other disease or condition, by history, physical examination,
             or laboratory abnormalities that in the investigator's opinion, would present undue
             risk to the subject, or may confound the interpretation of study results must be
             excluded.
