      RATIONALE: Chemoprevention is the use of certain drugs to keep cancer from forming. The use
      of levonorgestrel may prevent ovarian cancer.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying how well levonorgestrel works in
      preventing ovarian cancer in patients at high risk for ovarian cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the impact of levonorgestrel on the relative frequency of apoptosis in the
           ovarian epithelium of patients at high risk for ovarian cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Estimate the impact of this drug on proliferation and transforming growth factor-beta
           (TGF-beta) expression in the ovarian epithelium of these patients.

        -  Assess the safety of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study. Patients
      are stratified according to menopausal status (premenopausal vs postmenopausal). Patients
      are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral levonorgestrel once daily.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo once daily. In both arms, treatment continues for
           4-6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, including on
           the day of surgery. Patients then undergo prophylactic salpingo-oophorectomy*.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed at 1 year.

      NOTE: * Patients who are unable to have surgery completed during the expected 4-6 weeks, may
      continue levonorgestrel or placebo for a time period no &gt; 5 months. Patients unable to
      undergo surgery within 5 months are removed from the study.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients will be accrued for this study.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS:

          -  At increased genetic risk for ovarian cancer AND planning to undergo risk-reducing
             salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO)

               -  Has ≥ 1 intact ovary

          -  Patients enrolled on clinical trial GOG-0199 and planning to undergo RRSO allowed

          -  Submission of fixed ovarian tissue (FN01) required

          -  Must meet 1 of the following additional criteria:

               -  Family of the patient has a documented deleterious BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation and
                  either the patient herself has tested positive for a deleterious BRCA1 or BRCA2
                  mutation or the patient has a first- or second-degree relative with a
                  deleterious BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation

                    -  No patient with a deleterious BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation whose first- or
                       second-degree relative has tested negative for the exact same mutation

               -  The family contains members with ≥ 2 ovarian* and/or breast cancers among the
                  first- or second-degree relatives (male relatives must be counted) of the
                  patient within the same lineage (this condition may be satisfied by multiple
                  primary cancers in the same person or, where breast cancer is required to meet
