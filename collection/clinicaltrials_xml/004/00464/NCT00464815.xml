    <textblock>
      Multicentre study with 2 treatment groups. Each subject will have 2 blood samples taken for
      immunogenicity analyses, one prior to vaccination and one taken 30 days later.

      The Protocol Posting has been updated in order to comply with the FDA Amendment Act, Sep
      2007.
