      The purpose of the study is to characterize the safety and immunogenicity of 1 dose of GSK
      Biologicals' meningococcal vaccine GSK134612 as compared to Menactra® in adolescents/adults
      11-25 years of age.

      The Protocol Posting has been updated in order to comply with the FDA Amendment Act, Sep
      2007.

      The protocol posting has been updated following a protocol amendment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects 11-25 years of age will be randomized to receive either the meningococcal vaccine
      GSK134612 or Menactra®. An additional non-randomized group of subjects aged 10 years (&lt; 11
      years of age) will be enrolled to receive meningococcal vaccine GSK134612 only (At the time
      the study begun, Menactra® was only licensed in the United States for individuals above 11
      years of age and therefore could not be used as a control vaccine in subjects less than 11
      years old).

      This study will be single-blind for the subjects 11 to 25 years of age and open for the
      subjects 10 to &lt; 11 years of age.
