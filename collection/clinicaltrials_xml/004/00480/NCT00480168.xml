      The purpose of this study is to observe patients aged 6-18 with various psychiatric
      diagnosis being treated with drugs called atypical antipsychotics to determine the effects
      of the drugs on growth, weight gain, and laboratory tests.

      Introduction: Antipsychotics have been used for many years to treat serious mental illnesses
      like schizophrenia and bipolar illness (manic depression). These older drugs carry a higher
      risk of side effects like shaking, stiffness, restlessness or uncontrolled movements. They
      may occur when the drugs are first taken, or later, after years of use. Newer drugs called
      atypical antipsychotics (ATA's) are much less likely to cause these problems. Their lack of
      these side effects and greater safety have led doctors to use them for other diseases in
      both adults and younger patients. They have proved to be helpful in aggression,
      impulsiveness, anxiety and mood swings. Unfortunately, a number of other side effects, such
      as weight gain, increased rates of diabetes and increases in cholesterol have also been
      identified. While a lot of current research into these side effects has been done in adults,
      there have been few studies with younger patients. The research so far has been brief and
      involved small numbers. This is especially important in this young and potentially
      vulnerable group of patients.

      Study Methods: This research will study children and teens aged 6 to 18 who are being
      treated with the newer drugs for the first time. If agreeable to the patients and their
      parents or guardians, their doctors will prescribe one of the newer drugs and will measure
      the effects, if any, on weight, blood sugar, cholesterol as well as the improvement in their
      condition. Weight, height, and blood work will be done before the drug is started, and 6 and
      12 months after they have been on it, comparing the results with their original values. The
      doctor, the patient and the parent or guardian will rate the patients' condition at these
      times, as well, to evaluate their improvement.

          -  Outpatients and inpatients

          -  A wide range of patients including those with ADHD, Tourette's disorder, anxiety,

          -  No initiation of or changes of doses of other psychotropic medication prescribed for

        Exclusion Criteria:

             metabolic changes anticipated with the medications)

          -  Concurrent medical conditions including diabetes or hyperlipidemia if, in the
             judgment of the treating physician, the use of atypical anti-psychotics would be
             contra-indicated. (patient safety)

          -  Substance abuse (may effect the reliability of the patients or confound weight or
             metabolic effects of the medications)
