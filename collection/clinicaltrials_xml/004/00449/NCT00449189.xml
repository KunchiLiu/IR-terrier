  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of mirtazapine (Remeron)
      in the treatment of PTSD. Primary Hypothesis to be tested: Veterans with PTSD will have
      improvement in their symptomatology after 8 weeks of treatment with mirtazapine compared to
      those treated with placebo. After completion of the placebo-controlled phase, patients who
      agree to continue in the study will be treated with open-label mirtazapine for an additional
      8 weeks.

      After meeting inclusion criteria, the patients enter an 8-week randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled treatment trial of mirtazapine. After completion of the
      placebo-controlled phase, patients may continue study participation in an open-label
      mirtazapine for an additional 8 weeks.

      The VA Pharmacy has an established working relationship with the investigators. The
      pharmacist maintains the randomization log and verifies the order for the placebo or
      mirtazapine (15mg) in look-a-like capsules. The investigators and patients are kept blind to
      the contents of the capsules until the end of the entire study. See procedure grid in
      attached Work Proposed Section attached. Based on symptomology and occurrence of side
      effects, the investigator increases the medication in 15 mg (one capsule) increments every
      week, as tolerated, until a maximum therapeutic benefit is achieved, not to exceed 45 mg/day
      (3 capsules). The dosing is at bedtime. Compliance is assessed by biweekly pill count.
      Patients are given supportive clinical management during the clinic visits. An investigator
      is available by telephone 24 hrs a day in case of emergency. Patients may be seen more often
      if needed. At the end of the placebo-controlled phase, if the patients agree to continue in
      the study (confirmed at every visit) and they have not experienced an intolerable side
      effect related to the study medication, the patient will stop the placebo-controlled
      medication and begin open label mirtazapine, starting with 15mg at bedtime and titrating as
      tolerated to a maximum of 60mg/day.
