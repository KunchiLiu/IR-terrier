  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized controlled trial of insertion of the levonorgestrel-releasing
      intrauterine device (LNG-IUD) immediately following dilation &amp; evacuation (D&amp;E) compared to
      delayed insertion 3-6 weeks post-abortion. Eighty-eight women undergoing D&amp;E between 15 0/7
      and 23 6/7 weeks gestation will be enrolled at Magee-Womens Hospital, Pittsburgh, PA. The
      primary outcome is LNG-IUD usage six months following enrollment. We hypothesize that more
      women receiving immediate insertion will be using the LNG-IUD 6 months after the D&amp;E
      procedure than women receiving delayed insertion. Secondary outcomes include the proportion
      receiving an IUD, continuation rate, complication rates, subject satisfaction, and quality
      of life. The utility of ultrasonography in predicting expulsion will also be examined.
      Anticipated problems include poor subject follow-up and coordinating the intra-operative
      study procedures.

      The D&amp;E will be performed by the investigator or a co-investigator in the usual fashion. The
      uterus will be sounded to the fundus. Once the D&amp;E is complete, the surgeon will check the
      post-enrollment exclusion criteria to ensure that no events during the D&amp;E made the subject
      ineligible. If the subject remains eligible, the randomization packet will be opened.

      Immediately Post-D&amp;E Procedure.

        1. Group 1: IUD will be placed per study protocol. The strings will be trimmed to be flush
           with the cervix. Using transabdominal sonography, the distance from the serosal surface
           of the uterine fundus to the distal tip of the IUD will be measured.

        2. Group 2: No additional procedures will be performed in the operating room.

      Post-Operative Care. The subject will then be taken to the recovery room for routine
      post-operative care.

        1. Group 1: A brief questionnaire will be administered. No additional procedures will be
           performed in the recovery room.

        2. Group 2: A brief questionnaire will be administered. The subject will be asked to start
           her previously chosen method of contraception.

        3. Subjects will be given a digital thermometer and will be asked to call if any
           temperature exceeds 38°C (100.4°F). If a subject reports a fever (&gt;38°C), an interim
           visit will be scheduled as described below.

      Day 21-42. Post-Abortion Visit at 1 month (PAV 1): will be scheduled on a weekday between
      8:30 am and 4:30 pm at the time most convenient for the subject. For Group 1, the visit may
      be on any day from day 21-42. For Group 2, the visit will be scheduled with the goal of
      inserting the LNG-IUD during the first 7 days of the menstrual cycle.

      Subjects will complete a questionnaire about symptoms since the D&amp;E, including pain and
      bleeding and subjects' history will be collected. Subjects also will complete a set of
      visual-analog scales about pain, bleeding, and quality of life. All subjects will have a
      bimanual exam to assess uterine size, cervical motion and adnexal tenderness. Women in Group
      1 will have a speculum exam to measure and, if necessary, trim the IUD strings. The length
      of the segment trimmed will be measured and recorded. If cervicitis or vaginitis is
      suspected, further evaluation will be performed with diagnosis and treatment by CDC
      guidelines as indicated. Women in group 2 will have their IUD placed.

      Day 56-70: Post-Abortion Visit at 2 months (PAV 2): may be scheduled any time within days
      56-70 but must be at least 21 days after PAV1. Subjects will complete a questionnaire and
      visual-analog scales about symptoms since the D&amp;E, including pain, bleeding, and quality of
      life and subjects' history will be obtained. Bimanual Examination will be performed to
      assess uterine size, cervical motion and adnexal tenderness. A speculum exam will be done to
      measure the strings and trim, if necessary. The IUD-Fundal Distance will be assessed by
      endovaginal sonography.

      Day 160-200: Telephone Interview at 6 month (TI 6). A questionnaire will be administered
      over the phone. Three attempts will be made to contact the subject by telephone. A certified
      letter with the questionnaire and a postage-paid envelope will be sent if the subject is not
      contacted.
