  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is designed to investigate the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics (as
      measured by serum cortisol) and safety of GW685698X in subjects with moderate hepatic
      impairment and in healthy subjects following a single oral inhaled dose of GW685698X. From
      the study results it should be possible to assess if there is an altered Risk: Benefit in
      patients with moderate hepatic impairment
