  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II study of perifosine in patients with chondrosarcomas, alveolar soft part
      sarcomas and extra-skeletal myxoid chondrosarcomas. Patients will receive perifosine 100 mg
      orally qhs with food until disease progression. The goals of this study include:

        -  In this study a daily dose of perifosine previously determined to be relatively
           non-toxic will be evaluated in patients with chondrosarcomas, alveolar soft part
           sarcomas and extra-skeletal myxoid chondrosarcomas.

        -  Response to therapy will be based on regression of measurable disease according to Choi
           criteria. Time to progression and duration of stable disease will be measured as
           secondary endpoints of the study.

      This is a phase II study of perifosine in patients with chondrosarcomas, alveolar soft part
      sarcomas and extra-skeletal myxoid chondrosarcomas. Patients will receive perifosine 100 mg
      orally qhs with food until disease progression.

      Perifosine is available in 50 mg tablets. Patients will take two perifosine 50 mg tablets
      orally once a day at bedtime with food. Administering the drug qhs has been shown to
      decrease gastrointestinal toxicity in some patients. Patients may need anti-emetics and/or
      anti-diarrheals. All patients may continue therapy unless disease progression is documented
      on two occasions at least 4 weeks apart. Patients who experience toxicity may continue on
      treatment with doses delayed or reduced. Evaluation of all lesions for progression or
      response will be made at 3-month intervals.

      STUDY KEY POINTS

        -  Treatment will be administered on an outpatient basis in 28-day cycles.

        -  Growth factors should not be needed, however, use by patients on this trial is NOT
           prohibited.

        -  A favorable outcome will be defined as a complete or partial response according to the
           Choi criteria or stable disease by the Choi criteria for 6 months or longer.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of
             chondrosarcoma, extra-skeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma or alveolar soft part sarcoma.

          -  Patients may have had prior chemotherapy, but if the patient has had three or more
             forms of prior chemotherapy for metastases, the patient's clinical course should be
             discussed with the study chairman before the patient is enrolled on study

          -  Patients must have progression of disease by Choi criteria.

          -  ECOG performance status 0-1. Patients with ECOG PS of 2 may be admitted with approval
             from the study chairman.

          -  At least 13 years of age.

          -  Patients must have measurable disease.

          -  Patients who have brain metastases that have not progressed for at least 2 months

             childbearing potential must have a negative urine or serum pregnancy test within 72
             hours of treatment. Men and women of childbearing potential must agree to employ
             adequate contraception to prevent pregnancy while on therapy and for four weeks after
             the completion of treatment.

          -  Patients must have the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written
             informed consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients receiving investigational or commercial agents or therapies administered
             with the intent to treat the patient's malignancy, except bisphosphonates.

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to perifosine (miltefosine or edelfosine).

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness—including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection—and psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  Patients with a history of unstable or newly diagnosed angina pectoris, recent
             myocardial infarction (within 6 months of enrollment) or New York Heart Assoc. class
