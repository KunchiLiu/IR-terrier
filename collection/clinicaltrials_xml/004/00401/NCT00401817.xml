      Primary Objective

      1. To evaluate the safety profile of Bevacizumab (Bevacizumab™)- Rituximab (Rituxan®)-CHOP
      (RA-CHOP) in patients with newly diagnosed mantle cell lymphoma (MCL).

      Secondary Objectives

        1. To evaluate the response rate and time to disease progression of the RA-CHOP regimen in
           patients with newly diagnosed MCL.

        2. To prospectively characterize the angiogenic profiles of MCL patients during RA-CHOP
           treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bevacizumab administered at 15 mg/kg on day 1 of each of 6 cycles

      Rituximab administered 375 mg/m2 on day 3 of each of 6 cycles (with usual premedications)

      Standard CHOP chemotherapy administered on day 3 every 21 days (full dose) for 6 cycles of
      treatment

      Once completed six cycles of therapy (~18 weeks), patients will be evaluated every 3 months
      for the first year post treatment, then every 6 months until disease progression or death
      for years 2 through 5 post treatment. Patients who have disease progression will be
      contacted every 6 months until death to assess for survival status.
