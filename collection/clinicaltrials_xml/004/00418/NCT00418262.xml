      Determine if atomoxetine is safe and well tolerated by children with fetal alcohol syndrome.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Abnormalities of attention, function, and activity level in children exposed to alcohol in
      utero share similarities and differences to children who do not have alcohol exposure.
      Previous psychological studies have examined either core attention deficit hyperactivity
      (ADHD) symptoms of hyperactivity, inattention, and impulsivity or hypothesized
      neuropsychological differences in children with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and ADHD.
      Atomoxetine Hydrochloride is a non-stimulant medication used to treat ADHD. This study will
      determine if atomoxetine HCL significantly reduces symptoms of ADD/ADHD in children with
      fetal alcohol exposure.
