  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this 4 week study is to determine whether PASER速, an approved delayed-release
      oral formulation of 4-aminosalicylic acid, in doses of 50 milligrams per kilogram three
      times daily for 2 weeks followed by 50 milligrams per kilogram twice daily for 2 weeks, will
      resolve an acute flare of ileocecal Crohn's disease.
