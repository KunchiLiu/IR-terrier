      The present trial is a prospective multicentric GIMEMA study, in which adult ALL patients
      are extensively analyzed at diagnosis by a multiparametric approach including CC and
      molecular analysis for the following gene rearrangements: BCR-ABL, MLL-AF4, E2A-PBX1,
      TEL-AML1, MLL, p15 and p16 deletion in order to give place to a carefully characterization
      of the genetic lesions occurring in adult ALL and to evaluate their prognostic significance
      in a large cohort of patients homogeneously treated.

      This study requires a central handling and analysis of bone marrow (BM) or peripheral blood
      samples at presentation.
