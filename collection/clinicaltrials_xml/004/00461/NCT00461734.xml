    <textblock>
      This study will be done in patients who require the implantation of a cardiac pacemaker (an
      electronic device that controls the heartbeat) for complete heart block (a heart rhythm
      abnormality resulting in a slow heart beat). Pacemakers regulate the heart beat by
      delivering pulses of electricity through special wires (pacing leads) which are placed
      inside the heart.

      This study will compare two groups of pacemaker patients. Each group will have their pacing
      leads placed in a particular location in the heart. The purpose of the study is to show
      whether the position used in one group is better for maintaining effective heart function
      compared to the position used in the other group.

      The leads in one group will be placed in a position called the Right Ventricular Apex. This
      is the traditional and most frequently used position for pacemaker leads.

      The leads in the other group will be placed in a position called the Right Ventricular High
      Septum. This is a less commonly used position, but may result in health benefits for the
      patients compared with the Right Ventricular Apex.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is an increasing amount of evidence to suggest that other positions in the heart may
      be more effective than the conventional Right Ventricular Apex (RVA) position for restoring
      good heart function. The best site to place a lead has not yet been proven.

      This is a study comparing the long term clinical effects of two different lead positions.
      The measurements taken to assess the clinical effects include:

        -  the effectiveness of the heart's pumping action (as measured by ultrasound scans)

        -  measurements of how far patients can walk in 6 minutes

        -  analysis of blood samples

        -  collection of information from the pacemaker about heart rhythm problems

      Half of the patients in the study will receive conventional leads placed in the more common
      RVA position in the heart. The other half will receive a relatively new type of lead placed
      in what is called the Right Ventricular High Septal (RVHS) position.

      In order to fairly compare the outcomes of these two different lead positions this study has
      been designed as a 'randomized', 'blind' trial. This means that the group which patients
      will be entered into will be chosen at random and patients will not be told which group they
      are in.

      Patients will each have an equal (50:50) chance of being in either group. By carefully
      comparing the clinical differences between the two groups of patients, the study aims to
      prove whether or not there are additional benefits for patients when the RVHS lead position
      is used.

      All leads used in the study have been shown to be safe for patients and are available
      commercially for implantation. All of the implanting doctors involved in the study are
      experienced at implanting the pacemakers and leads that will be used in this study.
