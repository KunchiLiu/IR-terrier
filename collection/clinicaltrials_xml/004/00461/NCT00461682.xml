      SB-705498 has demonstrated efficacy in several preclinical and human experimental pain
      models. This study will investigate the efficacy of SB-705498 in patients with rectal pain.
      This will be a double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-way crossover study. 21 patients with
      faecal urgency (Group 1), and 21 patients with IBS (Group 2) will complete this study.
