  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of two different
      formulations of an investigational dengue vaccine (T-DEN) against a placebo vaccine when two
      doses are given six months apart to adults and children.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, children and adults at multiple sites in Puerto Rico will be randomly
      allocated to receive one of two T-DEN formulations or placebo. Subjects will be stratified
      by age group (a specific number of subjects in each of 4 age groups [12 months to 50 years
      of age] will be enrolled). The study includes 6 scheduled visits and 4 scheduled
      venipunctures. Safety follow-up for dengue may require unscheduled visits and venipunctures.

      &gt; Multiple DEN virus serotypes are endemic in Puerto Rico and all residents are considered
      to be at risk for dengue. The results of this phase II study will provide a basis for
      identifying the vaccine formulations which elicit neutralizing antibodies to all four dengue
      virus serotypes in a high proportion of vaccine recipients. The most immunogenic and well
      tolerated candidate formulation identified in this study will be considered for advancement
      to phase III development.
