      This research study is designed to determine if replacing your current antipsychotic and/or
      mood stabilizer with ziprasidone (Geodon) will impact weight. This research is being
      conducted because Geodon has a documented effect on mood. Additionally, we believe Geodon to
      be an effective medication for overweight or obese patients with bipolar disorder. There
      will be approximately 25 patients enrolled in this study.

      22 obese and three overweight BD patients (20 female; 10 BD-I, 14 BD-II, 1 BD-NOS) with mean
      ` SD baseline body mass index (BMI) of 31.8 ` 2.5 kg/m2 received ZIP (mean final dose 190 `
      92 mg/day) for mean of 79.2 ` 23.2 days. Weight was assessed at six weekly and three
      biweekly visits. Subjects entered the study in diverse mood states. At baseline, 21 were
      taking second-generation antipsychotics, 7 lithium, and 1 valproate, which could be
      reduced/discontinued at investigators' discretion.

          -  Diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder Type I, Type II, or NOS treated in ongoing therapy with
             atypical antipsychotic(s) and/or mood stabilizer(s) that have been implicated in
             causing weight gain (i.e. lithium, valproate, olanzapine, risperidone, quetiapine,
             aripiprazole).

          -  Age 18-65 years old
