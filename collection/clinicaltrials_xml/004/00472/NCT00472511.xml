  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is considered to be one of the most
      prevalent chronic health conditions in children. It affects between 4% and 12% of young
      children. A relationship between convergence insufficiency (eye teaming) and ADHD has been
      shown. However, the effect of ADHD medications on focusing and eye teaming has not been
      previously investigated. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to determine the effect of
      ADHD medication on focusing and eye teaming skills.
