      Primary objective:

        -  To describe the safety profile of a Tetanus, Diphtheria, Poliomyelitis and Pertussis
           vaccine (REPEVAX®) when administered as a pertussis booster 1 month after a Tetanus,
           Diphtheria, Poliomyelitis vaccine (REVAXIS®) as compared to the safety profile of
           REPEVAX® administered one month after Placebo.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To describe the safety of Td-IPV vaccine (REVAXIS®) or Placebo administered to healthy
           adults.

        -  To describe the safety of TdaP-IPV vaccine (REPEVAX®) administered one month after
           Td-IPV vaccine (REVAXIS®) or one month after Placebo.
