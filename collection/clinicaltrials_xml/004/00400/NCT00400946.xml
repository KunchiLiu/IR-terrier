      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer
      cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving giving more
      than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more cancer cells. It is not yet known
      whether pegasparaginase is more effective than asparaginase when given together with
      combination chemotherapy in treating acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying pegasparaginase to see how well it
      works compared with asparaginase when given together with combination chemotherapy in
      treating young patients with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Compare the relative toxicity of pegasparaginase vs E. coli asparaginase when
           administered with combination chemotherapy in children with newly diagnosed acute
           lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).

      Secondary

        -  Compare the relative efficacy of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Determine the prognostic significance of asparaginase antibody formation.

        -  Correlate trough enzyme levels with outcome (toxicity and relapse).

        -  Compare the quality of life in patients treated with pegasparaginase vs E. coli
           asparaginase.

        -  Compare trough serum asparaginase enzyme levels, asparagine levels, and
           anti-asparaginase antibody levels in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Determine the rate of infections (episodes of bacteremia and disseminated fungal
           infections) during the remission induction phase of combination chemotherapy in these
           patients.

        -  Determine the prognostic significance of response to remission induction chemotherapy
           as measured by morphology and minimal residual disease (MRD) measures.

        -  Determine the outcome of patients based on MRD status after 28 days of multiagent
           chemotherapy that intensifies treatment for B-lineage patients with MRD levels greater
           than 0.001 at the end of remission induction therapy.

        -  Determine the outcome of patients based on MRD status after 14 days of multiagent
           chemotherapy and at various other time points while on treatment (every 18 weeks after
           achieving complete remission and at the completion of all chemotherapy).

        -  Compare the outcome (based on bone marrow morphology after 14 days of multiagent
           chemotherapy) of patients with M2/M3 status at that time point vs M1 status or
           hypoplastic marrows.

        -  Determine the efficacy and CNS-related toxicity of CNS-directed treatments in these
           patients.

        -  Determine the efficacy and CNS-related toxicity (acute and long-term) of the high-risk
           (HR) regimen in which a subset of HR patients are treated with intensive intrathecal
           (IT) chemotherapy and the remainder are treated with cranial radiation therapy
           (concurrent with IT chemotherapy).

        -  Determine the efficacy and CNS-related toxicity (acute and long-term) of intensive IT
           therapy in standard-risk patients.

        -  Correlate dietary antioxidant micronutrient intake (including ascorbic acid, vitamin E,
           vitamin A, beta carotene, and total carotenoids) with the rate of infections (episodes
           of bacteremia and disseminated fungal infections) during remission induction therapy
           and the consolidation IA phase.

        -  Correlate dietary calcium intake with risk for development of fractures during the
           continuation phase of therapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter, open-label study. Patients are stratified
      according to disease risk (standard-risk [SR] vs high-risk [HR] vs very high risk [VHR]).

        -  Steroid prophase*: Patients receive intrathecal (IT) cytarabine on day 1 and
           methylprednisolone IV every 8 hours on days 1-3. Patients then proceed to remission
           induction therapy.

      Patients with CNS leukemia (CNS-2, CNS-3, or traumatic lumbar puncture [LP] with blasts) on
      initial LP receive additional IT cytarabine twice weekly beginning on days 4-6 and
      continuing until cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is clear, followed by 2 additional doses.
      Patients with cranial nerve palsy but no leukemia blasts in CSF or leukemic eye infiltrates
      also receive additional IT cytarabine as above.

      NOTE: *Patients who received steroids within the past 7 days do not receive steroid prophase
      treatment; instead they proceed directly to remission induction therapy according to their
      risk group.

        -  Remission induction therapy (SR patients): Patients receive oral prednisone or
           prednisolone 2-3 times daily OR methylprednisolone IV every 8 hours on days 4-32;
           vincristine IV on days 4, 11, 18, and 25; doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX) IV over 15
           minutes on days 4 and 5; methotrexate (MTX) IV on day 6; pegasparaginase IV over 1 hour
           on day 7; triple intrathecal therapy (TIT) comprising methotrexate, cytarabine, and
           hydrocortisone on day 18; and IT MTX on day 32.

      NOTE: Patients who do not receive steroid prophase treatment also receive IT cytarabine on
      day 4.

        -  Remission induction therapy (HR and VHR patients): Patients receive
           prednisone/prednisolone OR methylprednisolone; vincristine; DOX; MTX IV;
           pegasparaginase; TIT; and IT MTX as in the SR group. Patients also receive dexrazoxane
           hydrochloride IV over 15 minutes preceding the DOX infusions on days 4 and 5.

      NOTE: Patients who do not receive steroid prophase treatment also receive IT cytarabine on
      day 4.

      Patients who are in complete remission (CR) on day 32 proceed to consolidation I. Patients
      who are not in CR on day 32 receive vincristine IV weekly until CR is achieved. Patients
      with persistent marrow (greater than 5% leukemic blasts) or those who do not achieve CR by
      day 53 are removed from the study.

      Patients with CSF blasts on cytospin and at least 5 WBC/high-power field (hpf) in the CSF
      (CNS-3) after remission induction therapy are removed from the study. Patients with CSF
      blasts and less than 5 WBC/hpf in the CSF (CNS-2) receive 1 course of systemic chemotherapy
      comprising vincristine IV once a week for 4 weeks; dexrazoxane hydrochloride IV over 15
      minutes followed by DOX IV over 15 minutes once a day for 2 days; and oral mercaptopurine
      once a day for 2 weeks. Patients with persistent CNS blasts at day 53 are removed from the
      study. Patients with no CNS blasts at day 53 proceed to consolidation I.

        -  Consolidation I (SR patients): Patients receive vincristine IV and IT MTX on day 1 and
           oral mercaptopurine once daily on days 1-14. Patients also receive high-dose MTX (HDM)
           IV continuously over 24 hours on day 1 and leucovorin calcium IV every 6 hours
           beginning 36 hours after the start of the HDM infusion and continuing until MTX levels
           are undetectable. Patients proceed to CNS therapy after day 21.

        -  Consolidation I (HR patients): Patients receive vincristine, IT MTX, and mercaptopurine
           as in the SR group. Patients also receive dexrazoxane hydrochloride IV over 15 minutes
           followed by DOX IV over 15 minutes on day 1 and HDM with leucovorin calcium support as
           in the SR group beginning 8-24 hours after the completion of the DOX infusion. Patients
           proceed to CNS therapy after day 21.

        -  Consolidation I (VHR patients): Patients receive consolidation therapy in 3 stages.

             -  Stage IA: Patients receive vincristine, IT MTX, and mercaptopurine as in the SR
                group. Patients also receive dexrazoxane hydrochloride, DOX, HDM, and leucovorin

           dexamethasone, and TIT as in the SR group. Patients also receive dexrazoxane
           hydrochloride IV over 15 minutes followed by DOX IV over 15 minutes on day 1. HR
           patients also receive E. coli asparaginase OR pegasparaginase as above beginning on day
           1 and continuing for up to 30 weeks. VHR patients continue to receive E. coli
           asparaginase OR pegasparaginase as per consolidation I treatment. Patients proceed to
           consolidation II after day 21.

      Patients with WBC &gt; 100,000/mm³, T-cell disease, and/or CNS-3 at diagnosis or CNS-2 at end
      of remission induction therapy also undergo cranial radiation therapy daily for 8 or 10
      days.
