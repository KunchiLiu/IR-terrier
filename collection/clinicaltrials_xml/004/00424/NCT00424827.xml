      To assess progression-free survival of patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer who
      are treated with concurrent gemcitabine, 5-FU, cetuximab and external beam radiation
      therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, non-randomized, combination study of cetuximab, gemcitabine, 5-FU,
      and external beam radiotherapy in patients with locally advanced, non-metastatic pancreatic
      cancer.

      All patients will be assessed by history and physical examination including weight, vital
      signs, and performance status within 14 days of initiation of therapy. Baseline hematologic
      and biochemical profiles, including CBC with differential, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin,
      SGOT (AST), BUN, creatinine, and CA 19-9 will be completed within 14 days of initiation of
      therapy.

      During cycle I (chemoradiation), gemcitabine (200 mg/m2) and cetuximab 400mg/m2 initial dose
      followed by 250mg/m2 IV weekly will be given with continuous infusion 5-FU (200 mg/m2/day)
      delivered 5 of every 7 days and concurrent external beam radiation therapy. Cetuximab,
      gemcitabine and 5-FU will begin on the first week of external beam radiotherapy and will
      continue throughout the course of external beam radiation therapy, and will be discontinued
      following the conclusion of external beam radiation therapy. All patients will have a
      central venous access device placed to facilitate chemotherapy administration.

      During cycles 2 through 5 (chemotherapy), gemcitabine will be administered at a dose of 1000
      mg/m2 over 30 minutes followed by cetuximab at a dose of 250mg/m2 over 30 minutes weekly for
      3 weeks followed by one-week rest for four cycles.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Enrollment in this trial will be limited to patients for whom protocol therapy is safe and
        appropriate. Physicians should consider the risks and benefits of therapy together with
        all relevant medical and other considerations in deciding whether this protocol is
        appropriate for a particular patient. Specific considerations include:

          -  Psychiatric illness which would prevent the patient from giving informed consent.

          -  Serious medical illness such as uncontrolled infection, severe cardiovascular disease
             including recent (&lt; 6 months) myocardial infarction or uncontrolled congestive heart
             failure, or other serious illness which would limit anticipated survival to &lt; 12
             weeks.

          -  Protocol treatment would pose significant risk to an unborn child. Pregnant women
             should not be enrolled, and women of child-bearing age should be strongly encouraged
             to practice effective birth control during and for three months after the trial.

          -  Inability to swallow medication. Patients should have adequate, unassisted oral
             intake.
