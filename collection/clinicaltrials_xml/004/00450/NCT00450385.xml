  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that survival of newly diagnosed DLBCL (diffuse large B-cell
      lymphoma) patients treated with R-CHOP can be predicted by RNA or protein gene expression or
      by presence of biomarkers associated with the anti-tumor effects of Rituximab.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this phase II multi-institutional trial, the investigators will identify genes associated
      with either good or bad outcome in DLBCL patients treated with R-CHOP, will construct a
      robust predictive models based on RNA extracted from or paraffin specimens as well on
      immunohistochemistry and will examine the predictive power of new biomarkers associated with
      the anti-tumor effects of rituximab. The acquisition of fixed tissue as a component of this
      uniformly treated prospective study will also afford future studies with this informative
      dataset.

    <description>The investigators aim to determine a list of genes and construct survival prediction model(s) that will predict the overall survival at 30 months in DLBCL patients prospectively treated with R-CHOP chemotherapy.

    <description>The investigators aim to determine the usefulness of biomarkers associated with the antitumor effects of rituximab (e.g. immunoglobulin GFc receptor genotypes, CD20 protein expression and gene expression profiles) to predict overall survival of DLBCL patients treated with R-CHOP therapy and followed for at least 24 months or until death. Overall survival time will be calculated from the date of the diagnosis until death or last follow-up examination.</description>
