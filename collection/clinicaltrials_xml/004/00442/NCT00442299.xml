  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The uremic syndrome is mainly related to the retention of a host of compounds, due to
      altered glomerular filtration and other factors of renal dysfunction, e.g. tubular
      secretion. Uremic retention solutes are arbitrarily subdivided in three different categories
      according to their physicochemical characteristics and their subsequent behaviour during
      dialysis: (i) the small, water-soluble, non-protein bound compounds, (ii) the larger middle
      molecules, mainly peptides and (iii) the small protein-bound compounds (1).

      Although direct proof is lacking, several lines of evidence indicate that albumin is the
      most important carrier protein. Removal of protein bound uremic retention solutes is
      limited.

      The Prometheus® system fractionates blood into plasma and cellular components, using an
      albumin-permeable polysulfon filter (AlbuFlow®) with a specially designed sieving
      coefficient curve (1.0 for 2-microglobulin, &gt;0.6 for albumin, &lt;0.3 for IgG, &lt;0.1 for
      fibrinogen and &lt;0.01 for IgM). Due to the high sieving coefficient of the filter for large
      molecules (i.e. cut-off at about 250 kD) molecules up to the size of albumin (69 kD) easily
      pass from blood into the secondary circuit which is filled with isotonic sodium chloride
      solution, whereas larger molecules like fibrinogen (340 kD) cannot pass through the filter.
      In the secondary circuit the filtered plasma with the albumin-bound toxins flows through one
      or two adsorbers in a row with maximized adsorption capacity for putative liver toxins that
      are directly adsorbed (`fractionated plasma separation and adsorption' or FPSA). The
      purified plasma is then returned to the blood side of the albumin filter. In order to
      eliminate water-soluble toxins, blood thereafter undergoes hemodialysis using a conventional
      high-flux dialyser.

      We hypothesise that removal of protein bound uremic retention solutes can be improved by
      FPSA as compared to standard hemodialysis.
