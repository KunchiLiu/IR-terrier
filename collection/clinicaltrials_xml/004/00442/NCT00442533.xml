        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have received first line standard chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy
             for neuroendocrine malignancy in the past and failed the therapy.

          -  Patients must have evidence of residual multifocal active tumor.

          -  All patients must sign an informed consent indicating the awareness of the
             investigational nature of the studies involved.

          -  All patients must have a Karnofsky performance status of at least 60.

          -  Patients must be greater than 18 years of age.

          -  Patients must have measurable and/or followable disease based on either clinical or
             radiologic exam.

          -  Sensitivity to Indium-111 pentetreotide or any of its components is an absolute
             contraindication to participation in this trial.

          -  An absolute contraindication is pregnancy as evidenced by the clinical condition, a
             positive pregnancy test (B-HCG or pelvic ultrasound).

          -  If patients have received prior radionuclide therapy of the same product, there must
             be documented response to that therapy and/or residual active stable disease.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Karnofsky performance status of 50 or less.

          -  Patients who are unable to give informed consent.

          -  Patients under 18 years of age. There will be no upper age discrimination.

          -  Patients who are pregnant or those potentially pregnant subjects not willing to
             practice effective contraceptive techniques during the study period.

          -  Patients with renal insufficiency as defined by a calculated creatinine clearance
             (based on age, weight and serum creatinine) of 39.9 ml/min or less.
