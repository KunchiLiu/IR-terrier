    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is studying how well giving imatinib mesylate together with paclitaxel
      works in treating older patients with stage IIIB or stage IV non-small cell lung cancer.
      Imatinib mesylate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed
      for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel, work in different ways to
      stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from
      dividing. Giving imatinib mesylate together with paclitaxel may kill more tumor cells

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the clinical efficacy of the combination of weekly paclitaxel and
      intermittent imatinib in elderly patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety profile of the combination of weekly paclitaxel and intermittent
      imatinib in elderly patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer.

      II. To collect paraffin tissue blocks for a companion project evaluating the expression of
      platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) by original tumor specimens, and its relationship to
      response rate and survival.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive paclitaxel intravenously (IV) on days 3, 10, and 17 and imatinib mesylate
      orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-4, 8-11, and 15-18. Treatment repeats every 28 days
      for 4-6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.
