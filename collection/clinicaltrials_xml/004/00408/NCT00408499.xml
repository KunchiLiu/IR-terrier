    <textblock>
      RATIONALE: Erlotinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth. Monoclonal antibodies, such as cetuximab, can block tumor growth in
      different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor
      cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Giving erlotinib
      together with cetuximab may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of erlotinib and
      cetuximab and to see how well they work in treating patients with advanced solid tumors or
      progressive or recurrent stage III or stage IV non-small cell lung cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the safety and feasibility of erlotinib hydrochloride and cetuximab in
           patients with advanced solid tumors. (Phase I)

        -  Determine the efficacy of this regimen, in terms of objective tumor response rate, in
           patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) pre-treated with platinum.
           (Phase II)

      Secondary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of this regimen in these patients. (Phase I)

        -  Determine the efficacy of this regimen, in terms of response rate, in these patients.
           (Phase I)

        -  Determine the progression-free and overall survival of patients treated with this
           regimen. (Phase II)

        -  Determine the frequency and severity of toxicities of this regimen in these patients.
           (Phase II)

        -  Determine epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and K-RAS mutation status. (Phase II)

        -  Evaluate EGFR protein expression and protein expression of downstream markers (e.g.,
           pMAPK, pAKT, p27, and Ki-67). (Phase II)

        -  Evaluate the levels of marker proteins (e.g., pMAPK, pAKT, p27, and Ki-67) in buccal
           cells. (Phase II)

        -  Determine gene copy number by EGFR fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). (Phase II)

        -  Identify EGFR polymorphisms by analysis of genomic DNA from peripheral blood
           mononuclear cells. (Phase II)

        -  Determine if the continued presence or absence of mutant K-RAS tumor DNA correlates
           with response and/or outcome. (Phase II)

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study followed by an open-label, phase II study.

        -  Phase I: Patients receive oral erlotinib hydrochloride once daily on days 1-28 and
           cetuximab IV over 1-2 hours on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Treatment repeats every 28 days
           in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of erlotinib hydrochloride and cetuximab
      until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose
      preceding that at which â‰¥ 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. At least 6
      patients are treated at the MTD.

        -  Phase II: Patients receive erlotinib hydrochloride and cetuximab at the MTD determined
           in phase I.

      Blood and buccal samples are acquired from patients at baseline and prior to courses 2 and
      3. Samples are examined by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), immunohistochemistry,
      polymorphism analysis, and protein expression assays to assess molecular markers (epidermal
      growth factor receptor, K-RAS, pMAPK, pAKT, p27 and Ki-67) for biologic effects and
      predictive response.

      After completion of phase I treatment, patients are followed for 30 days or until all
      toxicities resolve. After completion of phase II treatment, patients are followed
      periodically.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 62 patients will be accrued for this study
