  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of the current proposal is that collateral flow is an important determinant
      of myocardial protection during an ischemic event. Increased collateral flow for any given
      area at risk will decrease the myocardial damage caused by the occlusion of the infarct
      related epicardial artery.

      It is further hypothesized that myocardial salvage provided by collateral flow will decrease
      infarct size and this in turn will decrease LV dilatation post-myocardial infarction.

      The hypothesis of the current proposal is that collateral flow is an important determinant
      of myocardial protection during an ischemic event. Increased collateral flow for any given
      area at risk will decrease the myocardial damage caused by the occlusion of the infarct
      related epicardial artery.

      It is further hypothesized that myocardial salvage provided by collateral flow will decrease
      infarct size and this in turn will decrease LV dilatation post-myocardial infarction.

      The two primary endpoints are infarct size as assessed by increase of biochemical cardiac
      markers and coronary collateral perfusion index (CPI) as obtained by transthoracic MCE.

      Extent of LV remodelling, i.e., LV dilatation as assessed by serial assessment of LV
      dimension by LV angiogram and/or echocardiography, respectively.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients unable to give informed consent e.g. because of mechanical ventilation

          -  Patients with cardiogenic shock

          -  Patients with myocardial infarction secondary to occlusion of a recently
             revascularized vessel (subacute stent thrombosis)
