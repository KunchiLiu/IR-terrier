      The study seeks to enroll healthy, vaccine naïve volunteers, 18 through 45 years old.
      Recruitment consists of using flyers, newspaper advertising, radio, and direct mailing at
      local military installations, targeting the general population of the greater Washington
      D.C. area.

      The study's primary objective is the safety and tolerability of Lfn-p24 given IM.

      Volunteers will be screened (visit 1) and enrolled within 2 to 12 weeks prior to the first
      vaccination. Study volunteers will receive a briefing from the Principal Investigator (PI)
      or a sub investigator. The briefing is followed by an opportunity for questions from the
      volunteers. The PI or designee will then review the consent form with potential volunteers
      (visit 1) and answer any questions. After review, an Informed Consent will be signed and a
      &quot;Test of Understanding&quot; will be completed by all volunteers, prior to enrollment in the
      study. A second pre-screening visit (visit 2) will occur 3 - 30 days prior to the first
      vaccination (visit 3) to confirm eligibility for vaccination. During this visit each
      volunteer will have an opportunity to ask questions about the study.

      On the day of vaccination (visits 3, 6, and 10), volunteers will be observed for 30 minutes
      following injection for acute adverse experiences and will be contacted the day following
      injection for a brief adverse reaction interview. In addition, volunteers will complete
      diaries for 7 days following each vaccination and will be evaluated by a clinical
      investigator if significant symptoms are reported. Adverse effects and laboratory
      abnormalities will be tabulated. Routine measurements of hematology, serum chemistry, and
      urinalysis laboratory tests will be performed in subsequent safety and general follow up
      visits.renee

      LFn-p24 with Alhydrogel adjuvant will be delivered IM in the deltoid muscle at the intervals
      shown below. Groups will be enrolled in staggered fashion beginning with the lowest dose
      group. The subsequent groups receiving higher doses will then be enrolled by the
      investigator if the second injection of the immediate lower dose is shown to be safe and
      well tolerated (&lt; grade II toxicity), after the 2 week post vaccination follow-up visit.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Citizens of the U.S.A. who are not at high-risk for HIV infection.

          -  Age: 18 through 45 years of age.

          -  For women, negative serum pregnancy test will be required within two days prior to
             any injection, as well as verbal assurance that adequate contraceptive measures are
             applied.

          -  Good health as determined by medical history, physical examination, and clinical
             judgment.

        Clinical laboratory values at screening within the following ranges:

          -  Hematocrit: Women: &gt; 34%: Men &gt;38% (Mild anemia in any potential trial volunteer who
             is otherwise healthy attributable by appropriate laboratory studies to thalassemia
             minor will not be cause for exclusion)

          -  White blood cell count: 3,000 to 12,000 cells/mm3

          -  Platelets: 125,000 to 550,000 per mm3

          -  Urine dipstick for protein and blood: negative or trace. If either is ≥ 1+, obtain
             complete urinalysis (UA). If microscopic UA confirms evidence of hematuria or
             proteinuria ≥ 1+, the volunteer is ineligible unless menstruating, then a repeat UA

             participation in the study.

          -  Have received any live, attenuated vaccine within 60 days of study entry.

          -  NOTE: Medically indicated subunit or killed vaccines (e.g., Hepatitis A or Hepatitis
             B) are not exclusionary but should be given at least 2 weeks before or after HIV
             immunization to avoid potential confusion of adverse reactions.

          -  Acute or chronic Hepatitis caused by viral or other etiology.

          -  Have used experimental therapeutic agents within 30 days of study entry.

          -  Have received blood products or immunoglobulins in the past 12 weeks.

          -  Currently enrolled in other vaccine trials.

          -  Are pregnant or lactating.

          -  NOTE: Women of child-bearing potential must be using effective contraception from the
             date of enrollment into the protocol.

          -  Have an immediate type hypersensitivity reaction to aminoglyocides, e.g., kanamycin
             (used to prepare the LFn-p24 vaccine).

          -  Are study site employees who are involved in the protocol and may have direct access
             to the immunogenicity results.

          -  Are receiving ongoing therapy with immunosuppressive therapy such as systemic
             corticosteroids or cancer chemotherapy.
