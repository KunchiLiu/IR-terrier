      This is a double-blind, two-period, placebo controlled cross-over Phase IIa study. This
      study is to use CB2 compound of GW842166 in patients with osteoarthritis. The pain
      assessments and WOMAC questionnaires will be used in the study after the repeated dose to
      evaluate the efficacy of CB2 compound of GW842166.
