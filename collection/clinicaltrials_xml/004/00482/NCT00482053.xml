      This purpose of this clinical trial is to develop an alternative treatment for patients with
      relapsed diffuse large B cell lymphoma who are not likely to be cured by the conventional
      transplantation regimen. This study tests a tandem transplant approach that starts with
      transplantation of the patient's own hematopoietic (blood) cells (AHCT) as preparation for
      an allogeneic transplantation whereby the blood cells from a matched donor are used to try
      to support the patient's immune system to fight the cancer cells. A novel combination of
      lymphoma-specific radiation that only impacts the lymphoid organs (lymph nodes and spleen)
      and an immune suppressing drug is given to prepare the patient body to receive the donor's
      cells. This conditioning regimen is used because it has been shown to reduce the likelihood
      of a very common side-effect, known as graft versus host disease, a negative reaction of the
      donor's cells against the patient's tissues. By carefully preparing the patient for this
      immune-based strategy, it is hoped that an improvement in event-free survival and a
      reduction in the risk of disease relapse after AHCT will be seen.

        Inclusion Criteria:- Age 18 to 70 years.

          -  Histologically proven diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) by the WHO
             classification.

          -  Relapse after achieving initial remission or failure to achieve initial remission.
             Patients with residual radiographic abnormalities after primary therapy are eligible
             if abnormalities are FDG-PET positive.

          -  Receipt of 2 cycles of second-line therapy and FDG-PET positive per Stanford
             (central) review. FDG-PET to be done 2 weeks after cycle 2 of second line
             chemotherapy.

          -  ECOG performance status &lt; 2

          -  Matched related or unrelated donor identified and available

          -  Bone marrow biopsy and cytogenetic analysis within 8 weeks of registration

          -  Women of child-bearing potential and sexually active males are strongly advised to
             use an accepted and effective method of birth control.

          -  Patients must have a pretreatment serum bilirubin &lt; 2 x the institutional ULN, a
             serum creatinine &lt; 2 x the institutional ULN and measured or estimated creatinine
             clearance &gt; 60 cc/min by the following formula (all tests must be performed within 28
             days prior to registration):

               -  Estimated Creatinine Clearance = (140 age)X WT(kg) X 0.85 if female 72X serum
                  creatinine(mg/dl).

          -  Patients must have an EKG within 42 days prior to registration that shows no
             significant abnormalities that are suggestive of active cardiac disease.

          -  Patients requiring therapy for coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathy, dysrhythmia,
             or congestive heart failure are not eligible.

          -  Patients must have a radionuclide ejection fraction within 42 days of registration.
             If the ejection fraction is &lt;40%, the patient will not be eligible. If the ejection
             fraction is 40-50%, the patient will have a cardiology consult.

          -  Patients must have a corrected diffusion capacity &gt;55%.

          -  Patients with known allergy to etoposide or a history of Grade 3 hemorrhagic cystitis
             with cyclophosphamide are not eligible.

             guidelines.

        Exclusion Criteria:- Pregnant or breast-feeding women are ineligible due to the known
        birth defects association with the treatments used in this study.

          -  Patients known to be human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive are ineligible
             because the concern for opportunistic infection and hematologic reserve are
             considered to be significantly greater in this population. The antibody test for HIV
             must be performed within 42 days of registration.

             lymphoma are not eligible.

          -  Patients with active infection requiring oral or intravenous antibiotics are
             excluded.

          -  Virology testing including CMV, HIV, EBV, HTLV, RPR, Hepatitis A, B and C will be
             performed within 30 days of donation.

          -  Prospective donors will be screened for CMV seroreactivity and seronegative donors
             will be utilized if available. If the possibility of more than one HLA-matched
             related donor exists, then the donor will be selected on the basis of CD31 allotype.
