    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test an intervention in primary care clinics to improve
      three risk factors for diabetes complications: glucose control, blood pressure and
      cholesterol. Subjects in the study will be clinic staff and clinicians, not patients. The
      intervention is Practice Facilitation. Practice facilitation occurs when a trained
      facilitator meets with a team of staff and clinicians in each practice over a period of
      several months. Facilitation meetings create time for learning and reflection by members of
      the team and improves their communication so that they can adopt and implement a strategy to
      improve patient care

    <textblock>
      Current control of hemoglobin A1c, blood pressure and lipids among patients with type 2
      diabetes in primary care settings is not adequate to prevent complications. Results from an
      NIDDK funded R34 pilot study conducted by members of this research team suggest that
      Practice Facilitation is feasible and may improve these risk factors. Practice facilitation
      occurs when a trained facilitator meets with a team of staff and clinicians in each practice
      over a period of several months. Facilitation meetings create time for learning and
      reflection by members of the team and improves their communication so that they can adopt
      and implement a strategy to improve patient care. The purpose of this study is to use a
      Practice Facilitation intervention to improve the above three risk factors among patients
      with type 2 diabetes in small, autonomous primary care practices. This intervention is based
      on complex adaptive system theory to support the selection, tailoring and implementation of
      one or more strategies to improve the above 3 risk factors in each intervention practice.
      Five strategies will be discussed during the facilitation to stimulate change in each
      practice: a diabetes registry, point-of-care testing of HbA1c and lipids, group clinic
      visits, improved decision support during the visit, and patient activation prior to each
      visit. The specific objectives are : 1) To evaluate the effectiveness and sustainability of
      practice facilitation to improve risk factors for type 2 diabetes complications across a
      variety of primary care settings; 2) Assess the implementation of the chronic care
      model(CCM) in response to the intervention; 3) Examine the relationship between
      communication within the practice team and the implementation of the CCM model; and 4) From
      the perspective of the organization conducting the intervention and the primary care
      practice, examine the cost of implementing the intervention relative to risk factor change.
      The study will be a cluster randomized trial conducted in 40 primary care practices
      randomized to intervention or control. Data will be collected on all practices and 40
      patients in each practice using a multi-method assessment process at baseline, 12 and 24
      months. The intervention will be a series of 15 visits to 20 intervention practices by
      trained facilitators over 12 months. Primary hypotheses will be tested with 12 month outcome
      data. Sustainability of the intervention will be tested with 24 month data. Insights will be
      included in a delayed intervention conducted in control practices and evaluated in a
      pre-post design.
