      This study will evaluate the effectiveness of atomoxetine in treating children with
      attention deficit hyperactivity disorder symptoms associated with autistic disorder,
      Asperger's syndrome, and pervasive developmental disorder, not otherwise specified.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Autism is a developmental disorder that can cause severe and pervasive impairment in
      thinking, feeling, language, and the ability to relate to others. It is usually first
      diagnosed in early childhood. Children with autism demonstrate repetitive behaviors or
      interests and deficits in social interaction, verbal communication, and nonverbal
      communication. In addition, they often have unusual responses to sensory experiences, such
      as certain sounds or the way objects look. Some symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity
      disorder (ADHD), such as inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity, are also associated
      with autism. Atomoxetine is a selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor that is used to
      treat ADHD. It works differently, however, than stimulant drugs and may help to reduce ADHD
      symptoms in children with autism. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of atomoxetine
      in treating children with ADHD symptoms associated with autism.

      Potential participants will first attend a screening visit, which will include a psychiatric
      diagnostic interview, a practice session for swallowing pill capsules, a physical exam, an
      electrocardiogram (ECG), a blood test, and an assessment of pubertal stage. Females of
      childbearing age will also undergo a urine pregnancy test. In an initial double-blind study
      phase, eligible participants will be randomly assigned to receive either atomoxetine or
      placebo for 8 weeks. A baseline visit will include several rating scales, observations, and
      an interview to assess adaptive functioning. These measures and procedures will be used to
      keep track of symptoms, side effects, and behavior that could change during the study.
      Children who are assigned to placebo and do not notice an improvement in their ADHD symptoms
      will be given the opportunity to receive atomoxetine at the end of 8 weeks. Study visits
      will occur once a week for 4 weeks, and then every other week for the remainder of the 8
      weeks. During these visits, many of the baseline questionnaires and interviews will be
      repeated. At the Week 8 visit, the physical exam, ECG, blood tests, and some baseline
      questionnaires will also be repeated. All children who respond well to atomoxetine may
      continue taking the drug for an additional 10 months. During this time, participants will
      report to the clinic once a month for the first 4 months, then once at the end of 7 months,
      and finally once at the end of 10 months. The same measures and procedures that were done
      during the 8-week phase will be done during the 10-month phase of this study.

             investigator-administered ADHD Rating Scale (ADHDRS)-Home Version that is at least

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Weighs less than 15 kg (about 33 pounds)

          -  Any another psychiatric disorder that may require a different treatment, including
             psychotic disorders, major affective disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic
             disorder, or substance-related disorders

          -  Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV)

          -  Inability to swallow study medication

          -  Presence of a medical condition that would make treatment with atomoxetine unsafe
             (e.g., unstable hypertension or cardiac disease, asthma requiring frequent treatment
             with albuterol, narrow angle glaucoma, pregnancy, etc.)

             medical condition as determined by the study physician in discussion with the
             participant's primary care physician

          -  Clinically significant abnormalities on ECG as determined by a pediatric cardiologist

          -  Pregnant

          -  Initiation of a new psychosocial intervention within 90 days prior to starting study
             medication. Participants who have recently had a significant change in their
             psychosocial interventions will not be eligible until this intervention has been
             stable for 90 days in order to avoid confounding results of the study. Stable
             interventions (e.g., speech and occupational therapy) will be allowed to continue
             during the course of the study. Minor changes in ongoing treatment (e.g., missed
             therapy sessions due to holiday/vacation planned break in therapy due to school
             holidays) will not be considered significant.
