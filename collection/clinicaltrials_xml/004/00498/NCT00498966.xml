      This is a Phase II study. Patients with kidney carcinoma will be considered in two groups.
      The goals of this study are:

        -  To measure clinical benefit defined as tumor response or progression-free survival for
           more than 12 weeks in patients with metastatic carcinoma of the kidney who have failed
           or have progressed on a VEGF receptor inhibitor

        -  To evaluate the safety of perifosine in patients with metastatic carcinoma of the
           kidney who have failed or have progressed on a VEGF receptor inhibitor

    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II study. Patients with kidney carcinoma will be considered in two groups.
      Patients in group A will have previously failed a VEGF receptor inhibitor but not an mTOR
      inhibitor, while patients in group B will have failed both a VEGF receptor inhibitor and an
      mTOR inhibitor. Evaluation of each group will be performed separately. The goals of this
      study are:

        1. To measure clinical benefit defined as an objective tumor response using RESIST or
           progression-free survival for more than 12 weeks in patients with metastatic carcinoma
           of the kidney who have failed or have progressed on a VEGF receptor inhibitor

        2. To evaluate the safety of perifosine in patients with metastatic carcinoma of the
           kidney who have failed or have progressed on a VEGF receptor inhibitor.

      Treatment Phase/duration of treatment: All patients will be treated with daily perifosine at
      100 mg PO daily until tumor progression (by the RECIST criteria) or unacceptable toxicity.
      Once radiological disease progression has been documented by the treating physician, the
      patient will go off study. Patients are encouraged to have two measurements for confirmation
      of progression.

      Follow-Up Phase: All patients will be followed-up for SAEs until at least 30 days after
      discontinuation of perifosine. All patients who are discontinued from perifosine for any
      reason other than disease progression will continue to have tumor assessments until the
      patient has documented disease progression or has begun other therapies.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with confirmed metastatic RCC

          -  Patients must have documented progression on treatment with sunitinib or sorafenib.
             Prior therapy with bevacizumab and/or cytokines (i.e., IL-2, interferon) is
             permitted. Prior vaccine therapy in the adjuvant setting is also permitted. Patients
             can have failed therapy with ONE prior mTOR inhibitor.

          -  Patients must have at least one measurable lesion on computer tomography (CT) Scan or
             magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using Modified RECIST criteria.

          -  Patients must have normal organ and marrow function, unless in the opinion of the
             treating investigator, the abnormality is related to tumor, and the study chairman
             agree the abnormality is unlikely to affect the safety of perifosine use. Normal
             organ and marrow function is described below:

               -  ANC &gt;= 1.5 x 109/L

               -  Platelets &gt;= 75,000/ mm3

               -  HCT &gt;= 28% (with or without growth factor support)

               -  Creatinine &lt;= 3.0 mg/dl

               -  Total bilirubin &lt;= 1.5 x upper limit of normal

               -  Transaminase &lt;= 2.5 x upper limit of normal

          -  ECOG performance status of 0 or 1

          -  Patients with CNS metastases must be clinically stable for at least 2 months
             following treatment with radiation therapy, surgery, or both; and be off

          -  Patients with a life expectancy ≥6 months

          -  Women of childbearing potential must have had a negative serum or urine pregnancy

             (excluding alopecia).

          -  Patients currently receiving sorafenib or sunitinib who have received either of these
             within 2 weeks prior to study entry.

             both VEGF receptor inhibitors.

          -  Patients with a known hypersensitivity to perifosine or its excipients.
