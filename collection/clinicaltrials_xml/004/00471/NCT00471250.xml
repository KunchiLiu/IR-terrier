      This study will collect fluid and tissue specimens from the lungs and nose of healthy people
      and people with a history of lung infections. The specimens will be examined for differences
      between the two groups that may be associated with susceptibility to certain infections.

      Healthy normal volunteers and people with a history of lung infections between 18 and 75
      years of age who are followed at NIH may be eligible for this study.

      Participants undergo the following procedures:

      Medical history and physical examination.

      Blood and urine tests.

      Electrocardiogram (ECG) and chest x-ray.

      Treadmill exercise stress test (for people over 45 years old with a history of chest pain or
      ECG abnormalities).

      Bronchoscopy: The subject s nose and throat are numbed with lidocaine and a sedative is
      given for comfort. A thin flexible tube called a bronchoscope is advanced through the nose
      or mouth into the lung airways to examine the airways carefully.

      Fluid collection during the bronchoscopy using one of the following methods:

        -  Bronchoalveolar lavage: Salt water is injected through the bronchoscope into the lung
           and immediately suctioned out, washing off cells lining the airways.

        -  Bronchial brushings: A brush-tipped wire enclosed in a sheath is passed through the
           bronchoscope and a small area of the airway tissue is gently brushed. The brush is
           withdrawn with some tissue adhering to it.

        -  Endobronchial biopsies: Small pinchers on a wire are passed through the bronchoscope
           and about 1 to 2 millimeters of tissue is removed.

        -  Nasal scrape: A small device is used to scrape along the inside of the nose to collect
           some cells.

      This research protocol involves one or more of the following procedures in healthy
      volunteers and patients with known or suspected predisposition to respiratory infection who
      are enrolled in National Institutes of Health (NIH) protocols: 1) Adults only: bronchoscopy
      with sampling of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and epithelial cells in healthy adult
      volunteers and patients; 2) Adults and Children: sputum induction for collection of sputum
      specimens; 3) Adults and Children: nasal mucosal biopsies and brushings for sampling of
      epithelial cells. The cellular and acellular samples will be separated, and stored or
      transferred to the appropriate laboratories investigating these diseases.

      Alveolar macrophages are the predominant (greater than 95%) cell type present in the lavage
      of normal subjects. Alveolar macrophages play a central role in the initiation and
      propagation of lung inflammation by releasing cytokines (i.e., interleukin-1, tumor necrosis
      factor) and chemokines (i.e., interleukin-8, monocyte chemotactic protein, macrophage
      inflammatory protein) that activate other resident cells and recruit inflammatory cells to a
      local nidus of inflammation. Airway epithelial cells are known to release a variety of
      mediators as well. Thus, the interaction of cells with mediators generated by alveolar cells
      and bronchial epithelial cells during acute inflammation is a key element in the initiation
      of pulmonary inflammatory responses.

      Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), bronchial brushings, and mucosal biopsies are standard
      diagnostic techniques done through the bronchoscope to obtain samples of alveolar and
      bronchial specimens for diagnosis of infection, malignancy, or non-infectious inflammation.
      Nasal mucosal scrape biopsy is a minimally invasive method of obtaining airway epithelial
      cells to diagnose disorders of airway clearance associated with abnormal cilia (hair-like
      structures on airway lining cells). Sputum induction is a routinely performed procedure to
      facilitate the collection of respiratory secretions (mucus) through stimulation of cough
      with inhalation of an aerosolized concentrated salt-water solution.

      The objective of this protocol is to analyze bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, airway epithelial
      cells, and sputum specimens from healthy volunteers and from patients who acquire
      respiratory infections to look for differences in immune function and to discover new
      pathways of infectious disease susceptibility. We hypothesize that studying cellular
      responses to infection and inflammatory markers released from these cells will further our
      understanding of human susceptibility to respiratory tract infections.

      Five hundred and fifty subjects (250 healthy volunteers and 300 patients) will undergo one
      or more of the following: 1) bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage, bronchial brushings,
      endobronchial biopsies; 2) nasal mucosal scrape and/or brush biopsies; 3) sputum inductions
      to obtain specimens for in vitro investigations and comparisons of both the cellular and
      acellular components.
