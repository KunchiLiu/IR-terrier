  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study aims to provide current information, etiology and outcome of
      community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), risk factors for for CAP in isolates of Streptococcus
      pneumoniae and Haemophilus influencae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, chlamydia pneumoniae and
      Legionella. Risk factors, including patient demographics, comorbid illnesses, setting of
      presentation, causative organisms, antibiotic history, and resistance profiles will be
      assessed and outcome will be recorded.

      The following information will be collected: age, sex, occupation, hospital location at the
      time of positive culture (ER, medical ward, ICU etc), date of positive culture, prior
      hospitalization, receipt of outpatient dialysis, home care or other regular medical care
      (eg, outpatient chemotherapy), presence of invasive devices, receipt of antibiotics,
      including their type and whether they were adequate for the resistance profile of the
      organism, prior positive microbiologic cultures, time and location of positive cultures,
      underlying diseases and severity of illness, co-morbid illnesses, presence of urinary or
      intravascular devices, recent immunomodulative therapies or radiation therapy, physical exam
      findings, laboratory and radiographical data, antimicrobial usage within 30 days of onset of
      the infection, microbiological data and resistance patterns, choice of antibiotics once
      organism identified, bacteriological outcomes, laboratory results, demographic information,
      medications, clinical outcome,gender, height, weight, ethnicity, and past medical history.
      We will collect information retrospectively.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients with Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influencae, Mycoplasma
             pneumoniae, chlamydia pneumoniae and Legionella species infections during the time
             period the study will be reviewed. A community-associated pneumonia isolate will be
             defined as one which was recovered from a clinical culture from a patient at UPMC who
             had no established risk factors for infection with an antibiotic resistant organism.
             Established risk factors are defined as: Isolation of the organism two or more days
             after admission for hospitalization OR history of hospitalization, surgery, dialysis,
             or residence in a long-term care facility within one year before the culture date OR
             The presence of an indwelling catheter or percutaneous medical device (eg,
             tracheostomy tube, gastrostomy tube, or Foley catheter) at the time of the culture OR
             Previous isolation of an antibiotic resistant organism.
