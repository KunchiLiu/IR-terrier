      RATIONALE: Enzastaurin may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well enzastaurin works in treating patients
      with persistent or recurrent ovarian epithelial cancer or primary peritoneal cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Assess the efficacy of enzastaurin hydrochloride, in terms of 6-month progression-free
           survival or objective tumor response, in patients with recurrent or persistent ovarian
           epithelial or primary peritoneal cancer.

        -  Determine the nature and degree of toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the duration of progression-free and overall survival of patients treated
           with this regimen.

        -  Determine the effects of prognostic variables, including platinum sensitivity, initial
           performance status, and age, in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral enzastaurin hydrochloride 3 times on day 1 and then once daily on days
      2-28 of course 1. For all subsequent courses, patients receive enzastaurin hydrochloride
      once daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 68 patients will be accrued for this study.
