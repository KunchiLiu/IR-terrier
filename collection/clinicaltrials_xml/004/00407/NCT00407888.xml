      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as doxorubicin hydrochloride, cyclophosphamide,
      and paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation, work in different ways to stop
      the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.
      Colony-stimulating factors, such as filgrastim, may increase the number of immune cells
      found in bone marrow or peripheral blood and may help the immune system recover from the
      side effects of chemotherapy. Monoclonal antibodies, such as trastuzumab, can block tumor
      growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others
      find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Giving
      combination chemotherapy and filgrastim together with trastuzumab may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving doxorubicin hydrochloride,
      cyclophosphamide, and filgrastim together followed by paclitaxel albumin-stabilized
      nanoparticle formulation and trastuzumab works in treating patients with breast cancer
      previously treated with surgery

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess disease-free survival following a dose-intensive weekly regimen of Adriamycin +
      oral cyclophosphamide augmented with G-CSF support followed by Abraxane and Herceptin if
      appropriate for adjuvant treatment of high risk breast cancer patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the toxicity associated with this regimen. II. To assess the delivered dose
      intensity of the regimen. III. To assess time to treatment failure and overall survival of
      the regimen. IV. To assess the incidence and severity of delayed nausea and vomiting with
      this regimen.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive dose-intensive chemotherapy comprising doxorubicin hydrochloride IV over
      10-15 minutes on day 1, oral cyclophosphamide once daily on days 1-7, and filgrastim
      subcutaneously on days 2-7. Courses repeat every 7 days for up to 12 weeks in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning 1 week later, patients then receive
      paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation IV over 30 minutes once a week for 12
      weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with
      HER-2/neu positive disease also receive trastuzumab IV over 30-90 minutes once a week for 1
      year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years,
      every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.
