    <textblock>
      This post-marketing study is being conducted to evaluate the long-term safety and
      effectiveness of the Prolieve Thermodilatation® System (Prolieve®) in the treatment of
      Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH). A secondary objective is to assess the safety and
      effectiveness of re-treatment with Prolieve® and determine the percent of subjects electing
      to be re-treated with Prolieve® rather than alternate therapy. This study will follow
      subjects treated with Prolieve® at 2 weeks, 3 months, and on a yearly basis for 5 years
      after treatment. Both efficacy and safety information will be collected at all follow-up
      visits. Procedural and safety information will be collected during treatment to further
      substantiate the findings of the pivotal trial.
