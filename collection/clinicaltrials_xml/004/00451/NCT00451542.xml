  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a retrospective chart review of patients treated for bipolar disorder at the
      TVAMC in the past four years cross-referenced with the electronic pharmacy file for having
      received a prescription of divalproex or lamotrigine.

      The primary objective of the study is to assess the long-term outcome in bipolar patients
      treated with divalproex versus lamotrigine in a retrospective chart review of veterans as
      measured by time to relapse into any significant mood episode (i.e. mania or depression).
      The primary hypothesis is that bipolar patients will demonstrate significantly greater time
      to relapse in those treated with divalproex compared to those treated with lamotrigine. The
      secondary objective of the study is to assess the safety and relative tolerability of
      divalproex and lamotrigine in this population based on discontinuation due to side or
      adverse effect.
