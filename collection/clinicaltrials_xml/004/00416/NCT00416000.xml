  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has been estimated that 80% of deaths from abdominal aortic aneurysms results from
      rupture. Endovascular Aneurysm Repair (EVAR) has been applied to RAAA (Ruptured Abdominal
      Aortic Aneurysm) patients with reports of improvements. Despite the use of EVAR, patients
      have developed complications with lung and kidney function. This study will investigate
      certain biochemical processes that will potentially reduce these complications. Knowledge
      gained from this study may also be used to further research in this field through larger
      studies.
