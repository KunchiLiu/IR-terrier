    <textblock>
      Chronic Prostatitis/Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndrome (CP/CPPS) is a condition with several
      causes of which some remain unknown. It is believed that some types of CP may be genetic and
      passed down (or inherited) from one generation to the next.

      In this study, we are collecting genetic material and medical information to try to
      determine if there are genetic factors may play a role in CP/CPPS. We will be collecting DNA
      (from Saliva) and urine from each participant. Individuals and families with CP/CPPS will be
      enrolled. Family members of an individual with CP/CPPS are eligible whether or not they also
      experience CP/CPPS symptoms.

      To further describe the phenotype of chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome
      (CP/CPPS) and to correlate the phenotypic information with the genotypic findings utilizing
      linkage analysis and candidate gene studies. A North American cohort and a Bulgarian cohort
      will be recruited. Each individual participant will be required to give a DNA sample (via
      Saliva) and a urine sample. All samples will be stored.
