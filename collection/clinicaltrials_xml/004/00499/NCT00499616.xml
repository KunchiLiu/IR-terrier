      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as carboplatin, cyclophosphamide, etoposide, and
      doxorubicin hydrochloride, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either
      by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Isotretinoin may help neuroblastoma
      cells become more like normal cells, and grow and spread more slowly. Giving combination
      chemotherapy with or without isotretinoin before surgery may make the tumor smaller and
      reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed. It is not yet known which
      treatment regimen is more effective in treating young patients with neuroblastoma.

      PURPOSE: This phase III trial is comparing different regimens of combination chemotherapy
      and surgery with or without isotretinoin to see how well they work in treating young
      patients with neuroblastoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Reduce therapy for patients with intermediate-risk neuroblastoma while maintaining a
           3-year overall survival (OS) rate of ≥ 95% by using a response-based duration of
           therapy algorithm.

        -  Maintain an overall 3-year OS rate of ≥ 90% for patients within each group.

        -  Utilize loss of heterozygosity, prospectively, at 1p36 and 11q23 to refine
           risk-stratification and treatment assignment, allowing patients whose tumors lack these
           chromosomal abnormalities to receive a reduction in therapy, and compare the outcome
           with patients treated on COG-A3961.

        -  Reduce intensity of therapy for patients 365 to &lt; 547 days (12-18 months) of age with
           stage 4 neuroblastoma and favorable biological features and maintain a 3-year
           event-free survival (EFS) rate consistent with that for patients &lt; 1 year of age with
           stage 4 neuroblastoma treated on COG-A3961.

        -  Reduce intensity of therapy for patients 365 to &lt; 547 days (12-18 months) of age with
           stage 3 MYCN-nonamplified but unfavorable histology neuroblastoma and maintain a 3-year
           EFS rate consistent with that for patients &lt; 1 year of age with stage 3,
           MYCN-nonamplified, unfavorable histology neuroblastoma treated on COG-A3961.

        -  Reduce surgical morbidity for patients with stage 4S neuroblastoma by allowing for
           biopsy only, rather than complete surgical resection, of the primary tumor.

        -  Systematically study the outcome of patients with stage 4S neuroblastoma who are unable
           to undergo biopsy for biology-based risk assignment.

        -  Determine if the extent of surgical resection correlates with the maintenance of local
           control, EFS and/or OS rates, and surgical complication rate.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the results of a standard retrieval approach for patients with residual
           disease after 8 courses of initial therapy.

        -  Determine the results of a standard retrieval approach for patients with progressive,
           nonmetastatic disease.

        -  Identify additional biological surrogate markers for disease relapse and/or metastatic
           progression.

        -  Describe the neurologic outcome of patients with paraspinal neuroblastoma primary
           tumors.

        -  Correlate surgical biopsy technique with adequacy of tissue acquisition for biologic
           studies and with complications associated with the biopsy procedure.

        -  Prospectively validate the prognostic ability of the International Neuroblastoma Risk
           Group image-defined risk factor system, and compare the institutional assessment of
           image-defined risk factors with that of central review.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups by
      risk-stratification based on age, stage (INSS stage 2, 3, 4, or 4S), MYCN status (amplified
      vs not amplified), histopathologic classification, and tumor DNA index.

        -  Initial chemotherapy: Courses of initial chemotherapy are administered every 21 days
           according to group assignment as outlined below:

             -  Course 1: Patients receive carboplatin IV over 1 hour on day 1 and etoposide IV
                over 1 hour on days 1-3.

             -  Course 2: Patients receive carboplatin IV over 1 hour, cyclophosphamide IV over 1
                hour, and doxorubicin hydrochloride IV over 15 minutes on day 1.

             -  Course 3: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on day 1 and etoposide
                IV over 1 hour on days 1-3.

             -  Course 4: Patients receive carboplatin IV over 1 hour and doxorubicin
                hydrochloride IV over 15 minutes on day 1 and etoposide IV over 1 hour on days
                1-3.

             -  Course 5: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on day 1 and etoposide
                IV over 1 hour on days 1-3.

             -  Course 6: Patients receive carboplatin IV over 1 hour, cyclophosphamide IV over 1
                hour, and doxorubicin hydrochloride IV over 15 minutes on day 1.

             -  Course 7: Patients receive carboplatin IV over 1 hour on day 1 and etoposide IV
                over 1 hour on days 1-3.

             -  Course 8: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour and doxorubicin
                hydrochloride IV over 15 minutes on day 1.

                  -  Group 1: Patients receive 2 courses of initial chemotherapy. Patients with a
                     partial response (PR) (50-90% reduction in volume) to chemotherapy proceed to
                     observation. Patients without a PR receive 2-6 additional courses of
                     chemotherapy (beginning with course 3). Patients who do not achieve a PR
                     after additional chemotherapy proceed to retrieval chemotherapy.

                  -  Group 2: Patients receive 4 courses of initial chemotherapy. Patients with a
                     PR after chemotherapy proceed to observation. Patients without a PR receive
                     2-4 additional courses of chemotherapy (beginning with course 5). Patients
                     who do not achieve a PR after additional chemotherapy proceed to retrieval
                     chemotherapy.

                  -  Group 3: Patients receive 8 courses of initial chemotherapy. Patients under
                     12 months of age with stage 3, 4, or 4S (not including liver metastases)
                     disease who achieve a very good PR (VGPR) (&gt; 90% reduction in the volume of
                     the primary tumor and resolution of metastatic disease) to chemotherapy
                     proceed to observation. Patients 12-18 months of age with stage 3 or 4
                     disease who achieve a VGPR proceed to isotretinoin therapy. Patients who do
                     not achieve a VGPR proceed to retrieval chemotherapy.

                  -  Group 4: Patients receive 8 courses of initial chemotherapy. If a VGPR cannot
                     be achieved following 8 courses of first-line chemotherapy +/- surgery, then
                     retrieval chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide/topotecan for 2-6 courses is
                     administered until a VGPR can be achieved with a combination of chemotherapy
                     and surgery.

        -  Retrieval chemotherapy*: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 30 minutes and
           topotecan IV over 30 minutes on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6
           courses.

             -  Groups 1 and 2: Patients with a PR after 2-6 courses of retrieval chemotherapy
                proceed to observation. Patients without a PR after 2-6 courses of retrieval
                chemotherapy are removed from protocol therapy.

             -  Group 3: Patients under 12 months of age with stage 4 disease with a VGPR after
                retrieval chemotherapy proceed to observation. Patients 12-18 months of age with
                stage 3 or 4 disease who achieve a VGPR after retrieval chemotherapy proceed to
                isotretinoin therapy. Patients who do not achieve a VGPR after retrieval
                chemotherapy are removed from protocol therapy.

             -  Group 4: Group 4 patients who fail to achieve a VGPR or who develop progressive,
                non-metastatic disease within 3 years of study enrollment proceed to isotretinoin
                therapy. Isotretinoin is also administered to the following Group 4 patients:

                  -  Age 365 to &lt; 547 days at diagnosis, INSS stage 3, MYCN-NA, unfavorable
                     histology, any ploidy

                  -  Age 365 to &lt; 547 days at diagnosis, INSS stage 4, MYCN-NA, favorable
                     histology, DI &gt; 1 NOTE: *Patients who have previously received
                     cyclophosphamide and topotecan to achieve first PR/VGPR are not eligible for
                     this Retrieval Therapy.

        -  Surgery: With the exception of patients with INSS 4S disease, patients undergo surgery
           to remove as much of the primary tumor and involved lymph nodes as can safely be
           accomplished. Reassessment for definitive surgery (for patients who undergo biopsy only
           or partial resection at diagnosis) is made at the completion of scheduled chemotherapy
           (after course 2 for group 1, after course 4 for group 2, and after course 8 for groups
           3 and 4).

        -  Isotretinoin therapy: Beginning 3-4 weeks after completion of chemotherapy or 2 weeks
           post-operatively (for patients who undergo surgical resection), patients receive oral
           isotretinoin twice daily on days 1-14. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 6 courses in
           the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up periodically for up to 10 years.

      Data from patients with low-risk disease who are observed following surgical resection only
      and are not enrolled on ANBL0531, are collected for study objectives.

          -  Must already be enrolled on protocol COG-ANBL00B1

               -  Simultaneous enrollment on COG-ANBL00B1 and this study allowed for clinical
                  situations in which emergent treatment may be indicated including, but not
                  limited to, the following criteria:

                    -  Epidural or intraspinal tumors with existing or impending neurologic
                       impairment

                    -  Periorbital or calvarial-based lesions with existing or impending cranial
                       nerve impairment

                    -  Anatomic or mechanical compromise of critical organ function by tumor
                       (e.g., abdominal compartment syndrome, urinary obstruction)

                    -  Asymptomatic but, in the opinion of the treating physician, it is in the
                       patient's best interest to begin chemotherapy immediately due to impending
                       risk of neurologic impairment or organ dysfunction

          -  If patient receives study chemotherapy prior to undergoing diagnostic biopsy, the
             biopsy must be performed within 96 hours of beginning study therapy

               -  The only exception to this requirement is for patients with stage 4S disease who
                  are considered too ill to undergo a diagnostic procedure will be waived the
                  requirement for diagnostic tissue submission but will still need to be enrolled
                  on COG-ANBL00B1

                    -  For patients with stage 4S disease who are very ill and in whom an open
                       biopsy to obtain tissue for diagnosis and biologic studies is considered
                       medically contraindicated, every effort should be made to obtain some tumor
                       tissue by either fine-needle aspiration of a metastatic site of disease
                       and/or sampling of involved bone marrow, so that this tumor sample can be
                       submitted for MYCN determination

          -  Patients who require emergent therapy, either prior to the diagnostic biopsy or
             before biology features are available, can be enrolled simultaneously on COG-ANBL00B1
             and COG-ANBL0531 to receive emergent protocol therapy

               -  In emergent circumstances, COG-ANBL0531 protocol therapy may be initiated prior
                  to enrollment on study as long as the patient has neuroblastoma by clinical
                  diagnosis, all other COG-ANBL0531 eligibility criteria are met, and the
                  COG-ANBL0531 Initial Therapy consent has been signed prior to starting protocol
                  therapy; in this circumstance ANBL0531 enrollment must occur within 4 working
                  days of starting protocol therapy

               -  Clinical situations in which emergent enrollment and treatment may be indicated
                  include, but are not limited to, the following circumstances:

                    -  Epidural or intraspinal tumors with existing or impending neurologic
                       impairment

                    -  Periorbital or calvarial-based lesions with existing or impending cranial
                       nerve impairment

                    -  Anatomic or mechanical compromise of critical organ function by tumor
                       (e.g., abdominal compartment syndrome, urinary obstruction)

                    -  Evolving hepatomegaly in infants less than 2 months of age

          -  See Disease Characteristics

        PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY:

          -  See Disease Characteristics

          -  No other prior chemotherapy or radiotherapy with the exception of dexamethasone

          -  No participation in another COG study with tumor therapeutic intent
