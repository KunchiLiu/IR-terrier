    <measure>Number of Subjects Reporting Any and Grade 3 Solicited Local Symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>During a 7-day follow-up period (Days 0-6) after any vaccination</time_frame>
    <description>Solicited local symptoms assessed were pain, redness and swelling. Any was defined as any solicited local symptom reported irrespective of intensity grade. Grade 3 pain was defined as pain that prevented normal activity. Grade 3 redness and swelling were defined as redness and swelling above 50 millimeters (mm).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Subjects Reporting Any, Grade 3 and Related Solicited General Symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>During a 7-day follow-up period (Days 0-6) after any vaccination</time_frame>
    <description>Solicited general symptoms assessed were arthralgia, fatigue, fever, gastrointestinal, headache, myalgia, rash and urticaria. Any fever = axillary temperature ≥37.5 degrees Celsius (°C). For other symptoms: Any = any solicited general symptom reported irrespective of intensity and relationship to vaccination. Related = symptoms considered by the investigator as causally related to vaccination. Grade 3 symptoms = symptoms that prevented normal activity. Grade 3 urticaria = urticaria distributed on at least 4 body areas. Grade 3 fever = axillary temperature &gt;39.0°C.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Subjects Reporting Any, Grade 3, Related and Grade 3 and Related Unsolicited Adverse Events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>During a 30-day (Days 0-29) post-vaccination period</time_frame>
    <description>An unsolicited AE covers any AE reported in addition to those solicited during the clinical study and any solicited symptom with onset outside the specified period of follow-up for solicited symptoms. Any was defined as the occurrence of any unsolicited AE regardless of intensity grade or relation to vaccination. Grade 3 = event which prevented normal, everyday activities. Related = event assessed by the investigators as causally related to the study vaccination. Grade 3 and Related = grade 3 event assessed by the investigators as causally related to the study vaccination.</description>

    <measure>Number of Subjects With Grade 3, Any and Related Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Throughout the study period (up to Month 7).</time_frame>
    <description>SAEs assessed include medical occurrences that result in death, are life threatening, require hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization, result in disability/incapacity or are a congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a study subject. Grade 3 SAE = SAE which prevented normal, everyday activities. Any was defined as occurrence of any symptom regardless of intensity grade and related was an event assessed by the investigator as causally related to the study vaccination.</description>

             must be obtained from the subject.

          -  Free of obvious health problems as established by medical history and
             history-directed physical examination before entering into the study.

          -  Subjects of childbearing potential must not be pregnant.

          -  Subjects must be of non-childbearing potential, or if the subject is of childbearing

          -  Use of any investigational or non-registered product (drug or vaccine) other than the
             study vaccine(s) within 30 days preceding the first dose of study vaccine, or planned
             use during the study period.

          -  Concurrently participating in another clinical study at any time during the study
             period, in which the subject has been or will be exposed to an investigational or

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding.

          -  Planning to become pregnant or likely to become pregnant (as determined by the

        <description>Solicited general symptoms assessed were arthralgia, fatigue, fever, gastrointestinal, headache, myalgia, rash and urticaria.

Related = symptoms considered by the investigator as causally related to vaccination. Grade 3 symptoms = symptoms that prevented normal activity. Grade 3 urticaria = urticaria distributed on at least 4 body areas. Grade 3 fever = axillary temperature &gt;39.0°C.</description>
