      A phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, dose-ranging study
      to investigate the efficacy and safety of 4 dose regimens of ORAL albaconazole in subjects
      with distal subungual onychomycosis. Subjects will take oral study drug for up to 36 weeks
      and then will be followed for an additional 16 weeks to determine if the study drug was
      efficacious. Subjects will have routine blood draws and other safety assessments during the
      study, as well as regular assessments of their toenail fungus
