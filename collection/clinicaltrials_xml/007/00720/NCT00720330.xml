  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are conducting this study to find out if intravenous (injected through the
      vein) infusion of lidocaine and ketamine administered with general anesthesia is as
      effective as a paravertebral block in lessening pain after surgery and that both of these
      techniques are superior to general anesthesia alone in reducing pain immediately after
      surgery and in the long-term.

      Participants will be randomized into one of three study groups; Group 1 - Paravertebral
      Group - ropivacaine is injected near the spine before surgery. Midazolam and fentanyl are
      administered intravenously for sedation. Group 2 - Lidocaine/Ketamine - General anesthesia
      with lidocaine and ketamine administered intravenously throughout your surgery and for 60
      minutes after surgery. Group 3 - General Anesthesia Alone. General anesthesia with placebo
      administered intravenously throughout surgery and for 60 minutes after surgery. All
      participants will rate their pain on a scale from 0 to 10 after surgery and on days 1 and 2
      after surgery. Participants are called 3 and 6 months after surgery for pain and quality of
      life assessments
