  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of subcutaneous (under
      the skin) administration of anti-interleukin-6 monoclonal antibody (CNTO 136) in reducing
      signs and symptoms of participants with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with methotrexate
      (MTX) therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, double-blind (neither physician nor participants knows the treatment
      that the participant receives), randomized (study medication is assigned by chance),
      placebo-controlled (an inactive substance is compared with a medication to test whether the
      medication has a real effect in a clinical study) study. This study will be conducted in 2
      parts (Part A and Part B). Each part consists of 3 phases: screening (approximately 1 month
      prior to the start of study medication), treatment phase (Part A: 22 weeks and Part B: 24
      weeks), and follow-up phase (approximately 4 months after the last administration of study
      medication). In Part A, participants will be randomly assigned to 2 groups to receive CNTO
      136 100 mg and placebo for 22 weeks. All participants in Part A, will be crossed over at
      Week 12 from placebo to CNTO 136 (for Group 1) and from CNTO 136 to placebo (for Group 2).
      In Part B, participants will be randomly assigned to 5 groups to receive placebo and/or 1 of
      3 doses of CNTO 136 (100mg, 50mg or 25mg) for 24 weeks. Participants in Part B, Group 1 will
      be crossed over at Week 12 from placebo to CNTO 136. All participants should be maintained
      on a stable dose of MTX for at least 6 weeks prior to the start of study medication through
      Week 24. Safety will be evaluated by the assessment of adverse events, vital signs, clinical
      findings, 12-lead electrocardiogram, and clinical laboratory tests which will be monitored
      throughout the study. The total duration of study participation for a participant will be
      approximately 42 weeks.

    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>An ACR 50 response is defined as a greater than or equal to 50 percent improvement from baseline in swollen (66 joints) and tender (68 joints) joint counts and greater than or equal to 50 percentage improvement in 3 of the following 5 assessments: 1) Participant's assessment of pain by Visual Analog Scale (VAS) (0-10 cm), 2) Participant's global assessment of disease activity by VAS (0-10 cm), 3) Physician's global assessment of disease activity by VAS (0-10 cm) 4) Participant's assessment of physical function as measured by the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) and 5) C reactive protein.</description>

    <measure>Part A and Part B: Change from baseline in Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS28) using C-reactive protein (CRP) at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>DAS28 using CRP is an index to measure the disease activity in participants with rheumatoid arthritis combining tender joints (28 joints), swollen joints (28 joints), CRP, and participant's global assessment of disease activity. The DAS28 score ranges from 0 (best) to 10 (worst). DAS28 score above 5.1 means high disease activity whereas a DAS28 below 3.2 indicates low disease activity. Higher scores indicate worsening.</description>
