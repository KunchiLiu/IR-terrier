      STUDY OBJECTIVES: To determine whether the addition of L-arginine to treatment as usual
      (TAU) in schizophrenia further improves and enhances therapeutic efficacy (positive,
      negative and depressive symptoms) and effectiveness of antipsychotic treatment

      STUDY POPULATION: Patients diagnosed (DSM-IV criteria) with schizophrenia or schizoaffective
      disorder

      Total expected number of patients: 14

      INVESTIGATIONAL COMPOUND: L-arginine capsules, 3 grams of L-arginine given twice a day
      (total daily dose of 6 grams/day)

      DURATION OF ACTIVE TREATMENT: 3 weeks followed by wash-out phase of 5 days and 3 weeks of
      second treatment phase (cross-over design)

      EVALUATION CRITERIA: Primary (efficacy) outcomes: PANSS scores. Secondary outcomes: Calgary
      Depression Scale for schizophrenia, CGI; AIMS, UKU-assessment of side-effects

      ASSESSMENT SCHEDULE: Treatment arm 1: Baseline, weeks: 1,2,3, wash-out phase; week 4,
      cross-over phase: treatment phase-2; weeks 5,6,7

      STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS: Analysis of variance of outcome measures with treatment as the
      between-subject factor and pre- and post-treatment scores as within- subjects factors.

      DURATION OF STUDY PERIOD: Patient recruitment to be completed in 12 months, study full
      completion 18 months.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Aged 18-65 years

          2. Diagnoses of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder using the Diagnostic and
             Statistical Manual-IV (DSM-IV) criteria

          3. Competent and willing to give informed consent

          4. Able to take oral medication and likely to complete the required evaluations.

          5. Medication remained stable 4 weeks prior to baseline.

          6. Female participants of child bearing capability must be willing to use adequate
             contraceptives (4.6.1a) for the duration of the study, and, willing to have a
             pregnancy test pretreatment and during the study.

        Adequate contraception is defined as use of contraceptive double barrier system (i.e.
        condom and spermicide) or contraceptive implant, oral contraceptive or injected depot
        contraceptive plus other form of contraceptive, i.e. condom. Females will be considered
        incapable of child bearing if they are one year postmenopausal or irreversibly surgically
        sterilised.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Relevant medical illness [serious renal, diabetes, hepatic, cardiac, low- or
             high-blood-pressure or other illnesses] in the opinion of the investigators. In
             particular, history of past or recent cardiac illness, MI and abnormal ECG and
             current treatments for cardiac illness. The results of the Laboratory Investigations
             (LFT, TFT, RFT, WBC, ECG, platelets, blood chemistry, lipids, weight/BMI) will be
             taken into account in determining the exclusion criteria.

               1. Relevant medical illness will be determined in the first instance by asking the
                  patients mental health care team if the patient has any medical
                  condition/problems. After consent has been obtained, the research nurse/research
                  doctor will then have access to the patient's notes and if necessary communicate
                  with his/her GP and will assess patient eligibility to take part in the clinical
                  trial by scrutinising the patient's past medical history, most recent blood
                  results, electrocardiograms, as well as any physical tests that have been
                  performed on the patient. If there are any deviations from the 'norm' the
                  investigators will assess the eligibility of the individual patient.

               2. Patients receiving active treatments for Herpes virus as L-arginine may
                  counteract the benefits of lysine to treat herpes virus

               3. Patients who are currently receiving NSAIDs or other drugs that can cause
                  significant stomach an gastrointestinal side-effects

               4. Drugs that alter potassium levels in the body, such as ACE inhibitors and
                  potassium sparing diuretics

               5. Patients who are pregnant or plan to become pregnant while using this amino acid

               6. Patients who are breastfeeding

               7. Prior history of intolerance to L-arginine

               8. Any significant change of psychotropic medications done within the previous 4
                  weeks

               9. Diagnosis of substance abuse (except nicotine or caffeine) or dependence within
                  the last three months according to DSM-IV criteria
