    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well giving vorinostat, cladribine, and rituximab together
      works in treating patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia
      (CLL), or B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) that has returned after a period of
      improvement. Vorinostat may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cladribine, work in different
      ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from
      dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab, may
      block cancer growth in different ways by targeting certain cells. Giving vorinostat together
      with cladribine and rituximab may kill more cancer cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine objective response rates of the SCR regimen (vorinostat, cladribine, and
      rituximab) in B-cell malignancies.

      II. Determine the tolerability and toxicities of the SCR regimen.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate progression free survival in patients treated with SCR. II. Estimate event free
      survival for patients treated with SCR. III. Determine the contribution (if any) of
      deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylation/histone deacetylation to disease progression and/or
      response to SCR combination chemotherapy.

      IV. Perform scientific correlates to determine if SCR treatment a) is associated with global
      and gene specific changes in transcription of messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA)s and micro
      ribonucleic acid (MiRNA)s b) is acting as an inhibitor of DNA methylation c) is activating
      or silencing specific genes or miRNAs.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive vorinostat orally (PO) on days 1-14, cladribine intravenously (IV) over 2
      hours on days 1-5, and rituximab IV on day 3 (weekly for the first course). Treatment
      repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 2 years and then every 6
      months thereafter.
