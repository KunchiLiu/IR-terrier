      Additional objectives are:

        -  parallel sampling of blood and saliva for the determination of drug concentrations and
           pharmacokinetic parameters in a substudy on the day of first application and during
           steady state

        -  attempt to establish a therapeutical drug monitoring

        -  collection of further safety data during prolonged add-on treatments (compassionate
           use)
