  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this evaluation is to determine the effectiveness of an educational program
      designed to assist family caregivers to learn the knowledge and skills to take better care
      of their frail elder relatives and themselves.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Spouses, children, and other family members typically care for frail elderly persons. These
      family caregivers attempt to provide care for their relative in the home, despite the
      potential for excessive stress to themselves. This care may extend over many years,
      involving unrelenting management of their relative, which puts the caregiver at risk for the
      development of physical and mental health consequences. The stress of caring for a frail
      elder may result in the institutionalization of the care receiver due to declining health or
      abilities in the caregiver as caregivers frequently continue to provide care at the expense
      of their own health. The goal of the education program is to fill an important need, that
      is, assist caregivers to become empowered, hardier, and have the ability to cope with the
      stress associated with caregiving. The aim is to investigate whether this educational
      intervention improves selected outcomes for family caregivers of frail elders. The selected
      outcomes are knowledge of caregiving, hardiness, quality of life, physical health,
      depressive symptoms, burden, and coping.
