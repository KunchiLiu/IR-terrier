  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple agents have been studied to prevent radiocontrast nephropathy after the
      administration of radiocontrast agents. One of these agents is N-acetylcysteine. Previous
      trials to assess the efficacy of n-acetylcystenine in the prevention of contrast nephropathy
      have been promising.

      Previous work in this field has limited applicability to the Emergency Department (ED)
      patient population for two reasons:

        1. Many of the pretreatment strategies employed in these studies take several hours or
           even days to perform, which is not feasible in acutely ill ED patients.

        2. Most of these studies were conducted in patients undergoing cardiac catheterization.
           This may be a very different population than patients in the ED undergoing abdominal or
           chest computed tomography.

      We wish to study the efficacy of N-acetylcysteine as an agent to prevent radiocontrast
      nephropathy in ED patients undergoing computerized tomography. We propose a randomized,
      double-blind, controlled trial comparing saline hydration plus N-acetylcysteine versus
      saline hydration alone. The hypothesis of this study is that N-acetylcysteine with normal
      saline will be more effective than saline alone in the prevention of radiocontrast
      nephropathy.
