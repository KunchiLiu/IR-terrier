    <textblock>
      Both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes (T1DM and T2DM) develop when there is impaired insulin
      production. The amount of insulin that can be produced, the amount of insulin producing beta
      cells in thepancreas and level of insulin and glucose in the blood are, however, imperfectly
      correlated. The development of a reliable method to noninvasively quantitate the beta cell
      mass (BCM) would be of great benefit by providing an important endpoint for the development
      of new treatments of T1DM and T2DM. We have previously identified a specific marker on islet
      cells called VMAT2 that we now propose to use in positron emission tomography (P.E.T.)
      scanning to determine islet cell mass. This radioligand, [11C]DTBZ, has been used previously
      in human subjects in clinical trials evaluating P.E.T scanning of the brain in patients with
      bipolar illness and schizophrenia compared to healthy control subjects. We hypothesize that
      P.E.T scans will be able to differentiate between normal, reduced or increased BCM in human
      subjects. Subjects with normal BCM will be recruited from among normal weight nondiabetic
      people with plasma insulin levels within the normal range. Subjects with predicted reduced
      BCM will be recruited from among patients with T1DM who have with low or not measurable
      insulin levels. If results from the nondiabetic subjects and the subjects with T1DM are
      found to differ significantly, subjects with increased BCM will be recruited from among
      patients with hyperinsulinemia including those with obesity and the metabolic syndrome. PET
      scan measurements of the pancreas will be obtained and compared in people predicted, on the
      basis of biochemical testing, to have normal or reduced, or increased BCM.

      An important determinant of progression to diabetes is beta cell mass (BCM). Measurement of
      plasma insulin has been used as a surrogate marker but insulin levels often do not correlate
      well with beta cell mass and development of means to assess BCM would provide an important
      endpoint. For example, highrisk individuals could be monitored prior to onset of diabetes or
      patients could be monitored prospectively to determine the progression of their disease and
      response to therapy. We have previously identified a specific marker on beta cells called
      VMAT2. We propose to use a radioligand, [11C]DTBZ, that binds to VMAT2 in positron emission
      tomography (P.E.T.) scanning to assess whether P.E.T. can measure beta cell masses. This
      radioligand, [11C]DTBZ, has been used previously in human subjects in clinical trials
      evaluating P.E.T scanning of the brain in patients with bipolar illness and schizophrenia
      compared to healthy control subjects. We hypothesize that P.E.T. with [11C]DTBZ will
      differentiate between normal, reduced or increased beta cell mass in human subjects.
      Subjects with predicted normal beta cell mass will be recruited from among normal weight
      nondiabetic people with plasma insulin levels within the normal range. Subjects with
      predicted reduced beta cell mass will be recruited from among patients with Type 1 diabetes
      who have low or not measurable insulin levels. Subjects with predicted increased beta cell
      mass will be recruited from among obese nondiabetic patients with hyperinsulinemia.
      Measurements of [11C]DTBZ uptake in the pancreas will be obtained and compared in the study
      population.

        Potential subjects with diabetes will be recruited from among the patients cared for at
        the Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center. Nondiabetic subjects will either be referred by their
        physicians or by word of mouth. Primary care physicians will be made aware of the study by
        fliers.
