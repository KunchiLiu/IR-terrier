      This study is designed to test whether an alternative medicine treatment, fish oil, will
      prevent depressive symptoms in pregnant and postpartum women who have been found to be at
      risk for depression. Epidemiologists have observed that people who live in countries where
      people on average eat a diet high in fish have a lower risk of depression than people who
      live in populations that eat less fish. Postpartum depression is also less common in these
      countries. The omega-3 fatty acids found in fish oil are thought to be responsible for this
      beneficial effect of eating fish. The two major omega-3 fatty acids found in fish are
      eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). DHA is an essential building
      block of the brain and nerve tissue. EPA may act to optimize the electrical signals between
      nerve cells and brain cells and may help the immune system to function well.

      Some researchers have treated people who are already suffering from depression with fish
      oil. Some of these studies have shown a benefit for the fish oil treatment and others have
      not. These studies have tested EPA and DHA alone and in various combinations. Currently, it
      is not known whether EPA or DHA is more effective in preventing and treating depression.
      Some of the researchers involved in this study have learned how to identify mothers who are
      most at risk for developing depression during and after pregnancy. This study is designed to
      learn whether EPA-rich and DHA-rich fish oil supplements will prevent depressive symptoms in
      women who are at risk to develop depression.
