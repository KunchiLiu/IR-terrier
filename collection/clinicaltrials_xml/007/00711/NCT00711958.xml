  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, multicenter clinical phase III study involving about 105
      cancer patients aged &gt;18 years who are receiving palliative chemotherapy and who are
      suffering from chemotherapy associated anemia. A standard treatment group (ERYPO®) will be
      included to provide a reference reflecting current standard medical practice.

    <textblock>
      Eligible patients were randomized to one of two different treatment groups (EPO HEXAL or
      ERYPO) in a 2:1 ratio. Patients received double-blind treatment for a period of 12 weeks.
      Following randomization the patients were treated subcutaneously with a dose of 150 IU/kg
      body weight of study drug three times per week. Dose adjustments to 300 IU/kg body weight
      three times per week were to be done if hemoglobin (Hb) increased &lt;1.0 g/dL or the
      reticulocyte count increased &lt;40,000 /μl after 4 weeks or if Hb increased &lt;2.0 g/dL after 8
      weeks of treatment. The primary endpoint was the Hb response in the EPO HEXAL group during
      weeks 5-12 of the study defined as absolute increase in Hb value of 2.0 g/dL from the mean
      value of the screening/baseline period in the absence of red blood cell transfusion during
      the preceding 4 weeks. For that purpose, Hb levels were measured at the weekly study visits
      by a central laboratory. Further parameters of treatment efficacy, safety and tolerability
      were recorded.
