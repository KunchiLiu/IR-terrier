  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a pilot randomized, sham-controlled trial of acupuncture for Head and Neck
      Cancer (HNC) patients with dysphagia after chemoradiation therapy (CRT). The following
      hypotheses will be evaluated:

      Aim 1. HNC patients will be willing and eligible to participate in a clinical trial of
      acupuncture, and be adherent to protocol acupuncture and baseline and follow-up outcomes
      testing.

      Aim 2. At 20 weeks post CRT and 6 months following the acupuncture treatment: a) the MDADI
      total score and its sub-scores will be higher in active acupuncture vs. sham control; b) the
      time-to-removal of the feeding tube will be shorter in the active acupuncture vs. sham
      control; c) body weight recovery will increase faster in active acupuncture vs. sham
      control.

      Aim 3. At 20 weeks post CRT, the plasma Transforming Growth Factor (TGF)-β1 level measured
      in patients treated with acupuncture will demonstrate trends of a decreased level when
      compared with a group of similar patients treated with sham acupuncture.

      AIMS:

      Aim 1. To assess the feasibility of recruiting and retaining HNC patients with dysphagia
      into a randomized sham-controlled trial of acupuncture.

      Aim 2. To collect preliminary data on the efficacy of acupuncture in changing scores of
      HRQOL in post CRT head and neck cancer patients.

      Aim 3. In a subset of HNC subjects treated with both active and sham acupuncture, to collect
      objective measures on swallowing functions using Videofluoroscopic swallowing study (VFSS);
      salivary flow production; and plasma Transforming Growth Factor (TGF)-β1, Interleukin 6
      (IL-6), Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and Interleukin 13 levels.
