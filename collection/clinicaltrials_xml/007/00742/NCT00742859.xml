  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prevention of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). Hypothesis: In patients with
      non-valvular AF, orally administered betrixaban will provide similar or better efficacy and
      safety than warfarin and it will offer the advantage of not requiring dose adjustments due
      to INRs outside the target range of 2.0 to 3.0 and a more consistent level of
      anticoagulation over time.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To assess the safety and tolerability of betrixaban at doses of 40 mg, 60 mg and 80 mg given
      orally once a day for at least 3 months compared to dose-adjusted warfarin in patients with
      non-valvular atrial fibrillation (AF).

      This is a Phase 2, exploratory, randomized, parallel group, multicenter, active comparator,
      dose finding study of patients with documented non-valvular AF. Patients will be randomized
      (1:1:1:1) to 1 of 4 treatment groups (approximately 125 patients per group) using an IVRS. A
      dynamic randomization will be used to balance patients by country, concurrent aspirin use
      (yes or no) and antecedent warfarin (yes or no). The study will be open label for
      randomization to warfarin versus betrixaban, but the three daily doses of betrixaban, 40 mg,
      60 mg or 80 mg, will be double-blind (identical capsules for all three dose levels). The
      warfarin-treated patients will be managed according to each center's usual clinical routine
      with INR monitoring and dose-adjustments in order to maintain a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 at
      maximum intervals of four weeks. No loading doses or dose titrations will be used for
      betrixaban. The betrixaban dose should be ingested in the evening (e.g. at bedtime),
      preferably at least 2 hours after the evening meal. Note: acenocumerol may be substituted
      for warfarin as indicated by local practice.
