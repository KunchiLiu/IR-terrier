      This study is an investigation of the effect of a computer-based working memory training
      program on memory and language processing in at-risk children (e.g., those with working
      memory weaknesses) who have received cochlear implants.

      The long-term goal of this research program is to improve speech-language outcomes in
      prelingually deaf children who receive CIs. The objective of this proposal is to investigate
      the short-term effects of a novel working memory training program on memory, learning, and
      speech-language outcomes in children with CIs. The specific hypothesis of this project is
      that completion of a behaviorally-based training program designed to increase working memory
      capacity will improve attention, working memory span, and working memory-related
      speech-language processing in a group of deaf children with CIs. This hypothesis is based on
      past research demonstrating the efficacy of working memory training programs in improving
      attention and working memory in children with attention deficits, as well as on past
      research showing an association between working memory and speech-language outcomes in
      children with CIs. Knowledge about the effects of working memory training on CI
      speech-language outcomes will provide a better understanding of the process by which
      children with CIs learn speech-language following implantation and may offer an entirely new
      avenue of intervention to improve speech-language outcomes, particularly in deaf children
      who show limited improvement following implantation.

      The specific aims of this study are:

        1. Specific Aim 1: Determine the feasibility and application of a novel, computer-based
           working memory training program when applied to children with CIs. We hypothesize that
           children with CIs will show a progression of learning in both auditory and visual
           working memory during the training program that will mirror that of normal-hearing
           children.

        2. Specific Aim 2: Determine the effect of the working memory training program on core
           attention, concentration, and working memory processes of children with CIs. We
           hypothesize that children with CIs will show improvement on both laboratory-based and
           parent-report measures of attention, concentration, and working memory processes after
           working memory training, compared to a baseline period.

        3. Specific Aim 3: Determine the effect of the working memory training program on working
           memory-related speech-language outcome measures in children with CIs. We hypothesize
           that children with CIs will show improvement on auditory working memory, verbal naming
           fluency, and word repetition after training.

    <description>The Cogmed Working Memory Training program is a 5-week program of computer-based exercises that require the user to complete tasks involving verbal, visual, or combined verbal-visual memory skills. In addition to memory skills, Cogmed tasks demand attention, concentration, and reasoning skills. Users are expected to practice Cogmed exercises at home for 40 minutes/day, 5 days/week, during the 5-week training period. The program uses an adaptive algorithm that presents users with problems of increasing difficulty at a level slightly higher than that at which they have recently achieved success.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  age 7-16 years at the time of study enrollment,

          -  profound bilateral hearing loss (&gt; 90 dB HL in the better hearing ear),

          -  implantation prior to age 3 years,

          -  use of multichannel CI's,

          -  a monolingual English home environment,

          -  enrollment in an aural rehabilitative program that encourages the development of
             speaking and listening skills,

          -  educational environment that uses oral or total communication (TC) strategies,

          -  sufficient speech perception and language competence to complete basic word and
             sentence repetition tasks,

          -  no significant developmental delay or neurological condition that, in the opinion of
             the investigators, would interfere markedly with cognitive functioning,

          -  Windows-based PC at home capable of running Cogmed working memory training software,

          -  mild or greater deficit in working memory, as shown by either (a) a Behavior Rating
             Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF) working memory T-score of 50 or higher or (b)
             a Digit Span scaled score of 10 or lower. Subjects will be discontinued if during the
             study they have any new or changed intervention (including medication) that involves
             working memory, attention, concentration, or executive functioning.
