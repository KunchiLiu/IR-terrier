    <textblock>
      The purpose of this multicenter, two-arm, exact binomial single-stage, phase II trial is to
      determine the preliminary efficacy and safety of RAD001 in patients with histological
      evidence of progressive or metastatic bone or soft tissue sarcoma.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Histological evidence of progressive or metastatic bone or soft tissue sarcoma.

        The following tumor types are included:

          -  liposarcoma

          -  synovial sarcoma

          -  malignant paraganglioma

          -  fibrosarcoma

          -  leiomyosarcoma

          -  angiosarcoma including haemangiopericytoma

          -  malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor

          -  STS, not otherwise specified

          -  miscellaneous sarcoma including mixed mesodermal tumors of the uterus

          -  osteosarcoma

          -  Ewing's sarcoma

          -  rhabdomyosarcoma

          -  gastrointestinal stromal tumor (only after failure or intolerance of imatinib or

          -  alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS)

               -  Objective progression of disease may be documented by RECIST criteria. Any of
                  the following would be sufficient according to RECIST:

          -  a 20% increase in the sum of unidimensionally measured target lesions

          -  a new lesion

          -  unequivocal increase in non-measurable disease.

               -  Patients must have disease not amenable to surgery, radiation, or combined
                  modality therapy with curative intent.

               -  ECOG performance status 0 - 2.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Anticancer therapy within 3 weeks of enrollment including chemotherapy, hormonal therapy,
        immunotherapy, or radiotherapy.

          -  The following tumor types will not be included:

               -  gastrointestinal stromal tumor (except for patients after treatment with
                  imatinib or sunitinib in 1st and 2nd line)

               -  chondrosarcoma

               -  malignant mesothelioma

               -  neuroblastoma.

          -  Prior therapy with RAD001 (everolimus) or other rapamycins (sirolimus, temsirolimus).

          -  Neurotoxicity &gt; grade 2 CTC.

          -  Radiation of the lung.

        Other protocol-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply
