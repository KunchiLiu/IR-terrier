      1. The polycystic ovary syndrome is the major cause of infertility in the United States.
           Metformin has been shown to increase frequency of ovulations in PCOS, and is used in
           clinical practice to treat infertility, but some women with PCOS do not respond to
           metformin treatment.

        2. Knowing that a specific gene predicts the effect of metformin on ovulation would
           facilitate more efficient and effective treatment of infertility in PCOS.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) affects approximately 6-10% of women of childbearing
      age, i.e., 3.5-5.5 million women in the United States. PCOS is the most common endocrine
      disturbance of young women and the major cause (75%) of anovulatory infertility in the
      United States. We hypothesize that women with the polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) who have
      the G/G genotype of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)_ rs8111699 in STK11 will exhibit a
      significantly greater response to metformin, in terms of ovulation, compared with women with
      either the C/G or C/C genotype. Specifically, we anticipate the frequency of ovulation
      (defined by number of ovulations/9 months/subject) to be at least 2-fold higher in women
      with the G/G STK11 genotype compared with women with either the C/G or C/C genotype.

      To test this hypothesis, we will obtain DNA for STK11 genotyping in 36 women with PCOS who
      are treated with metformin and carefully monitored for ovulation for 9 months. STK11
      genotype status will be determined, and the ovulation rates in the G/G, G/C and C/C genotype
      groups will be compared with one another. Our goal is to identify the genes that predict or
      modify response to commonly prescribed medications that will allow physicians to better
      choose among existing therapies and individualize treatment. While metformin has been shown
      to increase ovulatory frequency in PCOS and is widely used in clinical practice to treat
      infertility, a substantial number of women either do not respond or are slow to respond to
      metformin treatment.

      Knowing that a specific STK11 genotype predicts the effect of metformin on ovulation would
      facilitate more efficient and effective treatment of infertility in PCOS.
