    <textblock>
      For the primary goals, we hypothesize that 1) the oral tobacco product will be more
      efficacious than the medicinal nicotine product in substituting for smoking cigarettes; 2)
      among non-abstainers, the oral tobacco product will lead to greater reduction in cigarette
      smoking than medicinal nicotine; and 3) a higher rate of oral tobacco compared to medicinal
      nicotine use will be observed during and beyond the treatment period.

      For the secondary goals, we hypothesize that 1) both products will equally reduce withdrawal
      symptoms and negative affect from cigarette abstinence, but smokers who are assigned to the
      oral tobacco product will be more likely to report liking the effects from their assigned
      product compared to those smokers assigned to medicinal nicotine; 2) greater physiological
      effects (e.g., vitals) will be observed for the oral tobacco product compared to medicinal
      nicotine; 3) the toxicant exposure and toxicity will be reduced dramatically when smokers
      switch from cigarettes to each of these products; however, this reduction will be greater
      with the use of medicinal nicotine; 4) although the abstinence rates will be higher for oral
      tobacco products, and initial product costs will be lower, relative to the medicinal
      nicotine intervention, the likelihood of longer duration of oral tobacco use will increase
      the oral tobacco cost over time for the user; and 5) switching to low-nitrosamine oral
      tobacco will reduce life-years lost compared to continuing smoking and will be a
      cost-effective (in terms of life-years saved) substitution strategy compared to medicinal
      nicotine.

      This second study under &quot;Oral Tobacco as a Harm Reduction Product&quot; grant is a clinical
      trial. Subjects will be randomized to the brand of smokeless tobacco that is determined to
      be most effective in Study 1 or to nicotine gum for 12 weeks to compare complete
      substitution for smoking. The secondary aims are to determine the effects of the products on
      biomarkers of exposure and toxicity. If the sample size is sufficient, then comparisons will
      be made across products on these measures while controlling for amount of tobacco use. Other
      secondary aims include examining the reliability of our biological measures in a control
      group that continues to smoke, the extent of constituent extraction after oral pouch tobacco
      use, the relationship between extent of constituent extraction and biomarkers of exposure,
      and finally, withdrawal symptoms from the oral tobacco products. Two sites will be used for
      these studies: University of Minnesota and Oregon Research Institute (ORI).
