    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Young women age 16 years and 0 days to 23 years and 364 days

          -  HIV-infection after the age of 9 years as documented by a positive result on any of
             the following licensed tests: any antibody test confirmed by Western blot, HIV-1
             culture, HIV-1 DNA PCR, or plasma HIV-1 RNA &gt; 1,000 copies/ml

          -  HIV treatment history that falls in one of the following categories:

        Group A: ART naïve or if ART-exposed, has not received HAART for at least the six months
        prior to study entry Group B: Has been receiving HAART for at least six months at the time
        of study entry, with two HIV-1 RNA plasma viral loads &lt; 400 copies/ml on two previous
        clinical visits within the 6 months prior to study entry

          -  Willingness to avoid pregnancy from study entry through the Week 28 visit for
             subjects of child-bearing potential, i.e., use of at least one barrier or hormonal
             method; e.g., condoms, Depo-Provera, oral contraceptive pills, etc. Subjects on ARV
             medications must use a barrier contraceptive method because ARV medications can make
             hormonal birth control less effective.

          -  Anticipated ability and willingness to complete all study vaccines and evaluations

          -  Ability and willingness to participate in the study by providing written informed
             consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of any prior vaccination with an HPV vaccine

          -  Active anogenital warts within three months prior to study entry) or history of CIN
             2/3 (ever, must be documented by colposcopy)

          -  Previous allergic reaction to any constituents of the HPV vaccine

          -  Pregnancy

          -  Active substance use or dependence that, in the opinion of the site personnel, would
             interfere with adherence to the study

          -  Active opportunistic infection or current treatment for known or suspected active
             serious bacterial infection at the time of study entry

          -  Presence of any known &gt; Grade 3 clinical or laboratory toxicity at the time of study
             entry (per the ATN Toxicity Tables, see ATN MOGO) with the exception of isolated
             Grade 3 serum total hyperbilirubinemia that is considered due to atazanavir (see
             Section 9.6 for definition of isolated total hyperbilirubinemia).

          -  Receipt of any routine vaccine within four weeks prior to study entry

          -  Receipt of any immune globulin or plasma product within six months prior study entry

          -  Receipt of any blood product or transfusion, other than immune globulin or plasma as
             noted above, within four weeks prior to study entry

          -  Receipt of any restricted medication listed in Section 5.3.2 within the four weeks
             preceding study entry

          -  Receipt of any other disallowed medication listed in Section 5.3.3 within the three
             months preceding study entry

          -  Thrombocytopenia or coagulation disorder that would contraindicate intramuscular
             injection

          -  Anticipation of long-term systemic corticosteroid therapy (more than 10 mg/day of
             prednisone or equivalent for &gt; 2 consecutive weeks)

          -  Receipt of corticosteroid therapy at the above dose and duration within 3 months
             preceding study entry. Use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents and inhaled or
             topical corticosteroids are not exclusion criteria

          -  Known or suspected disease of the immune system (other than HIV), i.e., malignancy,
             current or prior treatment for malignancy

          -  If other serious, acute or chronic medical or surgical conditions or
             contraindications are present during screening, the Protocol Team must be consulted
             to determine whether enrollment may interfere with the evaluation of the protocol
             objectives and for permission to proceed with the enrollment
