        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female

          -  Age 18 and older

          -  Symptoms or manifestations secondary to motility disorders of the upper GI tract.
             These include gastroparesis, functional dyspepsia, gastroesophageal reflux disease
             that are refractory to standard therapy.

          -  Patients must have a comprehensive evaluation to eliminate other causes of their
             symptoms. This includes a history and physical examination. A recent (within 3 years)
             evaluation of the upper GI tract with either upper endoscopy or upper GI radiographic
             series. Baseline blood tests suggested are electrolytes, magnesium, and prolactin
             level.

          -  Patient has signed informed consent for the administration of domperidone that
             informs the patient of potential adverse events including:

               -  Increased prolactin levels

               -  Breast changes

               -  Extrapyramidal side effects

               -  Cardiac arrhythmias including QT prolongation (increased risk with the drugs
                  listed in the appendix)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of, or current, arrhythmias including ventricular tachycardia, ventricular
             fibrillation and Torsade des Pointes. Patients with minor forms of ectopy (PACs) are
             not necessarily excluded.

          -  Clinically significant bradycardia, sinus node dysfunction, or heart block. Prolonged
             QTc (QTc&gt;450 milliseconds for males, QTc&gt;470 milliseconds for females)

          -  Clinically significant electrolyte disorders. These include significant hypokalemia,
             hyperkalemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypermagnesemia that cannot be corrected with
             treatment of these electrolyte abnormalities.

          -  Gastrointestinal hemorrhage or obstruction.

          -  Presence of a prolactinoma (prolactin-releasing pituitary tumor).

          -  Pregnant or breast feedings female.

          -  Known allergy to domperidone
