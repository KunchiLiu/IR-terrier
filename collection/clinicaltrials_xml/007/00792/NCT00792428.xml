      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a non-painful, non-invasive,
      brain-stimulation technique called transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) combined
      with occupational therapy (OT) will improve motor function in patients with chronic stroke.
      The aim is to determine the effect of applying real (anodal and/or cathodal) vs sham
      (pretend) tDCS to the motor brain region to improve motor function in chronic stroke
      patients. Our research in normal subjects has shown that motor skills can be enhanced if
      tDCS is applied to the brain's motor region during motor learning. The effects after a
      single session of tDCS can last for up to 30 minutes, effects of multiple sessions (one
      session per day) can last for weeks. Furthermore, single sessions of tDCS applied to the
      motor regions in stroke patients have shown that improvements in motor functions can be seen
      and that effects may last for at least 30 minutes. Patients enrolled in this trial will be
      randomized to receive either real tDCS or sham tDCS in combination with OT once a day for up
      to 10 days. Assessments will be done by investigators who are blinded to the intervention.
      Patients are also blinded as to whether they are receiving real or sham tDCS. We hypothesize
      that real tDCS applied to the motor regions in combination with OT results in a subsequent
      improvement in motor function of the recovering hand over sham tDCS in combination with OT.
