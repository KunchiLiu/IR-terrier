             active phase of the study period.

          -  Use of rituximab (MabThera) more than 60 days after transplant.

          -  Administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol during the period
             starting from 30 days before each dose of vaccine and ending 30 days after.

          -  Pregnant or lactating female.
