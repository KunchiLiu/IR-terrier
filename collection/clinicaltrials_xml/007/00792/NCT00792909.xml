  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the immune memory induced by primary and booster
      vaccination with pneumococcal conjugate vaccine GSK1024850A in the first year of life
      through evaluation of the immune responses following vaccination with a booster dose of
      pneumococcal conjugate vaccine GSK1024850A in the fourth year of life and to assess immune
      responses following vaccination with a single dose of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine
      GSK1024850A in age-matched unprimed children.

      The study also aims to assess the antibody persistence in the fourth year of life following
      primary and booster vaccination with pneumococcal conjugate vaccine GSK1024850A in the first
      year of life.

      The study is also designed to evaluate the immunogenicity in terms of antibody response and
      the safety/reactogenicity in terms of solicited and unsolicited symptoms and serious adverse
      events following a 2-dose vaccination with pneumococcal conjugate vaccine GSK1024850A in the
      fourth year of life.

      This protocol posting deals with objectives &amp; outcome measures of the booster phase. The
      objectives &amp; outcome measures of the primary phase are presented in a separate protocol
      posting (NCT number = 00307034)
