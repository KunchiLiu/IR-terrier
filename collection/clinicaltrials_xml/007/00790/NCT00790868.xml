  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 5-year double blind, randomized, controlled, trial conducted at three treatment
      sites, aimed at showing the acute and longer-term effects of DCS augmentation of
      exposure-based CBT for panic disorder relative to placebo augmentation. By demonstrating
      that DCS can enhance the results of even a brief treatment strategy, we are seeking to
      validate an approach that fits well wtih teh practice limitations and applications of CBT in
      effectiveness studies.

      In this application, we propose to further validate and expand upon one of the apparent
      striking successes of translational research. Specifically, basic research on the neural
      circuitry underlying fear extinction led to the examination of d-cycloserine (DCS), a
      partial agonist of the NMDA receptor in the amygdala, as an agent capable of enhancing
      extinction learning (Davis et al., 2006; Davis et al., in press). Following successful
      validation of this strategy in the animal laboratory (see Ledgerwood et al., 2005;
      Richardson et al., 2004), Ressler et al. (2004) showed that single doses of d-cycloserine
      (DCS) could enhance extinction in a human exposure paradigm for height phobic adults. This
      exciting initial finding was replicated by our research team for the treatment of social
      anxiety disorder (Hofmann et al., 2006), as well as an initial pilot study by our research
      team of the treatment of panic disorder (Tolin et al., 2006; see Preliminary Studies). As
      discussed by Anderson and Insel (2006), these findings have the potential to foster
      significant advances in the treatment of anxiety disorders. The present study represents the
      further application of DCS for augmenting the effects of exposure-based cognitive-behavior
      therapy (CBT), now applied to the treatment of panic disorder with or without agoraphobia.

      In the current application, we propose a five-year study to show the acute and longer-term
      effects of DCS augmentation of exposure-based CBT relative to placebo augmentation. Our
      study is noteworthy for the use of a brief treatment strategy that has been shown to be
      successful in previous trials (e.g., Clark et al., 1999; Roy-Byrne et al., 2005) and has
      served as the basis for the DCS augmentation effect seen in a pilot study for this
      application (see Preliminary Studies). By demonstrating that DCS can enhance the results of
      even a brief treatment strategy, we are seeking to validate an approach that fits well with
      the practice limitations and applications of CBT in effectiveness studies (e.g., Katon et
      al., 2006; Roy-Byrne et al. 2005). Furthermore, by studying the genetic predictors of the
      overall response to CBT, and DCS augmentation in particular, we hope to further elucidate
      the nature of DCS augmentation and the selection of particularly responsive subgroups of
      patients in need. This agenda is in accords with &quot;the ultimate goal of personalized therapy:
      identifying individual patterns of pathophysiology that indicate which pharmacological or
      behavioral treatment will be most useful for any individual patient&quot; (Anderson &amp; Insel,
      2006, p. 320).

      Our study design calls for a double blind, randomized, controlled, trial conducted at three
      treatment sites. Patient with panic disorder will randomly receive DCS or placebo 1 hour
      prior to sessions 3-5 of a 5-session CBT protocol that includes 2 additional booster
      sessions over the course of follow-up. We will enter a total of 192 patients over 5 years
      with the identical treatment protocol followed at each of the sites. Sites will nonetheless
      differ with respect to study management and analysis procedures.
