  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the effects of atomoxetine on brain activation during attention and
      reading tasks via functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) in patients ages 10 to 16
      years old with ADHD and comorbid dyslexia

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, single site study that uses an fMRI
      measurement to assess brain activation during attention and reading tasks and the effects of
      atomoxetine in reducing symptoms of ADHD in patients with ADHD and comorbid dyslexia.
      Similar assessments are performed in two additional groups of patients with ADHD only and
      dyslexia only to determine to what extent symptomatic change in the comorbid ADHD &amp; dyslexia
      is achieved independently by atomoxetine effects on either condition. A healthy control
      group of non-ADHD, non-dyslexia subjects (20) will be included to monitor practice effects &amp;
      effects of treatment that may be interpreted as normal maturation. The healthy control group
      will not be treated with any study medications.

    <description>Atomoxetine will be administered at 1.0 to 1.4 mg/Kg/day given orally once daily in the morning for 16 weeks (study period II). Patients who complete the study period II will be re-randomized in the study period III of 16-week duration to assess maintenance of benefit following discontinuation of treatment with atomoxetine. Patients assigned to atomoxetine during the study period II will be re-randomized to either atomoxetine or placebo whereas patients previously assigned to placebo will receive atomoxetine.</description>
