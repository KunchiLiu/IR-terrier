      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate, in 12-23 months old subjects, the
      non-inferiority of meningococcal vaccine GSK134612 and pneumococcal vaccine GSK1024850A when
      co-administered, compared to each vaccine administered individually.

    <textblock>
      Multi-center study with 3 parallel groups. One group will receive 2 vaccines injections at
      the same visit (pneumococcal+ meningococcal), one group will receive a pneumococcal vaccine
      followed one month later by a meningococcal vaccine, and the last group will receive the
      meningococcal vaccine followed one month later by the pneumococcal vaccine.

      All subjects will have one blood sample taken before vaccination and one blood sample taken
      one month after each vaccination (i.e. the first group will have 2 blood samples taken, and
      the other two groups will have 3 blood sample taken)

          -  History of meningococcal or pneumococcal invasive disease.

             human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, based on medical history and physical
             examination (no laboratory testing required).

          -  A family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency, unless the child has
