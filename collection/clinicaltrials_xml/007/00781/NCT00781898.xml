  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this project is to conduct a multi-site effectiveness study to determine whether
      the addition of a monthly injection of depot naltrexone to treatment as usual (TAU) will
      significantly improve outcome in parolees and probationers with a history of opioid
      addiction compared to TAU alone. Participants will be randomized to either treatment as
      usual in community programs or monthly injections of depot naltrexone for six months with
      treatment as usual in community programs. The effectiveness of depot naltrexone has never
      been studied in opioid dependent parolees. all parolee subjects will be evaluated at
      baseline, while in treatment, and at 6, 12 and 18 month post entry time points. The primary
      study outcomes are retention in treatment, drug use, re-arrests, psychosocial and
      medical/psychiatric functioning, and economic costs and benefit costs of naltrexone.
