  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      More than 80% of patients with end stage renal disease have hypertension; 70% of whom are
      poorly controlled using conventional Hemodialysis therapy. An expanded extracellular fluid
      volume and an increase in peripheral vascular resistance as a result of hemodynamic/trophic
      effects of an increased sympathetic nerve activity, angiotensin II, asymmetrical dimethyl
      arginine, and decreased nitric oxide are the most frequently quoted mechanisms contributing
      to hypertension in this population. The intermittent nature of conventional hemodialysis
      treatments (4 hours, 3 days/week) results in the majority of patients having a sustained
      expansion of the extracellular fluid volume that likely contributes to the activation of
      neurohormonal pathways. However, daily therapy including short daily hemodialysis (2 hours,
      6 days/week) and nocturnal hemodialysis (6-8 hours, 5-6 days/week) improve or even normalize
      blood pressure. Short daily hemodialysis appears to improve blood pressure secondary to a
      reduction in extracellular fluid volume (7,8) whereas the improvement in blood pressure with
      nocturnal hemodialysis occurs by a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance (8,9,10).
      This is consistent with the Katzarski et al experience (7-8 hours, 3 days/week) and one
      randomized controlled trial in which blood pressure control was due to normalization of
      extracellular fluid volume in some patients and a reduction in peripheral vascular
      resistance in others. The majority of the studies in daily dialysis are observational, do
      not include a run-in period to optimize blood pressure management and have not explored the
      mechanisms of improvement in blood pressure in detail. We have designed a 9 month study to
      determine if the mechanism by which short daily hemodialysis is associated with an
      improvement in blood pressure control is secondary to changes in sympathetic nervous system
      activity and/ or extracellular fluid volume. Additionally we would like to explore the
      potential impact of short daily dialysis, compared to conventional dialysis, on markers of
      inflammation and oxidative stress in detail.

    <textblock>
      Patients with end stage renal disease have an adjusted risk of cardiovascular mortality that
      is 10-20 times greater than the general population. Of the modifiable risk factors,
      hypertension occurs in 80% of patients with end stage renal disease and is poorly controlled
      in 70% of patients. In several observational studies of daily hemodialysis, blood pressure
      has improved despite a reduction in the number of antihypertensive medications. A randomized
      crossover study in short daily hemodialysis also showed an improvement in systolic blood
      pressure and a reduction in left ventricular mass index. In limited investigation, the
      mechanism(s) responsible for the improvement in blood pressure have been attributed to a
      reduction in extracellular fluid volume (short daily) and a reduction in peripheral vascular
      resistance (nocturnal hemodialysis). The studies to date have been limited by failing to
      include a run in phase to optimize extracellular fluid volume prior to the initiation of
      daily dialysis. Additionally, only one study used a standardized algorithm for the
      management of blood pressure which is vital as the treatments are not blinded. We have
      designed a randomized, unblinded, 9 month cross-over study to determine the mechanism of
      blood pressure control on patients receiving conventional (3 times /week) HD to short daily
      HD (6 times /week 2 hrs/tx). After completing a 3 month run-in phase on conventional HD in
      which patient's dry weight and antihypertensive medications will be adjusted using a
      standardized algorithm, patients are to be randomized to a 3 month cross-over of daily HD
      versus conventional HD. The mechanism of improved blood pressure control will be explored
      using bioelectrical impedance to measure extracellular fluid volume (ECFV) and muscle
      sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) as well as plasma catecholamines to measure the activity
      of the sympathetic nervous system. Additionally the effect of short daily HD, compared to
      conventional HD, on reactive oxygen species and markers of inflammation will be examined in
      Dr. Rhian Touyz lab. Lastly we will determine the patient's treatment preference.

    <description>Muscle sympathetic nerve activity measurement will be obtained using microneurography. Approximately 10-20% of microneurography recordings are not interpretable due to technical problems. For this reason, blood samples will be collected at the same time that the microneurography is to be done. These test will be done at 3 time points throughout the study.</description>
