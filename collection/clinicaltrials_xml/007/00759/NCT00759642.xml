  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hormone receptor positive breast cancer is the most common type of breast cancer, comprising
      70-80% of all breast cancers. Endocrine therapy is the main type of initial treatment for
      patients with your type of breast cancer. Endocrine therapy is treatment that tries to
      remove, or block certain hormones from binding to the cancer cells and thus slow or stop the
      growth of cancer. Although most patients with your type of breast cancer respond initially
      to endocrine therapies, it can lose its effectiveness. New therapies for this type of cancer
      are needed.

      Endocrine therapy forms the backbone of treatment for both early stage and advanced stage
      hormone receptor positive breast cancer. Although most patients with advanced estrogen
      receptor positive metastatic disease respond initially to endocrine therapies, this response
      is short lived. New therapies able to provide additional benefit to patients with hormone
      receptor positive, endocrine-resistant, advanced metastatic breast cancer are required. This
      study proposes to add lapatinib to endocrine therapy to treat hormone receptor positive
      HER-2 negative metastatic breast cancer patients.

        Inclusion Criteria

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed invasive breast cancer, which at time of
             study entry is either stage III (locally advanced) disease not amenable to curative
             therapy or stage IV disease. Histological confirmation of recurrent/metastatic
             disease is encouraged but not required if clinical evidence of stage IV disease
             recurrence is available.

          -  ER and/or Progesterone Receptor (PgR )positive breast cancer (10% or more of
             infiltrating cancer cells exhibit nuclear staining for ER and/or PgR)

          -  Have had progressive disease or development of new metastatic disease while on
             treatment or within 12 months of treatment with an aromatase inhibitor and/or
             Fulvestrant in adjuvant or metastatic setting

          -  Have measurable (defined as at least 1 lesion that can be accurately measured in at
             least 1 dimension [longest diameter to be recorded], with minimum lesion size ≥ 2cm
             on conventional measurement techniques or ≥ 1cm on spiral computed tomography [CT]
             scan), or evaluable disease. Patients with lytic or blastic bone disease as only site
             of disease will be eligible for the study. These patients will be evaluable for
             progression but not for response.

          -  Primary tumor was HER-2 negative (IHC 0 or IHC 1+/2+ and FISH negative)

          -  Patients could have received prior Tamoxifen either as adjuvant therapy or for stage
             IV disease

          -  Performance status of 2 or better per Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG)
             criteria

          -  Adequate cardiac function (cardiac ejection fraction ≥ 50% as measured by
             echocardiogram or multigated acquisition (MUGA) scan).

          -  IV bisphosphonate and denosumab for bony metastatic disease will be allowed

          -  Palliative radiation therapy to bony metastases will be allowed

          -  Adequate bone marrow function per good medical practice. Results of these tests do
             not determine eligibility. Minor deviations are acceptable if they do not impact
             safety in the judgment of the treating physician. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥
             1500/mm3, platelet count ≥ 100,000/mm3, and hemoglobin ≥ 10 g/dL

          -  Adequate kidney function: serum creatinine of ≤ 1.5mg/dl and/or creatinine clearance
             of ≥ 60 mL/min

          -  Adequate hepatic function: transaminases &lt; 2 x upper limit of normal and total
             bilirubin ≤ 1.5 mg/dL.

          -  Must have a serum albumin ≥ 3.0 g/dL.

          -  Must be informed of investigational nature of study and must sign informed consent in
             accordance with institutional rules.

          -  Pretreatment lab values must be performed within 14 days of patient registration and
             other baseline studies within 30 days.

          -  Has uncontrolled brain metastasis or leptomeningeal disease

          -  Has rapidly progressing and/or bulky disease which in the opinion of the investigator
             may be more appropriately treated with a chemotherapy-based strategy.

          -  Has an uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing or
             active infection requiring parenteral antibiotics or psychiatric illness/social
             situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.
