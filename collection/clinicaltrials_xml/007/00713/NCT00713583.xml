    <textblock>
      Cocaine dependence is a major public health problem and the development of a treatment for
      this disorder is a priority. To date, treatment interventions based on positive incentive
      principles have shown the strongest effects for improving substance use outcomes. One such
      example is contingency management (CM) interventions in which nondrug rewards are used to
      compete with cocaine. Recent evidence suggests that certain medications improve response to
      CM interventions, particularly agents that target dopamine reward systems in the brain. A
      promising dopamine-enhancing medication is levodopa. We have observed the strongest effects
      of levodopa when the medication is administered in the context of CM therapy, perhaps
      through mechanisms that enhance reward saliency. The proposed study is designed to further
      evaluate this promising treatment approach. Cocaine dependent outpatients will participate
      in a randomized, 2-group (levodopa vs. placebo), double-blind clinical trial. CM will be
      behavioral therapy platform for both treatment groups. Potential treatment predictors
      related to reward saliency and motivation will be assessed before and during treatment. We
      will test the primary hypothesis that CM+levodopa will be more effective than CM+placebo in
      reducing cocaine use. This study is expected to validate the usefulness of a new
      behavioral-pharmacological treatment approach for cocaine dependence.

      Cocaine dependence is a major public health problem and the development of a treatment for
      this disorder is a priority. To date, treatment interventions based on reinforcement
      principles have shown the most robust empirical support for improving substance use
      outcomes. One such example is contingency management (CM) interventions in which nondrug
      alternatives are introduced into the environment with the goal of increasing the ratio of
      reinforcement derived from nondrug stimuli to the ratio of drug-derived reinforcement.
      Cocaine dependent individuals vary in their responsiveness or sensitivity to nondrug
      reinforcers, however, which has been a limiting factor in the efficacy of CM interventions.

      Recent lines of evidence suggest that certain medications add efficacy to CM interventions,
      particularly agents that target dopaminergic (DA) actions in cocaine reinforcement. A
      particularly promising medication that we have investigated is the DA precursor levodopa, an
      agent that increases the store of available central DA in DA-deficient individuals. We have
      observed the strongest effects of levodopa when the medication is administered in the
      context of CM therapy. A plausible explanation for the efficacy of this combination
      treatment is that levodopa, when given concomitantly with CM, enhances the saliency value of
      the incentives, which in turn motivates goal-directed behavior (abstinence).

      The proposed study is designed to replicate, predict, and extend the effects of this
      promising treatment approach. Cocaine dependent outpatients will participate in a
      randomized, 2-group (levodopa vs. placebo), double-blind clinical trial. Abstinent-based
      contingency management procedures will serve as the behavioral therapy platform for both
      treatment groups. Potential treatment predictors related to attentional bias and motivation
      will be assessed at baseline and during treatment. We hypothesize that CM+levodopa will be
      more effective than CM+placebo in reducing cocaine use and that the effects of CM+levodopa
      will be significantly associated with levels of attentional bias and motivation at
      pretreatment and during treatment. Finally, we expect to demonstrate that continued levodopa
      treatment (versus placebo) following discontinuation of CM extends abstinence duration.

      This study is expected to validate the usefulness of a novel behavioral-pharmacological
      treatment and in doing so, shed light on the mechanisms underlying the synergism between DA
      augmentation strategies and reinforcement-based therapies.
