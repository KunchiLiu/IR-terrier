    <textblock>
      This study evaluates exenatide, sitagliptin, and glimepiride for the treatment of high blood
      sugar in patients with impaired fasting glucose or early type 2 diabetes. The purpose of
      this study is to determine if exenatide and sitagliptin increase the amount of insulin made
      by the pancreas compared to glimepiride. It is hypothesized that exenatide or sitagliptin
      will sustain or increase the amount of insulin made by the pancreas in comparison to
      glimepiride.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) has reached epidemic proportions throughout the
      world. In the United States more than 1.5 million new cases of diabetes were diagnosed in
      2005, and the estimated prevalence of the disease was over 20 million. Another 54 million
      Americans are believed to have impaired fasting glucose, which represents a &quot;pre-diabetic&quot;
      state at increased risk for progression to overt diabetes. T2D ultimately results from an
      inadequate mass of functional beta-cells, where insufficient beta-cell compensation for
      insulin resistance leads to the development of impaired glucose tolerance and eventually
      diabetes. Autopsy studies have demonstrated a decreased beta-cell mass occurring with
      fasting glucose &gt; 110 mg/dl, consistent with functional studies that demonstrate decreased
      beta-cell (insulin) secretory capacity beginning in the range of impaired fasting glucose.
      Strategies that might preserve or expand functional beta-cell mass in vivo would be expected
      to reverse the progressive deterioration in blood glucose control seen with diabetes. One
      such strategy involves the incretin hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), which is
      trophic for islet beta-cells, having both pro-proliferative and anti-apoptotic effects.
      However, it is not known whether increasing GLP-1 effects can preserve or enhance functional
      beta-cell mass in humans. This proposal will determine the effect of increasing GLP-1 levels
      on functional beta-cell mass in human subjects with impaired fasting glucose (fasting
      glucose 110 - 126 mg/dl) or early T2D (fasting glucose 127 - 149 mg/dl) where a critical
      window exists for reversing further beta-cell deterioration. GLP-1 effects will be promoted
      by administration of either the GLP-1 analog, exenatide, or by increasing endogenous GLP-1
      levels through administration of the oral DPP4 inhibitor sitagliptin for a 6-month period.
      To control for the effect of exenatide and sitagliptin on normalization of blood glucose,
      subjects will be randomized to receive exenatide, sitagliptin or the sulfonylurea
      glimepiride, the latter being a first-line anti-diabetogenic agent that will serve as an
      active comparator.
