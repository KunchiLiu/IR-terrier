    <textblock>
      This study is being done to determine if combined infusions of lidocaine and ketamine is
      better than a lidocaine or ketamine infusion alone, or to placebo in improving recovery
      after abdominal hysterectomy. Participants will be randomized into one of four groups.
      Evaluations will be done through walking tests, pain and fatigue questionnaires and blood
      tests.

      Subjects undergoing abdominal hysterectomy surgery are randomized into one of four groups:
      Intravenous Lidocaine, Intravenous Ketamine, Intravenous Lidocaine and Ketamine or Placebo.
      Subjects will perform a six-minute walk test prior to surgery and on the second day
      postoperatively. After surgery and on days 1 and 2 after surgery, subjects will rate their
      pain. On day 1 postoperatively, subjects will rate their fatigue. On postoperative days 1
      and 2 incisional pain will be analysed using von Frey filaments. Two hours after surgery, 10
      ml of venous blood will be sampled for cytokine analysis. Telephone follow up will take
      place 6 and 12 months postoperatively to access pain and quality of life.
