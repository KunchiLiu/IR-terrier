      This six-week study will evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of GSK561679
      compared to placebo in female subjects with major depressive disorder

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind placebo controlled study to assess the CRF1 receptor antagonist,
      GSK561679, for treatment of depression in adult females diagnosed with Major Depressive
      Disorder (MDD). A treatment regimen of 350mg/day will be utilized to assess both efficacy
      and tolerability. Subjects will be randomized in equal numbers (n=75/arm) to the treatment
      arm and the placebo arm for a 6-week treatment period.

      Efficacy will be assessed by determining the change from baseline in symptoms of MDD and
      anxiety utilizing the Bech Melancholia scale (Bech), Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression
      (HamD17), Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self-Report (IDS-SR), Clinical Global
      Impression - Severity of Illness (CGI-S), Clinical Global Impression - Global Improvement
      (CGI-I), Medical Outcomes Study 12-item Sleep Module (MOS 12), Cohen Perceived Stress Test
      (PSS), Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HamA), and Dexamethasone Suppression Test (DST). Safety and
      tolerability will be assessed by determining the incidence of adverse events (AEs), vital
      signs, BMI, weight, clinical laboratory parameters, including ECGs, during the treatment and
      pre &amp; post-treatment phases, and Discontinuation Emergent Signs and Symptoms (DESS). In
      addition, the incidence of suicidality will be assessed by the Columbia Suicide Severity
      Rating Scale (C-SSRS).

          -  Subject must, in the investigator's opinion based on clinical history, have met DSM
             IV-TR criteria for their current major depressive episode for at least 4 weeks but
             for no greater than 24 months.

          -  Subject has an IVRS HamD17 total score ≥ 23 at the Screening and Randomization Visits

               -  any cardiac condition or ECG evidence that the investigator feels may predispose
                  the subject to ischemia or arrhythmia; or

               -  any ECG abnormality that, in the investigator's judgment, may pose a potential

             Visit.

          -  Subject has previously participated in an investigational trial involving GSK561679
             or closely related compounds.
