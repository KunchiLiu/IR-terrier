      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well gemcitabine and erlotinib work when given
      before and after surgery in treating patients with pancreatic cancer that can be removed by
      surgery. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine, work in different ways to stop the
      growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.
      Erlotinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell
      growth. Giving gemcitabine and erlotinib before surgery may make the tumor smaller and
      reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed. Giving these drugs after
      surgery may kill any tumor cells that remain after surgery.

      This is a single arm, non-randomized phase II study. Eligible, fully registered patients
      will receive preoperative chemotherapy consisting of gemcitabine plus erlotinib.
      Preoperative chemotherapy will be followed by exploratory laparotomy and
      pancreaticoduodenectomy. Patients will then receive postoperative chemotherapy consisting of
      gemcitabine plus erlotinib. Up to 123 patients will be accrued to this study, with the
      expectation that 78 patients will remain fully eligible and evaluable for the primary
      endpoint. The primary and secondary objectives for the study are listed below.

      Primary Objective:

      To estimate the proportion of patients alive at two years from the date of registration

      Secondary Objectives:

        1. To determine the resection rate (defined as the fraction of patients who proceed to
           planned surgery with removal of primary tumor [R0/R1]) following induction treatment
           with gemcitabine plus erlotinib

        2. To estimate the time to disease progression/relapse

        3. To evaluate the rate of R0, R1, and R2 resections (defined as per the 6th edition of
           the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual) in patients treated with preoperative gemcitabine plus
           erlotinib chemotherapy

        4. To evaluate the toxicity profile of preoperative gemcitabine plus erlotinib and the
           feasibility of postoperative gemcitabine plus erlotinib

        5. To evaluate response rates to preoperative chemotherapy for patients treated with
           preoperative gemcitabine and erlotinib

        6. To identify molecular predictors of pancreatic cancer response to gemcitabine combined
           with erlotinib

        7. To identify genetic profiles of pancreatic adenocarcinoma that may be associated with
           response to neoadjuvant therapy

      After completion of postoperative chemotherapy treatment, patients are followed every 3
      months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 2 years.

Within 3-6 weeks after completion of neoadjuvant therapy, patients undergo pancreaticoduodenectomy and patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride and erlotinib hydrochloride as in neoadjuvant therapy within 5-10 weeks post surgery.</description>
