    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who participated in Phase IIa study MD7108240 and who did not experience AMD
             disease progression requiring rescue therapy during pazopanib treatment or require
             discontinuation of pazopanib eye drops for safety reasons

          -  Best-corrected ETDRS visual acuity in the study eye of 23 letters (20/320 or 4/63) or
             better at screening.

          -  QTcB or QTcF &lt; 450msec; or QTc &lt; 480msec in subjects with Bundle Branch Block.

          -  Subject is willing and able to return for all study visits, and is willing and able
             to comply with all protocol requirements and procedures.

          -  Subject is capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with
             the requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form. If the subject is
             unable to read the consent form due to visual impairment then the consent must be
             read to the subject verbatim by person administering the consent, a family member or
             legally acceptable representative. If the subject is unable to provide written
             informed consent due to visual impairment, then written informed consent on behalf of
             the subject must be provided by a legally acceptable representative. (Note: Consent
             by legally acceptable representative is allowed where this is in accordance with
             local laws, regulations and ethics committee policy.)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Anterior segment and vitreous abnormalities in the study eye that would preclude
             adequate observation of the fundus for photographs, fluorescein angiography and OCT.

          -  Vitreous, subretinal or retinal hemorrhage in the study eye that is unrelated to AMD.

          -  Intraocular surgery in the study eye within 3 months of dosing.

          -  Use of topical ocular medications (other than pazopanib) in the study eye within 7
             days of first dose of investigational product or expected use of topical ocular
             medications during the treatment period, with the exception of artificial tears.

          -  Current use of medications known to be toxic to the retina, lens or optic nerve (e.g.
             desferoximine, chloroquine/hydrochloroquine, chlorpromazine, phenothiazines,
             tamoxifen, nicotinic acid, and ethambutol).

          -  An unwillingness to refrain from wearing contact lenses starting from the screening
             visit, through the follow-up visit

          -  ALT or AST above the upper limit of normal or total bilirubin â‰¥ 1.5 times the upper
             limit of normal at baseline. Note: Laboratory tests outside of the normal range may
             be repeated at the discretion of the Investigator.

          -  Medical history or condition:

          -  Uncontrolled Diabetes Mellitus, with hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) &gt; 10%.

          -  Myocardial infarction or stroke within 6 months of screening.

          -  Active bleeding disorder.

          -  Major surgery within 1 month of screening.

          -  Hepatic impairment.

          -  Uncontrolled hypertension, based on criteria provided in the protocol. Note:
             Initiation or adjustment of antihypertensive medications is permitted prior to study
             entry provided the referenced criteria are met.

          -  Use of prohibited medications listed in the protocol within the restricted timeframe
             relative to the first dose of study medication.

          -  A condition or situation which, in the opinion of the investigator, may result in
             significant risk to the subject, confound the study results or interfere
             significantly with participation.
