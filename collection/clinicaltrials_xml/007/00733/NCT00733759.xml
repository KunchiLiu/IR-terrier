  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs) are thin-walled abnormal vessels which provide
      direct capillary-free communications between the pulmonary and systemic circulations.
      Patients with PAVMs have usually have low blood oxygen levels and are at risk of other
      complications including strokes, brain abscesses, pregnancy-related complications and
      haemorrhage. We hypothesise that the complications of PAVM patients arise from their PAVMs
      and not the more recognised intracardiac forms of shunting. We propose to perform
      echocardiograms to enable assessment of the presence of other causes of capillary-free
      communications between the pulmonary and systemic circulations.
