      The purpose of this study is to determine if new MRI methods that measure various
      information and chemical makeup in the brain, will give early information regarding response
      to treatment in patients with brain tumors.

      The purpose of this study is to see if new MRI methods which measure information related to
      water, blood flow, and chemical makeup in the brain, can give early information of how well
      treatment is working in patients with brain tumors.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients over the age of 18 who have been diagnosed with a brain tumor of the central
             nervous system and a treatment plan has been discussed.

          -  Must be willing/able to undergo 3 to 5 additional contrast enhanced research MRI
             scans.

          -  You can take part in this study if you are NOT afraid of small, enclosed places.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  A patient who is claustrophobic.

          -  Females who are pregnant or lactating.

          -  Patients who have electrically, magnetically or mechanically activated implants such
             as heart pacemaker, magnetic surgical clips, prosthesis or or implanted neurological
             stimulator.

          -  Any patient who has a history of allergic reactions to MR contrast agent (Omniscan,
             Magnevist, MultiHance)

          -  Patients who require general anesthesia to complete MRI exam or patients who have had
             a negative reaction to MRI sedation. (Chloral Hydrate, Pentobarbital or Versed)

          -  You should NOT have any metals, or implanted devices in your body, for example,
             aneurysm clips, pacemakers, or artificial joints or limbs. It is extremely important
             that you tell us about any and all surgeries you have had so that we might now if
             there is a chance that any metal would be inside you. Also, if your job or any other
             experience might have left metal fragments in your body, please let us know, as the
             MRI's strong magnetic field could disturb a metal fragment in your body or interfere
             with an implanted device, such as a pacemaker, causing you harm.
