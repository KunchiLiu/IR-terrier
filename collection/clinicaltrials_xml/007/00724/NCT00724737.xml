      The purpose of this study is to determine if fMRI is precise enough to be used in
      preoperative decision making for patients who have brain tumors. Before a patient has brain
      surgery to have the tumor removed, functional mapping of the brain takes place either
      intra-operatively or post operatively after a subdural grid implant has been placed. Mapping
      helps the surgeon determine which areas of the brain are responsible for different important
      body functions. During this mapping procedure the surgeon determines if they can safely
      remove all or part of a brain tumor. The investigators are hoping to show that fMRI is just
      as accurate in mapping out different areas of the brain, without having to utilize an
      invasive form of brain mapping.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients with brain tumors and healthy volunteers

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  If patients are pregnant.

          -  If patients suffer from a significant degree of claustrophobia.

          -  If patients are claustrophobic and requires general anesthesia to complete the
             diagnostic MRI.

          -  Contraindications for an MRI due to surgeries and/or implantation of pacemakers or
             pacemaker wires, open heart surgery for placement of an artificial heart valve, brain
             aneurysm surgery, middle ear implants, hearing aids, braces or extensive dental work,
             cataract surgery or lens implant, any implanted mechanical or electrical device,
             implanted neurological stimulators or artificial limbs or joints.

          -  Contraindications from an MRI due to foreign metallic objects in the body such as:
             bullets, BBs, pellets, surgical magnetic metal clips, joint or bone pins, metal
             plates, shrapnel or any one who has a history of working near metal who could have
             metal shavings in their eyes.
