  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A non-myeloablative treatment strategy and uniform selection criteria will enable patients
      with a variety of low grade B-Cell malignancies to attain long term disease control without
      unacceptably high treatment related mortality.

    <textblock>
      Non myeloablative transplant aims to achieve the immunological advantage of graft versus
      tumor effect as conventional myeloablative therapy without causing high treatment related
      toxicities. Non myeloablative transplant has been gaining wider acceptance as a way to
      achieve longer disease free and over all survival in patients with low grade B-cell
      malignancies, which otherwise is an incurable disease. Recent studies of non-myeloablative
      HSCT have demonstrated the powerful effect of graft versus leukemia alone against myeloma
      and other malignant B-cell malignancies if the transplant is performed for low grade, low
      volume disease.
