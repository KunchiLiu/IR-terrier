    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to better understand the potential clinical application of
      cannabinoids for pain management, the following study is designed to determine the analgesic
      efficacy of smoked marijuana (0. 198, and 3.56% THC) and oral THC (0,10, and 20 mg) in the
      Cold-Pressor Test (CPT), a laboratory model of pain which has predictive validity for
      clinical use of analgesics. Both smoked marijuana and oral THC will produce dose- and
      time-dependent analgesic effects in the cold-pressor test. Oral THC is known to have a
      slower onset and longer duration of action compared with smoked marijuana. Therefore, the
      analgesic effects of oral THC is expected to peak later and last longer than effects
      produced by smoked marijuana.

      Laboratory animal studies have demonstrated the analgesic effects of drugs which act on the
      cannabinoid system, however, these effects have et to be clearly elucidated in humans. To
      better understand the potential clinical application of cannabinoids for pain management,
      the following study is designed to determine the analgesic efficacy of smoked marijuana (0,
      1.98, 3.56% THC) and oral THC (0, 10, and 20 mg) in the Cold-Pressor Test (CPT), a
      laboratory model of pain which has predictive validity for clinical use of analgesics.
      Non-treatment seeking marijuana smokers will be recruited for a five-session study during
      which the analgesic, subjective, and physiologic effects of cannabinoids will be evaluated.
      Determining the efficacy of cannabinoids in an experimental model of pain will provide
      important endpoints (i.e., dose, route of administration, time course) or this effect to
      further investigate the potential role for clinical use of smoked marijuana and/or oral THC
      as analgesics.
