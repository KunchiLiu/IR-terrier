  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to provide current FTC-203 study participants in South Africa
      with continued access to the study drug, emtricitabine, following completion of the FTC-203
      study. Individuals participating in this rollover protocol will receive emtricitabine, for
      as long as they continue to meet specific virologic criteria and until they withdraw from
      study, experiences a toxicity that necessitates the permanent discontinuation of
      emtricitabine, or emtricitabine is approved in the country of residence.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In addition to access to emtricitabine, the study will collect long-term safety information
      in participants receiving emtricitabine in combination with other antiretroviral agents.
      Data collection during the rollover protocol for safety purposes will be limited to the
      reporting of adverse events (AEs) that (1) meet the criteria for a serious adverse event
      (SAE), (2) result in permanent discontinuation of the study drug, emtricitabine, and/or (3)
      are associated with skin discoloration (hyperpigmentation).

        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Complete or have previously completed at least through the Week 96 Visit (i.e., 96
             weeks on study) for the FTC-203 study.

          -  Complete all End-of-Study Visit procedures for the FTC-203 study.

          -  Either (a) have a plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load of ≤ 400 copies/mL at the End-of-Study
             Visit for the FTC-203 study, or (b) if the subject's plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load at
             the End-of-Study Visit for FTC-203 study is &gt; 400 copies/mL, their viral load is &lt;
             1.0 log10 above the nadir recorded after Week 8 of the FTC-203 study and there is
             reliable genotypic evidence showing a lack of resistance to emtricitabine.

          -  A parent or other legal guardian has provided written informed consent to the subject
             participating in the rollover protocol. As applicable, based on the subject's age and
             normal institution practice, the subject should additionally provide their written
             informed consent or assent to participate in the rollover protocol.
