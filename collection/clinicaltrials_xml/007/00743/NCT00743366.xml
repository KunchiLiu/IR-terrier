    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to investigate the interaction between marijuana and
      quetiapine, with the goal of using this information to improve marijuana treatment outcome.
      It is hypothesized that quetiapine will decrease marijuana withdrawal and relapse. Primary
      outcome measures will be

        1. marijuana's direct effects

        2. marijuana withdrawal syndromes

        3. marijuana relapse. It is also hypothesized that marijuana withdrawal will be associated
           with increased levels of stress hormones. A secondary measure will be salivary
           cortisol.

      Quetiapine improves sleep and reduces anxiety and irritability, which are symptoms of
      marijuana withdrawal. Further, there are case reports showing that marijuana-dependent
      schizophrenics maintained on quetiapine had a 97.3% reduction in marijuana use. Thus, the
      purpose of this study is to determine if quetiapine decreases marijuana's direct effects,
      symptoms of marijuana withdrawal and marijuana relapse in the laboratory. The study will
      utilize and inpatient/outpatient, counter-balanced design, with each participant maintained
      on placebo and quetiapine (200 mg/day) for 18 days. Participants will begin taking capsules
      as outpatients so that the dose can be incremented prior to the inpatient phase. While
      inpatient, participants will have the opportunity to self-administer placebo or active
      marijuana 6 times per day. Our laboratory model, which has distinguished the effects of a
      range of medications on marijuana withdrawal and relapse, will provide important information
      on the effect of quetiapine as a potential short-term pharmacotherapy to facilitate
      abstinence in the initial stages of marijuana treatment.
