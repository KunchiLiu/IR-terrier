      This is a First Time in Human Study to assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics
      of single doses of GSK1034702 in healthy subjects. It will be a single-blind, randomized,
      placebo-controlled, single oral dose, dose-rising, cross-over study in healthy male and
      female (of non-child bearing potential) subjects. Subjects will be randomized into cohorts
      of 10 subjects and cohorts will be recruited until the pre-defined safety or PK stopping
      limits are reached. Each subject will receive placebo and up to 4 doses of GSK1034702 in a
      randomized sequence on 5 separate study occasions.
