    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if performing ultrasound with an attachment made
      up of two transducers will give us more information about the blood vessels in the breast
      than the current attachment that has only one transducer and to decide if using an
      ultrasound agent which enhances the ultrasound signal will help see smaller blood vessels
      than can be seen without the agent.

    <description>An ultrasound contrast agent, Definity, will be started through the IV line already in place. The breast will be scanned by a double ultrasound transducer system in a holder over the area of the breast to be biopsied. The machine will be set with different settings and the scan repeated, possibly multiple times.</description>
