  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine the effectiveness and safety of Avastin
      when combined with standard chemotherapy for Hodgkin lymphoma. Avastin works differently
      than standard chemotherapy drugs. It is a type of protein called an antibody which binds to
      a substance called VEGF(Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor). VEGF stimulates the growth of
      the blood vessels that feed tumors and encourages tumor cell growth. VEGF is produced in
      excess by Hodgkin lymphoma cells, and is associated with a poorer outcome in patients with
      Hodgkin lymphoma. When the activity of VEGF is interrupted in multiple other cancer types,
      the blood vessels around the tumor cells die resulting in less nutrient delivery and death
      to the tumor. Blocking of VEGF has also been shown to improve delivery of chemotherapy to
      cancer cells, making standard chemotherapy work better. This trial uses Avastin in
      combination with standard chemotherapy with the goal of improving the cure rate over
      chemotherapy alone.

      Participants will be given Avastin as well as ABVD (Adriamycin, Bleomycin, Vinblastine and
      Dacarbazine) intravenously on days 1 and 15 of a 28 day cycle. Participants will receive up
      to a total of 6 cycles of therapy.
