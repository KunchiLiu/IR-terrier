    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well giving sunitinib malate together with capecitabine
      works in treating patients with unresectable or metastatic liver cancer. Sunitinib malate
      may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth
      and by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as capecitabine,
      work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by
      stopping them from dividing. Giving sunitinib malate together with capecitabine may kill
      more tumor cells

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the progression-free survival of patients with unresectable or metastatic
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated with sunitinib and capecitabine.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the overall survival, response rate by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
      Tumors (RESIST) criteria, alpha fetoprotein (AFP) response, survival at one year, and safety
      and tolerability.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive sunitinib malate orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21 and capecitabine
      PO twice daily (BID) on days 1-14. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence or disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for up to 2
      years.
