  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study aims to explore the effectiveness of human erythropoietin versus placebo
      in promoting the recovery of erectile function in patients undergoing bilateral
      nerve-sparing radical retropubic prostatectomy for clinically localized prostate cancer.

      Pre-clinical studies in a rat model showed erythropoietin potently promoted recovery of
      erectile function.

      The hypothesis is that erythropoietin offers nerve protection in men undergoing
      nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy resulting in a reduced time of erectile dysfunction and
      also an improved rate of erection recovery following surgery.

    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the effectiveness of erythropoietin versus placebo in the recovery
      of erectile function in patients undergoing bilateral nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy
      for prostate cancer.

      Recent laboratory findings suggest, that erythropoietin may play a role in protection of the
      cavernous nerves during surgery. Some degree of nerve trauma occurs during bilateral
      nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy, but for most it is temporary. erythropoietin will be
      studied as an investigational drug for enhancement of erectile function postoperatively.

      The length of the study is 12 months and involves receiving a dose of study drug or placebo
      on the day before surgery, the day of surgery, and the day following surgery. The dose is
      given by subcutaneous injection. The study will also require the completion of
      questionnaires which will be mailed, emailed, or done online every three months until study
      completion.
