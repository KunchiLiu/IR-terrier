  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      By doing this study, we hope to learn more about heart failure and it's treatment from
      studying cardiac tissue (how the tissue works and the genetic (gene) trends associated with
      heart failure
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The research procedures will be conducted at the University of Kentucky Medical Center from
      tissue samples obtained during heart surgery.
