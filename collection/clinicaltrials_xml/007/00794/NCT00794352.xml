      Inflammatory or degenerative diseases of the brain and spinal cord, such as multiple
      sclerosis, may be related to problems with an individual s immune system. However, more
      information is needed on the ways in which the cells of the immune system interact with the
      central nervous system (CNS). This study will compare tests performed on both healthy
      volunteers and individuals who have signs or symptoms of immune-related damage to their CNS.

      This study will include two groups of subjects between the ages of 12 and 75. Subjects will
      either have symptoms of immune-related CNS damage, or will be healthy volunteers selected
      for comparison purposes.

      Study participants will visit the NIH Clinical Center on an outpatient basis for an initial
      evaluation visit. During the visit, patients will provide a comprehensive medical history
      and undergo a neurological examination, and will provide blood samples for research
      purposes. The healthy volunteers will be asked to schedule a return visit for a magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI) procedure, and may be asked to undergo other tests requested by the
      study researchers on an as-needed basis. The group of patients with symptoms of
      immune-related CNS damage will be asked to undergo a series of tests, including the
      following:

        -  MRI procedures, with a minimum of three brain MRIs and one spinal cord MRI taken
           approximately 4 weeks apart

        -  A diagnostic lumbar puncture, performed on an outpatient basis

        -  Tests of brain and vision activity

        -  Additional blood and tissue samples

      All study participants will return for a followup visit 1 year after the initial evaluation
      visit. Patients with symptoms of immune-related CNS damage may be offered the opportunity to
      participate in additional followup tests with NIH researchers.

      Objective: The goal of this study is to define the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying
      the development of disability in immune-mediated disorders of the central nervous system
      (CNS) and to distinguish these from physiological (and often beneficial) responses of the
      human immune system to CNS injury. The long-term objective of the study is to acquire
      knowledge that would allow us to therapeutically inhibit the pathogenic mechanisms and
      enhance repair mechanisms in immune-mediated CNS diseases, thereby minimizing the extent of
      CNS tissue damage and promoting recovery.

      Study Population: Patients with evidence of immune-mediated CNS injury will be enrolled. In
      addition, healthy volunteers will be included as controls for immunological and neuroimaging
      biomarkers.

      Design: We will collect, in a standardized manner, multimodal data (clinical/functional,
      neuroimaging and molecular/immunological data) during the diagnostic work-up of untreated
      patients with varied disorders of the CNS in which immune-mediated processes are expected to
      play a pathophysiological role.

      For the patient cohort, a comprehensive initial evaluation will be performed in order to
      establish a definitive diagnosis or confirm diagnosis and subtype of multiple sclerosis (MS)
      as a pre-requisite for enrollment into ongoing clinical trials, but also to collect
      consistent multimodal research data. This evaluation will include a standardized clinical
      exam, functional tests quantifying clinical disability, MRI and other neuroimaging
      modalities, CSF and serological studies, and lymphapheresis. Additional diagnostic tests,
      tailored to individual patients, may be performed if required for the diagnostic process.

      The protocol stipulates a one-year mandatory follow-up for all patients inclusive of
      clinical and MRI imaging, as well as repetition of any additional imaging or functional
      testing performed during the initial evaluation. Depending on the specific diagnosis,
      treatment decisions and clinical/research needs, patients may be offered additional
      follow-up visits. The maximum frequency of the follow-up visits and research samples to be
      collected is specified in order to ensure patient safety is not compromised. Patients age
      12-17 may also be included in the patient cohort inorder to establish a definitive
      diagnosis, or to provide non-standard assays to help with diagnostic and therapeutic
      decisions as part of extraordinary care.

      The volunteer cohort will provide sex and age-matched normative values for the immunological
      and imaging parameters.

      Outcome Measures: Clinical, MRI and immunological measures will be the outcome measures.
      However, no pre-defined research questions will be addressed other than to establish the
      diagnosis, determine the level of disease activity, and monitor the natural history.
