  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the ways that a drug called varenicline helps smokers
      to quit smoking. Varenicline is also called Chantix® and is approved by the United States
      Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to help people quit smoking. We will test how varenicline
      works by having you quit smoking and complete tasks that assess how you think and feel. We
      predict that varenicline help reduce anxiety, improve attention and concentration, and
      reduce how satisfying cigarettes are.

      The purpose of this study is to understand the therapeutic mechanisms of varenicline, a
      novel nicotinic analogue, through focused measures of potential psychological and
      physiological mediators. Varenicline is an FDA-approved pharmacotherapy for smoking
      cessation that is believed to provide relief from craving and withdrawal through agonism and
      antagonism of some central nervous system nicotinic acetylcholinergic receptors. However, no
      controlled studies have established the physiological and psychological processes that
      mediate the efficacy of varenicline in humans. The main goal of the proposed pilot study is
      to evaluate and compare the effects of varenicline on subjective, cognitive, and
      physiological outcomes, using a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind between-groups
      design. The study will combine both brief clinical trial methodology with human laboratory
      approaches. A secondary goal is to validate the utility of the laboratory paradigms for the
      identification of future smoking cessation agents.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        1.1. Who. Subjects will be women and men between the ages of 18 and 40 who have smoked at
        least 10 cigarettes per day for at least 1 year. They will respond to requests in the
        public media for individuals who are interested in quitting smoking.

        1.2. Total sample/Number per group. The total randomized sample size will equal 20
        subjects, equally distributed across the two medication groups.

        1.3. Inclusion Criteria.

          1. 18 years to 60 years.

          2. Smoke Marlboro Lights (This criterion was selected to reduce inter-subject variation
             in response variables as has been done in many human laboratory studies of smoking
             behavior. Over 40% of all smokers smoke some type of the Marlboro brand of cigarette
             (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, 2005). Based on telephone
             screen data for 767 subjects collected at TURC, Marlboro Light cigarettes are the
             most common type of Marlboro smoked in our sampling population (158/252 Marlboro
             users [63%]). Therefore, we have decided to only enroll those smoking Marlboro Light
             cigarettes, non-menthol).

          3. Smoked at least 10 cigarettes/day for at least 1 year.

          4. English speaking and reading.

          5. Females who are of childbearing potential must practice effective contraception and
             meet the following criteria:

               1. Are instructed to avoid pregnancy through 30 days after the last dose of study
                  medication.

               2. Have a negative urine pregnancy test at baseline.

               3. Agree to use of the birth control methods listed: an oral contraceptive agent,
                  an intrauterine device (IUD), an implantable contraceptive (e.g., Norplant), or
                  an injectable contraceptive (e.g., Depo-Provera) for at least one month prior to
                  entering the study and will continue its use through at least 30 days after the
                  last dose of the study medication. A barrier method of contraception (e.g.,
                  condom or diaphragm with spermicide) while participating in the study and 30
                  days after the last dose of study medication.

          6. Willingness to not use illicit drugs during study period including marijuana.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Concurrent use of tobacco products (other than cigarettes) or nicotine products.

          2. Medications that might affect the outcome measures of nicotine reward, cognition,
             anxiety, and stress will also be a basis for exclusion. These medications include
             psychotropic drugs (i.e., anti-psychotic, anti-depressant, anti-anxiety, or
             stimulant), anti- hypertensive agents (e.g., beta-blockers), and other drugs that can
             influence the outcome domains.

          3. History of kidney disease or renal impairment since varenicline is primarily excreted
             by the kidney and thus such patients are vulnerable to increased and potentially
             toxic levels of varenicline.

          4. Treatment for drug or alcohol dependence during the last year, or evidence of alcohol
             abuse so severe that the patient is judged potentially unable to comply with the
             protocol.

          5. Suicidal or homicidal ideation.

          6. History of bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, attention
             deficit disorder, or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.

          7. Current major depression or anxiety disorder.

          8. Pregnant or lactating or planning pregnancy during treatment period.

          9. Having plans to leave the immediate geographical area within 2 months.

         10. Unwillingness or inability to give written informed consent.
