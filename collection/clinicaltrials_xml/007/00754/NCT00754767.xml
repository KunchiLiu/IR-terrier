      RATIONALE: L-carnitine L-tartrate may prevent peripheral neuropathy caused by chemotherapy.

      PURPOSE: This randomized clinical trial is studying how well L-carnitine L-tartrate works in
      preventing peripheral neuropathy caused by chemotherapy in women with metastatic breast
      cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To evaluate the tolerability and usefulness of the dietary supplement, L-carnitine
           L-tartrate, in the prevention of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy in women
           with metastatic breast cancer.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral L-carnitine L-tartrate twice daily beginning on day 2 of
           the first course of chemotherapy and continuing until after completion of 4 courses of
           chemotherapy.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo twice daily beginning on day 2 of the first
           course of chemotherapy and continuing until after completion of 4 courses of
           chemotherapy.

      Patients complete questionnaires periodically to assess neuropathy, pain, fatigue, sleep,
      and activities of daily living.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 4 weeks and then every 3
      months thereafter.
