  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is to see whether treatment with Sunitinib decreases the accumulation of ascites
      in patients with refractory malignant ascites.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, non-randomized, phase II pilot study in patients who have stopped
      cytotoxic and biologic therapy for their neoplasms and are suffering from malignant ascites
      that requires drainage for comfort. The study will employ a Simon 2-stage optimal design.
      Initially up to 17 patients would be enrolled. If there are no responses among the first 12
      patients, the study would be terminated. Otherwise the trial would be expanded by 23 to a
      total of 37 patients. If there are 3 or fewer responses by the end of the trial, then no
      further investigation would be warranted.

    Phycisican decided to terminate study due to slow patient accrual.
