  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are similar
      conditions in which the lungs are critically injured by another inflammatory process in the
      body. Together they affect more than 150,000 people per year in the United States, with
      mortality approaching 50% and a financial burden estimated to exceed $5 billion. Fluid
      overload, weight gain, and reduced oncotic pressure (low blood proteins) are associated with
      prolonged need for mechanical ventilation and mortality in patients with ALI/ARDS.
      Historical studies have provided conflicting evidence for benefits with colloid or diuretic
      therapy in ALI/ARDS, but recent clinical trials have demonstrated significant improvements
      in blood oxygen levels. The mechanisms of these benefits are not yet certain, but appear to
      relate to albumin's (a protein medicine) specific ability to influence injury and
      inflammation in the lungs, thus improving the ability for the lung to repair and exchange
      oxygen.

      The purpose of this project is to determine the effects of therapies that affect blood
      proteins on their ability to change the way the lungs and cardiovascular system (heart and
      blood vessels) function. Special measurements will be taken to understand how these protein
      medicines change the ability of the lung and whole body to recover from widespread injury,
      with additional measures of specific heart and lung function. This clinical trial randomizes
      ALI/ARDS patients with low blood protein levels to receive albumin (a natural blood protein
      that is known to influence inflammation) or hetastarch (a synthetic blood protein) with
      diuretic therapy targeted to improve respiratory function. Therapeutic effects on
      respiratory function and blood oxygen levels, extravascular lung water, oncotic pressure,
      lung fluid removal, and heart function will be characterized. This trial will advance our
      understanding of treatment of ALI/ARDS and the factors that affect fluid balance in the
      lungs of these patients.
