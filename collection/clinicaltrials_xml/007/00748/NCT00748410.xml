  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will involve the use of a new compound, SB-656933. Accumulation of inflammatory
      white blood cells (mostly polymorphonuclear neutrophils)in the gut (colon) may be
      contributing to the pathology of ulcerative colitis. It has been shown that SB-656933
      reduces polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) accumulation in pre-clinical models of colitis.
      99m-Tc-HMPAO scintigraphy is a imaging technique which will be used in this study to observe
      the effect of SB656933 on the migration of PMN to inflamed tissue.
