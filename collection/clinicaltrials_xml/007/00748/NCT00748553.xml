  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical trial is to test whether treatment of patients with advanced or
      metastatic solid tumors or breast cancer with Abraxane plus Vidaza is safe and results in
      good tumor response. All patients enrolling in this study will receive treatment with
      Abraxane and Vidaza. Safety will be assessed by adverse events, laboratory results and
      performance status. Tumor response will be measured by RECIST criteria.

      The phase I part of the study will enroll patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors
      who have failed at least one previous treatment. The purpose of the phase I part is to
      assess the safety of the investigational treatment and select the recommended phase II
      dose-regimen. The phase II part of the study will enroll patients with advanced or
      metastatic HER2-negative breast cancer who have not received treatment for their metastatic
      disease. The purpose of the phase II part of the study is to assess safety and efficacy of
      the investigational treatment in breast cancer. The study doctor will determine what phase
      patients will be enrolled in.
