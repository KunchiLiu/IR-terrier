  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety of a new plan for treating glioblastoma. The
      usual first treatment for glioblastoma is to give focused radiation over 6 weeks in
      combination with a chemotherapy called temozolomide. In this study the radiation will be
      given over 2 weeks in combination with temozolomide and another drug, bevacizumab, will also
      be given. Our idea is that this treatment plan may attack both the tumor and the blood
      vessels feeding the tumor more effectively. This study will look at what effects, good or
      bad, this approach has on the patient and the tumor.

    <description>This treatment regimen is novel in that it delivers the initial course of RT over 2 weeks instead of 6 weeks; also, the addition of bevacizumab during and after RT is a new approach.</description>

    <description>Bevacizumab10 mg/kg IV once every two weeks on days 1 and 15 of every cycle (Cycle defined as 28 days). Temozolomide 75mg/m2 daily beginning on day 1 through completion of radiotherapy. Hypofractionated dose painting IMRT will start on day 1 and will be delivered on a Monday, Wednesday, Friday schedule for a total of 6 fractions.
Post RT therapy: Bevacizumab 10mg/kg IV every two weeks. Temozolomide 150-200mg/m2 daily for 5 consecutive days will be given on 28 day cycles.
Follow up: CBC weekly, comprehensive panel and urinalysis monthly, blood pressure every other week. Neurological/physical examination monthly. Gd-enhanced MRI with perfusion every 2 cycles. Neurocognitive testing (approximately 4months post RT, 1 year after diagnosis and then annually in long term survivors). Blood sample for correlative studies monthly.</description>
