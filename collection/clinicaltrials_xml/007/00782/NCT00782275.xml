    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to find out the effects (good and bad) the study
      treatment has on participants and their cancer. Temsirolimus has been approved by the Food
      and Drug Administration (FDA) in the treatment of renal cell carcinoma. Avastin has been
      approved by the FDA for other types of cancers but not renal cell carcinoma.

      -  Participants will receive avastin on days 1 and 15 of each 28-day treatment cycle. They
           will receive temsirolimus on days 1, 8, 15 and 22 of each cycle.

        -  During all treatment cycles, participants will have a physical exam, blood tests, and
           urine test. An assessment of the tumor by CT (Computerized Tomography) scan will be
           performed every 8 weeks.

        -  It is anticipated that participants will be in this research study for 5 years.

        Inclusion Criteria:
