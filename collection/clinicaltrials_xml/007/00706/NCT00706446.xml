  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is looking at the effects of certain long-acting bronchodilators on patients with
      asthma who have specific genetic variations. The investigators are interested in a certain
      common genetic variation in the receptor for beta-agonists, which is found in as many of
      one-sixth of the population. There is evidence that patients with asthma who have this
      variation may not do as well when treated with albuterol on a regular basis. The
      investigators will be looking at whether patients with this variation have more asthma
      exacerbations over the course of a year when treated with salmeterol or formoterol, which
      are long-acting forms of albuterol; and whether these patients have fewer exacerbations when
      treated with tiotropium, which is a different long-acting bronchodilator that does not act
      at this receptor. In both groups patients will also be receiving inhaled steroids.

    <description>salmeterol diskus 1 puff twice a day or formoterol inhaler 2 puffs twice a day for 1 year, depending on which medication the patient was on before the start of the trial.

In addition, the patients will be on inhaled steroids at variable doses, depending on what dose they were on at the start of the trial and based on the judgement of their treating physicians.</description>
