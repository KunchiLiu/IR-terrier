  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this experiment is to confirm the results of previous testing of Urodynamix's
      Uro-NIRS device. Together Urodynamix and Laborie have created a device that includes
      standard Laborie medical equipment and the experimental Urodynamix device. Collectively this
      integrated device is considered an investigational device, and the results from this study
      may be used to support a submission to the US Food and Drug Administration for the approval
      of the integrated device.

      This research is being done because we want to test the ability of the integrated Laborie
      and Urodynamix device to provide a non-invasive method to provide additional information to
      assist with the diagnosis of or treatment plan of patients suffering from urinary problems.
      The current technologies rely solely on the measurement of internal pressures of the
      bladder, which involves the insertion of catheter into the subject's urethra.

      This is a study of the fully integrated Uro-NIRS:UDS device (Laborie Triton or Laborie
      Dorado and Urodynamix's Non-Invasive Urodynamics device - Uro-NIRS), to confirm the results
      using the fully integrated Uro-NIRS:UDS device as compared to the stand-alone URO-NIRS
      device and UDS device. The study will evaluate male patients with lower urinary tract
      symptoms (LUTS) and female subjects with over-active bladder (OAB).

      The Uro-NIRS unit uses near infrared light at 3 different wavelengths to measure changes in
      haemoglobin and cytochrome from the detrusor muscle from the human bladder wall. This
      process is similar to what is used for cerebral and muscle oxygenation monitoring (e.g.,
      pulse oximetry). Previous clinical feasibility studies have identified the correlation
      between the changes in haemoglobin and cytochrome and the pressure values obtained during
      urodynamics procedures and uroflow procedures.

      For this study the Uro-NIRS results specifically will not be used by the urologist/nurse to
      guide in patient management and treatment decisions, but rather will only be used to collect
      measurements from the patient. The Uro-NIRS sensor patch will be adhered to skin surface
      where their bladder is located.

      The study will be conducted by the two principal investigators at the two clinical study
      sites who will collectively enrol a minimum of 50 subjects, with a minimum of 35 male
      subjects and a maximum of 15 female subjects. The study enrolment objective is to equally
      enrol male subjects into three categories: unequivocal, obstructed and unobstructed. Female
      subjects shall all have OAB.

    <description>As part of standard care subjects will be undergoing a standard bladder pressure diagnostic procedure. This standard procedure will involve the insertion of a catheter (a plastic tube) into the urethra and the measurement of pressure within the bladder. For subjects taking part in this study, the health of the bladder will measured by using light instead of pressure. A patch, the size of cell phone or deck of playing cards, will be taped to the skin in the middle of the abdomen, above the bladder. Using laser light that is 300 billion times weaker than the light from a regular household 100-Watt light bulb, the Laborie and Urodynamix device will take measurements through the skin without inserting anything into the body.</description>
