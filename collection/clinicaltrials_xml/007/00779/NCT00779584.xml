    <textblock>
      This first study in humans of SCH 900776 will evaluate its safety and tolerability when
      given as monotherapy or in combination with gemcitabine to participants with advanced solid
      tumors or lymphoma. Participants will be enrolled in cohorts that will receive sequentially
      higher doses of SCH 900776 in combination with standard doses of gemcitabine The recommended
      combination doses for a Phase 2 trial (combination-RP2D) will be determined based on safety
      and biological activity. Up to 10 to 15 additional participants may be studied at the
      combination-RP2D.

    <description>SCH 900776 will be administered to sequential escalating dose cohorts as an intravenous infusion over at least 30 minutes. Doses of SCH 900776 will either be doubled or increased by 40%, depending on the toxicities observed and the specific dose level, and by 20% increments above 200 mg. SCH 900776 will be given as monotherapy on Cycle 0 Day 1 for participants in the dose escalation portion, and starting with Cycle 1 in combination with gemcitabine on Days 1 and 8 of a 21 day treatment cycle for all participants</description>

             in cohorts for which gemcitabine doses are &gt;=1000 mg/m². Participants previously
