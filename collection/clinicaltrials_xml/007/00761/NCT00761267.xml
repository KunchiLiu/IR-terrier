      Prospective, open label study to assess the pharmacokinetics, safety &amp; efficacy of
      anidulafungin when used to treat children (aged 1 month - &lt; 18 years) with invasive
      candidiasis, including candidemia (ICC). To participate in the study, at the time of
      enrollment subjects must (1) have either a confirmed diagnosis of ICC or mycological
      evidence highly suggestive of Candida sp or (2) in infants 1 month to &lt; 2 years only, be at
      high risk of candidiasis. All subjects meeting screening criteria receive IV anidulafungin.
      Subjects will be stratified by age (1 month - &lt; 2 years; 2 years - &lt; 5 years; 5 years - &lt; 18
      years). Subjects may be switched to oral fluconazole, provided that the pre-specified
      criteria are met. Subjects with microbiologically confirmed ICC must have a minimum total
      treatment duration of 14 days. The maximum allowed treatment duration of anidulafungin is 35
      days; the maximum total treatment duration for the study is 49 days. At selected centers,
      anidulafungin pharmacokinetics will be assessed in the first 6 subjects age 1 month - &lt; 2
      years to confirm the recommended dosage regimen. A population PK-PD analysis will be
      performed in all other enrolled subjects. Subjects will be followed for safety through 6
      week FU visit. Efficacy for subjects with confirmed ICC will be assessed at EOIVT, EOT,
      2-week FU and 6-week FU visits.
