  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, open-label, multicenter study for patients with advanced or metastatic
      non-small cell lung cancer (stage IIIB or IV). The objective of this study is
      progression-free survival of bevacizumab and pemetrexed compared to pemetrexed monotherapy
      during second-line treatment of Stage IIB or IV non-small cell lung cancer.

      This phase II trial will address the issues of bevacizumab treatment duration and treatment
      safety by incorporating bevacizumab into a variation of the ECOG reference regimen as
      first-line therapy for patients with non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer. Following
      disease progression or treatment failure, the potential benefit of continued bevacizumab
      therapy will be tested by randomizing patients to two treatment arms, including second-line
      chemotherapy with or without further bevacizumab.

      For first-line treatment, a regimen of carboplatin, docetaxel, and bevacizumab followed by
      maintenance bevacizumab therapy will be given to all patients. Upon disease progression or
      treatment failure, patients will be randomized to one of two second-line regimens:
      pemetrexed plus bevacizumab or pemetrexed monotherapy.
