      The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of using a pulsed dye laser (the VBEAM),
      a non-ablative laser (the Affirm) and a combination of both lasers to improve the appearance
      of your surgical scar. Both the pulsed dye laser and Affirm laser are approved by the US
      Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of scars. Surgical scars are a type of
      scar that can benefit from laser therapy. Redness and the appearance of small blood vessels
      near the surface of the skin (telangiectasias) develop in such scars as part of the normal
      healing process and usually spontaneously remit, but often slowly and incompletely. In many
      cases, lasers can accelerate the clearing of this redness and also improve scar texture.
