      Specific aims:

        1. To obtain pilot data on 4-week continuous quit rates associated with 10 weeks of
           treatment with topiramate or placebo or topiramate plus nicotine patch for smoking
           cessation.

        2. To obtain pilot data on the effects of 10 weeks of topiramate versus placebo versus
           combination of topiramate plus nicotine patch on nicotine withdrawal symptoms, smoking
           satisfaction, and adverse effects during smoking cessation.

        3. To obtain pilot data on weight gain over 10 weeks with topiramate versus placebo versus
           combination of topiramate plus nicotine patch for smoking cessation.

      This is a 10-week, randomized, double-blind, single-site study of treatment with either:
      topiramate, or placebo, or topiramate plus nicotine patch. Approximately, 90 subjects ages
      18-65 who smoke at least 10 cigarettes per day will be screened for study participation,
      with the intention of 60 subjects being eligible for randomized treatment (20 per arm).
