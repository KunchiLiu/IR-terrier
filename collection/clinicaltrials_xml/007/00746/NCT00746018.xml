  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Some patients, specifically those with a diagnosed genetic mutation, will have their ovaries
      and fallopian tubes removed without removal of the uterus in an attempt to prevent ovarian
      and fallopian tube cancer from developing.

      Anatomically the fallopian tubes are attached to the uterus and extend towards the ovaries.
      The fallopian tube tissue arises within the corner area of the uterus and occupies about 1cm
      of the uterine muscle wall.

      The purpose of this study is to determine if the technique used to remove fallopian tubes
      only (without removal of the uterus) adequately removes or destroys all the fallopian tube
      cells that remain in the uterine muscle wall.

      Currently, during the operation an instrument is used that burns the fallopian tube and
      allows it to be cut away from the uterus. The investigators do not know if this procedure
      successfully destroys all the fallopian tube cells within the uterus. Therefore, we will
      compare this single step procedure to a two step procedure. The two step procedure is to
      burn and cut the fallopian tube followed by an additional burning step, called cauterization
      at the top of the uterus. The investigators will assess if either or both of these
      procedures destroy the fallopian tube cells that may remain inside the uterine wall. This is
      important to determine since the goal is to remove the ovaries and all of the fallopian
      tubes in order to prevent future development of ovarian or fallopian tube cancer.

    <description>The patients will already be undergoing a total hysterectomy with removal of the tubes and ovaries for a specific indication diagnosed or defined by their surgeon. If the patient is suitable to proceed by the surgeon, then he/she will perform a right salpingooophorectomy with the LigaSure devices.</description>

    <description>The investigators intend to enroll a total of 60 patients planned to undergo a total hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. There will be two techniques compared in this protocol. The first 30 patients will have the right tube removed with one application of the LigaSure. The LigaSure will be placed and the most proximal portion of the right fallopian tube adjacent to the uterine cornua and will be used to coagulate and cut the tube. The next 30 patients will have the tube ligated in the same fashion as group A however an additional step will be added once the fallopian tube has been removed. The LigaSure will be used to cauterize the remaining medial tissue on the cornua region of the uterus.</description>
