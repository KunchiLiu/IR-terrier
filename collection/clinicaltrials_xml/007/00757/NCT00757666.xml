    <textblock>
      The APPROPRIATE study will compare differences in functional capacity (peak VO2) between
      chronotropically incompetent patients randomized to receive rate responsive pacing driven by
      either the minute ventilation (respiration-based) sensor or an accelerometer (motion-based).

             discretion

          -  Has or indicated for an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) or cardiac
             resynchronization therapy-defibrillator (CRT-D)

          -  Currently enrolled in another investigational study that would directly impact the
