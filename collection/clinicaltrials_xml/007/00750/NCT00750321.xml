  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic musculoskeletal pain is a major problem in society. Treatments for people with
      musculoskeletal pain have limited efficacy. Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation
      (TENS) is a commonly utilized, non-invasive treatment for pain that is a safe
      non-pharmacological treatment that has been utilized for treatment of musculoskeletal pain.
      Recent studies in animals in the PIs laboratory have begun to examine the mechanism of
      action of TENS. The current study is proposed to translate the findings from the animals to
      human subjects. One concern with TENS is that there is not an appropriate placebo. Since
      TENS delivers an electrical current through the skin to produce pain relief, patients can
      typically feel the stimulation under the electrodes. The standard placebo in prior clinical
      studies has been to utilize a unit that appears to be functioning (lights on) but does not
      deliver a current. In this case the subject would not feel the stimulation. We will compare
      this standard placebo to a new device in which a current is delivered for 30 seconds and
      then slowly ramps to off. This current would then be felt by the subject as intensity is
      set, and then would slowly ramp down. Thus, electrical currents will be felt by the subject.
      It is common for people to adapt to the TENS current so that they no longer feel the
      stimulation over time, or that the stimulation is felt at a lower intensity. This new
      placebo TENS would appear to mimic this event to the subjects. This new TENS would have the
      further advantage of being able to double-blind the study so that the therapist applying the
      treatment, and the subject receiving the treatment are unaware who is receiving the active
      treatment. The investigators will therefore test the adequacy of this placebo when compared
      to a standard placebo with no stimulation.

      Hypotheses:

        1. TENS will reduce temporal summation and increase nociceptive threshold in normal
           subjects

        2. Placebo TENS with a short burst of electrical stimulation will be considered by
           subjects to be an active TENS unit with a greater frequency than the standard TENS unit
           that does not produce electrical current

        3. effectiveness of TENS will be associated with genotype of candidate pain genes (SNPs).
