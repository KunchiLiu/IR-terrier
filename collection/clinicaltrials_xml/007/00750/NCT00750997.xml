      This project seeks to determine the effect of prehospital resuscitation with hypertonic
      saline vs. conventional crystalloids on the inflammatory response after injury. The leading
      cause of late mortality following injury is multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS),
      which results from a dysfunctional inflammatory response after injury. Previous studies
      suggest that hypertonic saline may be beneficial by modulating this initial response and
      decreasing subsequent organ injury. This project takes advantage of a unique opportunity,
      afforded by an NIH-funded multi-center clinical trial of hypertonic resuscitation (conducted
      by the Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium), to obtain blood samples from patients enrolled in
      this trial to analyze inflammatory responses early after hypertonic vs. conventional
      resuscitation.

      The proposed study will be carried out in experiments grouped in three Specific Aims: Aim 1
      provides a thorough investigation of the immunomodulatory response following hypertonic
      resuscitation with regard to neutrophil, monocyte, and T cell responses at serial time
      points after injury and resuscitation. Aim 2 comprises experiments to investigate the
      mechanisms by which hypertonicity may alter inflammatory cell signaling. Aim 3 seeks to
      correlate the laboratory findings with clinical endpoints reflective of immune dysfunction
      including inflammation, organ failure, nosocomial infection, and sepsis.

      The investigators hypothesize that hypertonic resuscitation will be associated with
      modulation of the excessive inflammatory response seen after injury and thus will result in
      reduced rates of inflammatory organ injury.

      This was an ancillary study to the larger clinical trials of prehospital hypertonic
      resuscitation conducted by the resuscitation outcomes consortium. This study investigated
      markers of immune function and coagulation in a subset of patients enrolled in the larger
      trials at two of the clinical sites. Four publications detail the results:

      Bulger, E. M., Tower, C. M., Bulger, E. M., Garland, T., Cuschieri, J., Rizoli, S., et al.
      (2011). Increased neutrophil adenosine a3 receptor expression is associated with hemorrhagic
      shock and injury severity in trauma patients. Shock (Augusta, Ga.), In press(5), 435-439.
