      The purpose of this study is to test the effectiveness of a woman-focused HIV prevention
      intervention combined with voluntary counseling and testing (VCT), compared to VCT only, and
      VCT combined with an attention-control nutrition intervention.

      Surveillance data indicate that HIV risk and substance use is a serious problem among South
      African women. This study, funded by the National Institute on Child Health and Human
      Development (NICHD), builds on findings from a recently completed pilot study among women in
      less affluent townships and communities in the Western Cape (Wechsberg et al., 2008). The
      pilot study tested the effectiveness of an evidence-based woman-focused intervention in
      reducing drug use, sexual risk, and victimization by addressing the intersection of these
      factors among 100 poor, substance-using women of colour.

      The primary aim of this study is to test the effectiveness, through a randomized controlled
      trial (RCT), of VCT plus a woman-focused intervention relative to VCT only to increase
      knowledge and skills to reduce substance abuse, sexual risk, and victimization, and to an
      equal-attention (nutrition) control group at 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-month follow-ups. A
      secondary aim is to examine the moderating effect of victimization (i.e., sexual and
      physical) and the mediating effects of HIV risk knowledge, condom use skills, sexual
      negotiation assertiveness, and relationship power on the effectiveness of the woman-focused
      groups to decrease risk related to drug use, sexual risk, and sex-related-victimization
      relative to the rapid testing group and to the equal-attention control group.
