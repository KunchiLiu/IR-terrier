  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our goals for this study involve using intravenous lidocaine as it is normally used in the
      Stanford Pain Management Center to assess the effect of intravenous lidocaine on chronic
      pain. Studies have been done determining the efficacy of intravenous lidocaine for treating
      pain but little research has been done to determine the effects of an intravenous lidocaine
      infusion on the different components of the pain experience. Our study will incorporate
      psychophysical and behavioral testing both before and during the infusions of lidocaine to
      determine changes in mood. In addition, we will use functional magnetic resonance imaging to
      observe what changes occur in the brain during a lidocaine infusion.

      Each patient will receive an intravenous infusion of lidocaine. Drug will be infused using a
      computer-controlled paradigm. This paradigm allows increasing plasma concentrations in a
      step-wise manner, keeping the concentration during each infusion step constant. Plasma
      concentrations will be increased gradually from 0 to 5 ug/ml in a method at the discretion
      of the medical team. This will be conducted according to standard medical practice for the
      infusion and the study procedures will not affect the infusion paradigm. Total infusion time
      is approximately 1-2 hours.

        Inclusion Criteria:- subjects between the ages of 18 and 100 years for clinical component;
        subjects between the ages of 18 and 70 for the MRI component

          -  meets the study criteria of chronic pain of either peripheral or central origin

          -  male or a non-pregnant, non-lactating female. If females are of reproductive
             potential (i.e., not surgically sterilized and/or not post menopausal), they must be
             practicing an accepted method of birth control, agree to a urine pregnancy test at
             the start of each study session (for patient scheduled through the clinic, this has
             already been addressed by the recommending physician)

          -  is not currently on a sodium channel blocking agent, anticonvulsant, or tricyclic
             antidepressant,

          -  must be able to comply with any other study requirements and complete experimental
             tasks

          -  have no reported substance abuse within the past six months;

        Exclusion Criteria:- subject is lactating or pregnant;

          -  subject suffers from clinically significant cardiac, pulmonary, renal or liver
             disease;

          -  subject allergic to lidocaine.

          -  MRI Component: any metal objects (especially surgical clips), devices, or implants or
             any other MRI contraindication
