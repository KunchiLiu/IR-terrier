  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to determine the best confirmed response rate, safety, and
      tolerability of GSK1363089 treatment in adult subjects with squamous cell carcinoma of the
      head and neck (SCCHN). GSK1363089 is a new chemical entity that inhibits multiple receptor
      tyrosine kinases (RTKs) with growth-promoting and angiogenic properties. The primary targets
      of GSK1363089 are the HGF and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) RTK families (eg,
      MET, VEGFR2/kinase insert domain receptor [KDR]). Since MET overexpression has been
      associated with poorer prognosis and MET tyrosine kinase mutations have been reported in
      SCCHN, inhibition of MET receptor and VEGFR2/KDR activation by agents such as GSK1363089 may
      be of therapeutic benefit in this patient population.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject has a histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of SCCHN and

          -  has recurrent and/or metastatic disease

          -  is not eligible for curative intent surgery or radiotherapy

          -  has no history of uncontrolled tumor bleeding including hemoptysis in patients with
             documented pulmonary metastasis.

          -  The subject has measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be
             accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as
             =20 mm with conventional techniques, or as =10 mm with spiral computerized tomography
             (CT) scan.

          -  Subject is capable of swallowing capsules.

          -  Fifteen unstained slides of tumor tissue, archival or fresh, or paraffin block are
             available, and there - confirmation that samples have been sent for analysis at the
             central laboratory.

          -  The subject is at least 18 years old.

          -  The subject has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status =1.

          -  In the adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test, the subject has a serum
             cortisol level =20 Âµg/dL (552 nmol/L) 30-90 minutes after injection of ACTH.

          -  The subject has organ and marrow function as follows: absolute neutrophil count (ANC)
             =1500/mm3, platelets =100,000/mm3, hemoglobin =9 g/dL, bilirubin =1.5 mg/dL, serum
