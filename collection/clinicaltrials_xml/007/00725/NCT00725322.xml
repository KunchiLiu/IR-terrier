  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Superficial injection of Botulinum toxin has been advocated for cosmetic purposes but has
      also been reported to be helpful for some pain conditions. The investigators have observed
      prolonged profound analgesia following subcutaneous superficial injection of Botulinum Toxin
      Type A (BTA) in patients with certain types of neuropathic pain. The investigators propose
      to study if addition of BTA extends pain relief compared to placebo when injected
      subcutaneously into areas of cutaneous allodynia (the property that a normally non-noxious
      stimulus is perceived as painful).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Post-surgical neuromatous pain patients have marked cutaneous allodynia. Touching their skin
      with normally non-painful stimuli results in pain. Injected local anesthetics are often
      effective in providing temporary relief. In the course of clinical practice the
      investigators have observed that a number of patients with cutaneous allodynia have had
      marked persistent benefit from subcutaneous injection of Botulinum toxin Type A.

      Rather than killing targeted neurons, Botulinum toxin type A inhibits release of
      acetylcholine from cholinergic nerve terminals in a prolonged but ultimately reversible
      manner. Neuropathic pain and its hallmark allodynia are classically difficult to treat.
      Standard treatment with tricyclic antidepressants, anti-epileptic drugs, opiates and spinal
      cord stimulation is frequently disappointing leaving patients with refractory pain. Surgical
      or percutaneous ablation of involved nerves has fallen out of favor among many due to
      disappointing results.

      A pilot study is needed to assess the efficacy of superficially injected Botulinum Toxin
      type A for treatment of cutaneous allodynia and spontaneous pain among patients with
      neuropathic pain.
