      This research study is being done: 1) to determine if the MGH Be Fit program helps employees
      to change their nutrition and exercise habits and lower their risk for chronic diseases,
      such as heart disease and diabetes and 2) to determine if a maintenance program following
      the Be Fit 12 week program will help employees to keep the positive health changes.

      The main objectives of this trial are to determine if employees who participate in the Be
      Fit 12 week program and are randomized to a 9 month maintenance program are more likely to
      maintain weight loss, physical activity level, and reduction of other clinical risk factors
      for disease compared to the control group. Secondary objectives are to determine if
      employees who participate in the maintenance intervention have fewer chronic diseases
      related to lifestyle factors and lower health care costs at 3 years.

    <description>The Be Fit maintenance program is a randomized controlled trial of a 9 month intervention to maintain weight loss and physical activity after completion of the 12 week wellness program. Six teams of 25 participants will be randomized to the intervention or to usual care. There are 2 key elements to the maintenance program: personal contact and Internet contact. The personal contact enables the participants to continue receiving face-to-face support from a Be Fit nutritionist and trainer. The Internet interface is an opportunity for the participants to self-monitor their own progress while still under the guidance of the program.</description>
