      The combination of TMZ and DAC may effect dual modulation of DNA repair genes resulting in
      improved clinical response.

      Primary Objectives:

        -  Phase I: To determine the safety, tolerability, and Phase II recommended dose of the
           combination of extended schedule TMZ and DAC.

        -  Phase II: To determine the efficacy, as measured by overall response rate, of the
           combination of extended schedule TMZ and DAC given at the Phase II recommended dose to
           patients with metastatic melanoma.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To determine pharmacokinetics of the combination of TMZ and DAC in patients with
           metastatic melanoma.

        -  To determine, in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and tumor tissue, the
           pharmacodynamic effects of the combination of TMZ and DAC on promoter methylation and
           expression of selected genes and correlate these with response.

        -  To determine the progression-free survival of patients treated with the combination of
           TMZ and DAC.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Phase I: Safety, tolerability and Phase II recommended dose of the combination of TMZ + DAC. Phase II: Objective response rate</measure>
    <time_frame>No more than a total of 18 patients will be treated in the phase I portion of the trial, and the MTD cannot be determined with fewer than 8 patients. The MTD is defined to be the highest dose level at which no more than 1 of 6 patients experience DLTs.</time_frame>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Phase I: Pharmacokinetics of TMZ and DAC when administered in combination</measure>
    <time_frame>In the first stage, patients will be accrued and treated until there are 14 eligible patients. The 6 patients accrued at the MTD during the phase I portion will be included in the first stage. If no responses are observed, the study will terminate.</time_frame>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Phase II: -Progression-free survival -safety -pharmacodynamic effects of the combination in PBMC and tumor tissues.</measure>
    <time_frame>Levels of the proteins MGMT and hLMH1 will be assessed in blood samples acquired on days 1 (pretreatment), 8, 15, and 29.</time_frame>

    <description>In Part I patients will be treated on a standard &quot;3+3&quot; phase I dose-escalation design starting at 0.075 mg/kg until a decitabine dose level of 0.15 mg/kg is reached, or, in case unacceptable toxicities are observed, at the maximum tolerated dose (Phase II recommended dose). Decitabine will be administered at the specified dose level, intravenously, daily 5 days a week for the first 2 weeks of a 6-week cycle.</description>

    <description>Temozolomide is available in 25 mg and 100 mg tablets that will be administered orally; doses will be rounded to the nearest 25 mg. Temozolomide will be administered orally at 75 mg/m2 daily for 4 weeks starting on week 2 of a 6-week cycle.</description>
