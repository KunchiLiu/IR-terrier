      Collect exhaled breath condensates from patients scheduled for a routine surgical procedure
      before, during, and after surgery for measurements of IsoFs

      Draw blood from patients scheduled for a routine surgical procedure before, during, and
      after surgery for measurements of serum thrombomodulin.

    <textblock>
      High concentrations of oxygen are routinely administered to patients undergoing routine
      surgical procedures even though it is highly likely, at least in patients with normal lung
      function, that this is unnecessary and in fact may be doing unnecessary harm. Therefore, we
      plan to assess whether there is any evidence of lung injury during surgery resulted from
      administration of high concentrations of oxygen by measuring Isofurans (IsoFs) in exhaled
      breath condensate. In our studies in mice that were exposed to high concentrations of oxygen
      we also found that circulating levels of thrombomodulin were increased. Thrombomodulin is
      present in endothelial cells and upon injury they release thrombomodulin into the
      circulation. Endothelial cell injury is known to occur in hyperoxic-induced lung injury.
      Therefore, in addition to measuring IsoFs in exhaled breath condensate we will also measure
      plasma concentrations of thrombomodulin as an indicator of endothelial injury.
