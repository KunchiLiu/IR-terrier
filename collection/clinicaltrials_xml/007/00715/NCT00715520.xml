    <textblock>
      Previous studies have shown, that when patients learn a new motor movement, it may cause a
      change in the way the nerves act in the area of the brain that controls movement. This
      change is called use-dependent plasticity. The ability of that part of the brain, called the
      motor cortex (M1), to reorganize plays a major role in the recovery of motor deficits
      post-stroke; hence the importance for further development of rehabilitative strategies that
      utilize this potential for recovery. In this proposed study we will further examine
      influences of use-dependent plasticity in the non-injured M1 of healthy subjects and injured
      M1 of stroke subjects using a combination of non-invasive cortical stimulation, medication,
      and exercise techniques. In Specific Aim 1, we will test the effect of drugs that interact
      specifically with different neurotransmitter systems on use-dependent plasticity in intact
      M1 of healthy humans. In Specific Aim 2, we will identify the parameters for non-invasive
      TMS stimulation of M1 that are most effective to enhance use-dependent plasticity in intact
      healthy human M1. Specific Aim 3 will assess the efficacy of plasticity enhancing methods
      developed in non-injured M1 healthy subjects (Specific Aims 1 &amp; 2) in injured M1 of stroke
      patients. Our proposal links science to neurorehabilitation practice in stroke patients by
      applying principles known to enhance practice dependent plasticity in intact human M1 to
      injured M1 of stroke patients to enhance motor recovery. These newly designed rehabilitation
      strategies could potentially reduce the morbidity and disability of stroke and, thus, reduce
      dramatically the costs for long-term ambulatory and nursing home care. The positive impact
      on the field of neurorehabilitation will be considerable.
