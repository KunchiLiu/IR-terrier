    <textblock>
      In the past two years, subjects participated in a medical research study using the
      investigational drug called 123I-Iodine meta-iodobenzylguanidine (123I-mIBG)(pronounced &quot;123
      I oo dine-meta ioo doo ben zul gwan nid deen&quot;). The sponsor of that study (GE Healthcare) is
      now interested in gathering data concerning heart failure subjects and cardiac events, since
      they were enrolled in the original study. There will be no injections of radioactive imaging
      agents or repeat imaging studies.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject was a Heart Failure subject who signed informed consent for MBG311,
             MBG312, or MBG312C.

          -  The subject was administered 123I-mIBG in MBG311, MBG312, or MBG312C.

          -  The subject completed the late planar imaging assessments (at a minimum) required by
             the protocols for MBG311, MBG312, or MBG312C.

          -  The subject agrees to allow the investigator access to medical records, including
             those relating to subject death should this occur.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject withdrew or was withdrawn from MBG311, MBG312, or MBG312C.

          -  The subject was considered lost-to-follow-up (6 months without contact) in MBG311,
             MBG312, or MBG312C.
