      This study examine whether patients with lupus respond to aspirin , and if not, if that is
      related to inflammation. We examine the ability of aspirin to inhibit the production of
      thromboxane in patients with lupus and controls and see if aspirin insensitive thromboxane
      production is inhibited by meloxicam.

      Premature cardiovascular disease is a major cause of mortality in patients with systemic
      lupus erythematosus (SLE) with the risk of myocardial infarction increased up to 50-fold. In
      addition to defining the mechanisms for accelerated atherosclerosis it is important to
      define the effects of drugs used to reduce cardiovascular risk in high-risk patients. Low
      dose aspirin, by inhibiting thromboxane A2 biosynthesis, has profound antiplatelet effects,
      but some patients have impaired thromboxane suppression - a phenomenon termed aspirin
      resistance. An explanation is that aspirin-independent thromboxane synthesis may occur
      through enhanced COX-2 activity, as would occur in an inflammatory condition such as lupus.
      However, little is known about the effects of low-dose aspirin in SLE. Thus, we propose to
      test the following hypothesis: 1) that aspirin insensitive thromboxane biosynthesis is
      increased in patients with lupus and is mediated by increased COX-2 activity.
