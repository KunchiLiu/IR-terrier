  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this trial is to investigate how the outcome of the treatment with
      autologous chondrocytes compares to microfracture technique in patients with symptomatic
      knee disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, open-label, parallel-group, multicenter study designed to
      investigate the outcome of MACI implant versus arthroscopic microfracture in the treatment
      of articular cartilage defects in the knee in patients between ages of 18 and 55 years.

      All patients who meet the eligibility criteria and are considered suitable for inclusion
      will have a cartilage biopsy taken prior to randomization to study treatment. Eligible
      patients will then be randomized during the index arthroscopy procedure to receive either
      MACI implant or microfracture treatment.

      Patients randomized to treatment with MACI implant will return within approximately 4 to 8
      weeks of the index arthroscopy to undergo the chondrocyte implantation procedure via
      arthrotomy. Patients randomized to microfracture will undergo the procedure during the index
      arthroscopy.

      Patients will be assessed post-arthroscopy and post-arthrotomy at intervals during 2 years
      follow-up. Evaluations include adverse events, functional and pain outcomes, arthroscopic
      and histologic evaluation and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
