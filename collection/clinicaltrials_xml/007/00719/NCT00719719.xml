    <textblock>
      This study will explore the possible cause of unexplained, or idiopathic, anaphylaxis.
      Anaphylaxis is a rapid, life-threatening, severe reaction that occurs suddenly after contact
      with an allergy-causing substance, usually a particular food, drug or stinging insect. The
      allergen triggers mast cells to release several substances, including histamine. Histamine
      is responsible for many of the symptoms that may occur, such as flushing, hives, swelling of
      the palms and soles or tongue and vocal cords, nasal congestion, itching and tearing of the
      eyes, shortness of breath and wheezing, stomach pain, vomiting, low blood pressure, loss of
      consciousness, shock, and, rarely, death. Severe episodes of anaphylaxis are treated with
      epinephrine (adrenaline), followed by oral antihistamines and steroids. In more than half of
      cases of anaphylaxis, a clear cause is not identified. These cases are called idiopathic
      anaphylaxis. There is no cure or long-term preventive therapy for patients with recurrent
      episodes of idiopathic anaphylaxis.

      People between 18 and 55 years of age who have idiopathic anaphylaxis episodes at least 6
      times a year (with at least one episode every 3 months) may be eligible for this study.

      Participants are evaluated at the NIH Clinical Center with the following tests and
      procedures:

        -  Medical history, physical examination and blood tests.

        -  Bone marrow biopsy. For this test, the skin over the hipbone and the outer surface of
           the hipbone itself are numbed with local anesthesia. Then, a needle is inserted into
           the hipbone and a small amount of bone marrow is drawn into a syringe. The needle also
           cuts a small core of bone marrow, which is removed for analysis.

        -  Other tests that may be needed for evaluation of the patient s condition.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anaphylaxis is a severe life-threatening systemic hypersensitivity reaction resulting from
      the release of mediators from mast cells and basophils, and is characterized by the presence
      of cutaneous, respiratory, cardiovascular, or gastrointestinal signs and symptoms. Although
      the most common causes of anaphylaxis are reactions to foods, pharmaceutical agents, and
      stinging insects, a causative factor is not identified in up to 50% of individuals with
      recurrent anaphylaxis. These individuals are thus said to have idiopathic anaphylaxis (IA).
      The mechanistic cause of IA remains uncertain, although elevated levels of urinary
      histamine, plasma histamine, and serum tryptase are consistent with mast cell activation.

      This protocol will focus on the pathogenesis of IA. Subjects 13-70 years old with episodes
      of unexplained anaphylaxis will be evaluated in order to correlate both clinical and
      laboratory features that are typical of idiopathic anaphylaxis to identify genetic and
      molecular pathways that may predispose to these events and to determine signaling
      abnormalities in mast cells. We plan to enroll up to 100 subjects in this study. We
      anticipate that our findings will be a first step toward the development of novel targeted
      therapies.

        -  INCLUSION:

          -  Subject must be at least 13 years of age and no older than 70 years of age.

          -  Diagnosis of anaphylaxis occurring in the absence of an identifiable provoking agent
             of stimulus (Idiopathic Anaphylaxis [IA]) by a referral physician. Patient may carry
             both the diagnosis of 1A and the diagnosis of anaphylaxis provoked by an identified
             stimulus.

          -  History of anaphylaxis with a minimum of 3 episodes in the past year.

          -  One doctor's office or ER visit or hospitalization for anaphylaxis without an
             established etiology with involvement of the skin and/or mucosal tissue (e.g.,
             flushing, itching, hives, angioedema, tongue swelling) and at least one of the
             following:

               -  Elevated serum tryptase above subject s baseline measurement within 6 hours of
                  the event.

               -  Respiratory compromise (e.g., dyspnea, hoarseness-laryngeal edema,
                  wheeze-bronchospasm, stridor, reduced peak expiratory flow, hypoxemia).

               -  Gastrointestinal symptoms of vomiting and/or diarrhea

               -  Reduced blood pressure and/or associated symptoms of end-organ dysfunction (as
                  evidenced hypotonia, hypoxia, collapse, syncope or incontinence).

          -  Letter of referral from prospective study participant's referring physician, with
             copies of available medical evaluation and laboratory studies

          -  Able and willing to consider a bone marrow biopsy and aspirate

        EXCLUSION:

          -  Presence of conditions which in the judgment of the investigator or the referring
             physician may put the subject at undue risk for travel (including frequent episodes
             of IA not preventable by pre-medication, acute infection, severe thrombocytopenia
             [minimum platelet count of 30,000], or significant cardiovascular disease)

          -  Any medical condition that in the view of the principal investigator would make the
             subject unsuitable for enrollment in this study (such as advanced renal disease).

          -  Inability to provide informed consent.
