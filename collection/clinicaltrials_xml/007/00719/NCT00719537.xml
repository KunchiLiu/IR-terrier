  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent advances have shown that certain proteins may be present in a pregnant woman's blood
      very early in pregnancy which can predict who is at the highest risk for developing
      preeclampsia. These proteins can be measured and may be used to predict a woman's risk of
      developing preeclampsia.

      Special placental cells called endovascular cytotrophoblasts are needed in the early
      formation of the placenta. These placental cells invade the maternal blood vessels in the
      formation of the maternal-placental blood interface. HLA-G is a protein produced by the
      placental cells and prevents these special cells from being rejected by the mother's immune
      system. Recent studies have indicated that the level of HLA-G is decreased in placentas from
      mothers with preeclampsia. Progesterone, a naturally occurring hormone produced in
      pregnancy, has been shown to increase the production of HLA-G in the placental
      cytotrophoblast cells.

      In regards to the treatment of preeclampsia, studies have shown that low dose aspirin if
      given to mothers who have had severe early preeclampsia, lowers the risk for having
      preeclampsia again. This study aims to show that low dose aspirin combined with progesterone
      will decrease the risk of preeclampsia in pregnant women with a history of preeclampsia in a
      previous pregnancy. Data generated will determine levels and ratios of blood proteins that
      are predictive of preeclampsia at specific gestational ages.
