    <textblock>
      The goal of this research is to see if pancreatic polypeptide (PP), a hormone that is
      naturally produced by the pancreas and that works to control the amount of glucose that the
      liver makes, will reduce the amount of insulin required for people who must take insulin to
      maintain their normal blood glucose level.

      The pancreas is a large gland located behind the stomach. One of the functions of the
      pancreas is to produce two hormones: insulin and pancreatic polypeptide. Insulin helps the
      cells to take in glucose. The liver makes glucose and insulin normally acts to decrease or
      shut off the liver's production of glucose. However, in patients whose pancreas no longer
      makes insulin or makes low levels of pancreatic polypeptide the liver cannot perform these
      duties as well. Studies have shown that these important functions of the liver are improved
      for these patients when pancreatic polypeptide is given together with their insulin. Because
      PP increases the liver's sensitivity to insulin and thereby reduces the amount of glucose
      produced by the liver, this will result in fewer swings in blood sugar levels both in the
      upper and lower range. With fewer swings in blood glucose, a patient should decrease the
      amount of insulin used. One of the main benefits of lowering total insulin requirement is a
      reduction in the development of dangerous low blood sugar levels.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Lactating or pregnant females.

          -  Brittle or Labile diabetics: Volunteers with extremely erratic patterns of glucose
             control with large fluctuations in glucose levels for no obvious reason.

          -  Allergy to beef or beef by-products.

          -  Hypoglycemia within the past year requiring medical or other assistance to correct.

          -  Known autonomic neuropathy.

          -  Documented blood glucose under 60 mg within the past year and hypoglycemic
             unawareness.
