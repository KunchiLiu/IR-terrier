  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine if peri-operative treatment with omega-3 fatty acids is associated with a
      decrease in the incidence of early recurrences of atrial arrhythmias (within 30 days) and an
      improvement in probability of long-term maintenance of sinus rhythm after radiofrequency
      catheter ablation for Atrial Fibrillation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      AF is the most prevalent arrhythmia, affecting &gt;2 million Americans. Antiarrhythmic drug
      therapy often is ineffective to eliminate recurrent episodes of AF. In recent years
      radiofrequency catheter ablation has emerged as a highly effective treatment strategy in
      patients with paroxysmal and chronic AF.6, 7 However, AF may recur within days to weeks
      after a successful ablation procedure in up to 50% of the patients, probably because of an
      inflammatory response to thermal injury caused by radiofrequency energy application. These
      early recurrences of AF after ablation do not necessarily predict long-term clinical outcome
      and 30-50% of patients who develop early recurrences ultimately remain in sinus rhythm
      without the need for additional ablation.8 However, early recurrences of AF may be
      associated with significant morbidity due to troubling symptoms of rapid ventricular rates,
      multiple hospital visits and cardioversions, need for antiarrhythmic drug therapy and
      prolongation in duration of anticoagulant therapy. It is also possible that if early
      recurrences of AF after ablation can be avoided, the probability of remaining in sinus
      rhythm during long-term follow-up may be higher, as maintenance of sinus rhythm early-on may
      facilitate reverse left atrial remodeling. A similar phenomenon may occur in post-operative
      AF, that develops in ~30% of patients who undergo cardiac surgery. Post-operative AF is
      often transient and usually resolves within 3 months after the surgery. Perioperative
      treatment with omega-3 fatty acids has been reported to decrease the incidence of
      postoperative AF after coronary artery by-pass surgery.4 Because the pathogenetic factors
      that play a role in postoperative AF and early recurrences of AF after radiofrequency
      catheter ablation may be similar, it is plausible that treatment with omega-3 fatty acids
      before and after ablation will be associated with a reduction in the incidence of early
      recurrences of AF.
