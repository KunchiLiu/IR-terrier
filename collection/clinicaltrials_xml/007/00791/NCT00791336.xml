    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2 trial of the HIV protease inhibitor (HPI) Nelfinavir (NFV) in combination
      with radiotherapy and chemotherapy in patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung
      cancer (NSCLC) who are considered candidates for pre-operative treatment. This study is to
      be conducted according to US and international standards of Good Clinical Practice (FDA
      Title 21 part 312 and International Conference on Harmonization guidelines), applicable
      government regulations and Institutional research policies and procedures. The endpoints are
      to determine safety of NFV with chemoradiation, gather preliminary data for response, and
      tissue specimens for correlative molecular studies. Unacceptable toxicity is unlikely as
      prior studies have determined dosing 1250 mg twice a day is relatively safe for HIV patients
      receiving radiation therapy. NFV will start one week prior to chemo-radiotherapy and
      continue for the duration of chemoradiation (approximately 6 1/2 weeks). Standard
      radiotherapy (minimum total dose 5040 cGy) and combined (cisplatin/etoposide) chemotherapy
      based on SWOG 8805 will be delivered in combination with NFV. The thoracic surgery attending
      physician will determine the feasibility of resection. If the patient has resectable
      disease, the attending thoracic surgeon will perform the thoracotomy and anatomical
      resection. If the patient has unresectable disease, subject will be followed for 30 days
      post NFV administration. After the initial 30 days post-NFV, subjects will be followed for
      long-term outcomes (disease response and overall survival). Adjuvant therapy may be
      continued off-study at the discretion of managing oncology personnel. Tumors obtained at the
      time of surgical resection will be assessed for pathological response. Tumor tissue taken
      pre-treatment will be assessed for markers that may predict response such as Akt, VEGF, and
      EGFR.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histological diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer that is Stage III (T1-3, pN2,
             M0) NSCLC in whom neoadjuvant therapy is recommended.

          -  Must have had a mediastinoscopy to determine nodal status and potential resectability

          -  Must have enough tissue from the biopsy for tissue marker determination for
             correlative studies

          -  Negative metastatic work up (FDG PET/CT, brain CT or MRI)

          -  No prior thoracic radiotherapy will be permitted

          -  Age 18 years or greater

          -  ECOG performance status 0-1 (Karnofsky at least 70%)
