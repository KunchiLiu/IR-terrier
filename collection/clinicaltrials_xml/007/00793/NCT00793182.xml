  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) rate in
      subjects randomized to receive either Ioversol or Iodixanol for contrast-enhanced computed
      tomography.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) is an acute decline in renal function after the
      administration of iodinated contrast agents. CIN is commonly defined as an increase in post
      contrast serum creatinine (SCr) greater than or equal to 25% or an absolute increase greater
      than or equal to 0.5 mg/dL from pre contrast baseline values. Study will evaluate and
      compare the effects of two (2) contrast media products on renal function in subjects with
      stable reduced renal function while undergoing contrast-enhanced computed tomography.

             mL)

          -  Subjects have an abnormal screening SCr that results in a calculated eGFR of &lt; 60

             been excluded

          -  Subjects have stable reduced renal function which is defined as an abnormal screening
             SCr measurement with a &lt; 15% difference from the oldest historical SCr measurement
             obtained within the proceeding 1 week to 12 weeks

          -  Subjects must provide written consent and agree to abide by the site and study
             requirements

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects on dialysis

          -  Subjects received any investigational drug within 30 days of contrast administration
             or participated in an investigational study within 30 days prior to study enrollment

          -  Subjects have undergone a procedure using iodinated or gadolinium contrast agent
             within 7 days prior to contrast administration, or is scheduled to receive additional
             doses of contrast agents during the 48-72 hour post-study contrast administration

          -  Subjects in acute renal failure or have one or more known causes of acute renal
             failure

          -  Subjects taking NSAIDs (with the exception of ASA) and/or any type of diuretics who
             cannot discontinue these drugs post contrast administration and hold all subsequent
             doses until the 48-72 hour post contrast SCr has been drawn
