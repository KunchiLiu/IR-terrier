  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall hypotheses of this project is that severe sepsis is associated with endothelial
      dysfunction; that endothelial dysfunction, in turn, is predictive of subsequent organ
      failure and death; and that early effective protocol-directed resuscitation attenuates
      endothelial dysfunction leading to improved survival.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The endothelial response is emerging as a critical element of sepsis pathophysiology.
      Preclinical data and small human studies suggest that endothelial cells are responsible for
      increased leukocyte adhesion, inflammation, activation of coagulation, and respond to
      increased levels of the endothelial cell mediator Vascular Endothelial Cell Growth Factor
      (VEGF). Furthermore, the endothelium plays an active role in microcirculatory homeostasis
      and the preservation of microvascular flow. We propose to study the endothelium by
      performing a comprehensive endothelial cell &quot;read-out&quot; through the measurement of
      circulating levels of endothelial cell biomarkers as well as direct visualization of
      microcirculatory flow with in-vivo videomicroscopy. Accordingly, the broad, long-term
      objective of this project is to study the role of the endothelium in sepsis in a large,
      heterogeneous group of patients. To accomplish this, we will investigate two specific aims:
      1) to study biomarkers of endothelial cell activation in sepsis; and, 2) to study
      microcirculatory flow in sepsis. The overall hypotheses of this project is that severe
      sepsis is associated with endothelial dysfunction; that endothelial dysfunction, in turn, is
      predictive of subsequent organ failure and death; and that early effective protocol-directed
      resuscitation attenuates endothelial dysfunction leading to improved survival. To test this
      hypothesis, we will utilize patients, ancillary measurements (notably in-vivo assessment of
      microcirculatory flow), and additional samples and assays from the ProCESS clinical trial.
      ProCESS is a large, multicenter, randomized, controlled clinical trial testing the efficacy
      and mechanisms behind protocolized goal-directed resuscitation. To conduct this line of
      investigation directed at the endothelium and microcirculation that was not addressed in the
      original trial, we will select 8 ProCESS study sites for participation in this ancillary
      study. We will directly visualize and quantify the presence of disturbances in sublingual
      microcirculatory flow utilizing the novel bedside technique of orthogonal polarization
      microscopy. Furthermore, we will develop a multi-marker panel that assesses degree of
      endothelial cell dysfunction and subsequent mortality risk. We will also capitalize on the
      randomly assigned interventions in the ProCESS clinical trial to observe differences in
      endothelial response across the alternative resuscitation strategies. Improved understanding
      of these mechanisms may lead to strategies to predict outcome, to select patients for
      tailored (endothelium-directed) therapies, to follow treatment response, and to develop
      novel therapies for endothelial dysfunction in sepsis.
