  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We will compare three study groups receiving metoprolol, esmolol, or placebo. Level of
      anesthesia will be titrated to achieve the same range of BIS value in all groups. Our
      hypothesis is that the metoprolol and esmolol groups will require a lower level of
      anesthetic agent to achieve the targeted BIS range, compared to the placebo group.

      Our objective is to clarify if metoprolol, in a dose range used for perioperative cardiac
      protection, decreases anesthetic requirement.

    <textblock>
      Beta-receptor antagonists are commonly used in the perioperative setting. These agents have
      been shown to decrease the incidence of perioperative myocardial ischemia and are
      recommended by a recent practice guideline in certain patient groups.1 Besides protection
      from ischemia, there are other situations where beta-receptor antagonists are used
      intraoperatively such as control of the sympathetic response to tracheal intubation and
      certain types of surgical stimuli.

      There is new evidence suggesting that administration of esmolol, a short-acting
      beta-receptor antagonist, might reduce the actual anesthetic requirement. This was initially
      shown by studies in which esmolol decreased the amount of anesthetic required to prevent
      movement after skin incision.2;3 Subsequent studies used bispectral index (BIS) as an
      endpoint and demonstrated decreased BIS values in subjects receiving esmolol during general
      anesthesia. 4;5

      This anesthetic-sparing effect observed with esmolol has not been prospectively studied with
      other beta-receptor antagonists. Since perioperative beta-blockade is commonly achieved
      using longer acting agents such as metoprolol or atenolol, it is clinically relevant to
      understand the effects of these medications on anesthetic requirement. We aim to conduct a
      prospective, randomized, controlled, double-blind study to compare the anesthetic-sparing
      effect of metoprolol and esmolol administered intraoperatively.
