  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the Antioxidant Study is to compare the efficacy of foods naturally rich in
      antioxidants with that of antioxidants in a pill form on markers of inflammation and plasma
      cholesterol in healthy adults at risk of cardiovascular disease.

      Increasing the amount of antioxidants in your diet is thought to be one way to improve your
      health. If antioxidants do have a beneficial effect, one way to measure that is to examine
      possible changes in the levels of &quot;inflammatory markers&quot; in your blood.

      Participants will be asked to consume an antioxidant supplement that may or may not include
      Vitamin E, Vitamin C, Beta-carotene, and Selenium or a placebo for 8 weeks. The doses of
      antioxidants will be similar to the amounts suggested by the United States Department of
      Agriculture's (USDA) recommended daily allowances (RDA). In addition, a group of
      participants will be asked to change their usual eating habits and consume more of certain
      foods that are naturally good sources of the four antioxidants contained in the pills.

      Eligible participants will be asked to come to the Stanford Campus for 3 fasting blood draws
      over the period of 8 weeks and to complete diet and physical activity questionnaires at the
      beginning, middle and end of the study period.
