    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to evaluate interventions to increase acceptance of, and follow
      through with, hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccination in patients attending sexually transmitted
      disease (STD) clinics. The 1st specific aim is to assess the effect of message-framing on
      vaccine acceptance. Framing theory suggests that positively framed messages (i.e., benefits
      of getting vaccine) are more effective than negatively framed messages (i.e., dangers of not
      getting vaccine) in stimulating preventive health behaviors. Research on Framing Theory and
      engagement in health behaviors suggests also that the effects may be moderated by other
      attitudinal factors, including perceived risk of the behavior and degree of involvement in
      the message. The 2nd aim is to evaluate the effect of provider-based interventions. Prior
      research suggests that recommendations by health providers are very important in patients'
      decisions regarding acceptance of health care procedures. The 3rd aim is to examine the
      effect of the interventions on follow-through with the 2nd &amp; 3rd dose. Patients (18 years
      and older) will be recruited and followed from Chicago and Indianapolis STD clinics during
      routine medical visits. An audio computer-assisted self-interview (A-CASI) will cover
      demographics, risk behaviors, and perceived risk associated with vaccination. Subjects then
      will be randomized to receive a gain-framed, loss-framed, or information only message
      regarding HBV immunization (also delivered by A-CASI). Upon completion of the
      message-framing intervention, subjects will complete additional attitude questions via
      A-CASI. In addition, a randomly selected 50% of subjects will be asked questions regarding
      their intention to accept free HBV vaccination, enabling us to examine the effects on
      behavior of asking intention. Upon completion of the A-CASI subjects will be randomly
      assigned to one of two provider intervention conditions: 1. vaccine offered or 2. vaccine
      recommended. For both conditions free HBV immunization will be provided by a nurse
      practitioner. Subsequently, postcard reminders will be sent and phone call reminders made
      for follow-up appointments for those receiving the first and second doses of vaccine. The
      primary outcome measure is number of HBV vaccine doses received.
