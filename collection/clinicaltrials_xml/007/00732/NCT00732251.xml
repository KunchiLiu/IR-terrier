      The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy of allopurinol as an augmentation
      agent for the prevention of mania in bipolar disorder patients with currently stable mood.
      Bipolar disorder is a mental disorder with severe mood swings (mania and depression).
      Despite the development of medications for mania, they may have significant side effects,
      high costs and the need for serum level monitoring. These factors adversely affect
      medication compliance in bipolar patients. One recent study indicated the efficacy of
      allopurinol in the treatment of bipolar mania. Our hypothesis is that the addition of
      allopurinol to standard medications for bipolar disorder will decrease the recurrences of
      manic episodes compared to standard medications.

      This study will recruit bipolar disorder patients currently mood stable on a therapeutic
      dose of an anti-manic medication. Stable mood will be defined as a Young Mania Rating Scale
      score ≤10 and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale ≤10. Subjects must have a diagnosis of
      bipolar disorder confirmed by the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI). YMRS
      and MINI are common research questionnaires used in bipolar disorder studies. Potential
      subjects will be identified and approached during an outpatient clinical visit by a member
      of the research team and identified by their treating physicians and referred to the
      researchers.

      This study involves adding allopurinol to subjects' current bipolar medications. This study
      will be a open label, naturalistic study. The subject will be examined monthly for manic
      symptoms for 2 years. Semi-structured interviews and study questionnaires will be
      administered to subjects at each visit. Monthly Follow-up Study Visits (once per month for 2
      years - Months 1-5, 7-11, 13-17, 19-23) may be conducted either in-person or over the phone.
      All of the questionnaires will be administered by a clinician if the visit is completed over
      the phone. However, the 6-month interval visits (Months 6, 12, 18, and 24) must be done at
      the research center.

      The primary outcome measure will be the number of manic episodes in the 2 year study period.
      We will also measure the changes in medication doses that subjects in each group need to
      maintain mood stability.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects must be between ages 18 and 70.

          2. Subjects must meet DSM-IV criteria for bipolar disorder confirmed by the Mini
             International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI).

          3. Subjects must be taking at least one medication for mania at a therapeutic dose for
             at least 2 weeks.

          4. Subjects must have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, type 1, for at least 2 years
             prior to baseline.

          5. Subjects must have adequate response to medications as evidenced by Young Mania
             Rating Scale (YMRS) score less than or equal to 10 at screening and at baseline.

          6. Subjects must have adequate response to medications as evidenced by Hamilton
             Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) score less than or equal to 10 at screening and at
             baseline.
