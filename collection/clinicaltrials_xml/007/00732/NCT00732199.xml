      The purpose for our research protocol is to examine the role of breathing control mechanisms
      that determine the development of sleep-disordered breathing in the elderly. This proposal
      will focus on key factors that contribute to the control of ventilation in healthy
      individuals and in subjects with sleep-disordered breathing. We will study the age-specific
      changes in both normal persons and sleep individuals with sleep apnea.

    <textblock>
      Sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (SAS) is a relatively common disorder in the US population
      with significant adverse health consequences. Despite the high prevalence of SAS in elderly
      individuals, the underlying mechanisms have remained elusive. Specifically, we do not know
      whether the high prevalence of sleep apnea in older adults is due to increased central
      breathing instability. This proposal focuses on investigating age-specific differences in
      the susceptibility to central breathing instability in healthy individuals as well as
      individuals with sleep apnea.

      This project will investigate the following specific objectives:

        -  Determine age-specific changes in the hypocapnic apneic threshold during sleep in

             -  elderly vs young individuals without sleep apnea

             -  elderly vs young individuals with sleep apnea.

        -  Determine age-specific changes in long-term facilitation during sleep in

             -  elderly versus young individuals without sleep apnea

             -  elderly vs young individuals with sleep apnea.

        -  We will investigate the susceptibility to central breathing instability by mechanically
           ventilating the subjects during NREM sleep using pressure support ventilation. We will
           compare the hypocapnic apneic threshold in old (age&gt;60-65 years) and young (age
           18-40years) individuals who are healthy as well as in those with sleep-disordered
           breathing. We will also measure the parameters over a continuum of age from 18 to 89y.

        -  We will investigate whether there is a difference in the susceptibility to long term
           facilitation of genioglossus activity and ventilation between young and old healthy
           individuals in response to episodic hypoxia, while maintaining isocapnia. We will
           conduct similar experiments in young and old individuals with sleep apnea.

      Sleep apnea is very common in older veterans and is associated with significant
      cardiovascular complications. Greater insight into the pathogenesis will have a positive
      impact on the health of veterans suffering from this condition. This proposal will further
      our understanding of the pathogenesis of breathing instability leading to sleep-disordered
      breathing during sleep. Thus, we anticipate our findings will provide a basis for new
      approaches to prevention and management of SAS in veterans.
