      The main purposes of this study are to compare clinical outcomes of two groups of patients
      with similar medical conditions (one with non-variceal UGI lesions such as ulcers and
      another group with varices or portal hypertensive lesions) who are treated either with
      current standard visually guided endoscopic treatment according to stigmata of hemorrhage or
      with endoscopic Doppler endoscopic ultrasound probe (DEP) monitoring of blood flow in the
      lesion.

      Background: For patients with severe upper gastrointestinal (UGI) hemorrhage, risk
      stratification for rebleeding or endoscopic hemostasis has been based on visually defined
      endoscopic stigmata of hemorrhage for more than 40 years. These are imperfect, because there
      is significant interobserver variation and the investigators were previously unable to
      detect underlying vessel blood flow, which is directly related to the risk of rebleeding.
      Doppler ultrasound endoscopic probes (DEP) are relatively new in the US and can detect
      underlying lesion blood flow. However, few patients with severe UGI hemorrhage have been
      studied with endoscopic doppler ultrasound probe in the US and none in VA's. The CURE/VA GI
      Hemostasis Research Group will perform prospective randomized studies at the West Los
      Angeles VA and University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) Ronald Reagan Medical Centers to
      define the role of Doppler ultrasound probe (DUP) in management of severe UGI hemorrhage.

      Objectives: The specific aims (SA) of this research are: #1) In a randomized, blinded
      prospective controlled (RCT) study of patients with severe UGI hemorrhage (from
      varices/portal hypertensive lesions as one separate group vs. ulcers, &amp; other benign
      non-variceal sources as another group) to compare 30 day outcomes of patients in 2 major
      disease groups - Non-variceal &amp; Variceal-Portal hypertension lesions managed by current
      standards (according to endoscopic visualization &amp; stigmata of hemorrhage) with similar
      patients assessed, risk stratified, &amp; treated with DEP monitoring. #2). For patients
      randomized to the DEP group, to determine the initial prevalence, type (arterial or venous),
      &amp; location &amp; course of blood flow underlying stigmata for the different lesion groups. #3).
      For DEP patients with different lesion types, to determine the rates of persistent blood
      flow after endoscopic hemostasis treatments &amp; whether blood flow after under stigmata can be
      eliminated by further endoscopic hemostasis with different techniques. #4). To determine the
      proportion of patients whose risk stratification (for rebleeding) &amp;/or endoscopic treatment
      are changed by utilizing DEP for detection of blood flow under stigmata of hemorrhage or
      lesions before as a guide for endoscopic treatment &amp; absence of flow after treatment as a
      treatment endpoint rather than visual guidelines (stigmata) alone for endoscopic treatment.
      #5). To compare the outcomes for a large cohort of historical controls previously treated
      for hemostasis of the two lesion types in the UGI tract by the CURE/VA Hemostasis Research
      Group according to visual guidelines &amp; stigmata alone with patients in the RCT managed with
      DUP findings &amp; stigmata, contrasting demographics, hemostasis rates, rebleeding rates &amp;
      other outcomes up to 30 days for major diagnoses (ulcers and other non-variceal lesions vs
      varices &amp; other lesions related to portal hypertension). #6). For patients who are treated
      with surgery or angiography for continued bleeding or rebleeding of UGI lesions, to
      correlate &amp; compare their vessel depth &amp; location (relative to stigmata), type of vessel, &amp;
      lumen patency at surgery or angiography vs. Doppler endoscopic probe findings recorded
      previously. Research Plan and Methods: All studies will be performed over 5 years. The
      investigators will utilize a large RCT (blinded), a very large cohort study, &amp; prospective
      observational studies to complete the specific aims of the study. SAS will be utilized for
      data management. For SA #1, about 240 new patients (150 with non-variceal lesions and 90
      with variceal-portal hypertensive lesions) admitted to West Los Angeles (WLA) VA or UCLA
      Hospitals with severe UGI hemorrhage will be randomized in RCT of Doppler assisted
      management versus standard endoscopic/medical diagnosis, risk stratification, &amp; treatment.
      During urgent endoscopy, patients with clean varices (as the source of bleeding) or other
      UGI lesions with stigmata of recent hemorrhage (from the ulcers, Mallory Weiss tears,
      esophageal or gastric varices, and Dieulafoy's lesions) will be randomized. Routine clinical
      outcomes will be assessed prospectively &amp; compared by major diagnostic groups
      (ulcers-non-variceal lesions or varices-portal hypertensive lesions). For SA #5 (UGI cohort
      study), demographics, outcomes, &amp; risk factors will be compared for about 150 patients with
      non-variceal lesions &amp; about 90 other variceal-portal hypertensive lesion matched historical
      control patients (from CURE Hemostasis Research Databases) treated previously only based
      upon stigmata vs. 75 new patients with non-variceal UGI lesions or 50 variceal-portal
      hypertension lesions in this study treated according to stigmata of hemorrhage &amp; DEP as a
      guide to risk stratification &amp; endoscopic hemostasis. SA #2-4 &amp; 6 will be prospectively
      performed according to the methods in the proposal &amp; all analysis will be performed with the
      collaboration of an experienced biostatistician.

      Potential Impact on Veterans and Non- VA Healthcare: These studies will increase the
      investigators' knowledge about UGI bleeding, UGI lesion vasculature, blood flow, and effects
      of endoscopic hemostasis. Also, DEP may improve risk stratification of Veteran patients,
      medical and endoscopic management &amp; outcomes of patients with severe UGI hemorrhage from
      different etiologies. This is particularly relevant to patient care of Veterans with severe
      UGI hemorrhage, since this is a common clinical condition which requires considerable health
      care resources in every VA hospital. These results will also be generalizable to non-VA
      hospitals and the US population who is hospitalized with severe UGI bleeding.
