      The study is a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomised study to assess the efficacy and
      safety of Kappaproct as an add-on to current practice in treatment refractory ulcerative
      colitis patients. The study population will be chronic active ulcerative colitis patients
      who are no longer responding adequately to standard therapies and who are potential
      candidates for colectomy. Kappaproct/placebo will be add-on treatment allowing all included
      patients to be on concomitant medication, as well as mandatory steroids at inclusion,
      throughout the study.

      Kappaproct (DIMS0150) is a modified single strand DNA-based synthetic
      oligodeoxyribonucleotide of 19 bases in length. The drug functions as an immunomodulatory
      agent by targeting the Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) present in immune cells (i.e., B-cells
      and pDCs) residing in high abundance on mucosal surfaces, such as colonic and nasal mucosa.
      The mucosa of the colon and rectum of patients with ulcerative colitis contains active
      immune cells, which produce damage to the tissue. The activation of these cells by
      Kappaproct results in the systemic release of specific cytokines (e.g., IL-10 and type I
      interferons) and chemokines which are believed to be important factors for the clinical
      effect of Kappaproct. Ex vivo experiments with Kappaproct have demonstrated that the drug
      has the ability to enhance the steroid sensitivity of peripheral blood mononuclear cells
      (PBMCs) obtained from steroid refractory UC patients. Thus, the desired effect is to restore
      steroid sensitivity in steroid refractory patients such that they may benefit from the
      anti-inflammatory actions of the steroid and ultimately become steroid free.

      120 eligible patients will be randomly assigned in a 2:1 allocation to receive two single
      rectal doses of Kappaproct at 30 mg each, or placebo, at week 0 and 4.

      The primary endpoint is the induction of clinical remission at week 12 and patients will be
      continuously followed for efficacy and safety until 12 months after the first dose.
      Secondary endpoints include the induction of symptomatic remission (number of stools and
      blood in stools), induction of registration remission (clinical and endoscopic remission)
      and rate of colectomy.

                  highest dose according to local clinical practice.

               -  At least one treatment course of azathioprine or mercaptopurine of at least 3
                  months duration and/or at least one adequate treatment course of an anti-TNF
                  alpha.

               -  Any unsuccessful combination treatment of the above.

          4. Ability to understand the treatment, willingness to comply with all study
             requirements, and ability to provide informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with suspicion of Crohn's enterocolitis, ischaemic colitis, radiation
             colitis, diverticular disease associated colitis, as well as microscopic colitis
             should be excluded. Patients with disease limited to the rectum (ulcerative

             immunosuppressants/immunomodulators is not allowed and should have been discontinued
             4 weeks before enrolment. Patients who fail the wash-out criteria can undergo
             wash-out and be re-screened at a later time point.

          6. Treatment with antibiotics or Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) within
             two weeks before enrolment.
