    <textblock>
      This study is a control trial of sertraline (Zoloft) in fragile X syndrome children aged 2
      years to 5 years 8 months old. The trial is six months long, and each participant will
      receive a series of tests at both the beginning and end of the study. The researchers hope
      to show improvements in language and a decrease in autistic symptoms.

    <textblock>
      This is a single center study and the UC Davis MIND Institute for fragile X syndrome (FXS)
      patients aged between 2 years and 5 years, 8 months old funded by the Health Resources and
      Services Administration (HRSA). It is a double-blind control trial of sertraline (Zoloft),
      an anti-depressant typically used in the treatment of depression, obsessive-compulsive
      disorder, panic disorder, and other conditions. The researchers are investigating the use of
      this selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) in FXS because a retrospective study has
      shown significant improvements in language and decreases in autistic behavior. There is also
      emerging evidence regarding the stimulation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and
      the stimulation of neurogenesis when an SSRI is given early on in the development of animal
      models of Down syndrome. The researchers hope to see improvements in language stimulation,
      social gaze and social reciprocity, spatial attention, and a decrease in autistic behaviors.

      The aim of this study is to carry out a double-blind placebo controlled trial of sertraline
      in children with FXS who are between the ages of 2 years and 5 years, 8 months old. At
      baseline, the researchers will assess behavioral and cognitive development. These children
      will be treated for six months with either sertraline or placebo. At the end of the six
      months, the researchers assess the same behavioral and cognitive measures as at the
      beginning of the study. The researchers will also assess the side effects of the sertraline
      treatment throughout the study.
