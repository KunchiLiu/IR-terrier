    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to see whether pomalidomide can help people with myeloma.
      Researchers also want to find out if pomalidomide is safe and tolerable.

      There are two parts to this study:

        -  The first part of this study (Phase 1) will determine a safe dose of the medication
           cyclophosphamide in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone.

        -  Once the safest dose has been determined, this study (Phase 2) will look to see the
           difference in effectiveness of pomalidomide in combination with high dose dexamethasone
           with or without cyclophosphamide for the treatment of patients who have myeloma, which
           has relapsed to or become refractory (not responding) to prior treatment.

             defined as patients who experience disease progression on active therapy or within 60
             days after the discontinuation of therapy. Relapsed disease is defined as achievement
             of at least a partial response followed by disease progression after 60 days of
             discontinuing active therapy.

          -  Must have measurable disease as assessed by one of the following criteria: Serum
             monoclonal protein â‰¥ 0.5 g/dL by protein electrophoresis; &gt;200 mg of monoclonal
             protein in the urine on 24 hour electrophoresis; Serum immunoglobulin free light
             chain â‰¥ 10 mg/dL AND abnormal serum immunoglobulin kappa to lambda free light chain
             ratio

          -  Must have received at least 2 prior therapies to include prior immunomodulatory drug
             (lenalidomide) and the patient must be refractory to lenalidomide (defined as
             progressive disease during active therapy or within 60 days of discontinuation of
             therapy). All previous cancer chemotherapy (bisphosphonates are not included),
             including surgery, must have been discontinued â‰¥2 weeks prior to first dose of study
             drug. Prior radiotherapy must have been completed &gt; 2 weeks prior to the start of
             study drug unless the radiation field would not impact marrow reserve in the opinion
             of the investigator.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status â‰¤2 (Karnofsky â‰¥60%

          -  Must have acceptable organ function: total bilirubin less than 1.5 mg/dL; aspartic
             transaminase (AST)/alanine transaminase (ALT) â‰¤2.5 X institutional upper limit of
             normal (ULN); serum creatinine &lt; 3mg/dL

          -  Patients must have adequate hematologic function as evidenced by the following:

        For the Phase I study:

        Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) â‰¥ 1000 per mmÂ³ Platelet count â‰¥ 50,000 per mmÂ³ For the
        Phase II portion, patients with greater than 50% bone marrow plasmacytosis will be allowed
        to enter the trial if the platelet count is greater than 30,000 per mmÂ³ and regardless of
        baseline absolute neutrophil count if it is felt to be related to active myeloma and if in
        the opinion of the investigator, growth factor support can result in improvement in the
        neutrophil count to greater than 1000 per mmÂ³ (growth factor can be used during
        screening).

          -  Females of childbearing potential (FCBP)â€  must have a negative serum or urine
             pregnancy test with a sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL within 10 - 14 days prior to
             and again within 24 hours of starting pomalidomide and must either commit to
             continued abstinence from heterosexual intercourse or begin TWO acceptable methods of
             birth control, one highly effective method and one additional effective method AT THE
