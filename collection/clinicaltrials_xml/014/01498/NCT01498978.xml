  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well ipilimumab works when given together with androgen
      suppression therapy in treating patients with hormone-resistant prostate cancer that has
      spread to other parts of the body. Monoclonal antibodies, such as ipilimumab, can block
      tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumors to grow and spread. Others
      find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Androgen can
      cause the growth of prostate cancer. Androgen deprivation therapy may stop the adrenal
      glands from making androgen. Giving ipilimumab together with androgen suppression therapy
      may kill more tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Proportion of patients who achieve an undetectable prostate-specific antigen (PSA) (=&lt;
      0.2 ng/ml) after initiation of ipilimumab therapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Time to PSA progression. II. Time to progression by any measure. III. Maximum percentage
      of PSA reduction in each patient. IV. Number of patients with immune related adverse events
      (IRAEs) and correlation of these with complete PSA response, time to progression, and T cell
      measurements.

      V. Measures of T cell response to therapy with flow cytometry. VI. Response in measurable
      disease by modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria.

      VII. Time to death from any cause. VIII. To examine correlative biomarkers and their
      relationship to clinical outcomes. Potential biomarkers include, but are not limited to
      C-reactive protein (CRP), insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 and -2, or follicle stimulating
      hormone (FSH).

      XV. Bank samples for future molecular correlative studies, biomarker, or other studies.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive ipilimumab intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats
      every 21 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients without progression then receive maintenance ipilimumab IV once every 3
      months for 4 additional doses.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for up to 5
      years.

          -  Bilirubin =&lt; 3.0 x ULN, (except patients with Gilbert's syndrome, who must have a
             total bilirubin less than 3.0 mg/dL)

          -  No known active or chronic infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV),
             hepatitis B, or hepatitis C; patients should be assessed for high risk behaviors that
             may result in these infections, such as intravenous drug use or multiple sexual
             partners; the assessment should be noted

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) =&lt; 1

          -  Patients receiving any herbal product known to decrease PSA levels (i.e. saw palmetto
             and prostate cancer [PC]-SPES), or any immunosuppressive dose of systemic or
             absorbable topical corticosteroid (except prednisone up to 10 mg orally per [q] day,
             or its equivalent), must discontinue the agent for at least 2 weeks prior to
             screening; progressive disease must be documented after discontinuation of these
             products

          -  Patients receiving bisphosphonate therapy must have been on stable doses for at least
             4 weeks with stable symptoms prior to the first infusion with ipilimumab

          -  Total testosterone &lt; 50 ng/ml, except in patients with prior orchiectomy, where
             testosterone does not need to be measured; patients must continue their LHRH agonist
             therapy throughout study duration

          -  Life expectancy &gt;= 6 months; this must be documented

          -  Patients who are sexually active with a partner who could become pregnant are to use
             an effective form of barrier contraception, such as condoms or a partner using oral
             contraceptive pills; persons of reproductive potential must agree to use an adequate
             method of contraception throughout treatment and for at least 8 weeks after
             ipilimumab is stopped

          -  If a patient enters the trial on androgen suppression therapy (AST) that consists of
             both an LHRH agonist and an oral antiandrogen, both agents should be continued
             throughout the study; if an antiandrogen is stopped prior to study entry, it should
             be stopped 4 weeks before for nilutamide and flutamide and 6 weeks before for
             bicalutamide to ensure that a withdrawal phenomenon does not interfere with
             interpretation of efficacy results

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Radiation to any area of the body &lt; 28 days prior to randomization

             syndrome); those with immune-mediated skin toxicity (i.e. toxic epidermal necrolysis,
             Stevens-Johnson syndrome) will also be excluded

          -  Any underlying medical or psychiatric condition, which in the opinion of the
             investigator will make the administration of ipilimumab hazardous or obscure the

             diarrhea

          -  Any non-oncology vaccine therapy used for prevention of infectious diseases (for up
             to 1 month before or after any dose of ipilimumab)

          -  A history of prior treatment with ipilimumab or prior cluster of differentiation
             (CD)137 agonist or cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) inhibitor or
