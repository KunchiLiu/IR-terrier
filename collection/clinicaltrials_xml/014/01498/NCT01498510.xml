  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop and evaluate an innovative, web-based psychosocial
      intervention for opioid-treated chronic pain patients who display aberrant drug-related
      behavior.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although opioid therapy has gained increasing acceptance as a treatment for patients with
      chronic, non-malignant pain, concerns persist related to achievement of treatment goals and
      medication misuse/abuse within the clinical context(often described as aberrant drug-related
      behavior). Psychosocial approaches, particularly self-manangement strategies such as
      cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT), have been found to be efficacious for the treatment of
      chronic pain. However, most chronic pain patients are not exposed to comprehensive
      psychosocial interventions, largely due to the lack of expertise and time among physicians
      who prescribe opioids. To address this public health concern, this study will develop,
      implement and evaluate an innovative CBT intervention for the treatment of chronic pain
      tailored to the specific needs of patients who are prescribed opioids and present with
      aberrant behaviors. The development of this interactive, web-based intervention will include
      input as well as feedback on a beta version from pain experts and chronic pain patients.
      Once the intervention has been developed, we will conduct a controlled efficacy trial in
      which chronic pain patients maintained on opioids will be randomized to receive either
      treatment-as-usual (n=55) or treatment-as-usual plus the computer-delivered intervention
      (n=55). In addition to conducting statistical analyses to evaluate the relative efficacy of
      these two interventions, we will examine two hypothesized mediators of treatment outcome -
      i.e., cognitive distortions relative to pain management and coping, and expectations about
      the future.
