    <textblock>
      The primary goal is to evaluate the suitability of the Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV)
      challenge model in measuring the efficacy of MEDI-557 compared to placebo in healthy adult
      subjects for the reduction in the incidence of RSV through 12 days post-RSV challenge with
      the RSV virus.

      This is designed to be a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study. Up to 30
      subjects will be randomized, dosed and followed. Subjects will be randomly assigned to
      receive a single intravenous (IV) dose of MEDI-557 or placebo. Subjects will be inoculated
      with RSV. Subjects will be followed for efficacy for 12 days post-RSV challenge. Safety
      follow-up will be approximately 12 months from randomization.
