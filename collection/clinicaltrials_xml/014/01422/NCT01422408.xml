    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well giving fluocinonide cream works in treating symptoms of
      vaginal dryness and painful sexual intercourse in patients with breast cancer undergoing
      hormone therapy. Fluocinonide cream may prevent or lessen vaginal dryness and painful sexual
      intercourse in patients undergoing hormone therapy.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the decrease in symptoms of vaginal dryness and dyspareunia with the use of
      fluocinonide 0.05% cream in breast cancer subjects and subjects at increased risk for breast
      cancer on endocrine therapy. Estimates of decrease will be obtained utilizing patient survey
      instruments.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the decrease in symptoms of vaginal itching and the total vaginal index score
      with the use of fluocinonide 0.05% cream in breast cancer subjects and subjects at increased
      risk for breast cancer on endocrine therapy. Estimates of decrease will be obtained
      utilizing patient survey instruments.

      II. To explore toxicities reported by subjects using fluocinonide 0.05% cream via vaginal
      application.

      III. To explore correlation between subject reported compliance, as well as compliance via
      measurement of the amount of fluocinonide 0.05% cream used, and response rates with the use
      of fluocinonide 0.05% cream.

      IV. To explore the correlations between patient characteristics and response rates with the
      use of fluocinonide 0.05% cream.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients apply topical fluocinonide cream twice daily (BID) in weeks 1-2 and once daily (QD)
      in weeks 3-4.

    <description>Decrease in symptoms of vaginal dryness, itching, and dyspareunia will be evaluated by the Mayo/North Central Cancer Treatment Group (NCCTG) patient questionnaire which has patients grade how much vaginal dryness, vaginal itching, and vaginal discomfort during intercourse they are currently experiencing on an ordinal scale of zero to five (none, mild, moderate, severe, and very severe, respectively). Analyzed using Wilcoxon signed rank test with 2.5% significance level to account for two co-primary endpoints.</description>

    <description>Estimates of decrease will be obtained utilizing patient survey instruments. Vaginal itching will be graded on an ordinal scale of zero to five (none, mild, moderate, severe, and very severe, respectively). Generalized estimating equation (GEE) methods will be used to characterize changes in vaginal symptom scores over time. GEE methods permit the analysis of correlated normal and non-normal data (e.g., binary and ordinal data) and evaluation of fixed and time-dependent covariates (e.g., age, menopausal status, duration of vaginal symptoms, and type of adjuvant endocrine therapy).</description>
