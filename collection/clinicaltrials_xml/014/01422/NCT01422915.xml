  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators demonstrated that cholestyramine is an effective binding agent in vitro
      for porphyrins. A few isolated case reports of treatment of individuals with a cutaneous
      porphyria suggest that cholestyramine and colestipol effectively remove porphyrins.
      Hypothesis: orally administered colestipol will effectively lower erythrocyte porphyrin
      concentrations in subjects with erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP).

      Four adults with proven EPP volunteered as subjects for this study. Initial phase (pre-Rx):
      CBC; liver chemistries including cholesterol; serum iron, TIBC and ferritin; erythrocyte and
      plasma protoporphyrin concentrations; and completion of questionnaire focused on cutaneous
      manifestations are completed at weeks 2 and 4. Treatment Phase 1: colestipol tablets, 1 gram
      in morning and 1 gram at bedtime for 3 months, with repetition of same tests at end of
      months 2 and 3. Treatment Phase 2: colestipol tablets, 2 grams in morning and 2 grams at
      bedtime for 3 months, with repetition of same tests at end of months 2 and 3. Post-Treatment
      - repetition of same tests at end of months 1, 2 and 3.
