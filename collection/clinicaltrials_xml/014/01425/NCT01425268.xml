  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to compare the performance and safety of the AirXpander tissue
      expander to standard saline expanders in patients undergoing two-stage breast reconstruction
      following mastectomy.

      This is a pivotal, prospective, multi-center randomized, controlled, open-label clinical
      study designed to compare the performance and safety of the AirXpander Tissue Expander
      System to currently cleared saline tissue expanders. Subject who meet the inclusion and
      agree to participate in the study will be enrolled and randomized to either the
      investigational arm (AirXpander Tissue Expander) or the control arm (standard saline tissue
      expander) using a 2:1 (AirXpander to saline) permuted block randomization stratified by
      investigational center and procedure (unilateral or bilateral). If the subject is having a
      bilateral procedure, the same type of expander will be implanted in each side. Subjects in
      both arms will be followed in the same manner until the explantation of the tissue
      expander(s) and exchange for permanent implant(s).

    <description>The primary endpoint will be assessed when the subject has completed tissue expansion and had an exchange to permanent breast implants. Subjects not completing permanent breast implant procedure will be considered failures if the procedure could not be completed due to a device related event.</description>

    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>All adverse events will be collected and reported during the time that the expander is implanted. All events will be reported and categorized based on their relationship to the device or procedure. All device malfunctions will be reported.</description>

        is unwilling to comply with the air travel or altitude restriction of not &gt; 3300 feet
        (1000 meters) from baseline during the time the AeroForm tissue expander is implanted.

        12. Subject has a currently implanted electronic device such as a pacemaker,
        defibrillator, neurostimulator device, or drug infusion device.

        13. Subject is pregnant or planning on becoming pregnant during the study period.
