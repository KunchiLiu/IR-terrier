  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of the Phase III TWiTCH trial is to compare 24 months of alternative
      therapy (hydroxyurea) to standard therapy (transfusions) for pediatric subjects with sickle
      cell anemia and abnormally high (≥200 cm/sec) Transcranial Doppler (TCD) velocities, who
      currently receive chronic transfusions to reduce the risk of primary stroke. For the
      alternative treatment regimen (hydroxyurea) to be declared non-inferior to the standard
      treatment regimen (transfusions), after adjusting for baseline differences, the
      hydroxyurea-treated group must have a mean TCD velocity similar to that observed with
      transfusion prophylaxis.

    <textblock>
      Despite the clear results of the STOP and the follow-up STOP II trials, the use of chronic
      erythrocyte transfusions for primary stroke prevention in children with Sickle Cell Anemia
      (SCA) remains controversial for many practicing hematologists, as well as for patients and
      families. Transfusions have proven clinical efficacy in preventing first stroke in children
      with SCA and abnormal TCD velocities, but their indefinite use may still be difficult to
      justifY.

      The risk of transfusion acquired iron overload is now recognized as a serious consequence of
      chronic erythrocyte transfusions in children with SCA. After one to two years of monthly
      transfusions, virtually every patient will have excess hepatic iron deposition that warrants
      intervention with chelation therapy. The effectiveness of iron chelation has not yet been
      realized, despite the availability of the oral chelator deferasirox (Exjade®), due to its
      lack of palatability and increasing recognition of serious drug-related toxicities including
      renal and hepatic dysfunction. Simply put, indefinite erythrocyte transfusions cannot be
      viewed as adequate and acceptable long-term therapy for primary stroke prevention in SCA.
      There is an urgent need to develop an equivalent effective alternative therapy for the
      prevention of primary stroke in children with SCA, specifically one that better manages iron
      overload and improves quality of life.

    <measure>TCD Mean Velocity at 24 months on the index side</measure>
    <time_frame>30 months</time_frame>
    <description>The primary endpoint for the TWiTCH trial will be maximum TCD time-averaged mean velocity on the index side. The index side is the side with the higher mean (averaged over baseline evaluations) of the maximum (over arteries on that side) TCD time-averaged velocity. Values of the primary endpoint will be obtained at clinic visits during baseline and during the 24-month treatment period. An abnormally high TCD is defined as TCD V≥200 cm/sec, or abnormally high TCDi V ≥ 185cm/sec, or TCD maximum V ≥ 250 cm/sec.</description>
