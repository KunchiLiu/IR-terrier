      The purpose of this study is:

        -  To compare the blood sugar control of LY2605541 with insulin glargine after 78 weeks of
           treatment.

        -  To compare the number of night time low blood sugar episodes on LY2605541 with insulin
           glargine during 78 weeks of treatment.

        -  To compare the number of participants on LY2605541 reaching blood sugar targets without
           low blood sugar episodes at night to those taking insulin glargine after 78 weeks of
           treatment.

        -  To compare the total number of low blood sugar episodes on LY2605541 with insulin
           glargine after 78 weeks of treatment.

                  a change to the participant's current lipid-lowering medication or initiation of
                  lipid-lowering medication, it is acceptable to change the lipid-lowering
                  medication for the participant and have the participant return greater than or
