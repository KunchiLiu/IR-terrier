    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to assess whether human subjects can be made tolerant
      to intravenously administered Crotoxin and achieve higher and more therapeutically effective
      doses levels without the previously reported adverse effects associated with bolus i.m.
      administration.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Crotoxin has been shown to induce neurotoxic tolerance in animals allowing them to receive
      high doses associated with effective anti-tumor activity in the absence of adverse side
      effects.

      The study plans to demonstrate this effect in human subjects using two dose escalation
      protocols; slow and fast. It is believed that this approach will prevent toxic side effects
      to subjects.

      The route of administration has not been employed clinically and is designed to avoid the
      myonecrotic effects of intramuscular injections. The target maximum dose is almost double
      that off the previously reported MTD.

      The protocol also incorporates an active suppression of the allergic reaction by
      pre-treatment administration of antihistamines.

    <description>The cohort I will initially include a maximum of 12 patients with doses of 0.04 to 0.32 mg/m2. In Cohort I, each dose will be initially administered for 5 consecutive days with 2 days break during week-end. Crotoxin will be administered daily by intravenous administration over a 2-hour period by saline drip. Subjects will receive increasing doses over the course of 40 treatment days (8 dose levels). Intra patient dose escalation is mandatory. The aim of this study is to identify a MTD. MTD is defined as a dose where no toxicity is observed for 3 consecutive patients, or no more than one DLT is observed for 6 patients</description>

    <description>The second cohort will include 12 patients with same doses of 0.04 to 0.32 mg/m2 in which the dose escalation speed will be faster. Subjects will receive increasing doses over the course of 27 treatment days (8 dose levels)</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Be adult patients with histologically confirmed advanced solid tumors who have
             progressed despite standard therapy, or for whom no standard therapy exists.

          2. Have an ambulatory PS (ECOG 0-1).

          3. Have tumour evaluation made within 28 days before study drug administration (patients
             with non measurable lesions according to the RECIST guidelines not previously
             irradiated are allowed to enter the trial).

          4. Have completed radiotherapy or chemotherapy or any other anticancer therapy
             (including experimental therapy) more than 4 weeks prior to enrolment into the trial
             and must have recovered from all acute side effects of these treatments

          5. Have a life expectancy greater than 3 months

          6. Have an age between 18 and 75 years
