  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine whether a change in the rules and staff roles in
      methadone treatment programs will result in greater lengths of stay in treatment and lower
      rates of heroin and cocaine use, crime and HIV-risk behavior as compared to methadone
      treatment as usual.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Early drop-out and premature discharge from methadone treatment is common in the United
      States and may be associated with drug use and its associated problems. The purpose of this
      study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a novel approach to the organization methadone
      treatment in which the patient rules and staff roles of the clinic will be modified for
      study participants as compared to patients receiving standard methadone treatment.
