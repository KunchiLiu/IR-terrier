  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigation is designed as an open, non-controlled, post-marketing investigation.
      Subjects with at least one second degree burn less than 9.5x15 cm in size at 1-3 sites will
      be included. The subject is allowed to have more than one burn on the body but only one
      should be included in the investigation. Each subject will be followed/assessed according to
      normal hospital routine 1-3 times per week for a maximum of 3 weeks or until desired
      treatment effect is obtained if that occurs earlier. All dressing changes will be done
      according to clinical routine and will follow the IFU (instruction for use). All dressing
      changes will be registered in a dressing log. Additional compression bandaging, gauze wrap,
      or such are allowed and should be reported as well

      At baseline, subject characteristics will be registered together with subject status of
      health and status of the burn, and current treatment of the burn.

      At each visit the following variables will be collected where applicable:

        -  Investigator's/Nurse evaluation of

             -  Overall experience of the dressing

             -  Ability of dressing to stay in place (not at baseline)

             -  Conformability of the dressing

             -  Handling at application

             -  Ease of removal of the dressing (not at baseline)

        -  Subject evaluation of

             -  Overall experience of the dressing

             -  Comfort of the dressing

             -  Conformability of the dressing

        -  Pain before, during and after removal of dressing according to VAS

        -  Status of skin

        -  Burn status: width x length, exudate details and signs of inflammation/infection

      In addition the following variables should be evaluated at each visit:

        -  Concomitant medication/treatment

        -  Adverse Event/Adverse Device Effect (AE/ADE)

        -  Serious Adverse Event/Serious Adverse Device Effect (sAE/sADE)

      Photos will be taken before Mepilex Border Ag is removed, after removal, before cleansing,
      and after cleansing. All photos must include a sticker marker with subject code, visit
      number and date, and an indication of whether pre-/post removal, pre-/post cleansing. The
      stick marker also contains a ruler. Detailed instructions on how to take the photos is given
      in Appendix 14.2

      At each visit the subject will give the assessment concerning the comfort and
      stay-on-ability of the dressing. The investigator will also give an assessment at each visit
      concerning handling, conformability and ability of dressing to stay in place.

    <description>The primary objective is to evaluate the experience of using Mepilex Border Ag in normal clinical practice when used on small second degree burns (&lt; 9.5x15 cm) in need of topical antimicrobial treatment according to the treating physician, i.e. increasing signs of infection, odour, pain and exudate (none, mild, moderate and severe).</description>

    <measure>Evaluate the comfort</measure>
    <time_frame>3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Secondary objectives are to evaluate the comfort, conformability, handling at application, ability to stay in place, pain during wear (in-between dressing changes) and at removal of dressing and adverse events according to the subject and treating hospital staff. Scale used is from very poor - very good.</description>
