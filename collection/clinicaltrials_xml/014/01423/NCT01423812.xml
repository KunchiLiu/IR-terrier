  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Darunavir is a nonpeptidic protease inhibitor with a high genetic barrier to resistance that
      evolved from a prototype compound synthesized using structure-based design strategies.
      Once-daily darunavir at 800mg boosted with 100mg of ritonavir is an effective antiretroviral
      agent indicated for HIV-infected treatment-naïve patients. In treatment-experienced
      patients, darunavir was initially approved for twice-daily administration boosted with
      twice-daily ritonavir at 600mg and 100mg, respectively. Recently, once-daily
      darunavir/ritonavir was approved for use in treatment-experienced adult patients with
      viremia with no darunavir resistance mutations. In treatment-experienced patients with viral
      suppression, switching from an antiretroviral taken twice-daily to a once-daily dose is an
      attractive option to promote greater patient acceptability and adherence, and potentially
      minimize side effects and toxicities. Because of darunavir/ritonavir's high genetic barrier
      to resistance and well-established safety profile at a once-daily dose, switching patients
      with virologic suppression from twice-daily darunavir/ritonavir to once-daily
      darunavir/ritonavir will likely confer attributes more favorable to patients through a
      simplified dosing schedule and lower potential for lipid elevation without the loss of
      virologic control. DRIVESHAFT is a 48-week Phase 4, randomized, open label, comparative
      study. The study will be conducted in 60 HIV-1 infected, antiretroviral experienced,
      virologically-suppressed patients on regimens containing darunavir 600mg/ ritonavir 100mg
      twice-daily and a minimum of two other antiretrovirals, with a history of 0-1
      darunavir-associated resistance mutations. Subjects will be randomized 1:1 to switch to
      darunavir 800mg/ ritonavir 100mg once-daily or continue on their current regimen. Rates of
      virologic suppression of once-daily darunavir/ritonavir regimens relative to
      darunavir/ritonavir twice-daily regimens will be compared, and safety, change from baseline
      fasting lipid parameters, and adherence will be evaluated.
