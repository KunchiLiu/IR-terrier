      Abstract:

      New medication classes are needed to improve treatment effectiveness in the depressed phase
      of bipolar disorder (BD). Extant evidence suggests that BD is not only characterized by
      reduced monoaminergic signaling, but also by neural changes such as dendritic remodeling,
      demyelination, and glial and neuronal cell loss (73). These changes have been hypothesized
      to result from chronic inflammation (45), based partly on convergent evidence that
      proinflammatory cytokines are elevated in depressed patients with BD (34, 12). The principal
      aims of the proposed research is to evaluate the antidepressant efficacy in bipolar
      depression of minocycline, a drug with neuroprotective and immune-modulating properties, and
      of aspirin, at doses expected to selectively inhibit cyclooxygenase 1 (COX-1), within the
      context of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group clinical trial
      following a 2 x 2 design.

      Specific Aims Specific Aim 1: To test the hypothesis that augmentative treatment with
      minocycline and/ or aspirin will improve depression ratings to a greater extent than
      placebo.

      Specific Aim 2: To investigate the relationship between the response to minocycline, aspirin
      and markers of inflammation (serum concentrations of IL-6 and CRP, and IL-6 mRNA expression
      in peripheral blood monocytes (PBM). The investigators will test the hypotheses that: a)
      minocycline treatment will reduce inflammation to a greater extent than placebo; b) during
      minocycline treatment the change in inflammatory cytokine expression will correlate with the
      change in depression ratings; c) the baseline elevation of inflammatory markers will predict
      greater antidepressant response to minocycline.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  One hundred and twenty male or female outpatients between 18 and 65 years of age, who
             meet DSM-IV-TR criteria for BD (type I or II) and for a current major depressive
             episode will be recruited. The depressive syndrome must have been present for at
             least 4 weeks and the minimum threshold for depression severity will be set at a
             17-item HAM-D score &gt;10. Subjects will provide written informed consent as approved
             by the Western Institutional Review Board.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. inability to provide informed consent;

          2. age of onset of BD&gt;40 years;

          3. serious risk of suicide;

          4. current delusions or hallucinations sufficient to interfere with the capacity to
             provide informed consent;

          5. current manic symptoms [depressed BD patients with concurrent manic symptoms have
             been found to be more likely to experience adverse reactions in antidepressant
             treatment trials (23)];

          6. medical illness including as hepatic impairment, renal dysfunction, bleeding
             diatheses (e.g., hemophilia), known cerebrovascular disease or heart disease,
             hypertension that is inadequately controlled by medication, or known peptic ulcer
             disease;

          7. abuse of drugs or alcohol within the preceding 6 months, or substance dependence
             within the last 5 years;

          8. daily alcoholic beverage consumption equivalent to &gt;3 oz of alcohol;

          9. asthma or known allergies or hypersensitivities to tetracycline antibiotics, aspirin
             or other NSAIDs;

         10. current use of drugs that could increase the risks associated with aspirin or
             minocycline administration, namely other antibiotic medications, other NSAIDs or
             anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin), acetazolamide, or methotrexate;

         11. known HIV or other chronic infection including, but not limited to viral hepatitis.

         12. Pregnant or nursing women, and women who are attempting to conceive during the 8 week
             study period, will also be excluded.
