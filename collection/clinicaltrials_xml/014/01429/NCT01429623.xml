  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether treatment with the investigational drug
      ladostigil will delay the onset of Alzheimer's disease(AD) in patients with Mild Cognitive
      Impairment (MCI). MCI is now recognized as a precursor to AD and clinical tools are
      available to assess cognitive performance at this earlier stage. Ladostigil is currently
      under investigation for the treatment of AD. In this study, the investigators will be
      examining ladostigil at a lower dose level. At this dose level, ladostigil has been shown to
      reduce signs of early memory loss in animals. Thus, in this study the investigators are
      attempting to determine if earlier invention with a lower dose of ladostigil will
      significantly reduce initial memory loss and delay the subsequent progression to more
      serious cognitive dysfunction.
