    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2 clinical trial in adult hypogonadal males with baseline morning serum
      testosterone concentrations &lt;300 ng/dL. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the
      pharmacokinetics of FE 999303, delivered using an applicator in comparison to hand
      application
