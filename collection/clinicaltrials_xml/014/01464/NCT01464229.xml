  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Iloperidone is an atypical antipsychotic drug, FDA-approved for the acute treatment of
      schizophrenia in adults in 2009 (Marino et al., 2010); moreover, some of its pharmacological
      features seem to be very promising in treating symptoms like anger and anxiety (Fava et al.,
      1997; Wang et al., 2010). The investigators therefore feel that an adequately sized, well
      powered, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, cross-over study of iloperidone
      augmentation of SSRIs among MDD outpatients in partial remission with residual anger and
      irritability is warranted at this point to evaluate its efficacy, safety and tolerability on
      residual anger, irritability and depressive symptoms.

      Main hypothesis: Adults with MDD in partial remission, who are experiencing residual
      symptoms of anger and irritability, assigned to treatment with iloperidone will demonstrate
      a significantly greater reduction in the total score of the Anger/Hostility Scale of the
      Symptom Questionnaire from baseline to endpoint than those assigned to placebo using the
      cross-over design.
