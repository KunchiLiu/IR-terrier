  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that sitagliptin will significantly reduce impairments in
      insulin secretion and insulin resistance resulting from short-term oral glucocorticoid
      therapy.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators plan to conduct a prospective, randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled parallel arm study comparing insulin secretion and insulin resistance in
      subjects with impaired fasting glucose on oral glucocorticoid therapy + placebo versus
      subjects on oral glucocorticoid therapy + sitagliptin. For the oral glucocorticoid therapy,
      we plan to use dexamethasone (dex) 2.5 mg daily. We chose dex for known glycemic effects,
      improved compliance, and once daily dosing.

      Previous studies have shown that in humans, glucocorticoid-induced insulin resistance
      develops within 4 hours with infused drug at high dose (methylprednisolone 500 mg x single
      infusion) and does not change with duration of drug therapy of up to 3 months.10
      Furthermore, more modest doses over a short duration (dex 2.0 mg orally daily x 2 days) have
      been shown to decrease insulin-mediated glucose disposal.11 12 Thus, studying acute effects
      of oral dex at 2.5 mg daily x 7 days should be more than adequate to achieve impaired
      glucose-mediated insulin secretion and impaired insulin-mediated glucose disposal.

      In order for sitagliptin to have the desired effect, drug should be administered for at
      least 7 days (5 half-lives plus 40% more for margin of error). We plan to study subjects
      with impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose tolerance as they would likely be
      candidates for DPP-IV therapy in the future and would be likely to have impaired insulin
      secretion and impaired glucose disposal amenable to DPP-IV therapy.

    <description>The primary outcome variable will be the difference in the disposition index (DI) determined as the product of the acute insulin response to glucose (AIRg) x the insulin sensitivity index (SI) in subjects on oral dex and either placebo or sitagliptin 100 mg for 1 week. The primary analyses will be an ANCOVA, including baseline responses as a covariate.</description>
