  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, non-masked, open-label, Phase II study of cetuximab + dasatinib in
      recurrent Squamous Cell Carcinoma of The Head and Neck (SCCHN) that has recurred after
      cetuximab-containing therapy (please see attached schema).

      The primary endpoint 12-week PFS.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients must have recurrent SCCHN and may have received any number of prior palliative
      systemic therapies for recurrent disease (without cetuximab or othr EGFR inhibitor). One
      prior curative regimen (induction, primary or postoperative chemoradiotherapy) should have
      been given AND all patients should have been exposed to cetuximab as part of prior
      potentially curative treatment.Those who have received a prior Src kinase inhibitor or EGFR
      inhibitor other than cetuximab are not eligible.

      Patients will be tested for serum IL-6. If IL-6 is detectable, the patient will be
      ineligible. If IL-6 is not detected, the patient will be eligible for the study. Subjects
      more than 2 weeks post last dose of Cetuximab will receive an initial loading dose 400 mg/m2
      on cycle 1, day 1. Subjects who have received Cetuximab within 2 weeks of starting study
      will start Cycle 1 with dose of 250 mg/m2. Dasatinib will start 3 days after initial
      cetuximab study dose on cycle 1 (i.e cycle 1, day 4), and continue without interruption.

    <description>Cetuximab on a standard weekly schedule (see Section 6.2). Group 1 (subjects more than 2 weeks post last dose of Cetuximab): Loading dose of 400 mg/m2 on cycle 1, day 1 then 250 mg/m2 IV weekly.
Group 2 (subjects last Cetuximab treatment within 2 weeks): Cycle 1 will start at a dose of 250 mg/m2 Dasatinib 150 mg once daily without interruption. On the FIRST cycle (1 cycle is 3 weeks) dasatinib will start 3 days after the cetuximab loading dose (i.e. cycle 1, day 4) to avoid headache as shown on the previous phase I trial.
Treatment will continue until progression.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion:

          -  Patients must have metastatic and/or recurrent SCCHN that has been previously treated
             with cetuximab.

          -  Undetectable baseline serum IL-6 NOTE : This eligibility criterion applies only to
             patients enrolling to the second, biomarker-enrichment stage of the trial.

          -  Measurable disease per RECIST 1.1.

          -  Unlimited prior treatment with radiation or chemoradiotherapy

          -  Any number of prior regimens for recurrent or metastatic SCCHN (i.e. palliative
             treatment) including cetuximab or other EGFR inhibitor

          -  Age &gt;18 years

          -  ECOG performance status &lt;2 (Karnofsky &gt;60%, see Appendix A).

          -  Life expectancy of greater than 12 weeks.

          -  Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:

               1. absolute neutrophil count &gt;1,200/µL

               2. platelets &gt;100,000/µL

               3. total bilirubin within normal institutional limits

               4. AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) &lt; 2.5 X institutional upper limit of normal

               5. Creatinine up to 1.5 X normal institutional limits

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed Consent
             document.

          -  Patients should not be taking concomitant medication that are CYP3A4 inducers or
             potent inhibitors and should try to avoid taking proton pump inhibitors and H2
             antagonists during rest of treatment period. The above medications will be continued
             only if medically necessary and their use will be noted.

          -  Sexually active women of childbearing potential must use an effective method of birth
             control during the course of the study, in a manner such that risk of failure is
             minimized. Prior to study enrollment, women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must be
             advised of the importance of avoiding pregnancy during trial participation and the
             potential risk factors for an unintentional pregnancy. In addition, men enrolled on
             this study should understand the risks to any sexual partner of childbearing
             potential and should practice an effective method of birth control. All WOCBP MUST
             have a negative pregnancy test prior to first receiving investigational product. If
             the pregnancy test is positive, the patient must not receive investigational product
             and must not be enrolled in the study. In addition, all WOCBP should be instructed to
             contact the Investigator immediately if they suspect they might be pregnant (e.g.,
             missed or late menstrual period) at any time during study participation.

        Exclusion:

             minimum of 1 week should have elapsed from prior palliative radiotherapy.

          -  Patients may not have received an investigational agent within 4 weeks of starting
             this trial.
