  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Carfilzomib is a drug that has shown anti-tumor activity by inhibiting the proteasome within
      the cell, which is responsible for degrading or breaking down a wide variety of proteins.
      Carfilzomib has not been approved by the FDA.

      Rituximab and dexamethasone are often used to treat Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia (WM),
      alone or in combination with other drugs. Combinations with rituximab, dexamethasone and
      proteasome inhibitors, like carfilzomib, show high levels of activity in WM patients.

      In this research study, the investigators are testing the safety and efficacy of Carfilzomib
      when used along with Rituximab and Dexamethasone as a possible treatment for Waldenstrom's
      Macroglobulinemia.

      If you take part in this research study, you will receive Carfilzomib and dexamethasone as
      an infusion on Days 1, 2, 8, and 9 for Cycles 1-6. You will then have a Rituximab infusion
      on Days 2 and 9. Each cycles lasts 21 days. After completing Cycle 6 and if you are
      eligible, there will be a 2 month break before the maintenance phase is started. During this
      break, you will have a study visit with a physical exam, blood tests, and a bone marrow
      biopsy. If you continue to the maintenance phase, you will receive Carfilzomib and
      Dexamethasone on Days 1 and 2 and Rituximab on Day 2 of Cycles 1-8. Each cycle will continue
      to last 21 days, but will take place every 2 months. Infusions will last between 2-6 hours.

      During all cycles you will have a physical exam and you will be asked questions about your
      general health and specific questions about any problems that you might be having and any
      medications you may be taking. Blood tests will also be done at each Cycle visit, and you
      will complete a questionnaire. Bone marrow and CT scan will only be repeated at physician
      discretion when appropriate and in order to ensure your response to treatment.
