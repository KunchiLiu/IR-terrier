  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to improve how we estimate survival of people with cancer that has
      spread to their bone. There have been previous attempts to estimate survival of people with
      cancer that spread to the bone, but they have not been accurate. This study will try to
      improve the way we estimate survival in people with cancer that has spread to their bone by
      looking to see if a physician assessment and a patient assessment of the health status can
      be blended to give a better estimate of survival than patients or doctors alone.

    <description>This is a prospective, cross sectional, human use study conducted using patients with bone metastases requiring orthopaedic stabilization. Though this is an observational study, blood sampling, the SF-36 questionnaire, and ECOG performance status, and correlative studies will be performed.</description>

    <intervention_name>blood sampling, the SF-36 questionnaire</intervention_name>
    <description>The patient be asked to fill out a questionnaire. The questionnaire asks about their quality of life and will take approximately 15 minutes to complete. It will be completed at a regularly scheduled clinic visit.
At the scheduled pre-operative testing, an extra sample of your blood (equal to about 4 teaspoons) will be collected for research tests. The research tests will measure levels of inflammation in your body. These tests are not part of routine care. A physical examination of the operative site will be done by the Orthopaedic Surgeon. The patient will complete the same questionnaire at the regularly scheduled three and six month follow-up visit</description>
