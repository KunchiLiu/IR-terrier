      The overall objective of this developmental/exploratory study is to use noninvasive proton
      magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H MRS) to determine (a) whether levels of the antioxidant
      glutathione (GSH) are decreased in vivo, as has been found in postmortem brain, in the brain
      of 30 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) compared to matched controls; (b) whether GSH
      levels in PD brain increase significantly following 30 days of daily supplementation with
      1800mg or 3600mg of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) compared to placebo and to baseline, and (c)
      whether any such increases in brain GSH would be dose-dependent and be associated with a
      change in the participants' oxidative stress profiles. In addition, a clinical assessment
      battery, including quantitative tests of motor function, will be performed to investigate
      potential associations between the NAC intervention, brain GSH levels, oxidative stress
      markers, and clinical presentation. If successful, this study will represent the first
      objective documentation of whether there is a GSH deficit in living PD brain that dietary
      NAC supplementation can mitigate, thereby providing a compelling justification for
      investigating such neuroprotective strategies in larger controlled clinical trials.

      Multiple lines of preclinical, animal model, genetic and postmortem evidence have implicated
      oxidative stress in the chain of pathogenic events that lead to the progressive degeneration
      of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons found in Parkinson's disease (PD) - the hallmark of
      the disorder. These include evidence of membrane lipid peroxidation seen in increased levels
      of 8-iso-prostaglandin-F2a-isoprostanes (F2-isoprostanes) (Seet et al 2010), protein
      peroxidation in the form of nitration and nitrosylation of a-synuclein and parkin (Giasson
      et al 2000; Chung et al 2004; Yao et al 2004), and oxidative DNA damage measured as
      increased 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine (8OH'2dg) (Alam et al 1997; Seet et al 2010; Nakabeppu
      et al 2007). Importantly, replicated studies in postmortem PD brain by independent
      laboratories (Sofic et al 1992; Jenner 1992 et al; Riederer et al 1989; Sian et al 1994)
      have consistently found losses of up to 40% of nigral glutathione (GSH), the most abundant
      antioxidant in living tissue, suggesting that oxidative stress in PD may be the result of
      decreased intracellular antioxidant capacity (Bains and Shaw 1997). Therefore, there is
      currently great interest in neuroprotective treatment strategies aimed at maintaining,
      restoring and/or elevating intracellular GSH levels (Zeevalk 2008). However, GSH does not
      readily cross the blood-brain barrier or the membranes of most cells, including neurons, so
      that direct dietary supplementation of the antioxidant has not proved viable in increasing
      its intracellular concentration (Zeevalk 2008). On the other hand, since the bioavailability
      of cysteine, which does cross both the blood-brain barrier and most cell membranes, is
      rate-limiting in the GSH synthesis pathway, this amino acid and its non-toxic derivatives,
      such as N-acetylcysteine (NAC), are being investigated as potential precursors that can be
      supplied through dietary means to spur in situ synthesis and intracellular elevation of
      brain GSH (Zeevalk 2008). In support of the potential validity of this strategy, two recent
      studies in schizophrenia (Berk et al 2008b; Bulut et al 2009) and one in bipolar disorder
      (Berk et al 2008c) - disorders in which oxidative stress is postulated to play pathogenic
      role -- reported symptom amelioration following treatment with NAC. However, to the best of
      our knowledge, no study to date has measured in vivo human brain GSH in PD to confirm the up
      to 40% deficit in the antioxidant that has been found in postmortem brain, and to ascertain
      that NAC supplementation leads to elevation of brain GSH in situ. The overall objective of
      this R21 proposal is, therefore, to address this void or gap in knowledge by pursuing the
      following aims:

      Specific Aim 1: To directly measure, using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H MRS),
      in vivo brain GSH in 30 unmedicated patients with idiopathic PD and in 30 sex- and
      age-matched healthy controls prior to and following 4 weeks supplementation with either
      placebo, 2000mg/day or 4000 mg/day of NAC.

      Hypothesis 1: (a) Baseline brain GSH levels will be significantly lower in the patients with
      PD than in the matched healthy control subjects. (b) Brain levels of GSH will increase
      significantly compared to baseline in all treated groups following 4 weeks of NAC
      supplementation. However, elevations of the antioxidant will be dose-dependent and largest
      in subjects with the largest deficit at baseline.

      Specific Aim 2: To measure a number of established markers of oxidative stress (Dalle-Donne
      et al 2006) in temporally concordant CSF samples obtained from all participants, at baseline
      and following 4 weeks of NAC supplementation.

      Hypothesis 2: (a) Four weeks of NAC supplementation will improve the oxidative stress
      profile in all subjects, with the larger improvement occurring in subjects with the largest
      baseline GSH deficit. (b) Because GSH does not cross the blood-brain barrier, its levels in
      CSF will better correlate with brain levels measured by 1H MRS than would blood levels, and
      provide a more accurate assessment of antioxidant capacity and oxidative stress in the CNS.

      Significance: Achievement of these aims will provide the first objective in vivo
      documentation of the reported postmortem brain GSH deficits and oxidative stress in PD, and
      whether NAC supplementation increases brain levels of the antioxidant in situ, thereby
      providing a compelling justification for larger placebo-controlled, randomized trials of NAC
      as a neuroprotective therapy. This proposal qualifies as &quot;high-risk, high-reward&quot; since it
      tackles a significant scientific and therapeutic roadblock that, if overcome, could open a
      new avenue for PD therapy development.
