  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter study evaluating the safety and tolerability of increasing doses of
      Toca 511, a retroviral replicating vector, injected into the resection cavity of subjects
      with Grade III or Grade IV Gliomas who have elected to undergo surgical removal of their
      tumor. Approximately 6 weeks after injection of Toca 511, subjects will take an oral course
      of 5-FC, an antifungal antibiotic. These one week courses of 5-FC will be repeated during
      the 31 week study. In some subjects, Toca 511 and Toca FC will also be evaluated with either
      of the following standard treatments for glioma: lomustine, a drug approved by the FDA to
      treat brain tumors or bevacizumab, an alternative drug approved by the FDA to treat brain
      tumors. After completion of this study, all subjects will be eligible for enrollment and
      encouraged to be in a long-term continuation protocol that enables additional Toca FC
      treatment cycles to be given, as well as permits the collection of long-term safety and
      survival data.

    <description>All subjects will receive Toca 511, a retroviral replicating vector that expresses the cytosine deaminase (CD) gene. CD converts the antibiotic 5-FC to the anti-cancer drug 5-FU in cells that have been infected by the Toca 511 vector. Beginning approximately 6 weeks after administration of Toca 511, subjects will take a course of oral 5-FC. These courses of 5-FC will be repeated cyclically during the 6-month study.</description>

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria (must all be answered &quot;Yes&quot;):

          -  Has the subject given written informed consent?

          -  Is the subject between 18 years old and 80 years old inclusive?

          -  Has the subject had histologically proven HGG with recurrence or progression
             following initial definitive therapy(s) such as surgery with or without adjuvant
             radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy (confirmed by diagnostic biopsy or
             contrast-enhanced MRI and evaluable by Macdonald criteria)? Note if first recurrence
             of GBM is documented by MRI, an interval of at least 12 weeks after the end of prior
             radiation therapy is required unless there is either: i) histopathologic confirmation
             of recurrent tumor, or ii) new enhancement on MRI outside of the radiotherapy
             treatment field.

          -  Does the subject have a single, HGG tumor recurrence/progression that is ≤ 5 cm in
             its greatest dimension?
