  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is a proof-of-concept pilot study aim to investigate the biologic and clinical
      effects of early azithromycin treatment in children hospitalized with Respiratory Syncytial
      Virus (RSV) bronchiolitis.

      HYPOTHESES

      In infants hospitalized with RSV bronchiolitis, azithromycin therapy (compared to placebo)
      will result in:

        1. Decreased concentrations of inflammatory mediators (IL-8 as primary outcome) in serum
           and nasal wash measured on day 8 after randomization.

        2. A smaller proportion of participants with recurrent (≥2) wheezing episodes during weeks
           3-52 following randomization.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age: 1-18 months.

          2. Hospitalization for the first episode of RSV bronchiolitis:

               -  Confirmed RSV infection by positive nasal swab results (viral culture and/or
                  direct antigen detection) from the SLCH virology lab; AND

               -  At least two of the following symptoms/signs of bronchiolitis: respiratory rate
                  greater than 40 breaths/minute; cough; wheezing; audible rales, crackles, and/or
                  rhonchi; paradoxical chest movements (retractions).

          3. Duration of respiratory symptoms from initiation of symptoms to admission is 5 days
             or less. Time of admission will define by the time the child was seen in the ED for

          4. Randomization can be performed within 48 hours from time of admission (defined by
             time of first set of vital signs obtained on the floor).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Prematurity (gestational age &lt; 36 weeks).

          2. Presence or history of other significant disease (CNS, lung, cardiac, renal, GI,
             hepatic disease, hematologic, endocrine or immune disease). Children with atopic
             dermatitis will not be excluded from the study.

          3. Clinically significant gastroesophageal reflux currently treated with a daily
             anti-reflux medication (anti- H2 or PPI).

          4. The child has significant developmental delay/failure to thrive, defined as weight &lt;
             3% for age and gender.

          5. History of previous (before the current episode) wheeze or previous treatment with
             albuterol.

          6. Treatment (past of present) with corticosteroid (systemic or inhaled) and/or
             montelukast.

          7. Treatment with any antibiotics in the past 2 weeks.

          8. Treatment with Macrolide antibiotic (Azithromycin, clarithromycin or erythromycin)
             with the past 4 weeks.

          9. Current treatment with any daily medication (other then albuterol, vitamins or
             nutritional supplements).

         10. Participation in another clinical trial.

         11. Evidence that the family may be unreliable or nonadherent, or may move from the
