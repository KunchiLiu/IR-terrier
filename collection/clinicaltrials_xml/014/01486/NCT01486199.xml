    <textblock>
      The investigators are developing a new nuclear medicine imaging technique for measuring
      liquid absorption in the airways that can be applied to screen new medications being
      developed to treat cystic fibrosis (CF). The investigators believe that the absorption of
      the small molecule radiopharmaceutical Indium 111-DTPA will indicate changes in liquid
      absorption in the airways and demonstrate whether new CF medications will be effective. In
      this study the investigators will further develop this technique through testing involving
      pediatric CF patients and healthy control subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have recently developed a novel aerosol-based imaging technique to detect
      changes in liquid absorption in the airways - a central pathophysiological process known to
      be important in cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease. This technique may provide a measure of
      disease severity and indication of therapeutic correction in advance of currently available
      outcome measures. It involves the simultaneous delivery of two radiopharmaceuticals by
      inhalation: one an absorbable small-molecule (Indium-111 labeled diethylene triamine
      pentaacetic acid; In-DTPA) and the other a non-absorbable particle (Technetium 99m labeled
      sulfur colloid; Tc-SC). The overarching hypothesis is that DTPA absorption provides a
      quantifiable, non-invasive measurement of airway liquid absorption that (a) is sensitive to
      CF genotype, (b) uniquely identifies basic disease phenotype and predicts disease severity,
      and (c) is modulated by therapeutic interventions.
