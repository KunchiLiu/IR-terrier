  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The best treatment for resectable esophageal cancer or cancer between esophagus and stomach
      (GE junction) is unknown. Although an operation to remove the esophagus is the most common
      treatment, previous studies have shown that patients live longer when either chemotherapy or
      chemotherapy plus radiation (chemoradiation) is given before surgery (preoperative),
      compared to surgery alone. However it is unknown which of these treatments (preoperative
      chemotherapy or preoperative chemoradiation) is more effective in improving survival. A
      study where patients with resectable esophageal / GE junction cancer are chosen at random to
      receive one of the two preoperative treatments would help determine if one form of treatment
      improves survival compared to the other.

      Patients with localized esophageal / GE junction cancer (adenocarcinoma) will be randomized
      to receive either preoperative chemotherapy or preoperative chemoradiation followed by
      surgery.

      The main objective of this pilot trial is to determine the possibility of conducting a
      larger study with many centers participating. If this study proves to be feasible with
      enough patients enrolled and able to tolerate treatments without major side effects then we
      can hopefully proceed to perform a larger multi-center trial to look for survival outcome
      differences between patients who receive preoperative chemotherapy and those who receive
      preoperative chemoradiation. The results of this trial would ultimately help us choose the
      most effective treatment of resectable esophageal cancer and hopefully improve survival.
