  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Muscle proteins accumulate damage during aging and leads to the loss of muscle mass and
      function in older people. Exercise can increase the making of new proteins and removal of
      older proteins, but it is not known if the effect changes with aging or type of exercise.
      The investigators will determine the ability for endurance, resistance, or a combination of
      exercise training to remove older-damaged proteins and make newer-functional muscle proteins
      in groups of younger and older people. The investigators will particularly study protein
      that are involved with energy production (mitochondrial proteins) and force production
      (contractile proteins).

      Hypothesis 1: Older people will have greater accumulation of damaged proteins than younger
      people.

      Hypothesis 2: Aerobic exercise will decrease the accumulation of damaged forms of
      contractile and mitochondrial proteins in younger and older people.

      Hypothesis 3: Resistance exercise will decrease the accumulation of damaged forms of
      contractile proteins in younger and older people.

    <textblock>
      The loss of muscle mass and function with age leads to high social and economic costs.
      Lifestyle interventions that can help maintain muscle mass and function can be beneficial to
      improve health and decrease the costs associated with loss of independence in the elderly.
      Muscle proteins accumulate damage during aging, which is suggested to lead to loss of
      function. The biological processes that remove damaged proteins and synthesis new proteins
      appear to be decreased with aging. Exercise is known to increase the processes that remove
      older and synthesis newer muscle proteins and may be an effect lifestyle intervention to
      improve muscle quality and function. Additionally, specific types of proteins appear to
      decay with age including contractile and mitochondrial proteins. Different types of exercise
      training can increase the making of specific proteins. The investigators will examine the
      ability for aerobic and resistance training to increase the quality of mitochondrial and
      contractile proteins between younger and older people.

    <description>The investigators will determine the rate of incorporation of stable isotope amino acid tracers in skeletal muscle proteins during several hours of rest. The measurement will be an average resting muscle protein synthesis rate (% new muscle protein per hour) and will be performed at baseline and following 12 weeks of exercise training.</description>

    <description>Participants will perform 12-weeks of high intensity aerobic training. Training will be 5-days per week. Three days (e.g. Monday, Wednesday and Friday) will include repeated bouts of cycling for 4-minutes at ~90% maximal effort followed by 3 minutes of active rest. The other two days (e.g. Tuesday and Thursday) will be treadmill exercise for 45 minutes at 70% of maximal effort.</description>
