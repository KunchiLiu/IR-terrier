  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypotheses of this study are:

        1. Delivery of single fraction Lattice Extreme Ablative Dose (LEAD) radiotherapy (RT) to
           the dominant tumor lesion(s) in the prostate as identified by multiparametric
           functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging is safe and feasible.

        2. Biomarker expression levels differ in the functional MRI identified suspicious tumor
           regions and unsuspicious tumor regions. The investigators hypothesize that a
           significant source of variation in biomarker levels is due to tumor heterogeneity and
           that it is molecular abnormalities in the dominant tumor areas that are angiogenic and
           determine outcome.

    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to use a novel method for delivery of ablative spatially
      fractionated radiation to the multiparametric functional MRI defined tumor volume in the
      framework of a single-arm phase I clinical trial. The technique, deemed Lattice Extreme
      Ablative Dose (LEAD) RT, involves the creation of high doses shaped in cylinders through the
      DCE-MRI and/or DWI-MRI defined region(s) and adjacent apparently normal prostate in a
      lattice framework. The LEAD RT delivery will be in a single fraction of 12-14 Gy prior to
      standard fractions (2.0 Gy per day) for an additional 76 Gy (total dose for all treatments
      of 88-90 Gy and 149 Gy 3.0 in 2.0 Gy equivalents).

      In this protocol the investigators also aim to examine biomarkers obtained from
      ultrasound-guided prostate biopsies. The patients will have the option of refusing the
      pre-RT prostate biopsies that are planned to be done when the patient has fiducial markers
      placed. Emphasis will be placed on biopsying regions in which the multiparametric MRI shows
      enhancement with or without DWI indicated water restriction. The preferred method of
      protocol research biopsies will involve the Eigen Artemis® system, which allows for fusion
      of the MRI images to ultrasound in real time. The Artemis® system is an FDA approved
      transrectal ultrasound prostate biopsy device. At the present time, Eigen has made available
      to us the MRI-ultrasound (MRIus) fusion software, which is in beta testing. The Eigen
      Artemis® system fusion software (not FDA approved) may be used to fine-tune the location of
      the tumor and biopsies by fusion of the previously obtained multiparametric MRI to the
      transrectal ultrasound in real time. The ultrasound is the true guidance imaging parameter
      that identifies the prostate boundaries and other nearby structures. The MRI is fused to the
      ultrasound such that the biopsies may be directed to a region in the ultrasound space.

      The Eigen Artemis® system software will be used as a means of better targeting tumor
      regions, which are poorly seen on ultrasound alone. Recently, Natarajan et al (24) described
      the UCLA experience, demonstrating that the proportion of positive biopsies was much higher
      using the MRIus fusion software, as compared to ultrasound alone. In this protocol, the
      MRIus fusion software may be used to obtain research biopsies and the results of the
      biopsies (e.g., in terms of Gleason score) will not be used for diagnosis (the patients
      already have a diagnosis) or influence treatment in any way. The patient is free to withdraw
      from the protocol at any time, including upon learning the results of the biopsies.

      If the Eigen Artemis system® is unavailable, ultrasound biopsies may be performed while
      viewing the functional MRI images on a separate monitor during the ultrasound-guided
      biopsies to enhance the probability of obtained biomarkers more representative of patient
      outcome. A third option that will become available in 2012 is to perform MRI-guided biopsies
      directly on the MRI scanner using a commercially available approach.. Biomarkers from
      biopsies from the index lesion(s) will be compared to those from tumor in other areas of the
      prostate. Biopsy tissues will be collected pre- and post-treatment and analyzed by
      immunohistochemistry (IHC) for biomarker quantification.

          -  T1-T3a disease based on digital rectal exam (DRE).

               -  T3a disease based on MRI is acceptable (no evidence of frank (clear cut) SV
                  involvement or invasion of bladder or rectum).

          -  Patients with Gleason score ≥8 must be offered long term androgen deprivation therapy
             (ADT) and refuse such treatment because only 4-6 months (+/- 2 months) (short term
             ADT) is permitted (not required) on this protocol. The ADT is recommended to begin
             after fiducial marker placement; however, ADT is permitted to have been started up to
             two months prior to the signing of consent. All patients in this protocol may (not
             required) be treated with 4-6 months (+/- 2 months) of ADT, at the discretion of the
             treating physician.

               -  Gleason ≥8 must have &lt; 40% of the tissue involved with Gleason 8 in the biopsy
                  specimen.

          -  PSA ≤ 30 ng/mL within 3 months of enrollment. If PSA was above 30 and dropped to ≤30

             limit and x=.04*upper assay limit + upper assay limit), and taken within 4 months of
             enrollment. Patients who have been started on ADT prior to signing consent are not
             required to have a serum testosterone at this level prior to signing consent; but, a
             serum testosterone prior to fiducial marker placement is recommended.

          -  Serum liver function tests (LFT) are taken within 3 months of enrollment.

          -  Complete blood counts are taken within 3 months of enrollment.

             prostate cancer.

          -  Serum testosterone is not within 40% of normal assay limits taken within 4 months of
             enrollment (only applicable to patients not started on ADT prior to signing consent).
