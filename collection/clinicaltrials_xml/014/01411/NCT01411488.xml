      The purpose of the study is to determine the prevalence of anal erosions within a 14 day
      period among adult ICU patients at Cleveland Clinic Main Campus who receive one of two fecal
      management systems (FMS).

      Null Hypothesis: There is no difference in the rates of anal erosion between the twp fecal
      management systems in a 14 day period.

      Alternative Hypothesis: One fecal management system is no worse than the second fecal
      management system in the development of anal erosion.

      PURPOSE: To compare the incidence of anal erosion between 2 indwelling fecal management
      systems. Anal erosion was defi ned as localized mucous membrane tissue impairments of the
      anal canal caused by corrosive fecal enzymes and/or indwelling devices. DESIGN: Randomized
      comparative effectiveness clinical trial comparing 2 commercially available indwelling fecal
      management systems. SUBJECTS AND SETTING: The target population was adults cared for on
      medical, surgical, and neurological intensive care units (ICUs) and non-ICU units with an
      order for indwelling fecal management system placement. The research setting was a 1200-bed
      quaternary-care medical center in the Midwestern United States. Seventy-nine patients
      participated in the study; 41 received system A and 38 received system B. Subjects' mean age
      was 64 ± 13.6 years (mean ± SD), and 52% were female.
