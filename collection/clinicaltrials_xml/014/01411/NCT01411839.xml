    <textblock>
      The current HIV treatment adherence project was designed to adapt culturally and then pilot
      test an empirically supported cognitive-behavioral therapy program for adherence and
      symptoms of depression (CBT-AD)with HIV+ Latinos living on the U.S.-Mexico Border.

      Additionally, the investigators will assess the feasibility and efficacy of a novel
      medication monitoring and reminder system (MedSignalsÂ®) in the form of an electronic pillbox
      with monitoring and reminding functions that is available in a Spanish-language version. Our
      hypotheses are grounded in a conceptual model proposing that the CBT-AD intervention will
      improve problem-solving ability and decrease depressive symptomatology, which will directly
      improve biomedical outcomes of HIV-1 RNA viral load and CD4 as well as indirectly improve
      biomedical outcomes through increased motivation, improved memory, and better medication
      adherence. Evaluating and implementing generalizable and sustainable mental health and
      adherence interventions such as the ones proposed are urgently needed in the region to
      improve HIV treatment outcomes and thwart the development and transmission of drug resistant
      virus.

    <measure>Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes in depression ratings at two time points: From baseline to 6 and 9 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The MADRS is a 10-item clinician administered scripted rating scale of depressive symptoms. The scale was develop to capture current depressive symptoms within the past seven days. The areas covered include: apparant and reported sadness, inner tension, reduced sleep and appetite, concentration difficulties, lassitude, inability to feel, pessimistic and suicidal thoughts. Both control and treatment conditions are interviewed with the MADRS at baseline and at 6 and 9 month follow-ups for any changes.</description>

    <measure>MedSignals Electronic Pill-box for Adherence</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes in adherence at two-time points: from baseline to 6 and 9 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The MedSignals electronic pill-box is a elecontric storage bin that allows participants to store medications. In the treatment condition, the pill-box provides audio commands to alarm participants of their dosing regimen. The pill-box stores adherence information (time, number of openings). In the control condition, the pill-box does not alarm participants. The pill-box serves as a storage bin for the control condition and stores adherence data. All data is then uploaded onto an online database for investigators.</description>

    <description>Those randomized to the control condition are not involved in the CBT-AD therapy intervention. They receive standard care as usual. A letter is sent to their medical provider indicating that mild symptoms of depression were detected. The participants in the control arm are followed and matched to a participant in the intervention arm.</description>
