    <textblock>
      The investigators are conducting a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study to
      assess the efficacy of d-cycloserine augmentation of cognitive-behavioral therapy for the
      treatment of pediatric obsessive compulsive disorder. This study represents an innovative
      approach in translating bench research findings into clinical research and testing a new
      approach for optimizing an effective psychotherapy with a safe non-psychotropic medication.

    <textblock>
      Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) affects 1-2% of children, runs a chronic course without
      treatment, and is associated with considerable functional impairment and poor quality of
      life. Although most patients with OCD respond to cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or
      pharmacotherapy with a serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI), a substantial number of youth
      remain symptomatic after receiving these therapies. Pharmacological interventions with SRIs
      are only moderately efficacious, rarely produce remission, may be accompanied by side
      effects, and may not be an acceptable intervention to some parents. Medication augmentation
      strategies such as atypical antipsychotics are often used in children with partial response
      but have concerning metabolic effects and no systematic supporting efficacy or safety data.
      Although CBT is the gold standard treatment for pediatric OCD, not all patients benefit and
      the availability of skilled therapists is quite limited. Thus, there is a critical need for
      interventions to optimize treatment outcome in pediatric OCD. The primary mechanism in CBT
      is repeated and prolonged exposure to feared situations while abstaining from OCD rituals.
      This treatment is based on animal models of extinction of conditioned fears. Basic research
      on the neural circuitry underlying fear extinction led to the examination of d-cycloserine
      (DCS), a partial agonist at the NMDA receptor in the amygdala, as an agent capable of
      enhancing extinction learning. Following successful validation of this strategy in animals,
      six trials in adult humans - and one study in youth with OCD - provide support for DCS
      dosing as facilitating extinction learning that occurs during exposure-based psychotherapy.
      However, experts and agencies responsible for regulating drug indications in the US,
      including the FDA, recognize that safety and efficacy findings in adults should not be
      routinely extrapolated to children. The present study furthers pilot work on DCS to augment
      the effects of CBT in children with OCD. The investigators are conducting a double-blind
      randomized controlled trial, conducted at two sites, to examine the relative benefit of 10
      psychotherapy sessions of which sessions 4-10 will be augmented with weight-adjusted doses
      of DCS (25/50mg) compared to CBT augmented with placebo. 150 youth (ages 7-17) with OCD will
      be randomly and evenly assigned to one of the two treatment conditions. The primary outcome
      will be change in OCD symptom severity assessed by independent evaluators. The study
      recruitment sites are the University of South Florida (USF) and Massachusetts General
      Hospital/Harvard Medical School (MGH). This study extends the first report of DCS
      augmentation in youth with anxiety disorder/OCD by conclusively investigating an innovative
      research approach that manipulates glutamatergic pathways to mediate improved outcomes of
      exposure-based psychotherapy based upon a translational model of the neurobiology of OCD.

    <description>D-cycloserine will be encapsulated into 25mg with identical placebo capsules. Youth will take (1 or 2) DCS or identical placebo capsule 1 hour before sessions 4-10. A 0.7mg/kg dosage corresponds with dosages found to be effective in adult studies (50mg/estimated average adult weight of 70kg=.71mg/kg). Accordingly, doses for this study will be about 0.7mg/kg. Two dosing levels will be used based upon weight ranges to ensure comparable mg/kg levels: children weighing 25-45kg will be given a dosage of 25mg (~0.56-1.0 mg/kg/day), and children ≥46kg will be given 50mg provided in two 25mg capsules (~0.50-1.08mg/kg/day). Doses will be given 1 hour before therapy sessions 4-10.</description>
