      Note: In June 2013, the study design was changed from a randomized controlled study of
      risperidone + despiramine vs. risperidone vs. placebo to an open label pre-post study of
      risperidone (or risperidone-like drug) + desipramine. The aims of the study were revised to
      read:

        1. To determine whether participants treated with risperidone in combination with
           desiprmaine have less alcohol use (fewer drinking days; fewer heavy drinking days)
           during the final 8 weeks on these medications as compared to pre-baseline. The primary
           hypothesis is that compared to pre-baseline, participants will demonstrate fewer days
           of drinking (per week), as well as fewer days of heavy drinking (per week) in the final
           eight weeks they are taking risperidone and desipramine, as recorded on the Timeline
           Follow-Back assessment

        2. To explore changes in symptoms (of schizophrenia and of depression) in the final eight
           weeks of treatment with risperidone + desipramine compared to the period before
           baseline

        3. To assess the side effect burden associated with the combination of these two
           medications in participants.

      The original aims of the study were:

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether participants who are treated with
      risperidone in combination with desipramine have less alcohol use (fewer drinking days;
      fewer heavy drinking days) than do participants who are treated with RISP with placebo. The
      primary hypothesis is that compared to treatment with risperidone, participants randomized
      to a combination of risperidone plus desipramine will have fewer days of drinking, as well
      as fewer days of heavy drinking. The study will also compare the effects of risperidone as
      compared to risperidone plus desipramine on participants' symptoms and side effects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alcohol use disorder is at least three times more common in schizophrenia than in the
      general population, and worsens the course of schizophrenia. Typical antipsychotic agents
      are of limited value in controlling alcohol use in these &quot;dual diagnosis&quot; patients. Data
      from our group and others suggest that the atypical antipsychotic drug clozapine limits
      alcohol and cannabis use in &quot;dual diagnosis&quot; patients with schizophrenia much more
      effectively than other antipsychotics that have been assessed, however, the side effects
      produced by clozapine severely limit its use.

      The investigators have hypothesized that clozapine will lessen alcohol/substance use in such
      dual diagnosis patients in part because of its mechanism of action that includes release of
      dopamine (DA) in the prefrontal cortex which will help to normalize dysfunctional brain
      reward circuits that may underlie the co- occurring alcohol/substance use in patients with
      schizophrenia. Our data suggest that the effect of clozapine can be duplicated in rodents
      when medications with clozapine-like activity (DA D2 antagonism, potent norepinephrine (NE)
      α2 receptor antagonism and NE reuptake inhibition) are combined together. The investigators
      have demonstrated that RISP (a medication that is both a DA D2 receptor antagonist, and a
      potent NE α2 receptor antagonist), in combination with the specific NE reuptake inhibitor
      desipramine, significantly decreases alcohol consumption in alcohol drinking rodents.

      This translational study is a pilot &quot;proof of concept&quot; 14-week double-blind investigation of
      40 participants who have co-occurring diagnoses of schizophrenia and an alcohol use
      disorder. Patients not treated with risperidone (or a risperidone-like agent, including
      risperidone long-acting, paliperidone and paliperidone palmitate) at the time of consent
      will be switched to oral risperidone in the first two weeks of the study. At Week 3, all
      participants will begin treatment with risperidone risperidone plus desipramine and followed
      for 12 weeks. The primary outcome measure will be days of drinking (per week), as well as
      days of heavy drinking (per week). The investigators anticipate that data from this study
      will support a larger trial of risperidone + desipramine in patients with schizophrenia and
      an alcohol use disorder.

    <description>Alcohol/other substance use (including tobacco) will be assessed primarily by weekly self-report using the Timeline Followback (TLFB) method enhanced by procedures to strengthen the reliability and validity of this measure. Our data and Carey's suggest that the TLFB is useful for assessing alcohol use in persons diagnosed with SCZ. We will use well delineated procedures to minimize response bias,e.g., and we will obtain a Certificate of Confidentiality. The self-report data will be buttressed with other data.</description>
