    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out how doses of IPX066 required to help people with
      Parkinson's disease compare to those required for carbidopa-levodopa sustained-release
      tablets (also known as SinemetÂ® CR).

      Part 1 - This study is a multicenter open-label study. Subjects will be converted from their
      current treatment to IPX066 over a 6-week period. Up to 40 subjects will be enrolled in the
      study. Subjects will be entered into one of two cohorts. Approximately 24 subjects will
      enroll in Cohort 1 (non- Objective Parkinson's Disease Measurement (OPDM) subjects) and
      up-to 16 subjects at selected sites will enroll in Cohort 2 (OPDM/PK subjects). Along with
      the OPDM measurements, PK blood samples may also be collected from these subjects.

      Part 2 - Following the successful completion of Part 1 of the study, eligible subjects may
      participate in Part 2, a 6-month open-label extension study.
