    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to obtain safety, efficacy, and satisfaction data on the
      combination of topical Benzoyl Peroxide (BPO) 2.5% and the topical keratolytic agent
      Salicylic Acid (SA) 0.5% in the treatment of moderate to severe acne. Subjects with moderate
      or severe acne will be asked to apply the commercially available, over-the-counter products
      Foam Deep Cleanser (2.5% BPO), Foam Advanced Acne Treatment (2.5% BPO), and Foam
      Rejuvenating Toner (0.5% SA) daily for 12 weeks. No control group or reference treatment
      will be included.

      This open-label, multicenter, study is being conducted to obtain safety, efficacy, and
      satisfaction data on an Acne System (Benzoyl Peroxide 2.5%, Salicylic Acid 0.5%), which
      includes Foam Deep Cleanser (2.5% Benzoyl Peroxide) and Foam Advanced Acne Treatment (2.5%
      Benzoyl Peroxide) and Foam Rejuvenating Toner (0.5% Salicylic Acid), in the treatment of
      moderate to severe acne. Approximately 120 male or female subjects ages 12-35 years,
      inclusive, with moderate or severe acne as assessed by Investigator's Global Assessment
      (ISGA) and lesion counts are expected to be enrolled. Subjects will be instructed to use all
      3 study products as part of a complete acne treatment system; no reference therapy or
      control group will be included. Subjects will be instructed to apply Foam Deep Cleanser
      (2.5% Benzoyl Peroxide) and Foam Advnced Acne Treatment (2.5% Benzoyl Peroxide) to the face
      each morning and Foam Deep Cleanser (2.5% Benzoyl Peroxide) and Foam Rejuvenating Toner
      (0.5% Salicylic Acid) each evening over an application period of 12 weeks.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Capable of understanding and willing to provide signed and dated written voluntary

             than 50 facial inflammatory lesions (papules and pustules), excluding nasal lesions.
             B: A minimum of 20 but not more than 100 facial non-inflammatory lesions (open and
             closed comedones), excluding nasal lesions. C: No more than 3 facial nodular lesions
             (&lt;5mm), with no cystic lesions.

             least 1 year and/or it does not affect the face.)

          -  Use of topical antibiotics on the face within the past 2 weeks or of systemic
             antibiotics for acne treatment within the past 4 weeks.

          -  Concurrent use of medications known to be photosensitizers (eg, thiazides,
             tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones, phenothiazines, and sulfonamides) because of the
             possibility of augmented photosensitivity.

          -  Use of topical corticosteroids on the face within the past 2 weeks or systemic
             corticosteroids within the past 4 weeks. Use of inhaled, intra-articular, or

             estrogens, as described above, androgens, or anti-androgenic agents for more than 12
             consecutive weeks prior to study enrollment are allowed to enroll as long as they do
             not expect to change the dose or drug, or to discontinue use during the study and it

             facial procedures, and natural/herbal products within the past 4 weeks.

          -  Concomitant use of medications that are reported to exacerbate acne as these may
             impact efficacy assessments.

          -  Facial procedure (eg, blue light, chemical or laser peel, microdermabrasion)
             performed by aesthetician, beautician, physician, nurse, or other practitioner within
