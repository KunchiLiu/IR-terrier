  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A medicine that is FDA-approved for bone marrow stimulation (called Leukine) will be tested
      for its ability to be tolerated by Alzheimer's disease patients and potentially to improve
      their memory.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preliminary preclinical results demonstrated that GM-CSF (Granulocyte macrophage
      colony-stimulating factor, e.g. Leukine®/Sargramostim) rapidly reduced cerebral amyloid
      deposition and completely reversed memory deficits in transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer's
      Disease (AD). To assess the efficacy of GM-CSF in humans, the investigators performed a
      retrospective analysis of a cognition study of human patients undergoing hematopoietic cell
      transplantation for cancer and who garner cognitive impairments from the chemotherapy or
      irradiation. In the patients that received a colony-stimulating factor (CSF) to stimulate
      the bone marrow and recover immune system function, the investigators found that those who
      received GM-CSF (Leukine®/Sargramostim) plus G-CSF (Filigrastim) significantly improved in
      cognitive function as compared to those who received G-CSF alone. These findings combined
      with over two decades of accrued safety data using recombinant human GM-CSF,
      Leukine®/Sargramostim, in elderly leukopenic patients, suggested that Leukine® should be
      tested as a treatment to reverse cerebral amyloid pathology and cognitive impairment in AD.
