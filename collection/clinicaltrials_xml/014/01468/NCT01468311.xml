  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

        -  Hodgkin s lymphoma (HL) is a highly treatable cancer. However, if HL does not respond
           to chemotherapy or returns after chemotherapy, further treatments often are not
           successful.

        -  Some HL cells have a molecule called CD25 on the surface. Daclizumab is a drug that can
           detect CD25 on cells. In a treatment study for HL that did not respond to chemotherapy,
           daclizumab plus a radioactive atom called Yttrium 90 helped kill these HL cells.
           Researchers want to combine this 90Y daclizumab with high-dose chemotherapy and stem
           cell transplant. This treatment may be more effective than the daclizumab alone.

      Objectives:

      - To see if yttrium-90 daclizumab, high-dose chemotherapy, and stem cell transplants can
      treat HL that has not responded to earlier treatments.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have Hodgkin s lymphoma that has not responded to
      chemotherapy.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. They will also
           have blood and urine tests.

        -  Participants will have filgrastim and plerixafor to move stem cells into the blood.
           Stem cells will be collected with apheresis.

        -  Four weeks after stem cells are collected, participants will have the 90Y daclizumab
           and normal daclizumab to treat the HL. Chemotherapy will start 9 days after the first
           treatment.

        -  Most participants will have a second dose of 90Y daclizumab 6 weeks after the first
           dose.

        -  After each daclizumab treatment, participants will have several imaging studies of the
           chest and abdomen. Blood samples will also be collected.

        -  On the day after the last day of chemotherapy, participants will receive the stem cells
           collected earlier. Filgrastim injections will help stimulate stem cell growth....

      Background:

        -  Although Hodgkin s lymphoma (HL) is considered a highly treatable cancer, patients with
           relapsed and chemotherapy refractory disease represent a major therapeutic challenge.

        -  Only 30-65% of relapsed patients will achieve long-term disease free survival with the
           current standard of care high-dose chemotherapy with autologous hematopoietic stem cell
           transplant (ASCT).

        -  The malignant Reed-Sternberg cells of HL and the surrounding benign T cell infiltrates
           often express CD25, the high affinity interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R alpha).

        -  In study NCI-97-C-0110, we treated 30 patients with CD25-expressing relapsed or
           refractory HL with radioimmunotherapy (RIT) using (90)Y-labeled daclizumab (anti-CD25),
           and achieved a 63% response rate including 12 complete responses with few serious
           adverse events other than MDS in 4 patients.

        -  We propose integrating (90)Y-labeled daclizumab RIT into the induction regimen of ASCT
           in an effort to improve the response and disease-free survival in relapsed and
           refractory HL.

      Objectives:

      Phase I Primary Objectives:

        -  To assess the safety and adverse events associated with (90)Y-daclizumab (humanized
           anti-CD25) radioimmunotherapy (RIT) in combination with high-dose BEAM (carmustine,
           etoposide, cytarabine, [Ara-C, cytosine arabinoside] and melphalan) chemotherapy and
           autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (ASCT) in patients with relapsed or
           refractory Hodgkin s lymphoma (HL) with adverse prognostic factors.

        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose in mCi of (90)Y-daclizumab RIT in combination
           with high-dose BEAM chemotherapy and ASCT in patients with relapsed or refractory HL.

      Phase II Primary Objectives:

        -  To assess the frequency of the failure to engraft, myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS),
           secondary leukemia for the development of abnormal bone-marrow cytogenetics in
           refractory or relapsed HL patients treated with (90)Y-daclizumab RIT in combination
           with high-dose BEAM chemotherapy and ASCT.

        -  To estimate the response rate (the number of complete and partial responses) in
           patients with refractory or relapsed HD to (90)Y-daclizumab RIT administered in
           combination with high-dose BEAM chemotherapy and ASCT.

      Eligibility:

        -  Patients must have a confirmed diagnosis of relapsed or refractory HL with at least 10%
           of malignant Reed-Sternberg cells or infiltrating T-cells expressing CD25 (IL-2R
           alpha). A. Patients must have at least one of the following: (1) had an initial relapse
           less than 12 months after achieving a CR with primary chemotherapy for HL; (2) were
           Staged at III/IV at diagnosis; (3) exhibited chemotherapy resistant disease or (4) did
           not achieve a CR with cytoreductive chemotherapy prior to a planned transplant. B.
           Patient must have a lesion of at least 1.0 cm in its greatest diameter. C. Patients
           with lymphocyte predominant HL are excluded. D. Patients with pre-existing MDS or
           marrow cytogenic abnormalities will not be eligible to participate.

        -  Omission of cytotoxic chemotherapy or other systemic therapy of HL for at least 4 weeks
           prior to entry into the trial.

        -  No prior ASCT or allogeneic stem cell transplant.

      Design:

        -  A single institution non-randomized open-label phase I/II trial.

        -  Patients will undergo peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) mobilization with
           granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF, filgrastim) and Plerixafor followed by
           apheresis to collect a target dose of 4 x 106 CD34 cells/kg (minimal dose of 2 x 106
           CD34+ cells/kg) of actual body weight.

        -  Phase I study will be carried out using a standard 3 + 3 cohort dose-escalation design:

             -  Dose level 1: Patients will receive a single dose of 15 mCi 90Y-daclizumab RIT
                (day -15 2 days) followed by high-dose BEAM chemotherapy (beginning Day -6) and
                ASCT (Day 0).

             -  Dose levels 2-7: Patients will receive two doses of 90Y-daclizumab RIT 6 weeks
                apart (Day -56 and -15 2 days) followed by high-dose BEAM chemotherapy (beginning
                day -6) and ASCT (Day 0). The first dose of 90Y-daclizumab will be fixed at 15
                mCi. The second dose will be escalated in 15 mCi increments from 15 mCi until
                maximum tolerated dose, not to exceed 90 mCi.

        -  Phase II: All patients will receive two doses of 90Y-daclizumab (Day -56 and -15 2
           days) followed by high-dose BEAM chemotherapy (beginning Day -6) and ASCT (Day 0). The
           first dose of RIT will be 15 mCi. The second dose will be the maximum tolerated dose as
           determined from phase I.

           111In-daclizumab (5 mCi) imaging may be performed concurrently with each 90Ydaclizumab
           RIT and at day 100 after ASCT.
