    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of recombinant interleukin-12
      when given together with cetuximab and to see how well they work in treating patients with
      squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck that has come back, spread to another place in
      the body, or cannot be removed by surgery. Recombinant interleukin-12 may stimulate the
      white blood cells to kill tumor cells. Monoclonal antibodies, such as cetuximab, may
      interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving recombinant
      interleukin-12 together with cetuximab may kill more tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To find a safe and tolerable interleukin (IL)-12 (recombinant interleukin-12) dose for
      use in combination with cetuximab in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and
      neck. (Phase I) II. To determine the response rate to the combination of IL-12 and
      cetuximab. (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To characterize the immunologic effects of IL-12 when administered in combination with
      cetuximab.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of recombinant IL-12 followed by a phase
      II study.

      Patients receive cetuximab intravenously (IV) over 1-2 hours on day 1 and recombinant
      interleukin-12 subcutaneously (SC) on days 2 and 5 beginning in course 2. Treatment repeats
      every 2 weeks for 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Patients achieving clinical response or stable disease may continue with therapy until
      disease progression.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 1 year.
