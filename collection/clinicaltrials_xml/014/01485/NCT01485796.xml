    <description>In Study Epoch 1 PIDD patients that are already on intravenous treatment or subcutaneous treatment will be enrolled and treated with IGI, 10% and rHuPH20 subcutaneously, with a short dose/interval ramp-up (Epoch 1) consisting of one 1-week dose and interval and one 2-week dose and interval. The ramp-up (Epoch 1) is followed by Epoch 2 which consists of approximately 6 months (24 weeks) of IGI, 10% and rHuPH20 treatment. For subjects pretreated intravenously (IV), this treatment will occur every 3 or 4 weeks (at a 3-week or 4-week dose, respectively), depending on the subject´s previous IV dosing schedule. For subjects pretreated subcutaneously (SC), treatment will also occur every 3 or 4 weeks (at a 3-week or 4-week dose, respectively), at the discretion of the investigator and subject.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject must have a documented diagnosis of a form of primary humoral
             immunodeficiency involving a defect in antibody formation and requiring gammaglobulin
             replacement, as defined according to the IUIS Scientific Committee 2009 and by
             diagnostic criteria according to Conley et al. The diagnosis must be reviewed by the

          -  Subject has been receiving a consistent dose of immunoglobulin G (IgG) with a
             non-Baxter product (Gammunex administered IV, Hizentra, or Privigen), administered in
             compliance with the respective product information, for a period of at least 3 months
             prior to screening. The average minimum pre-study dose over that interval was
             equivalent to 300 mg/kg BW/4 weeks and a maximum dose equivalent to 600 mg/kg BW/4
             weeks at a dosing frequency as follows:

               -  For IV treatment prior to the study: at mean intervals of 3 or 4 weeks (+/- 3
                  days) or

               -  For SC treatment prior to the study: at mean intervals of approximately 1 or 2
                  weeks (+/- 2 days).

          -  Subject has a serum trough level of IgG &gt; 5 g/L at screening.

          -  Subject has not had a serious bacterial infection within the 3 months prior to
             screening.

          -  If female of childbearing potential, subject presents with a negative pregnancy test
             and agrees to employ adequate birth control measures for the duration of the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has a known history of or is positive at screening for one or more of the
             following: hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for
             hepatitis C virus (HCV), PCR for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) Type 1/2.

          -  Abnormal laboratory values at screening meeting any one of the following criteria
             (abnormal tests may be repeated once to determine if they are persistent):

               -  Persistent alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate amino transferase (AST)
