    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter, sequential, 5-arm, phase 1 study of oral IXAZOMIB
      designed to assess drug-drug interaction with ketoconazole (Arm 1), the relative
      bioavailability of 2 capsule formulations of IXAZOMIB (Arm 2), food effect (Arm 3),
      drug-drug interaction with rifampin (Arm 4), and drug-drug interaction with clarithromycin
      (Arm 5) in patients with advanced nonhematologic malignancies or lymphoma.

    <description>Applicable to all Arms:
After completion of Cycle 1, patients receive a 4.0- mg dose of IXAZOMIB Capsule B formulation on Days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day schedule; however, starting with Cycle 4 and beyond patients will have the option of escalating to the 5.3-mg dose at the discretion of the investigator and the Millennium clinician.
The maximum duration of treatment is 12 months after completion of Cycle 1 (13 months in total) unless it is determined that a patient would derive benefit from continued therapy beyond 12 cycles.</description>
