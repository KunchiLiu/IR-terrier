  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Drugs such as amisulpride, known as antipsychotic drugs, are used to treat troublesome and
      distressing symptoms in older people. Although these drugs can be beneficial, they are
      associated with side effects, particularly in patients with dementia and schizophrenia- like
      illness. There is an urgent clinical need to understand why this is the case, to guide
      treatment strategies.

      This study aims to utilise brain imaging techniques that measure the action of antipsychotic
      drugs in the brain to explore the causes of this susceptibility in older people with
      dementia and schizophrenia-like illness, and translate these findings into direct patient
      benefit.

      The aim of the study is to investigate and compare the relationship between the action of
      amisulpride at brain sites and clinical response (symptom reduction and side effect profile)
      during the first 10 weeks of amisulpride treatment in two patient groups - Alzheimer's
      disease and schizophrenia-like illness. Imaging data will be combined with data on drug
      dosage, levels of drug in the bloodstream and clinical response (symptom reduction and motor
      side effects) during dose titration.

      Non-linear mixed effect modelling will be used to establish the minimum clinically effective
      dose of amisulpride, optimum dose range and impact of variability and covariates on
      exposure-response relationships in the 2 patient groups

      This information will be used make predictions about amisulpride prescribing of other
      antipsychotic drugs to the two patient groups.
