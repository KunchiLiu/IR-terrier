      The purpose of this study is to test a novel and tolerable office-based treatment method,
      sclerotherapy with sodium tetradecyl sulfate, for recurrent epistaxis (nosebleeds) related
      to Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT) disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ninety percent of patients who suffer from Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT)
      experience epistaxis which can range from mild to recurrent, severe, life threatening
      episodes. Current methods to treat significant epistaxis have limitations, namely the need
      for general anesthesia and repeated treatments. The objective of this study is to test a
      novel and tolerable office-based treatment method, sclerotherapy with sodium tetradecyl
      sulfate (STS), for recurrent epistaxis related to HHT.

      Sclerotherapy is the treatment of vascular lesions by injection with an agent which causes
      thickening of the vessel wall, obstruction of blood flow, clot formation and collapse of the
      lesion. Sclerotherapy is an established treatment modality for vascular malformations in the
      skin, GI tract, genitourinary tract and has been used for lesions in various sites in the
      head and neck. STS is an anion surfactant (detergent) that is commonly used for
      sclerotherapy. There are case reports in the literature describing sclerotherapy treatments
      for epistaxis related to HHT using other agents, but these case reports did not lead to
      prospective studies. We have performed a pilot study to analyze the tolerability and
      effectiveness of sclerotherapy with STS in a series of patients with recurrent epistaxis
      related to HHT. In our series, the treatment was found to be well tolerated and effective,
      based on patient administered questionnaire and review of clinical data. No complications
      related to the procedure were noted. Further prospective studies would help elucidate the
      role of sclerotherapy with STS in the treatment algorithm for recurrent epistaxis related to
      HHT.

      Our goal is to conduct a prospective, randomized-controlled trial to test the efficacy and
      tolerability of sclerotherapy using STS in the treatment of recurrent epistaxis due to HHT.
      A modified crossover design will be utilized with the intervention group receiving
      sclerotherapy, plus any additional, previously utilized standard treatment methods needed to
      control epistaxis. The control group will receive their current standard treatment methods,
      followed by delayed intervention with sclerotherapy. The primary outcomes will be frequency
      and severity of epistaxis. Secondary endpoints will be hemoglobin level, tolerability of
      treatment, additional treatment requirements, and quality of life.

    <description>The primary outcome measure will be frequency and severity of epistaxis as measured by the Epistaxis Severity Score (ESS). The ESS, a recently developed grading system for epistaxis severity, has been recommended for comparison of existing and new therapies for epistaxis. The ESS was reported to be an accurate, reproducible, validated objective measure of epistaxis severity. The ESS will be measured at baseline in both treatment groups, and at the end of the first and second periods. Monthly diaries will be kept to aid in accuracy of reporting the ESS.</description>

    <description>This group will receive, on the first period of the study, sclerotherapy with STS to any visible lesions in the nose at the outset, followed by any needed standard treatments for breakthrough epistaxis. On the second period of the study this group will continue with standard treatments that they had been receiving for epistaxis prior to the study. Standard treatment may include nasal packing, cauterization, laser treatments, microdebrider, and septodermoplasty.
Individual injection amounts vary between lesions, patients and treatment sessions. No more than 3 ml of solution is used in each session.</description>

    <description>The standard treatment group will continue their pre-study &quot;standard treatment&quot; methods to treat epistaxis on the first period of the study, followed by intervention with sclerotherapy on the second period of the study, plus any additionally needed standard treatments for breakthrough epistaxis. Standard treatment may include nasal packing, cauterization, laser treatments, microdebrider, septodermoplasty, and any other treatments that the patient reports using that are accepted as standard of care.
Sodium tetradecyl sulfate (STS) is injected into the nasal lesions as a solution prepared by foaming STS with air at a 4:1 ratio. Individual injection amounts vary between lesions, patients and treatment sessions. No more than a total of 3 ml of solution is used in each session. Multiple lesions can be treated bilaterally, each with a separate injection.</description>

    <description>3% Sodium tetradecyl sulfate (STS) is mixed with air at a ratio of 4 parts air to 1 part STS for injection into the affected vessels in the nose. Topical anesthetic is applied to the nasal mucosa prior to injections. Once the mixture is ready for injection, the needle is placed into the vessel, in a submucosal fashion, penetrating 1-2 mm, and very small quantities of foam are injected The amount of foam injected into each lesion varies between 0.1 cc to 0.25 cc. Individual injection amounts vary between lesions, patients and treatment sessions. No more than a total of 3 ml of solution is used in each session. During each session, several lesions can be treated, but the total amount of STS used does not exceed 3 cc.</description>
