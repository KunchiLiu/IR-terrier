  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out whether swallowing has an effect on the degree of
      urinary urgency and on the amplitude of detrusor contraction during filling cystometry in
      patients with detrusor overactivity (DO).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Consecutive patients with DO will be included in this study. During urodynamics, the
      amplitude of the waves of DO will be documented and compared. At the beginning of the 2nd
      wave, patients will be asked to perform 5 repetitive swallows. Following each wave, patients
      will be asked to grade the severity of the urgency by a visual analogue scale (VAS).
