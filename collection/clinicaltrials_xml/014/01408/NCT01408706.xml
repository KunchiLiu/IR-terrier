      The purpose of this study is to compare reproducibility of the device position and location
      of the prostate rectum interface between two immobilization devices for radiation therapy of
      prostate carcinoma.

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Calculated dose of radiation to the rectum of the two immobilization devices will be measured and documented after the radiation treatment plan has been approved.</measure>
