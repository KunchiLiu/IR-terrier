  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the potential of high doses of rifampin (RIF) to
      shorten treatment for tuberculosis (TB) without causing more adverse events. The hypotheses
      are that higher doses of RIF will result in higher blood concentrations of RIF; higher blood
      concentrations will result in tuberculosis bugs being killed more quickly; and, both of
      these will happen without more adverse events. Patients with active, infectious,
      drug-susceptible TB who agree to participate will be randomly assigned to 1 of 3 doses of
      RIF. All patients will also receive standard doses of regular (3) companion drugs for 2
      months of daily, supervised therapy. The study will assess the following among the 3 study
      arms (oral doses of RIF 10, 15 &amp; 20 mg/kg/day) during the initial 8 weeks of treatment: 1)
      the amount of RIF in the blood after at least 14 days of treatment; 2) the difference in the
      number of tuberculosis bugs killed; 3) the frequency of adverse events.

      This is a Phase II, multi-site, dose-ranging trial comparing 3 doses of RIF in a multidrug
      regimen for treatment of smear-positive, pulmonary TB. The intervention phase of this
      prospective, randomized, double-blinded trial will last 8 weeks, the duration of the
      standard &quot;intensive&quot; phase for short-course chemotherapy for TB. During that time, subjects
      will receive the following companion drugs: isoniazid (INH, 5 mg/kg/day), ethambutol (EMB,
      20 mg/kg/day), and pyrazinamide (PZA, 25 mg/kg/day), pyridoxine (50 mg), the standard doses
      used in treatment. Subjects will also be randomized to receive one of the following
      weight-based doses of the study drug, rifampin (RIF): 10 mg/kg/day (standard dose, control),
      15 mg/kg/day (intervention 1), 20 mg/kg/day (intervention 2). All patients will receive at
      least standard dose of RIF, the efficacy of which in multidrug-treatment for TB is well
      established. Placebo will be used to control only the additional RIF capsules provided in
      the intervention arms. Subjects, clinicians, and laboratory staff will be blinded to study
      arm. All patients in the same weight band will receive the same total number of tablets
      (fixed-dose combination plus RIF and/or placebo). Blinding is essential to reduce the
      probability of biased reporting of adverse events.

      After randomization, other covariates that may result in heterogeneity within strata (e.g.,
      presence of cavitation, HIV serostatus), will be adjusted for in analyses. It is important
      to maintain the ability to measure the effect (if any) of these potential characteristics on
      treatment outcome. If we were to stratify on these characteristics, we could not estimate
      their confounding (or interaction) effect. All doses will be delivered orally and fully
      supervised. All patients will receive weight-based doses of fixed-dose combinations
      according to package inserts. This will be supplemented by active RIF capsules or placebos,
      or both, according to weight and treatment arm. They will also all receive 50 mg of
      pyridoxine to prevent peripheral neuropathy, a common side effect of INH.
