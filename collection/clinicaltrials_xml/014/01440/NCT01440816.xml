    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well giving interleukin-12 gene and in vivo
      electroporation-mediated plasmid DNA vaccine therapy works in treating patients with Merkel
      cell cancer. Placing the gene for interleukin-12 into Merkel cells may help the body build
      an effective defense to kill tumor cells

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To measure the effect of intratumoral injection of IL-12 plasmid (pIL-12) (interleukin-12
      gene) followed by in vivo electroporation (EP) (electroporation-mediated plasmid DNA vaccine
      therapy) on the local expression of interleukin-12 (IL-12) in the tumor microenvironment in
      patients with Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the safety of intratumoral pIL-12 injection and in vivo EP in MCC. II. To
      assess the clinical efficacy of this treatment approach in MCC. III. To assess the
      immunologic changes resulting from this treatment approach.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive interleukin-12 gene intratumorally (IT) and undergo electrical discharge
      around the tumor site for electroporation-mediated plasmid DNA vaccine therapy on days 1, 5,
      and 8. Patients with unresectable disease may receive a second course of treatment in week
      7. Patients with localized disease proceed to definitive treatment as determined by the
      treating physician starting 2-4 weeks after the first injection.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at weeks 4-8 (for patients who
      received definitive treatment) or 12 (for patients with unresectable disease) and then
      annually for up to 5 years.

    <description>Patients who experience at least 2-fold increase in the expression of IL-12 protein will be counted as having a successful outcome.

The proportion of successful outcomes in this population will be reported with 90% Wilson (score) binomial confidence interval.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have biopsy-confirmed Merkel cell carcinoma

          -  Patients must have at least one injectable lesion, defined as an easily palpable
             superficial lesion (cutaneous, subcutaneous or lymph nodal metastasis) that can be
             accurately localized, stabilized by palpation, and is superficial enough to enable
             intratumoral injection and electroporation; the injectable lesion must not be in
             close proximity to another tissue (e.g. nerve, bone) that could put patient safety at
             risk

             pre-treatment fine needle aspiration (FNA) plus biopsy (if indicated) AND the
             post-treatment FNA plus biopsy (or surgery) of at least one injected lesion (FNA is
             essential to determine the primary endpoint of the study); NOTE: The pre-treatment
             biopsy will be obtained from a superficial not-to-be-injected lesion; the
             post-treatment biopsy of an injected lesion will be obviated if definitive surgical
             resection is planned

          -  The effects of this treatment approach on the developing human fetus are unknown; for
             this reason, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate
             contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to
             study entry and for the duration of study participation; should a woman become
             pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should
             inform her treating physician immediately

          -  Patients must have the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written
             informed consent document

          -  Both men and women, and members of all races and ethnic groups are eligible for this
             trial

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have had prior chemotherapy, investigational therapy or a major surgical
             procedure within 4 weeks or radiotherapy within 2 weeks prior to first day of
             treatment

          -  Patients must not be receiving concurrently any other anti-cancer treatment
             (including topical agents such as imiquimod) or investigational agents, which could
             potentially interfere with the study treatment and/or study endpoints

          -  Patients with active untreated brain metastases will be excluded

          -  Pregnant or breast feeding women are excluded because effects of this treatment on
             the fetus or passage through milk are unknown

          -  Patients with electronic pacemakers or defibrillators or those with a history of life
             threatening cardiac arrhythmia or uncontrolled seizure disorder are excluded

          -  Use of any immunosuppressive treatments including corticosteroids, cyclosporine,
             mycophenolate mofetil et cetera, within 4 weeks prior to Day 1 of treatment will not
             be allowed; NOTE: Patients on topical or physiologic doses (for hormone-replacement
             therapy) of corticosteroids will be allowed

          -  Patients, who are judged to be immunosuppressed due to uncontrolled human
             immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, severe uncontrolled diabetes, concurrent
             hematological malignancy, or other comorbidities, will be excluded

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             serious infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris,
             serious autoimmune conditions or psychiatric illness/social situations that would
             limit compliance with study requirements

          -  Patients receiving concurrent therapeutic-dose anticoagulation will be excluded
