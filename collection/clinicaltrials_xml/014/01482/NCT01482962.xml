  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 3, randomized, 2-arm, open-label, international trial evaluating alisertib
      compared with single-agent treatment, as selected by the investigator from the offered
      options of pralatrexate or gemcitabine or romidepsin, in patients with relapsed or
      refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL). Note: romidepsin will not be used as a
      single-agent comparator in countries that do not permit its use at this time.
