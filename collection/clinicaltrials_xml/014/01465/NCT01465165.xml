  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several lines of evidence support the existence of an underlying abnormality in brain energy
      metabolism may play a key role in the biology of mood disorders. The current study utilizes
      two distinct but complementary imaging techniques, FDG PET and multinuclear MRS, to better
      understand the nature of these metabolic abnormalities in major depressive disorder (MDD).
      The investigators hypothesize that individuals with depression will have increased metabolic
      activity as measured by PET in certain brain regions involved in mood regulation, but that
      this metabolic activity will be inefficient based on MRS findings. For this study, the
      investigators will study 10 medication-free, currently depressed participants with recurrent
      MDD, 10 depressed participants with recurrent MDD currently taking antidepressant
      medication, and up to 20 healthy control participants matched to depressed participants for
      age and gender. Depressed and healthy participants will each undergo one PET scan and one
      MRS scanning session.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Meet DSM-IV TR criteria for MDD, Recurrent

          -  Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score &gt; 18

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any coexisting psychiatric illness other than generalized anxiety disorder, panic
             disorder, or social/specific phobias

          -  Any history of substance dependence

          -  Substance abuse within the past 6 months

          -  Significant risk of suicide, as defined by score &gt;4 on item 10 of the MADRS or in the
             clinical judgment of the study physician

          -  Any significant medical or neurological condition which is likely to impact the
             central nervous system and/or affect the results of MRS or PET imaging

          -  For the subset of unmedicated MDD patients, any psychotropic medications within 4
             weeks prior to scanning. For the subgroup of medicated patients, they may be taking a
             stable dose (i.e., same dose for at least 4 weeks at the time of scanning) of
             standard antidepressant medications, but may not be taking any other psychotropic
             medication.

          -  Inability to give informed consent

          -  Contraindication to MRI (e.g., pacemaker, ferromagnetic implants in the body)
