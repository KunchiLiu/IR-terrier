  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of TSC when dosed concomitantly
      with the standard of care (radiation therapy and temozolomide) for newly diagnosed
      glioblastoma in adults. All patients will receive TSC in the study. The objective of the
      study is to evaluate the effect of TSC on survival and tumor response in patients with GBM
      while establishing an acceptable patient risk profile.

  <detailed_description>

      The overall objectives of this Phase 1/2 clinical study in newly diagnosed GBM patients are
      to evaluate the safety and tolerability, efficacy, PK profile, PFS/time to disease
      progression, QoL, and overall survival in adults when TSC is added to the standard of care
      regimen of radiation therapy and temozolomide. All patients will receive TSC in this study.
      The primary objective of the Phase 1 portion of the study is to evaluate the safety (DLT
      rate) and to define the dosing regimen of TSC for the larger Phase 2 study. The primary
      clinical endpoint is overall survival at 24 months and patients will be followed for up to 3
      years.
