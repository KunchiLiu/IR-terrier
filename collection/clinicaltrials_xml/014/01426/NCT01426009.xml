    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine steady-state efficacy and dose response profile
      and to assess safety and pharmacokinetic profile of nebulized EP-101(SUN101) after 7-day
      dosing using an investigational high efficiency nebulizer (eFlow®) compared with placebo and
      two active comparators in patients with moderate to severe Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary
      Disease (COPD).

    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, four-period,
      incomplete block design cross-over study using EP-101(SUN101) and open-label active controls
      (tiotropium bromide and ipratropium bromide). The study population will consist of subjects
      of 40-75 years of age with moderate to severe COPD. Approximately 133 subjects diagnosed
      with moderate to severe COPD will be enrolled in order to achieve minimum 105 subjects
      completing the study.

      Following a run-in phase, each subject will be randomly assigned to one of 7 treatment
      sequences, with each sequence comprised of four 7-day Treatment Periods. There will be a
      washout period of 7 days between each Treatment Period. Study visits will be conducted on
      Days 1 and 7 of each Treatment Period, with an overnight stay required in the clinic during
      these visits. A Final Study Visit will be conducted 7 days following the last study
      treatment.

      During each Treatment Period, study treatments will be administered once daily (QD), except
      for ipratropium inhalation solution, which will be administered three times daily (TID).
      EP-101 (SUN101)active and placebo treatments will be administered using an investigational
      high-efficiency eFlow® nebulizer. Tiotropium bromide (Spiriva®) will be administered in an
      open-label manner via Handihaler® dry-powder inhaler (DPI). Ipratropium bromide inhalation
      solution will be administered in an open-label manner via general purpose nebulizer.

      This study was previously posted by Elevation Pharmaceuticals, Inc. On September 5, 2012,
      Elevation was acquired by merger with Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc. (&quot;Sunovion&quot;), which
      resulted in Elevation becoming a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Sunovion. In conjunction
      with this acquisition, the name of Elevation has been changed to Sunovion Respiratory
      Development Inc.
