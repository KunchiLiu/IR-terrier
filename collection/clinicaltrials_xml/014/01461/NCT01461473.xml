    <textblock>
      STAGE I of the COMET study is to develop an Electronic Network Informatics Infrastructure
      that will prospectively enable access to and the sharing of clinical and research data.

      STAGE II: This is a Comparative Effectiveness Trial (CET) evaluating positive airway
      pressure (PAP) vs. oral appliance (OA) therapy in improving hypertension and abnormalities
      in cardiovascular function in overweight/obese patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).
      Data collected during the STAGE II study will be incorporated in Part 3 of the STAGE I
      study.

      STAGE III of the COMET study is completion of data analysis and preparation of the
      electronic network informatics infrastructure for use beyond the four Clinical Centers to
      interested CTSA institutions. We will also explore expanding ontologies, and the use of
      federated database methodology.

      STAGE I, Part 1: We plan to extract limited access data sets from an existing research
      database (prior research patients' data from APPLES research project where patients
      consented to provide a limited accesses data set to the public domain as required by grants
      funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute [NHLBI], PI: Kushida) and a dummy
      database with prepared test data (no real patient data) to evaluate and refine the initial
      iterations of the informatics infrastructure being created via an agile evolutionary
      development process (see COMET Project Map in Section 16).

      STAGE I, Part 2: We would like to expand the functionality of the informatics infrastructure
      by testing its ability to incorporate research data collected from an electronic
      questionnaire, the Alliance Sleep Questionnaire (ASQ). Paper ASQ collection has been
      approved by the Stanford Institutional Review Board (IRB) and pilot collection successfully
      concluded in September 2010. We will enable data collection using an electronic version of
      ASQ in order to use these data to evaluate and refine the iterations for the informatics
      infrastructure. STAGE I, Part 3: We will expand the functionality of the informatics
      infrastructure by testing its ability to incorporate live (ongoing) longitudinal data
      collected from multiple forms and data sources obtained during the STAGE II study. The
      addition of these data will allow the COMET Steering Committee to create use cases with a
      greater diversity of data content. The STAGE II data will be used to evaluate and refine the
      iterations for the expanded informatics infrastructure. STAGE I, Part 4: Part 4 is designed
      to expand the collection of data beyond individual research studies, tapping into
      University-wide systems (e.g., Stride) to link longitudinal data collected during research
      studies to longitudinal data collected during clinical visits. Only de-identified data will
      be shared with the global network, and only the local site will hold the code book that will
      translate the Global ID to the Participant ID. All Health Insurance Portability and
      Accountability Act (HIPAA) regulations will be considered.

      STAGE II: This stage is comprised of the multicenter, randomized, parallel group,
      comparative effectiveness trial to compare positive airway pressure (PAP) vs. oral appliance
      (OA) therapy in improving hypertension and abnormalities in cardiovascular function in
      overweight/obese patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Data collected during the
      STAGE II study will be incorporated in Part 3 of the STAGE I study. This comparative
      effectiveness trial will be conducted at 4 clinical centers, and the data collected during
      this trial will be used to test the electronic network informatics infrastructure.

      Stage II CET Specific Aims:

        -  To evaluate and compare the effect of positive airway pressure and oral appliance
           therapy on 24-hour blood pressure and vascular structure and function associated with
           obstructive sleep apnea in a primarily female, overweight/obese hypertensive
           population.

        -  To evaluate and compare the effect of positive airway pressure and oral appliance
           therapy on sleep-disordered breathing, sleepiness, mood, and quality of life.

        -  To compare the cost-effectiveness of positive airway pressure and oral appliance as
           obstructive sleep apnea treatments.

        -  To explore cardiovascular biomarkers before and after treatment and to identify genetic
           polymorphisms which may predict treatment response.

      STAGE III: This stage is comprised of completion of data analysis and preparation of the
      electronic network informatics infrastructure for deployment beyond the four Clinical
      Centers to interested Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSA) institutions. We will
      also explore expanding the ontologies beyond a sleep-related ontology to other medical
      ontologies, and the use of federated database methodology.

          -  BMI &gt; = 25.0 kg/m2.

          -  A diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea based upon medical history and apnea- hypopnea

             alternative treatments.

          -  Clinically significant acute or chronic disease that is not well controlled or could
             affect ability to complete or comply with study procedures, in the opinion of the

          -  Current or planned participation in another research study.
