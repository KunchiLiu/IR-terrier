  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall purpose is to determine research based 'next-steps' for outpatients with major
      depressive disorder who have not had satisfactory outcomes to standard 'first-step'
      treatments. The primary objective is to compare the acute (up to 12 weeks) treatment
      effectiveness of augmenting an antidepressant with aripiprazole or with bupropion-SR vs.
      switching treatment to bupropion-SR monotherapy on symptom remission in Veterans with Major
      Depressive Disorder (MDD) who have not achieved optimal response after an adequate trial on
      antidepressant (SSRI or SNRI or mirtazapine) monotherapy. The secondary objectives are to
      compare the acute (up to 12 weeks) and long term (up to 36 weeks) efficacy, safety, effects
      on functioning, suicidality, quality of life, anxiety and other associated symptoms, costs
      and cost-effectiveness of each of the three treatments.

      The overall aim of VAST-D is to enhance treatment outcomes for representative outpatients
      diagnosed with nonpsychotic major depressive disorder (MDD) and treated in primary or
      psychiatric VA care settings. In particular, VAST-D is designed to determine the comparative
      effectiveness of different treatment options for participants with MDD who fail to have a
      satisfactory outcome to treatment with their initial antidepressants.

      These options may be conceptualized as representing two overall treatment strategies: 1)
      Medication Switch - switching from the initial antidepressant to another antidepressant
      medication, specifically bupropion-SR and 2) Medication Augmentation - augmenting the
      initial antidepressant with a second antidepressant, specifically bupropion-SR or a second
      generation antipsychotic, specifically aripiprazole. VAST-D's primary goal is to determine
      which of these 3 treatment strategies is most likely to lead to remission. Other key
      objectives include comparisons of response, time to remission, time to response, relapse,
      anxiety symptoms, suicidal ideation and behaviors, side effects, tolerability, quality of
      life, health related costs and satisfaction with participation in the study.

      VAST-D will enroll 1518 total patients of both genders and all ethnic/racial and
      socioeconomic backgrounds. All patients will meet DSM-IV-TR criteria for nonpsychotic MDD.
      The diagnostic criteria for eligibility will be established by clinical interview
      supplemented with the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Final determination for
      eligibility will be made by the study clinician. Only participants with a suboptimal outcome
      to a well documented, adequately delivered (dose and duration), trial with selective
      serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) or a serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor
      (SNRI) or mirtazapine will be eligible for the study. Failure to achieve an adequate outcome
      will be ascertained by a QIDS-C16 &gt;= 16 (considered severe depression) after at least 6
      weeks of treatment or &gt;= 11 (considered moderately severe depression) after at least 8 weeks
      of treatment. Otherwise, the inclusion criteria are broad and the exclusion criteria are
      few; participants with most comorbid general medical or psychiatric disorders are generally
      included to provide a broadly representative sample.

      Participants will be randomized (1:1:1 ratio) to switch to bupropion-SR alone (n=506),
      current antidepressant plus bupropion-SR (n=506), or current antidepressant plus
      aripiprazole (n=506). Treatment will be guided by clinician-rated symptom measures (the
      PHQ-9) and global side effects measures (the Frequency, Intensity, and Burden of Side
      Effects Rating or FIBSER) obtained at each treatment visit. Acute treatment visits will
      occur at baseline and at weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 to ensure delivery of appropriate
      and yet vigorous and tolerable pharmacotherapy. Participants who tolerate the acute
      treatment and achieve adequate response at 12 weeks will enter the 24-week Continuation
      Treatment phase, during which the initial treatment will continue and visits will occur
      every four weeks subsequently until patients have been followed for 36 weeks
      post-randomization. The QIDS-C16 will be administered at baseline and at each follow-up
      visit by an independent evaluator (who will be blinded to treatment assignment) to measure
      symptoms of depression for the study outcomes of remission, response and relapse. Neither
      the participant nor the treating clinician will be blinded to treatment.

      Primary hypotheses:

      Primary hypothesis 1.a: Remission rate from major depressive disorder will be higher in
      patients whose treatment is augmented with bupropion-SR (antidepressant + bupropion-SR)
      compared to those switched to bupropion-SR monotherapy.

      Primary Hypothesis 1.b: Remission rate from major depressive disorder will be higher in
      patients whose treatment is augmented with aripiprazole (antidepressant + aripiprazole)
      compared to those switched to bupropion-SR monotherapy.

      Secondary hypotheses:

      Secondary Hypothesis 2.a: Remission rate will be greater in patients whose treatment is
      augmented with bupropion-SR (antidepressant + bupropion-SR) than in those augmented with
      aripiprazole (antidepressant + aripiprazole).

      Secondary Hypothesis 2.b: Relapse rate (within 36 weeks of the initiation of treatment) will
      be lower in patients whose antidepressant is augmented with bupropion-SR (antidepressant +
      bupropion-SR) than in those whose antidepressant is switched to bupropion-SR monotherapy.

      Secondary Hypothesis 2.c: Relapse rate (within 36 weeks of the initiation of treatment) will
      be lower in patients whose treatment is augmented with aripiprazole (antidepressant +
      aripiprazole) vs. those switched to bupropion-SR monotherapy.

      Secondary Hypothesis 2.d: Relapse rate (within 36 weeks of the initiation of treatment) will
      be lower in patients whose treatment is augmented with bupropion-SR (antidepressant +
      bupropion-SR) than in patients whose treatment was augmented with aripiprazole
      (antidepressant + aripiprazole).

      Secondary Hypothesis 2.e: The proportion of patients who develop akathisia, other
      akathisia-like side effects (e.g., tremor, irritability, motor restlessness) and
      extrapyramidal side effects will be greater in the patients whose antidepressant treatment
      is augmented with aripiprazole (antidepressant + aripiprazole) compared to patients whose
      treatment is augmented with bupropion-SR (antidepressant + bupropion-SR), or switched to
      bupropion-SR monotherapy.

      Secondary Hypothesis 2.f: The relative costs (direct and indirect) of augmenting an
      antidepressant with aripiprazole (antidepressant + aripiprazole) will be greater than the
      costs of antidepressant augmentation with bupropion-SR (antidepressant + bupropion-SR), and
      the costs of antidepressant augmentation with bupropion-SR (antidepressant + bupropion-SR)
      will be greater than the costs of switching to bupropion-SR monotherapy, and augmentation
      and monotherapy with bupropion-SR will be more cost-effective than aripiprazole
      augmentation.
