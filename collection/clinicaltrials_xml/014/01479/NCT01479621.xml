    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo- and open-label active controlled,
      parallel-group, multicenter, dose ranging study in male or female subjects ages 12 years and
      older with persistent asthma who are uncontrolled on non-steroidal therapy. The primary
      objective of this study is to evaluate the dose response, efficacy and safety of 4 different
      doses of fluticasone propionate (dose 1, dose 2, dose 3, and dose 4) delivered as
      Fluticasone Propionate DPI (Dry Powder Inhaler) when administered twice daily.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Written informed consent/assent signed and dated by the subject and/or parent /legal
             guardian before conducting any study related procedure.

          2. Male or female 12 years and older, as of the Screening Visit. Male or female 18 years
             and older, as of the Screening Visit, in countries where local regulations or the
             regulatory status of study medication permit enrollment of adults only.

          3. General good health, and free of any concomitant conditions or treatment that could
             interfere with study conduct, influence the interpretation of study
             observations/results, or put the subject at increased risk during the study.

          4. Asthma Diagnosis: Asthma as defined by the National Institutes of Health (NIH).

          5. Severity of Disease: A best forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) of 40%-85%
             of the predicted normal value during the Screening Visit. NHANES III predicted values
             will be used for subjects aged ≥12 years and adjustments to predicted values will be
             made for African American subjects.

          6. Reversibility of Disease: Demonstrated a ≥15% reversibility of FEV1 within 30 minutes
             following 2 inhalations of albuterol/salbutamol inhalation aerosol (if required,
             spacers are permitted for reversibility testing only) at the Screening Visit. If a
             subject fails to demonstrate an increase in FEV1 ≥15%, then the subject is not
             eligible for the study and will not be allowed to re-screen.

          7. Current Asthma Therapy: Subjects must be on a short-acting β2-agonist alone or a
             non-corticosteroid maintenance medication (with or without a short-acting β2-agonist)
             for ≥ 3 months preceding the Screening Visit. Subjects must not have used an inhaled
             corticosteroid for at least 6 weeks preceding the Screening Visit.

             Exception: Based upon the investigator's judgment that there is no inherent harm in
             changing the subject's current ICS therapy and the subject provides consent, subjects
             on low dose ICS (100mcg Fp BID or equivalent) may be switched to a short-acting β2
             agonist alone at a Pre-screening Visit. The subject will be required to return to the
             clinic to complete the Screening Visit once the 2-week washout period has been
             completed.

          8. Short-Acting β2-Agonists: All subjects must be able to replace their current
             short-acting β2-agonists with albuterol/salbutamol inhalation aerosol at the
             Screening Visit for use as needed for the duration of the study. The use of spacer
             devices with the metered dose inhaler (MDI) will not be allowed during the study with
             exception of its use during reversibility testing at the Screening Visit. Nebulized
             albuterol/salbutamol will not be allowed at any time during the study. Subjects must
             be able to withhold all inhaled short-acting beta sympathomimetic bronchodilators for
             at least 6 hours prior to all study visits.

          9. If female, is currently not pregnant, breast feeding, or attempting to become
             pregnant, has a negative serum pregnancy test, and is of

               1. Non-childbearing potential, defined as:

                    -  Surgically sterile (tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, or
                       hysterectomy) or

                    -  Congenital sterility or

                    -  Diagnosed as infertile and not undergoing treatment to reverse infertility
                       or is of

               2. Child-bearing potential, willing to commit to using a consistent and acceptable

                    -  Systemic contraception used for &gt; or = 1 month prior to screening,
                       including birth control pills, transdermal patch (Ortho Evra®), vaginal
                       ring (NuvaRing®), levonorgesterel (Norplant®), or injectable progesterone
                       (Depo-Provera®) or

                    -  Double barrier methods (condoms, cervical cap, diaphragm, and vaginal
                       contraceptive film with spermicide) or

             participation, and, as judged by the investigator, capable of giving informed
             consent/assent and being compliant with all study requirements (visits,
             record-keeping, etc).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History of life-threatening asthma that is defined for this protocol as an asthma
             episode that required intubation and/or was associated with hypercapnea, respiratory
             arrest or hypoxic seizures.

          2. Culture-documented or suspected bacterial or viral infection of the upper or lower
             respiratory tract, sinus, or middle ear that is not resolved within 2 weeks prior to
             the Screening Visit. In addition, the subject must be excluded if such infection
             occurs between the Screening Visit and the Randomization Visit.

          3. Any asthma exacerbation requiring oral corticosteroids within 3 months of the
             Screening Visit. A subject must not have had any hospitalization for asthma within 6
             months prior to the Screening Visit.

             Note: An exacerbation of asthma is defined as any worsening of asthma requiring any
             treatment other than rescue albuterol/salbutamol HFA MDI and/or the subject's regular
             non-corticosteroid maintenance treatment. This includes requiring the use of systemic
             corticosteroids and/or emergency room visit or hospitalization, a change in the
             subject's regular non-corticosteroid maintenance treatment, or the addition of other
             asthma medications.

          4. Presence of glaucoma, cataracts, ocular herpes simplex, or malignancy other than
             basal cell carcinoma.

             chronic bronchitis, emphysema, bronchiectasis with the need for treatment, cystic
             fibrosis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease).
             Significant is defined as any disease that, in the opinion of the investigator, would
             put the safety of the subject at risk through participation, or which could affect
             the efficacy or safety analysis if the disease/condition exacerbated during the
             study.

          6. Have any of the following conditions that, in the judgment of the investigator, might
             cause participation in this study to be detrimental to the subject, including, but
