      Phase II trial evaluating the safety &amp; efficacy of Atorvastatin for prophylaxis of Acute

      The study is a single-arm phase II single institutional trial evaluating the safety and
      efficacy of atorvastatin for the prophylaxis of acute GVHD in patients with hematological
      malignancies undergoing HLA matched related donor HSCT. This study will explore a
      two-pronged acute GVHD prophylaxis strategy, consisting of pre-treating consenting related
      donors with atorvastatin before stem cell mobilization and collection, followed by
      atorvastatin plus methotrexate/tacrolimus-based GVHD prophylaxis in transplant recipient
      patients.

          -  The donor must be at least 18 years of age, and willing/able to provide informed
             consent. Complete medication list will be reviewed for potential negative interaction
             with atorvastatin.

          -  The donor must be an HLA-matched sibling or relative.

          -  Syngeneic donors are not eligible.

             must not be breast feeding.

          -  Bilirubin, AST and ALT must be &lt; 2 x normal; and absence of hepatic
             fibrosis/cirrhosis.

             calculated by Cockcroft-Gault equation.

             consent.
