      The primary objective of this study is to assess the effectiveness of cellular dermal
      replacement tissue vs. non-viable extracellular matrix (ECM) for the treatment of
      non-healing diabetic foot ulcers. Our hypothesis is that these devices are of equal
      efficacy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        (Answering NO will exclude patient):

             any study-related activities.

          2. The area of the study ulcer after debridement is between 1 cm2 and 25 cm2 at Visit
             3/Week 0.

          3. Subjects between 18 and 85 years of age.

          4. Subject's highest Ankle-Brachial Pressure Index (ABPI) / Ankle-Arm Index (AAI) is
             greater than or equal to 0.80 and lower than 1.4 (the highest ABPI/AAI value from
             three measurements within last 6 months shall apply).or a toe-arm index is equal to
             or higher than 0.6.

          5. The patient has one or more diabetic ulcers on the target foot with only one ulcer
             selected as the study (target) ulcer. The target ulcer must be at least 4 cm from a
             non-target ulcer and in the Investigator's opinion, be unlikely to coalesce with
             another ulcer within 12 weeks of randomization.

          6. Subject's study ulcer is full thickness and does not extend to bone, muscle, or
             tendon.

          7. Subject's study ulcer has been present at least 4 weeks prior to the initial
             screening (Visit 1) or 6 weeks at randomization (Visit 3).

          8. Subject has been diagnosed with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes and HbA1c is less than 10%.

          9. Study ulcer has no clinical feature of infection (2 signs of inflammation and
             elevated bacterial load of the wound).

         10. For female subjects of childbearing age potential, the subject has a negative
             pregnancy test and is not lactating for the duration of the study.

         11. Subject understands the requirements of this study and is willing to comply with all
             the study requirements.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        (Answering YES will exclude patient):

          1. The subject is diagnosed with cancer and is undergoing treatment with

          2. The subject is diagnosed with HIV/AIDS.

          3. The subject is diagnosed with any bleeding disorders.

          4. The subject is diagnosed with any connective tissue diseases.

             biopsy, MRI or bone scan).

          9. Doppler exam within the last 365 days demonstrating reflux greater than 0.5 seconds.

         10. The subject is diagnosed with active Charcot as described by Saunder's classification
             system.

         11. The subject manifests signs of poor nutritional status and/or albumin level &lt; 2.9.

         12. The subject has been exposed to Dermagraft® and/or Oasis® in the last 60 days.

         13. The study ulcer size is less than 0.5 cm2 or greater than 25 cm2.

         14. The subject has any porcine allergy or cow product allergy.

         15. The subject's recent (last 30 days) chemistry tests serum creatinine is 2 times above
             the upper limit of normal and/or LFT's 3 times above the upper limit of normal.

         16. Between Visit 1/Week -2 and Visit 3/Week 0 (randomization) the study ulcer has
             decreased in size by more than 40%, or increased in size by more than 50%.
