  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ASSIST I was the first randomized trial in patients with scleroderma to not just slow
      disease progression but rather actually reverse it. It is the first treatment to have ever
      demonstrated reversal of lung disease in scleroderma with improvement in FVC, total lung
      capacity (TLC), high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT), and QOL. We now, therefore,
      purpose to compare the ASSIST I conditioning regimen of cyclophosphamide and rATG to a less
      intense regimen of rATG/cyclophosphamide/Fludarabine. In the new regimen the
      cyclophosphamide dose is decreased to 120mg/kg (60mg/kg/day x 2) compared to 200mg/kg
      (50mg/kg/day) in the standard regimen. The lower dose of cyclophosphamide will be less
      cardiotoxic. This study will determine if the less cardiotoxic regimen will be safer than
      the standard regimen and as effective as the standard regimen.

      Mobilization. For patients in both arms undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation,
      peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) will be mobilized with cyclophosphamide (2 g/m2) followed
      by 5-10 mcg/kg subcutaneous filgrastrim daily from day 5 until completion of apheresis.
      Mobilized hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) will be collected by apheresis on day 10 and
      cryopreserved without selection or manipulation. There will be an interval of at least 17
      days between mobilization of PBSC and start of conditioning regimen.

      Control arm. The control arm will have the same conditioning regimen used in ASSIST study.
      The conditioning regimen will be 200 mg/kg of intravenous cyclophosphamide given in 4 equal
      fractions on days -5 through -2 with intravenous mesna. Rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin
      (rATG) (Thymoglobulin®) will be dosed at 0.5 mg/kg on day-5 and then 1.5 mg/kg from day-4
      thru day -1. Methylprednisolone 1000 mg will be used infused intravenously before each dose
      of rATG. PBSC will be infused intravenously on day 0. Filgrastrim 5-10 mcg/kg will be
      started on day + 5 and continued until neutrophil engraftment.

      Cytoxan rATG/Fludarabine arm

      The conditioning regimen will be 120 mg/kg of intravenous cyclophosphamide given in 2 equal
      fractions on days -3 and -2 with intravenous mesna. Rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin (rATG)
      (Thymoglobulin®) will be dosed at 0.5 mg/kg on day-5 and then 1.5 mg/kg from day-4 thru day
      -1. Fludarabine 30 g/m2 will be given IV on days -5, -4, and -3. Methylprednisolone 1000 mg
      will be used infused intravenously before each dose of rATG. PBSC will be infused
      intravenously on day 0. Filgrastrim 5-10 mcg/kg will be started on day + 5 and continued
      until neutrophil engraftment.
