    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the effects of a drug, eplerenone, along with lifestyle
      modification to affect sugar metabolism, body fat distribution, and cardiovascular health in
      HIV-infected individuals. In non-HIV-infected individuals, recent data has shown that
      aldosterone, a hormone that regulates salt and water balance, is increased in association
      with increased belly fat and decreased insulin sensitivity. In HIV-infected individuals,
      aldosterone appears to be higher in individuals with increased belly fat, and increased
      aldosterone appears to be strongly associated with impaired sugar metabolism. In this study,
      the investigators will test the effects of eplerenone, which is a medication that blocks the
      actions of aldosterone, along with lifestyle modification. The investigators hypothesize
      that eplerenone may improve sugar metabolism, improve markers of cardiovascular health, and
      reduce fat accumulation in liver and muscle.

      The study is 12 months long, with two phases. In the initial, 6-month phase, volunteers are
      randomly assigned to receive either eplerenone or placebo (an inactive pill). In addition,
      all volunteers will receive counseling about healthy diet and lifestyle, and will be asked
      to follow guidelines for a healthy level of physical activity. In the second 6-months of the
      study, all volunteers will continue to receive lifestyle modification and all will receive
      eplerenone.
