  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a series of 3 linked randomized clinical trials of 6 month duration, with a
      total of 12 month follow-up, to evaluate the effect of Integrated Stepped Care on drinking
      outcomes and HIV biologic markers (including VACS index) in HIV-infected patients with
      unhealthy alcohol use.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Unhealthy alcohol use threatens the health benefits seen with antiretroviral therapy (ART)
      for HIV-infected (HIV+) patients. Although research has demonstrated the efficacy of brief
      interventions, motivational counseling, and medications to treat unhealthy alcohol use in
      HIV uninfected patients, there is limited research or use of these treatments in HIV+
      patients. We have demonstrated that integrated treatment of addiction in HIV clinics is
      feasible. Stepped care algorithms can facilitate the evaluation of varying intensities of
      treatments for unhealthy alcohol use. The proposed study will compare onsite Integrated
      Stepped Care treatment (ISC) to treatment as usual (TAU) in three, linked, 6-month
      randomized clinical trials in 642 HIV+ patients with unhealthy alcohol use. Screened
      patients are randomized to ISC or TAU after determining that they meet criteria for either
      1) at-risk drinking, 2) alcohol abuse or dependence or 3) moderate alcohol consumption in
      the presence of liver disease. ISC and TAU are tailored to the drinking category. ISC for
      at-risk drinkers and those with Moderate Alcohol use and Liver Disease begins with a brief
      intervention and is stepped up to Motivational Enhancement Therapy (MET) in those who meet
      predefined failure criteria. ISC for abuse or dependence begins with addiction physician
      management (APM) including alcohol pharmacotherapy if not contraindicated. APM is stepped up
      to include MET if predefined failure criteria are met. The study will test the hypothesis
      that ISC leads to decreased alcohol consumption and improved HIV biomarkers. Data analyses
      will be conducted on the intention to treat sample.

          1. Be HIV-infected and receiving HIV care at one of the participating medical centers.

          2. Meet one of the following criteria for unhealthy alcohol use:

               -  At-risk Drinking Study- greater than 14 drinks per week or greater than 4 drinks
                  per occasion in men and greater than 7 drinks per week or greater than 3 drinks
                  per occasion in women and those over 65.

               -  Alcohol Abuse or Dependence Study - Meet DSM-IV TR criteria for alcohol abuse or
