  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is associated with physical disability through both direct pathways (e.g., lower
      extremity pain, insufficient muscle strength) and indirect pathways (obesity-related
      comorbidities and inflammation). Furthermore, diabetes, a major obesity-related health
      condition, is associated with increased risk of disability and accelerated declines in
      physical and cognitive function. The investigators preliminary data suggest that intentional
      weight loss improves physical function, and there is strong circumstantial evidence that it
      would also benefit cognitive function.

      To evaluate the role of intentional weight loss on physical and cognitive function, the
      investigators propose an ancillary study to the on-going Look AHEAD (Action for Health in
      Diabetes) trial. Look AHEAD is a multi-center, randomized clinical trial to examine the
      effects of a 4-year lifestyle intervention designed to achieve and maintain weight loss
      through decreased caloric intake and exercise in overweight or obese men and women aged
      45-74 years with type 2 diabetes. The investigators propose to add validated and
      well-established measures of physical and cognitive performance to the year 8 follow-up
      visit - during the trial's weight maintenance phase - in ~1000 participants at 4 of the 16
      Look AHEAD field sites (Colorado, Memphis, Pennington and Pittsburgh).

      The specific aims of this ancillary study are: 1) To determine the long-term effects of a
      lifestyle intervention designed to achieve and maintain weight loss on physical function;
      and 2) To determine the long-term effects of a lifestyle intervention designed to achieve
      and maintain weight loss on cognitive function. In addition, the investigators hypothesize
      that in the intervention group, larger initial weight loss, better weight loss maintenance,
      and higher physical activity will be associated with better physical and cognitive function.
      The investigators also hypothesize that in the control group weight loss will be associated
      with worse physical and cognitive function than in those who are weight stable or who have
      gained weight.

      The number of obese older adults is rising rapidly and there are few data to guide an
      evidence-based clinical response to their management. The results of this study will provide
      the first direct evidence of the role of long-term intentional weight loss on the
      maintenance of physical and cognitive function in older obese adults with diabetes. Since
      this study is being done as an ancillary study to an on-going trial it can be done in a
      timely and cost-efficient manner.
