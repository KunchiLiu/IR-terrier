    <textblock>
      This project tests a model for improving illness self-management among persons who have both
      serious mental illness and diabetes and will be performed within a primary care setting at a
      safety net hospital system. The information gained from the randomized trial will be
      supplemented with reports from participants about their experiences of trying to improve
      illness self-management. Improvements in self-management should result in a reduction of
      psychiatric symptoms and improvements in functioning and physical health.

      This project will test a novel intervention, Targeted Training in Illness Management (TTIM),
      intended to improve both serious mental illness (SMI) and diabetes mellitus (DM)
      self-management in 100 individuals with SMI-DM vs. 100 individuals with SMI-DM receiving
      treatment as usual (TAU). The intervention will be conducted in a safety-net health system
      primary care setting and will be conducted as a randomized controlled trial (RCT). The
      primary effects of TTIM will be assessed with respect to SMI symptoms, Functional
      Status/Role Impairment, General Health Status, and DM outcomes. Secondary outcomes include
      adherence to psychotropic and DM medication, and engagement in healthy behaviors.

      This assessment will include quantitative assessment of facilitators/barriers targeted by
      the proposed intervention as well as a supplemental qualitative assessment. The qualitative
      assessments will include input from patients and interventionists. Specific aims for the
      qualitative analysis are to validate findings from the RCT, expand understanding of &quot;key
      active ingredients&quot; of TTIM, and provide information to inform future studies on individuals
      with SMI and related medical conditions.

    <description>This intervention blends psychoeducation, problem identification/goal-setting, behavioral modeling and reinforcement via use of Peer Educators, and health care linkage, has been adapted to the primary care setting and targeted for SMI-DM participants. Generalizability is enhanced with relatively brief in-person participation requirements and by utilizing professional staff typically found in primary care. TTIM will stress information sharing that is accessible to participants, and through a collaborative process, foster motivation for SMI-DM self-management.</description>

    <ipd_description>The investigators will make deidentified data available to other qualified investigators in the research community. Data will remain under control of the PIs of the research study at CWRU. Copies of electronic data files accompanied by data documentation (metadata) will be shared.
Qualified investigators may contact the PIs for information on how to request data. Investigators will be required (at minimum) to provide 1) the names and qualifications of all individuals who will have any access to primary data files; 2) a research proposal detailing how the data will be used; 3) a statement that the investigators will a) not further share the primary data with third parties, b) protect the privacy of subjects, c) provide a means to protect the confidentiality of the data; and 4) a data transfer/use agreement with CWRU. Only data necessary to meet the goals of the investigators' research proposal will be provided to limit the risk of identifying individual research subjects.</ipd_description>
