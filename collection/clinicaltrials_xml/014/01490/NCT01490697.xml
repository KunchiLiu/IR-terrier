      Despite substantial therapeutic advances, Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) remains
      difficult to treat. One promising new area of research is in post-reactivation pharmacologic
      intervention, which is based upon the concept of blockade of memory reconsolidation. Recent
      animal research suggests that reactivation (retrieval) of a stored memory can return it to a
      labile (alterable) state from which it must be restabilized in order to persist. This
      process is called &quot;reconsolidation,&quot; and various drugs have been found to block it in
      animals. This blockade may lead to a weakening of the original memory trace.

      The aim of this study is to pilot the effect of mifepristone on physiologic responding
      during traumatic imagery. Although mifepristone is widely and safely used to cause a medical
      abortion, it is also a powerful stress hormone receptor blocker. These stress hormones,
      called glucocorticoids, may enhance memory (re)consolidation. Indeed, a recent study in
      animals reported that mifepristone blocked reconsolidation of context-conditioned fear in
      rats.

      Reconsolidation blockade is a two-stage process. First, the memory must be destabilized by
      recalling it. Second, reconsolidation of the memory must be blocked by a drug. Memory traces
      formed under stressful conditions may resist destabilization and thus are inaccessible to
      reconsolidation blockers. However, when a reconsolidation blocker was paired with
      d-cycloserine (DCS) in animals that had been trained under stressful conditions,
      reconsolidation blockade became successful. These results suggest that DCS promotes the
      destabilization of resistant memory traces. The traumatic memories of individuals with PTSD
      may be particularly resistant to destabilization. Therefore, this study will compare
      mifepristone paired with DCS to placebo controls.

      The same script-driven traumatic imagery method validated in previous studies of propranolol
      in this lab will be used. Briefly, subjects with PTSD will describe their traumatic event
      during a script preparation session, which will reactivate the memory. They will then
      receive a) mifepristone and DCS or b) placebo. A week later, they will engage in
      script-driven mental imagery of their traumatic event while physiologic responses (heart
      rate, sweating, etc) are measured. This is a pilot study so there are no formal hypotheses.
      The aim is to estimate effect sizes for mifepristone and to compare them with effect sizes
      for propranolol from this lab's previous work.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criterion:

          -  Subject has experienced a traumatic event that meets the DSM-IV11 A1. and A.2. PTSD
             criteria

          -  Subject currently meets DSM-IV criterion B.5, viz., &quot;physiological reactivity on
             exposure to internal or external cues that symbolize or resemble an aspect of the
             traumatic event.&quot;

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Medical condition that contraindicates the administration of mifepristone, e.g.,
             history of adrenal failure; concurrent corticosteroid therapy; hemorrhagic disorders;
             cardiovascular, hypertensive, hepatic, respiratory or renal disease; insulin
             dependent diabetes mellitus; severe anemia; heavy smoking; porphyria; allergy to
             mifepristone; concurrent anticoagulant therapy; or medical condition that
             contraindicates the administration of DCS e.g., hypersensitivity to cycloserine,
             epilepsy, severe renal insufficiency.

          -  Pregnant (as determined by mandatory blood pregnancy testing, or currently breast
             feeding. (Note: Women who have had a hysterectomy or are post-menopausal (defined as
             over the age of 50 with no menstrual period for at least 12 months) will be exempted
             from pregnancy testing. Furthermore, women of childbearing potential will only be
             included if: a) they are using contraception in the form of barrier methods with
             spermicide, hormonal methods (e.g. birth control pill), or IUDs, or b) they have not
             been sexually active for the preceding 60 days.)

          -  Contraindicating psychiatric condition, e.g., current psychotic, bipolar,
             melancholic, or substance dependence or abuse disorder; or currently suicidal.

          -  Cognitive Impairment or dementia

          -  Initiation of, or change in, psychotropic medication within one month prior to
             recruitment

          -  Current use of medication that may involve potentially dangerous interactions with
             mifepristone, including certain CYP 3A4 substrates such as calcium channel blockers,
             azole antifungals, macrolide antibiotics, and tricyclic antidepressants. (Note - we
             have not included in this list benzodiazepines or selective serotonin reuptake
             inhibitors, because these drugs are frequently used by PTSD subjects, and they have
             sufficiently wide therapeutic ranges such that any transient increases in blood
             levels induced by a single dose of mifepristone will not endanger subjects); or
             current use of medication that may involve potentially dangerous interactions with
             DCS, including ethionamide, isoniazid, and pyridoxine.

          -  Inability to understand the study's procedures, risks, and side effects, or to
             otherwise give informed consent for participation;

          -  Age less than 18.
