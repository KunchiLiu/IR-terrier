    <textblock>
      Misoprostol is a medication used extensively in obstetrics and gynecology for its ability to
      aid in softening the cervix as well as decreasing blood loss after abortion or vaginal
      delivery. Opinions vary as to its usefulness in aiding in cervical dilation, and in
      decreasing blood loss. The investigators propose to conduct a randomized, placebo-controlled
      trial to evaluate whether misoprostol given buccally 2 hours prior to second trimester
      surgical abortion decreases blood loss from the procedure. The investigators will also
      assess whether misoprostol improves cervical dilation, changes the length of the procedure,
      changes the need for additional mechanical dilation, changes the subjective ease of the
      procedure, and changes a woman's pain.
