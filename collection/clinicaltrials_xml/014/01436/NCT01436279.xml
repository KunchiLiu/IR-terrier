  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study the investigators plan to compare mifepristone and misoprostol use to osmotic
      dilator use for cervical preparation for 15-18 week surgical abortion. Mifepristone would be
      given 24 hours prior to abortion, and misoprostol 400 mcg would be administered buccally 2
      hours prior to abortion. Osmotic dilators are the method currently used in our institution,
      and are placed 24 hours prior to abortion. The primary outcome will be the length of the
      procedure. Secondary outcomes will include amount of dilation achieved, ease of procedure,
      participant's assessment of discomfort after mifepristone or dilators, discomfort during the
      abortion procedure, acceptability to participants, and acceptability to staff.
