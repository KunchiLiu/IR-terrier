  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to assess whether a new drug, Nulojix® (belatacept), would
      minimize serious long term side effects associated with anti-rejection medications while
      still protecting the new kidney from damage. The researchers also wanted to learn more about
      the safety of this treatment and long term health of the transplanted kidney.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dialysis or kidney transplant are the two ways to treat kidney failure. Transplant
      recipients have to take anti-rejection medications to prevent their immune system (the
      body's natural defense system against illness) from rejecting their new kidney. Most
      patients who undergo a kidney transplant must take these anti-rejection medications for the
      rest of their lives. Taking standard anti-rejection medications for a long time can cause
      serious side effects, including kidney damage. There would be a benefit to finding new
      anti-rejection medications that work just as well, but don't damage the kidney.

          -  Ability to understand and provide written informed consent;

          -  Candidate for primary renal allograft from either a living or deceased-donor;

          -  No known contraindications to study therapy using NULOJIX® (belatacept);

          -  Female participants of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test
             upon study entry;

          -  Female and male participants with reproductive potential must agree to use FDA
             approved methods of birth control during participation in the study and for 4 months
             following completion of the study;

          -  Flow-based PRA within last 12 months (in absence of a sensitizing event) of &lt; 30% as
             determined by each participating study center. If the subject experienced a
             sensitizing event after the PRA test date, then the PRA must be repeated and
             confirmed &lt;30%;

          -  Negative crossmatch or a PRA of 0% on historic and admission sera as determined by
             each participating study center.

          -  A documented negative TB test within the 12 months prior to transplant. If
             documentation is not present at the time of transplantation, and the subject does not
             have any risk factors for TB, a TB-specific interferon gamma release assay (IGRA) may
             be performed.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Need for multi-organ transplant;

          -  Recipient of previous organ transplant;

          -  EBV sero-negative (or unknown) recipients;

          -  Active infection including hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or HIV;

             drugs within 1 year prior to transplant;

          -  Individuals undergoing transplant using organs from ECD or DCD donors;

          -  HLA identical living donors;

          -  Individuals at significant risk of early recurrence of the primary renal disease
             including FSGS and MPGN type 2 or any other disease that in the opinion of the
             investigator is at increased likelihood of recurrence and which may result in rapid
             decline in renal function;

          -  Individuals previously treated with NULOJIX® (belatacept);

          -  Any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would interfere with the
             participant's ability to comply with study requirements;

          -  Use of investigational drugs within 4 weeks of enrollment;

          -  Known hypersensitivity to mycophenolate mofetil (MMF)or any of the drug's components;

          -  Administration of live attenuated vaccine(s) within 8 weeks of enrollment.
