    <textblock>
      This study is examining the effectiveness of duloxetine as a treatment for chronic pelvic
      pain in women. Duloxetine is FDA approved for the treatment of other pain conditions,
      including fibromyalgia and diabetic neuropathy.

    <textblock>
      Chronic pelvic pain in women can be caused by various pathologies, such as endometriosis,
      fibroids, and adhesions. Surgical treatment of the pathology often relieves the pain, but a
      significant number of women continue to have pain, even after visibly successful surgery.
      One model explored in this study is that in some cases of chronic pelvic pain, the central
      nervous system has changed in its processing of pain-related signals, requiring a therapy
      directed to the CNS to effectively treat the pain. This model has been supported in studies
      of other chronic pain conditions, such as fibromyalgia and migraine. This study will seek to
      determine whether the analgesic effectiveness of duloxetine is related to the pain state of
      the individual.
