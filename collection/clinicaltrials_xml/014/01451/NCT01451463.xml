  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In individuals with Huntington's disease (HD), chorea may contribute to balance problems and
      difficulties with walking, sit to stand transfers and stair climbing that in turn may
      contribute to high fall rates. Xenazine (tetrabenazine) is a monoamine-depleting drug that
      is commonly used to reduce chorea.

      The purpose of this study is to compare: 1) spatial and temporal gait measures, 2)
      performance on functional mobility measures, and 3) amount of daily walking activity before
      and after administration of Xenazine in individuals with HD. It is hypothesized that the use
      of Xenazine to decrease chorea will improve functions of 1) gait, 2) sit-to-stand transfers
      3) stair climbing and 4) overall daily physical activity and function.

      Individuals with HD who are ambulatory and are either already taking Xenazine or have been
      newly prescribed the medication will be recruited for this prospective open-label study. A
      variety of motor assessments will be preformed while subject are taking Xenazine or after a
      period off of the medications. These tests include: Unified Huntington's Disease Rating
      Scale (UHDRS) motor section, GAITRite forward walking, Tinetti Mobility Test, Timed
      Sit-to-Stand Test, Timed Stair Climb Test, Rhomberg test. A subset of subjects will wear an
      activity monitoring device on the wrist of the non-dominant hand for 5 consecutive days and
      nights.
