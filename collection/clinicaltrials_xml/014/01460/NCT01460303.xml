  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Following surgery for female urinary incontinence and/or pelvic organ prolapse, women are
      sometimes temporarily unable to empty their bladders and are sent home with a transurethral
      indwelling catheter attached to a bag which holds urine. The goal of this study is to
      compare a new type of patient-operated catheter without a bag to the catheter with a bag for
      ease of use, comfort and quality of life for patients during the postoperative recovery
      period. This new catheter, the OPTION-vf, is approved by the FDA and is available on the
      market.

    <measure>Urinary Catheter Evaluation Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>5-10 days postoperatively</time_frame>
    <description>The urinary catheter evaluation questionnaire will be administered at the time patients return for their bladder challenge, normally between 5-10 days postop. The questionnaire focuses on comfort and ease of use of the catheter to which patients were randomized following failed bladder challenge. The questionnaire consists of seven questions with response choices ranging from &quot;no discomfort&quot; to &quot;extreme discomfort&quot;, for example.</description>
