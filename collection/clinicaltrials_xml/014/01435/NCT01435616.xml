      The purpose of this study is:

        -  To compare the blood sugar control on LY2605541 with insulin glargine after 52 weeks of
           treatment.

        -  To compare the number of night time low blood sugar episodes on LY2605541 with insulin
           glargine during 52 weeks of treatment.

        -  To compare the number of patients on LY2605541 reaching blood sugar targets without low
           blood sugar episodes at night to those taking insulin glargine after 52 weeks of
           treatment.

        -  To compare the total number of low blood sugar episodes on LY2605541 with insulin
           glargine after 52 weeks of treatment
