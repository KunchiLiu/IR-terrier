  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare ways of giving advice and providing support to
      improve diet and physical activity in adult primary care patients with elevated body mass
      index and dysglycemia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized comparative effectiveness trial to evaluate the health and economic
      effects of a community-based intensive lifestyle intervention for adult primary care
      patients with elevated body mass index and dysglycemia (either type 2 diabetes or
      pre-diabetes). The study will use qualitative and quantitative methods to assess reach,
      effectiveness, costs, adoption, implementation, and maintenance of a clinical-community
      partnership to offer intensive lifestyle intervention resources to eligible adult primary
      care patients.

    <description>The study collects individual participant survey data that will include the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-12 health-related quality of life questionnaire. Responses from the questionnaire are used to construct a validated numerical score that expresses global health-related quality of life across a range of 0 (death) to 1 (perfect health). Changes in this indicator will be evaluated.</description>
