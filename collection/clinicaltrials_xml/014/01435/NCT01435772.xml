             informed consent, prior to the performance of any study-related procedures;

          -  Have been diagnosed with late-onset Pompe Disease, based on the entry criteria of a
             prior BMN 701 study;

          -  If sexually active, be willing to use 2 known effective methods of contraception from
             Screening until 4 months after the last dose of study-drug;

          -  If female, and not considered to be of childbearing potential, be at least 2 years
             post-menopausal, or have had tubal ligation at least 1 year prior to screening, or

             Investigator.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have received any experimental or approved therapy for Pompe disease, other than BMN
             701, subsequent to completion of a BMN 701 study and prior to entry into POM-002;

          -  Have received, or are anticipated to receive, any investigational medication, other
             than BMN 701, within 30 days prior to the first dose of study-drug;
