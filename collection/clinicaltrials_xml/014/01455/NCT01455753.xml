  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this project is to investigate whether the proximity of employees to flu-shot
      clinics will increase the uptake rates of employees participating in these clinics. The
      investigators hypothesize that ease of access is an important factor in whether or not
      employees receive an influenza vaccination.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In 2010, flu shots were provided to our partner company's headquarters in their second
      headquarters building (H2) in an obscure conference room. The investigators are proposing to
      move the flu shot clinic to a high traffic area, near a café in H2. The location of the flu
      shot clinic will be prominent and employees would pass by the flu shot clinic several times
      a day. Two weeks after the flu shot clinic in H2, the investigators will have a two day flu
      shot clinic in the first headquarters building (H1), near a highly traveled café in H1. Our
      partner company will not tell employees that there will be a flu shot clinic in H1 until
      after the flu shot clinic ends in H2. The unexpected factor of the flu shot clinic in H1
      will be used to test H2's location versus H1's location without the bias of having employees
      wait or procrastinate to choose one location over another. The two locations will allow us
      to identify whether moving from one convenient location to another, even more convenient
      location would make a significant difference in participation rates.
