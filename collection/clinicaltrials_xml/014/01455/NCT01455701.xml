    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, open label single arm study to investigate the pharmacokinetics and
      safety of tocilizumab (TCZ) (RoActemra/Actemra) in participants less than 2 years old with
      active systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA). Participants will receive tocilizumab
      infusions every 2 weeks. The anticipated time on study treatment is 12 weeks (Main
      evaluation period). Participants will have the option to continue TCZ treatment until
      participant reaches 2 years of age or up to one year from baseline, whichever is longer. An
      optional extension period will follow the main evaluation period.
