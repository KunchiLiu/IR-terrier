  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal is to improve HIV patients' adherence to medication regimens. The investigators are
      planning an intervention in which the patient is given financial incentives to take clinic
      attendance seriously, and then given the option to make these incentives contingent on
      taking medications as prescribed—that is, to require better behavior from themselves to earn
      the same reward. Past studies have shown that conditional payments improve adherence to HIV
      treatment, but only while payments are being made. The investigators expect that patients
      will be willing to give up some payments to commit themselves to better adherence. The
      investigators also hope to see some patients maintaining good adherence after financial
      incentives are removed, among those who are given the opportunity to choose this commitment.

    <description>In the Incentive Choice arm, patients will first be presented with a brief explanation of the differences between the Attend-Check-up-Get-Paid arm and the Take-Meds-Get-Paid arm. The RC has a paper diagram that he will use in the explanation. Only after patients make a decision are they given a full walk-through of what they need to do to receive their incentive payment, as in the above Attendance Incentive arm. There is the question of how much detail we might want to shift from the walk-through to the initial brief explanation of the Attend-Check-up-Get-Paid arm and the Take-Meds-Get-Paid arm.</description>

    <description>In the Attendance Incentive arm, patients will be given a walk-through of what they need to do to receive their incentive payment, which would include attending their provider check-up, seeing the RC and remembering to bring their MEMs bottle.</description>

    <intervention_name>Medication Adherence among HIV/AIDS Patients</intervention_name>
    <description>If patients are interested and available, they will be scheduled for a first study visit (&quot;study visit 1&quot;) involving enrollment and baseline data collection. The second (&quot;study visit 2&quot;), third (&quot;3&quot;), fourth (&quot;4&quot;), and fifth (&quot;5&quot;) study visits will be used to implement the intervention with financial incentives and will involve data collection. The sixth (&quot;6&quot;) will involve only data collection; there should be time during the sixth to complete chart extraction—for hospital, pharmacy, and clinical records.
Subjects will be told that study visit 5 is &quot;the end of the study&quot;, although we &quot;may follow up later&quot;. Study visit 6 will be an unanticipated meeting.</description>
