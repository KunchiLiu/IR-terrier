  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preliminary studies with a variety of vaccines suggest target accessibility (potential
      immunogenicity) in a variety of solid tumors to immune directed approaches. In an effort to
      overcome limitations of immunostimulatory cancer vaccines, the investigators have designed a
      novel autologous vaccine to address inability to fully identify cancer associated antigens,
      antigen recognition by the immune system (i.e. antigen to immunogen), effector potency, and
      cancer-induced resistance. In an effort to overcome limitations of immunostimulatory cancer
      vaccines, the investigators designed a novel dual-modulatory autologous whole cell vaccine,
      Vigil™ (bi-shRNA furin and GMCSF Autologous Tumor Cell Vaccine), incorporating the rhGMCSF
      (recombinant human GMCSF) transgene and the bifunctional shRNAfurin (to block proprotein
      conversion to active TGFb1 and b2) to 1) address the inability to fully identify cancer
      associated antigens, 2) effect antigen recognition by the immune system (i.e. antigen to
      immunogen), 3) enhance effector potency, and 4) subvert endogenous cancer-induced immune
      resistance. The investigators have also completed the Phase I assessment of Vigil™ vaccine
      in 27 advanced solid tumor patients (1.0 x 10e7 or 2.5 x 10e7 cells/injection/month for a
      maximum of 12 vaccinations) who have not experienced any significant adverse effects
      following 131 vaccinations, including 4 patients with melanoma. Plasmid functionality,
      immune biomarker response, and preliminary evidence of anticancer activity have been
      observed. This is a Phase II study of intradermal autologous Vigil™ cancer vaccine (1.0 x
      10e7 cells/injection; maximum of 12 vaccinations) in patients with stages IIIc and IV
      melanoma with biopsy accessible lesions to document blood and intratumoral immune responses
      and assess correlation with survival.

             tumor in sufficient quantity (&quot;golf ball size&quot; estimated weight ~ 30 grams, pleural
             and/or ascites fluid estimated volume ≥ 500mL) for vaccine processing.
