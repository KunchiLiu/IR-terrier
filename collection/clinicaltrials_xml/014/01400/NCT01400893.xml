  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this protocol is to evaluate the safety of a selective cytopheretic device
      (SCD) in patients that are on continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) for acute kidney
      injury (AKI).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute kidney injury is a condition where the kidneys are not capable of producing adequate
      urine. Therefore, another way to remove waste from the body is needed to hopefully allow
      time for the kidneys to heal. One method of removing waste from the body is called
      Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy (CRRT) or variations of that therapy. This study will
      evaluate the safety of the device while it is connected to the CRRT tubing for up to 7 days.
      Patients will be followed up until day 60 following the treatment.

    <description>The selective cytopheretic device (SCD) is comprised of tubing, connectors and a hemofilter cartridge. The device is connected in series to a commercially available Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy (CRRT) device. Blood from the CRRT circuit is diverted after the CRRT hemofilter through to the extra capillary space (ECS) of the SCD. Blood circulates through this space and is returned to the patient via the venous return line of the CRRT circuit. Regional citrate anticoagulation is used for the entire CRRT and SCD blood circuits.</description>

          1. A patient, or legal representative, has signed a written informed consent form.

          2. Must be receiving medical care in an intensive care unit (e.g., ICU, MICU, SICU,
             CTICU, Trauma).

          3. Age 18 to 80 years.

             serum pregnancy test) and not lactating if recently post-partum.

          5. Must be receiving and tolerating CRRT therapy for a minimum of 4 hours, but not
             longer than 24.

          6. Expected to remain in the ICU for at least 96 hours after evaluation for enrollment.

          7. A clinical diagnosis of ATN due to hemodynamic or toxic etiologies. ATN is defined as
             Acute Kidney Injury occurring in a setting of acute ischemic or nephrotoxic injury
             with oliguria (average &lt;20 mL/hr) for &gt;6-12 hours or: an increase in serum creatinine
             ≥2 mg/dL (≥1.5 mg/dL in females) over a period of ≤4 days. (Note: Prerenal,
             hepatorenal, vascular, interstitial, glomerular, and obstructive etiologies are
