  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma is considerably more prevalent in East Asia. Despite of
      relatively high prevalence of esophageal SCC, prognosis is very poor with limited options of
      effective chemotherapy regimens. We attempted to identify favorable subgroups of patient who
      are likely to benefit from 5- fluorouracil/cisplatin(FP) or capecitabine/cisplatin (XP)
      chemotherapy as first-line treatment.Between January 2000 to December 2010, 239 patients
      were diagnosed of recurrent, metastatic esophageal SCC and received either FP or XP as
      first-line chemotherapy. Clinicopathologic variables and treatment outcome were
      retrospectively collected. we analysis treatment outcome of palliative chemotherapy in
      metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and make prognostic scoring system. The
      present study represents the largest series to analyze the treatment outcome of FP/XP
      chemotherapy in metastatic SCC. Risk-adapted stratification of treatment for subgroup of
      metastatic SCC patients should be actively pursued.
