  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to better understand what effects Bortezomib, a drug used for
      multiple myeloma therapy, has on the immune system.

    <textblock>
      Subjects on this study will be receiving treatment for multiple myeloma according to the
      standard of care with a regimen containing Bortezomib.

      If a bone marrow sample is clinically indicated to guide treatment, an additional 1
      tablespoon of the specimen will be obtained for further laboratory studies.

      Approximately 3 tablespoons of blood will be taken for research purposes before therapy with
      Bortezomib starts. When subjects return for follow-up after cycle 1, 2, and 3 and additional
      3 tablespoons of blood will be taken for research purposes.

      Optional samples of blood may be taken at follow-up visits after cycles 4, 5 and 6 and 1, 3
      and 6 months after completing therapy.

      This study also includes a medical record review.
