    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized, open-label phase II trial of 40 patients with poor prognosis head
      and neck cancer, defined as surgically unresectable and/or ≥N2b disease and judged
      appropriate for non-surgical definitive therapy.

      This is a non-randomized, open-label phase II trial of 40 patients with poor prognosis head
      and neck cancer, defined as surgically unresectable and/or ≥N2b disease and judged
      appropriate for non-surgical definitive therapy. Patients must have ECOG performance status
      of 0-1 with good organ function and will be treated with six weekly cycles of carboplatin,
      nab-paclitaxel and cetuximab prior to scheduled concomitant chemoradiation. The study is
      designed to evaluate whether this induction regimen can result in an improved response rate
      (complete response (CR) + partial response (PR)) with less toxicity than the current
      standard induction TPF regimen which includes docetaxel, cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (5FU).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All primary sites are eligible excluding nasopharyngeal.

          -  Surgically unresectable and/or N2b or greater nodal disease; NOTE: surgical
             unresectability will be defined as the combination of the treating surgeon's judgment
             of unresectability plus one of the following objective criteria:

               -  Encasement of tumor or nodes to the carotid artery or ¾ encasement of the
                  carotid artery.
