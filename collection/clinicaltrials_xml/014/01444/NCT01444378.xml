      To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Absolute Pro® Peripheral Self-Expanding
      Stent System and the Absolute Pro® LL Peripheral Self-Expanding Stent System for the
      treatment of subjects with atherosclerotic de novo or restenotic lesions in the native
      superficial femoral artery (SFA) and/or the native proximal popliteal artery (PPA).

      CAUTION: Absolute Pro® Peripheral Self-Expanding Stent System and the Absolute Pro® LL

          6. Target lesion is within or adjacent to an aneurysm.

          7. Target lesion or vessel has angiographic evidence of thrombus that is unresponsive to
