  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In recent years, the demand for home hospice care has grown rapidly. Family members and
      friends who act as informal caregivers are essential to the provision of palliative care
      services; however, this role is not without adverse effects on the caregivers themselves. It
      is well documented that emotional needs of individuals caring for dying persons in their
      home are not well attended, and interventions aiming to provide support to informal hospice
      caregivers are notably lacking. In this context, problem solving therapy (PST) provides an
      overall coping process that fosters adaptive situational coping and behavioral competence.
      The investigators are conducting a randomized controlled trial to fully evaluate the PST
      intervention for informal hospice caregivers. Additionally, the investigators aim to
      evaluate how the modality of the intervention (face to face vs video) impacts its
      effectiveness. This investigator team is conducting a 4-year randomized trial study in which
      hospice caregivers will be randomly assigned to a group receiving standard hospice care with
      the addition of social support interactions (attention control group) or a group receiving
      standard hospice care with the addition of the problem solving intervention delivered face
      to face (intervention group 1) or a group receiving standard hospice care with the addition
      of the problem solving intervention delivered via video (intervention group 2). The specific
      aims include an assessment of the impact of PST on caregiver quality of life, problem
      solving ability, and caregiver anxiety.

    <description>Problem-solving therapy (PST) focuses on behavioral change principles derived from this theoretical framework. PST addresses four skills: 1) problem definition and formulation, which involves gathering data and information, articulating the issue in clear terms, identifying the challenge, and setting realistic goals; 2) generation of alternative strategies; 3) decision making; and 4) solution implementation. The intervention is delivered in a series of interactions with the interventionist.</description>
