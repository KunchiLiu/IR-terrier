    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the effects of study drug (GSK1605786) on the blood
      levels of multiple commonly used drugs that are given to measure how your liver breaks down
      the study drug. These commonly-used drugs are midazolam, pioglitazone, omeprazole, and
      rosuvastatin which will determine the effect of GSK1605786 on how the body breaks down
      (metabolizes) these commonly-used drugs. Blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis of
      GSK1605786, and two metabolites, [GSK2635622 (CCX062) and GSK2656694 (CCX304)] and four
      probe substrates will be collected over a 24-hour period after administration. Safety will
      be assessed by the measurement of vital signs, cardiac monitoring, collection of adverse
      event assessments and laboratory tests.
