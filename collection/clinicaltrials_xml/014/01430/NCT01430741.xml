      A major goal for the Department of Veterans Affairs is to end Veteran homelessness by 2015.
      The VA's largest homelessness initiative is the joint Departments of Housing and Urban
      Development (HUD) and Veterans Affairs (VA) Supportive Housing program (HUD-VASH), which has
      been expanded greatly over recent years via the allocation of 30,000 Housing First vouchers
      between 2008 and 2010 and increased funding to hire 1,000 new program case managers.
      However, recent expansion has resulted in a number of implementation challenges including
      delays in the distribution of housing vouchers and dropout among program participants (25%
      of those housed in HUD-VASH drop out within a year). Much of this dropout can be attributed
      to untreated issues facing many Veterans enrolled in HUD-VASH. The most common among these
      untreated issues are mental health and substance use disorders. The presence of these
      disorders is due in large part to the fact that much of HUD-VASH case management focuses on
      housing placement and maintenance, with limited attention to mental health, substance abuse,
      and other related psychosocial issues, which when left untreated, negatively impacts voucher
      distribution and housing stability. This project will test an implementation model-Getting
      To Outcomes (GTO)-designed to assist in the delivery of an intervention for Veterans with
      co-occurring mental health and substance use disorders (MISSION-Vet) in the HUD-VASH
      program. The proposed study will compare implementation of MISSION-Vet currently being
      planned through VA Office of Patient Care Services to an enhanced approach using the GTO
      model. Thus, this project can contribute to ending all Veteran homelessness by 2015, a
      pledge made by President Obama.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This project tests an implementation platform-Getting To Outcomes (GTO)-designed to assist
      in the delivery of an evidence-based intervention for Veterans with co-occurring mental
      health and substance use disorders (MISSION-Vet) in the HUD-VASH program. This project will
      be a cluster randomized controlled trial that compares implementation of MISSION-Vet
      augmented by GTO to MISSION-Vet Implemented as Usual (IU) at three of the largest HUD-VASH
      programs in the country: VA Central Western Massachusetts Healthcare System (Northampton,
      MA), VA Capitol Health Care Network (Washington, D.C.), and VA Eastern Colorado Health Care
      System (Denver, CO). This project will randomly assign 150 HUD-VASH case managers and 1106
      Veterans on their caseloads who have received HUD-VASH vouchers and case management services
      into these two groups on a 1-year rolling admission basis determined by when the Veteran
      receives a housing voucher. The control group will receive MISSION-Vet in addition to
      HUD-VASH case management services and the intervention group will receive the same as the
      control, however the HUD-VASH case manager will have access to GTO implementation support.

      To compare case managers implementing MISSION-Vet augmented with GTO to HUD-VASH case
      managers using IU strategies on the following variables: (1) fidelity to the MISSION-Vet
      intervention; (2) proportion of time the Veteran is housed; (3) mental health, substance
      use, and functional outcomes among Veterans; and (4) factors key to the successful
      deployment of a new treatment as specified by the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption,
      Implementation, &amp; Maintenance (RE-AIM) model.

      Data will be collected on fidelity to MISSION-Vet in both IU and GTO groups. Data will also
      be collected on all subjects' substance use, overall mental health functioning, engagement
      in substance abuse treatment services, the length of time housed, and community
      participation. The investigators will collect data from individuals at baseline and three
      time points for up to one year. The investigators' data analysis strategy will be to use a
      repeated-measures model to test for the significance of the treatment-by-time interaction
      while accounting for the clustered design of case manager within site.

      This study intends to serve a dual function of comparing implementation of MISSION-Vet
      currently being planned through VA Office of Patient Care Services to an enhanced
      implementation approach using the GTO model. The proposed research will help to guide policy
      and practice actions to implement MISSION-Vet with fidelity and effectiveness to achieve
      maximum outcomes among homeless Veterans.

    <description>GTO strengthens the knowledge, attitudes, and skills practitioners need to carry out evidence based programs. GTO consists of a series of steps practitioners should follow in order to obtain positive results and then provides them with the guidance necessary to complete those steps with quality. According to GTO, &quot;carrying out&quot; an evidence based program includes a series of steps corresponding to three general areas: (1) planning - e.g., developing goals and performance targets, ensuring staff are trained in the evidence based program; (2) implementation - e.g., monitoring program activities, maintaining adherence to an evidence based program model, supervision; and (3) self-evaluation - e.g., tracking patient outcomes, using data to improve program operations.</description>

    <description>MISSION-Vet has been developed to target mental health, substance abuse and related issues facing homeless Veterans through assertive outreach, psychoeducation and linkages to community-based resources. The core intervention utilized within MISSION-Vet is Critical Time Intervention (CTI), which addresses the situational and motivational barriers related to engagement in care and places a primary focus on housing placement and support. CTI is supplemented with thirteen manual-guided Dual Recovery Therapy (DRT) mental health and substance abuse psychoeducation sessions, delivered by a case manager, to address mental health and substance abuse issues. DRT sessions are intended to assist the Veteran with developing more self efficacy and motivation for maintaining sobriety and stability. We have also supplemented CTI by adding Peer Support Technicians (PSTs). PSTs can reduce in-patient utilization, substance abuse, social isolation and other symptoms by role modeling healthy behaviors.</description>
