  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the pharmacodynamic (PD) effects (Total Symptom Score
      (TSS) and its individual components: rhinorrhoea, nasal congestion, post-nasal drip) of
      intranasal, repeat dose SB-705498 in non-allergic rhinitis (NAR) patients elicited by a cold
      dry air challenge in an environmental exposure chamber (EEC). SB-705498 is a selective
      antagonist of the transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 (TRPV1) ligand gated ion channel.
      TRPV1 is a cation permeable ion channel that can be activated by several physiological
      factors, such as heat, protons (pH), osmotic stress, eicosanoid derivatives, anandamide, and
      by products of inflammation, such as histamine, prostaglandins and bradykinin. In the nose,
      the local TRPV1 expressing sensory C-fibres are thought to play a key role in the
      development of nasal hyper-responsiveness to environmental provocateurs. It has been
      proposed that blocking the nasal sensory nerve stimulation may control nasal
      hyper-responsiveness and therefore prevent the induction of rhinitis symptoms. In this
      context, preclinical evidence supports that targeting TRPV1 by SB-705498 may be an
      attractive option.

      In this study NAR patients will be randomised, in a double blind, placebo controlled cross
      over design to receive 14 day repeat doses of 12mg intra-nasal SB-705498 once daily. Whilst
      dosing at home, subjects will record symptom scores to document their symptoms. In addition,
      during visits to the clinical unit, acoustic rhinometry, quality of life questionnaires and
      safety assessments will be monitored.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Deviations from inclusion criteria are not allowed because they can potentially jeopardize
        the scientific integrity of the study, regulatory acceptability or subject safety.
        Therefore, adherence to the criteria as specified in the protocol is essential.

        A subject will be eligible for inclusion in this study only if all of the following
        criteria apply:

          1. Diagnosis of NAR, as determined by the presence of perennial rhinitis symptoms that
             last for several months per year, for more than 1 year and are not attributed to
             allergy, infections or nasal abnormalities. Positive history of rhinitis symptoms
             triggered by environmental provocateurs (e.g. weather changes, irritants, air
             pollution etc), but not allergens.

          2. Normal levels of total plasma IgE and negative allergy skin or Rast tests to common
             aeroallergens.

          3. Male or female between 18 and 65 years of age inclusive.

          4. A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of:

               -  Non-childbearing potential defined as pre-menopausal females with a \documented
                  tubal ligation or hysterectomy; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of
                  spontaneous amenorrhea [in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous
                  follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) &gt; 40 MlU/ml and estradiol &lt; 40 pg/ml (&lt;147
                  pmol/L) is confirmatory]. Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose
                  menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the contraception
                  methods in Section 8.1 if they wish to continue their HRT during the study.
                  Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of post-menopausal
                  status prior to study enrollment. For most forms of HRT, at least 2-4 weeks will
                  elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval
                  depends on the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of their
                  post-menopausal status, they can resume use of HRT during the study without use
                  of a contraceptive method.

               -  Child-bearing potential and agrees to use one of the contraception methods
                  listed in Section 8.1 for an appropriate period of time (as determined by the
                  product label or investigator) prior to the start of dosing to sufficiently
                  minimize the risk of pregnancy at that point. Female subjects must agree to use
                  contraception until 84 days post-last treatment administration.

          5. Male subjects with female partners of child-bearing potential must agree to use one
             of the contraception methods listed in Section 8.1. This criterion must be followed
             from the time of the first dose of study medication until 84 days post-last treatment
             administration.

          6. Body weight ≥ 50 kg (males) and ≥45kg (females) and BMI within the range 19 - 29.9
             kg/m2 (inclusive).

          7. Capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with the
             requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form.

          8. Available to complete all the required study measurements.

          9. Single QTc, &lt; 450 msec; or QTc &lt; 480 msec in subjects with Bundle Branch Block.

         10. The subject must demonstrate at screening TSS ≥ 4 (on a 9 point scale) at screening
             visits 1 and 2.

         11. AST and ALT &lt; 2xULN; alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5xULN
             (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct
             bilirubin &lt;35%).

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Deviations from exclusion criteria are not allowed because they can potentially jeopardise
        the scientific integrity of the study, regulatory acceptability or subject safety.
        Therefore, adherence to the criteria as specified in the protocol is essential.

        A subject will not be eligible for inclusion in this study if any of the following
        criteria apply:

          1. Nasal abnormalities likely to affect the outcome of the study, i.e. nasal septal
             perforation, nasal polyps, other nasal malformations.

          2. History of frequent nosebleeds.

          3. A positive pre-study Hepatitis B surface antigen or positive Hepatitis C antibody
             result within 3 months of screening

          4. Current or chronic history of liver disease, or known hepatic or biliary
             abnormalities (with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones).

          5. Positive pre-study drug/alcohol/smoking screen. A minimum list of drugs that will be
             screened for include amphetamines, barbiturates, cocaine, opiates, cannabinoids,
             benzodiazepines and methadone

          6. A positive test for HIV antibody.

          7. History of regular alcohol consumption within 6 months of the study defined as:

             • An average weekly intake of &gt;14 drinks for males or &gt;7 drinks for females. One
             drink is equivalent to 12 g of alcohol: 12 ounces (360 ml) of beer, 5 ounces (150 ml)
             of wine or 1.5 ounces (45 ml) of 80 proof distilled spirits.

          8. The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational
             product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current
             study: 30 days, 5 half-lives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the
             investigational product (whichever is longer).

          9. Exposure to more than four new chemical entities within 12 months prior to the first
             dosing day.

         10. Use of prescription or non-prescription drugs, including vitamins, herbal and dietary
             supplements (including St John's Wort) within 7 days prior to the first dose of study
             medication, unless in the opinion of the Investigator and GSK Medical Monitor the
             medication will not interfere with the study procedures or compromise subject safety.

             Subjects who are using some of the medications below on an as needed basis, may
             participate in the study if they remain free of medication for the following periods
             of time prior to each visit:
