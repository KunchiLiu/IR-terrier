  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to evaluate eribulin as adjuvant therapy in breast cancer patients
      who do not achieve pCR following standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Three cohorts of
      patients will be evaluated separately based on tumor type: triple-negative,
      hormone-receptor-positive/HER2-negative, and HER2-positive.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized, open-label trial to evaluate 6 cycles of eribulin in female
      patients with invasive breast cancer who do not achieve pathologic complete response (pCR)
      after treatment with a standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimen and surgery. Patients will
      be randomized into three cohorts according to tumor-type: triple-negative (Cohort A),
      hormone-receptor-positive/HER2-negative (Cohort B), and HER2-positive (Cohort C) tumors.
      Patients will receive eribulin for 6 cycles (1 cycle = 21 days). Patients with HER2-positive
      tumors will also receive trastuzumab; and patients in Cohort B will receive locoregional
      radiotherapy and/or adjuvant hormonal therapy per institutional guidelines. Up to 148
      patients are planned for enrollment.

          2. Histologically confirmed breast cancer prior to surgery with the following staging
             criteria: T1-T3, N0-N2, and M0 (T1N0M0 patients are excluded).

          3. Previous treatment with a minimum of 4 cycles of neoadjuvant anthracycline and/or

          4. Patients must be ≥ 21 days and ≤ 84 days from breast surgery and fully recovered.
             Patients may have had mastectomy or breast conservation surgery with axillary node
             dissection.

          5. Pathologic CR (pCR) not achieved following neoadjuvant treatment (i.e., residual
             invasive breast cancer (&gt;5 mm) in the breast or presence of nodal disease at surgery
             [ypT0, N1-N3a, M0 or ypT1b-T4, N0-N3a, M0].
