  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare two types of care - standard oncology care and
      standard oncology care with early palliative care (started soon after diagnosis) to see
      which is better for improving the experience of patients and families with advanced lung and
      non-colorectal GI cancer. The study will use questionnaires to measure patients' and
      caregivers' quality of life, mood, coping and understanding of their illness.

      Subjects and their caregiver will complete a baseline questionnaire and then be randomized
      to a study group.

      Subjects who are randomized to Standard Oncology Care will follow up with their treating
      oncologist. They will consult with the palliative care team at their request or at the
      request of the treating oncologist. They will complete questionnaires at 12 weeks and 24
      weeks after enrollment.

      Subjects who are randomized to the Standard Oncology Care with Early Palliative Care will
      meet with a palliative care clinician at their next medical oncology visit or infusion
      visit. They will meet with the palliative care clinician at least every three weeks. They
      will complete questionnaires at 12 and 24 weeks after enrollment.
