      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of concurrent versus sequential
      administration of abiraterone acetate plus prednisone on product parameters of sipuleucel-T,
      and to assess the safety and efficacy of sipuleucel-T with concurrent or sequential
      administration of abiraterone acetate plus prednisone in men with metastatic castrate
      resistant prostate cancer.
