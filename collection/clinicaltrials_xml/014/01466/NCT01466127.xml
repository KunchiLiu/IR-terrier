    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to learn how differences in learning under mildly-stressful
      circumstances may be changed by taking oxytocin. Oxytocin is a hormone made naturally in the
      body. The investigators will also examine the impact of any anxiety, depression, and stress
      related symptoms on learning processes.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Men or women 18 to 65 years of age

          -  Score in study range on the NEO-FFI

          -  No current Axis I DSM-IV excluded diagnoses as determined by the SCID completed
             within the past 4 months.

          -  Must be able and willing to understand study procedures and return to the clinic on
             two separate consecutive days for the fear-conditioning procedures.

          -  Subjects must be able to give informed consent and be willing and able to comply with
             study procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Presence of a current DSM-IV Axis I diagnosis as measured by the SCID.

          -  A serious medical condition or other condition deemed likely to result in surgery or
             hospitalization, or which would make participation in the study difficult.

          -  Patients with a history of trauma resulting in head injury related seizures or with
             epilepsy (except a prior history of febrile seizures of infancy which are not
             exclusionary).

          -  Use of supplemental hormones (birth control, estrogen, testosterone, prednisone, etc)
             or narcotics.
