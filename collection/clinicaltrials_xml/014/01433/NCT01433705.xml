    <textblock>
      Establish the normal distributions of Rb-82, N-13 ammonia, and F-18 FDG (radioactively
      labelled tracers) in the heart using PET imaging for subsequent use in the evaluation of
      clinical patient studies using these procedures.

      Normal healthy volunteers will be extensively screened for this study. Subjects will be
      given IV administration of Rb-82 and N-13 to acquire rest/stress imaging. Normal subjects
      not excluded by any unexpected abnormality during the Rb-82 or N-13 rest/stress studies will
      undergo a glucose loading F-18 FDG imaging protocol, viability protocol using the
      hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp with simultaneous IV infusions of dextrose and insulin
      according to standard procedures in our laboratory. These same individuals will also undergo
      an inflammation F-18 FDG protocol after following a high fat, protein permitted, no
      carbohydrate diet for approximately 30 hours prior to F-18 FDG injection. The F-18 FDG
      radiotracer will be administered IV per protocol.

    <textblock>
      Cardiac rubidium-82(Rb-82)and N-13 ammonia heart perfusion (blood flow) studies and
      florine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (F-18FDG) heart PET glucose metabolism studies are important
      tools for the evaluation of patients with coronary heart disease.

      This includes patients with known or suspected heart disease and patients with congestive
      heart failure following myocardial infarction (heart attack) with indeterminant assessments
      of cardiac health from other imaging modalities, for example SPECT perfusion imaging and
      echocardiography.

      These studies help physicians plan potentially life saving procedures to re-establish
      coronary blood flow to living but severly compromised heart muscle. Rb-82 and N-13 ammonia
      studies can tell if there is reduced blood flow to the heart muscle either at rest or during
      stress. FDG studies can tell whether there is any chance of a beneficial effect from
      coronary revascularization procedures, for example coronary angioplasties and stents or
      coronary artery bypass. Revascularization procedures in patients like these may be
      technically difficult, risky and costly. Unfortunately the normal cardiac distributions of
      Rb-82, N-13 and ammonia, and F-18FDG for computer analysis of human studies are not well
      known and what is known is not widely available for clinical use. The latest imaging
      guidelines from the American Society of Nuclear Cardiology recommend that Rb-82, N-13
      ammonia, and FDG cardiac studies be compared to normal distributions or patterns of these
      radiotracers in the heart developed from a series of normal individuals.

      The purpose for these studies is to generate databases of normal Rb-82, N-13 ammonia, and
      F-18FDG cardiac distributions so that they can be used in the analysis of clinical patient
      studies at the University of Michigan Hospital.

    <description>Intravenous administration of Rb-82 and N-13. Images will be acquired according to standard clinical imaging protocol and reviewed. Patient will be connected to an EKG machine to monitor the heart. Blood pressure will be monitored as well. For Rb-82 images, 40 mCi (millicuries are a measurement of radioactivity) will be used. For N-13 ammonia images, 20 mCi (millicuries) will be used. Acquisition time for both rest and stress studies should take about 30 min.</description>

When metabolically prepared with the viability protocol and the inflammation protocol (two separate days), 10 mCi (millicuries) of F-18 FDG will be administered IV per FDG protocols, via heparin lock. 40-60 minutes after FDG injections PET imaging will be performed according to standard clinical imaging protocol.</description>
