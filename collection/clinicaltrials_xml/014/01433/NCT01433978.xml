      Core study:

      To compare the efficacy of avatrombopag (in addition to standard) of care to eltrombopag (in
      addition to standard of care) for the treatment of adult participants with chronic immune
      thrombocytopenia (idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura [ITP]) as measured by durable platelet
      response.

      Open-label Extension Phase:

      To evaluate the safety and tolerability of long-term therapy with avatrombopag in
      participants with chronic ITP (cITP).

      The study consisted of three phases: Prerandomization, Randomization (Core Study) and
      Extension Phase. Participants 18 years of age and over, who meet all the eligibility
      requirements, were randomized into the study. It was required that splenectomized
      participants made up at least 35% of the study population and no single platelet count was
      greater than 35x10^9/L. Participants were centrally stratified at randomization by
      splenectomy status, baseline platelet count, and use of concomitant ITP medication at
      baseline and were randomized to receive either double-blind avatrombopag or eltrombopag in a
      1:1 ratio. Participants received blinded therapy at a starting dose of 20 mg avatrombopag
      once daily or 50 mg eltrombopag once daily. Participants were allowed to have their dose
      titrated up (maximum dose 40 mg avatrombopag and 75 mg for eltrombopag) or down (minimum
      dose 5 mg for avatrombopag and 25 mg for eltrombopag) depending on their response to study
      drug. The goal of dose modification was to maintain the platelet count at levels greater
      than or equal to 50x10^9/L and less than or equal to 150x10^9/L, and to decrease the need
      for ITP-directed concomitant medications. The duration of treatment in the Core study and
      the Extension Phase is approximately 26 and 104 weeks, respectively.

    <description>Participants who met the eligibility requirements for the Open-label Extension (OLE) Phase or who discontinued the Core Study early because of lack of treatment effect were eligible to continue into the OLE Phase for up to 104 weeks of open-label avatrombopag therapy. Participants entering the OLE from the Core Study received a starting dose of open-label avatrombopag that was determined by the last dose of study drug at the End of Treatment (EOT) Visit (Visit 22) of the Core Study. Participants who discontinued the Core Study early because of lack of treatment effect and entered the OLE received open-label avatrombopag at a starting dose of 20 mg once daily of open-label avatrombopag.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Men and women greater than or equal to 18 years of age.

          2. Participants diagnosed with cITP (greater than or equal to 12 months duration)

             Hematology (ASH/BCSH) guidelines, and an average of 2 platelet counts less than
             30x10^9/L). The physical exam should not suggest any disease which may cause
             thrombocytopenia other than ITP.

          3. Participants who previously received one or more ITP therapies (including, but not
             limited to corticosteroids, immunoglobulins, azathioprine, danazol, cyclophosphamide
             and/or rituximab).

          4. Participants must have had either initially responded (platelet count greater than
             50x10^9/L) to a previous ITP therapy or have had a bone marrow examination consistent
             with ITP within 3 years to rule out myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or other causes of
             thrombocytopenia.

          5. Prothrombin time/International Normalized Ratio (PT/INR) and activated partial
             thromboplastin time (aPTT) must have been within 80% to 120% of the normal range with
             no history of hypercoagulable state.

          6. A complete blood count within the reference range (including white blood count [WBC]
             differential not indicative of a disorder other than ITP), with the following
             exceptions: a) Hemoglobin: participants with hemoglobin levels between 10 g/dL (100
             g/L) and the lower limit of normal (LLN) are eligible for inclusion, if anemia was
             clearly attributable to ITP (excessive blood loss); b) Absolute neutrophil count
             (ANC) greater than or equal to 1500/uL (1.5x10^9/L) (elevated WBC/ANC due to
             corticosteroid treatment is acceptable).
