  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Schizophrenia is a devastating and costly illness. One-third to one-half of people with
      schizophrenia do not respond to the most current drugs leaving clozapine as the best
      alternative for treatment. However, over 60% of people treated with clozapine continue to
      have persistent symptoms and cognitive impairments. Little data is available to support
      evidence-based recommendations to guide clinicians in treating these patients. Preliminary
      data has suggested that adjunct treatment with minocycline may offer robust symptom
      improvement in patients with schizophrenia, including those taking clozapine. Minocycline
      has had interesting effects; including suggesting it may have a significant role in
      treatment of neurologic and psychiatric disorders. Minocycline is currently available
      generically; its side effects are well-described and minimal. The proposed double-blind
      treatment study seeks to demonstrate that adjunctive minocycline offers patients superior
      efficacy for persistent positive symptoms, cognitive impairments, and/or other components of
      schizophrenia pathology. This knowledge could lead to the more effective treatment of
      patients with schizophrenia. The research itself may lead to a better understanding of the
      pathophysiology of positive symptoms and cognitive impairments, which could contribute to
      improved treatments in the future.

    <time_frame>10 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Adjunct minocycline to clozapine will be compared to placebo to test its efficacy to improve positive psychotic symptoms. The 4 item positive subfactor of the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) will be the primary outcome over the 10 week randomized study.</description>

    <time_frame>10 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Adjunct minocycline to clozapine will be compared to placebo to test its efficacy in improving cognitive function. Neuropsychological testing will be done at baseline and endpoint using the MATRICS battery. A composite score as well as individual scores will be will be the primary outcome over the 10 week randomized study.</description>

    <measure>The efficacy of minocycline compared to placebo to improve negative symptoms.</measure>
    <time_frame>10 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Adjunct minocycline to clozapine will be compared to placebo to test its efficacy in improving negative symptoms of schizophrenia. The Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS) will be used to test changes in the total SANS score in adjunct minocycline compared to placebo in the 10 week study.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The effect of minocycline on inflammatory biomarkers associated with schizophrenia.</measure>
    <time_frame>10 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Both pro and anti-inflammatory cytokines will be drawn at baseline and endpoint. We will test to see if minocycline is associated with improvements in abnormal cytokines as compared to placebo.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The safety of adjunct minocycline compared to placebo as defined by reported side effects, laboratory findings and extrapyramidal symptoms.</measure>
    <time_frame>10 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>We will examine side effect reports by a standardized side effect checklist, various laboratory measures (hepatic, kidney, blood) and use the Simpson Angus Scale and Barnes Akathisia Scale to measure extrapyramidal side effects. We hypothesize that side effects rates will be similar to placebo. Additionally we will closely watch for skin pigmentation.</description>

    <measure>The efficacy of adjunct minocycline to placebo to improve depressive symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>10 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The total score of the Calgary Depression Rating Scale will be used to examine the efficacy of minocycline compared to placebo in improving depressive symptoms.</description>

    <measure>The effect of adjunct minocycline to placebo on global clinical improvement of symptoms.</measure>

    <measure>The efficacy of adjunct minocycline compared to placebo on perceived health quality and general well being.</measure>
    <time_frame>10 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>We will use the Short Form 36 Health Survey and the Psychological General Well Being Schedule to measure changes. We hypothesize that minocycline will be superior to placebo.</description>

    <description>Minocycline Dosing:
Minocycline (Dynacin® or generic) will be available in 50, 75 and 100 mg capsules. There will be matched placebo-minocycline capsules for each minocycline capsule strength. During the first week subjects will receive one 50 mg capsule twice per day (minocycline 100 mg total or matching placebo) and during weeks 2-10 subjects will receive 2- 50 mg capsules twice per day If a subject should complain of any side effect, then the blind psychiatrist will be allowed to omit the next dose of study medication and then continue the subject on the optimal treatment dose. If, despite this intervention, the subject is still unable to tolerate the 200 mg/day dose, then the dose may be lowered to 150 mg to alleviate side effects and minimize attrition.</description>
