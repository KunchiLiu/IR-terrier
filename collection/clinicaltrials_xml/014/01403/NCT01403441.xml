      This study is designed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of an investigational
      procedure for treating people with treatment resistant bipolar depression. Precise dose
      delivery of radiation to the predetermined targets in the brain will be accomplished with
      known Cyberknife stereotactive radiosurgery methods.. This technology is considered to be
      noninvasive (does not physically invade your body). We will be studying if the Cyberknife
      influences the sensitivity of certain nerves of your brain. Although many clinical
      treatments for psychiatric conditions have been done using stereotactive radiosurgery, the
      present study is experimental, because we are seeking to use more moderate doses of
      radiation that are intended not to destroy any brain cells, but to normalize or modulate
      their function.

      Main objective: To determine the safety of Radiosurgical Neuromodulation (RSN) for
      Refractory Depression using X-rays in a population of subjects with severe treatment
      resistant bipolar depression over a 12-month observational period post treatment. While
      almost any radiosurgical device could be used, the research team has extensive experience
      with the Accuray CyberKnife System, K011024, and it will be used for planning and delivery
      of the 6MV X-ray treatment for this study.

      Participation will be dependent upon subjects having a diagnosis of bipolar depression and
      meeting criteria for treatment resistance. Treatment resistance will be defined as a failure
      to show clinical improvement after at least four different medication trials and/or one
      course of ECT during the current episode. A medication trial is defined as an adequate dose
      and duration of one of four classes of psychoactive medications: lithium, anticonvulsant
      mood stabilizers, atypical antipsychotic mood stabilizers, and/or antidepressant
      medications. One course of ECT is defined as receiving six acute treatments. The study will
      include subjects who have failed ECT, or have had intolerable side effects to ECT, or
      elected not to receive such treatment due to stigma, or concern over possible side effects
      of the ECT treatment itself. The subjects enrolled will have exhausted all reasonable
      treatment strategies, and currently have no other reasonable or viable treatment options for
      their illness.

      Secondary objective: To examine clinical outcome initially over 3 months, then with follow
      up at 6, 9 and 12 months. Depression will be assessed using the Hamilton Depression Rating
      Scale (HDRS) 24 item, while manic symptoms will be measured by using the Young Mania Rating
      Scale (YMRS), and the Clinical Global Impression of Severity of illness (CGI-S), and
      Improvement (CGI-I). A battery of neuropsychological tests will be administered as well,
      assessing memory with the California Verbal Learning Task (CVLT), prefrontal function using
      a DKEFS battery including the DKEFS Sorting task, DKEFS Trails task, DKEFS color-word
      interference task, and the DKEFS verbal fluency task. In addition, the investigators will
      request information regarding any possible adverse events that occur during this trial.

      The intended use for the CyberKnife System, the radiosurgical device being used in this
      research study, is to administer radiomodulaton to the cingulate cortex target Cg25 in
      patients with refractory bipolar depression.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        In order to be eligible to participate, all patients must meet the following criteria:

          -  Men and women 22-65 years of age

          -  Primary diagnosis of bipolar depression, as per DSM IV-TR criteria

          -  The current major depressive episode has been for at least one year

          -  HDRS-24 item greater than or equal to 20

          -  Negative urine pregnancy in female subjects

          -  No current psychotic symptoms

          -  No comorbid post traumatic stress disorder, the inclusion of subjects with other
             psychiatric comorbidity will be determined by the investigator prior to enrollment

          -  No personality disorder that in the opinion of the investigator may compromise the
             subjects ability to participate and be compliant with the elements and procedures of
