  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is a unique form of accelerated plaque formation seen
      in the coronary arteries of patients who have received heart transplantation. It is a major
      cause of morbidity and mortality in patients after heart transplant. Little progress has
      been made in characterizing this disease process, with more sophisticated imaging allowing
      for more detailed analysis of CAV, superior stratification of transplant recipients is
      possible and earlier interventions can be performed if necessary to prevent mortality and
      graft loss.

      Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is a novel imaging modality with much higher resolution
      then Intra-Vascular Ultrasound (IVUS). This study will involve examining patients post-heart
      transplant using this high-resolution imaging modality. It is currently the standard care
      for patients post-heart transplant to receive annual coronary angiograms with close follow
      up. Patients will be imaged using OCT at the time of their routine annual angiogram, and
      will be re-imaged one year later at the time of the next annual angiogram or earlier if
      clinically indicated. The study goal is to better characterize CAV in vivo with OCT imaging
      and to try to identify patterns of the disease, including intra-coronary risk assessment.

      This is a descriptive, pilot study involving the use of Galectin 3 biomarker, Optical
      Coherence Tomography in patients post-heart transplant with suspected Cardiac allograft
      vasculopathy. This study will involve imaging up to 100 patients at different points in time
      post heart transplant, with various degrees of disease and with different lesion subtypes.
      Imaging will take place at the time of routine coronary angiogram, which is standard of care
      in this patient population,or when clinically indicated. Additionally, these patients will
      be re-imaged with OCT during their next clinically indicated cardiac catheterization. A
      one-time blood draw will take place at one of the routine coronary angiogram visits. We will
      attempt to have imaging of all 3 major epicardial coronary arteries. In prior studies using
      IVUS todetect CAV, the yield was significantly higher with multi-vessels imaged.21, There
      will be a one-time blood draw either at baseline or during the routine reimaging. A total of
      1 ml (about 5 tsps.) of blood will be collected and stored in an -80 freezer for up 1 year
      but will not be used for other research purposes. The tubes will be labeled with a numeric
      code and subject initials. Samples will be analyzed for Galectin 3 biomarker. Previously
      enrolled subjects will be re-consented prior to collecting the blood s ample.

      Study Drugs or Devices OCT is an intravascular light-based imaging modality that measures
      the intensity of reflected light waves and converts these echoes into a high-resolution
      tomographic image.24 It is a catheter-based invasive imaging system analogous to IVUS but
      uses light as opposed to ultrasound to generate in vivo images of coronary arteries. It has
      the highest resolution of any intravascular imaging modality, capable of obtaining detailed
      cross-sectional images of coronary arteries in vivo at a resolution of 10 um or near
      histologic.24-27 This device, which is FDA approved for intracoronary evaluation, has been
      used in evaluating patients with coronary artery disease, specifically for plaque
      composition analysis, as well as for proper stent deployment after percutaneous
      intervention.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Post heart transplant patients

          -  Patients presenting for their routine annual or clinically indicated coronary
             angiogram post-heart transplant. The decision for coronary angiogram will be made by
             the treating physician from the heart-failure-transplant team (not by the physician
             who will do the angiogram)

          -  Clinically suspect or evidence of CAV in previous coronary angiogram

          -  Age &gt; 18

          -  Written informed-consent obtained

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any complications that occur during routine biopsy of the coronary arteries during
             the same cath-lab visit

          -  Baseline renal failure with Cr &gt; 1.8

          -  Contraindication for anticoagulation

          -  Any other condition that in the opinion of the investigators would alter the safety
             of participation, or interfere with the ability to adhere to study procedures.
