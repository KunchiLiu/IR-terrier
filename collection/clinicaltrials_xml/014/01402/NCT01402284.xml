  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      - Carfilzomib is an experimental anti-cancer drug that has not yet been approved for
      treating multiple myeloma. Lenalidomide is a drug that may stop tumor growth and help the
      immune system kill cancer cells. Dexamethasone is a drug that helps stop inflammation. It is
      sometimes used to treat (alone or with other drugs) certain types of cancer, especially
      multiple myeloma. This combination of drugs has not been tested in people with multiple
      myeloma. Researchers want to see whether it is safe and effective for this group.

      Objectives:

      - To test the effectiveness of combined carfilzomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone in
      treating multiple myeloma.

      Eligibility:

      - People at least 18 years of age who have multiple myeloma that has not been treated.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a medical history and physical exam. They will also
           have blood and urine tests, a bone marrow sample, and molecular imaging studies.

        -  Participants will have eight 28-day cycles of treatment. The combined study drugs will
           be given as tablets and injections. Those in the study will be monitored with frequent
           blood tests, bone marrow samples, and molecular imaging studies. In addition to current
           standard measures to determine clinical responses, molecular tests will be conducted to
           define evidence of minimal residual disease.

        -  After the first four cycles of therapy, those who are eligible for a stem cell
           transplant will have stem cells collected and stored for use if the cancer returns.

        -  After stem cell collection, participants will have the second four treatment cycles.

           -, If the disease has improved or is stable at the end of eight cycles, those in the
           study may have another 12 cycles of low-dose (maintenance) lenalidomide alone.

        -  Participants will have regular follow-up visits after the end of the study
           chemotherapy.

      Background:

        -  Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable plasma cell neoplasm with a median survival of
           3-4 years.

        -  Novel agent combinations with proteasome inhibitors demonstrate improved response rates
           while increasing survival in MM patients.

        -  A common debilitating side effect of the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib is neuropathy.

        -  Carfilzomib is a new proteasome inhibitor with potent anti-MM effects and decreased
           peripheral neuropathy

      Objectives:

      -Evaluate toxicity, including peripheral neuropathy, of carfilzomib, lenalidomide, and
      dexamethasone (CRd) in untreated MM patients

      Eligibility:

        -  Newly diagnosed patients with histologically confirmed multiple myeloma

        -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years

        -  Creatinine Clearance (CrCl) greater than or equal to 60 ml/min. CrCl will be calculated
           using the Cockcroft- Gault method. If the calculated CrCl based on Cockcroft-Gault
           method is &lt;60 mL/min, patient will have a 24 hr urine collection to measure CrCl. The
           measured CrCl must also be greater than or equal to 60 ml/min.

        -  Without serious co-morbidity that would interfere with receipt of CRd

        -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater than or equal to 1.0 K/uL, hemoglobin greater
           than or equal to 8 g/dL, and platelet count greater than or equal to 75 K/uL

        -  Adequate hepatic function, with bilirubin less than 1.5 x the ULN, and AST and ALT less
           than 3.0 x ULN

      Design:

        -  Single arm, single stage phase II trial of combination therapy (carfilzomib,
           lenalidomide, and dexamethasone) for untreated multiple myeloma patients with an early
           stopping rule for toxicity

        -  Patients will receive 8 cycles of induction combination therapy of CRd

        -  Each cycle consists of 28-days

        -  After 4 cycles of therapy, transplant eligible patients will undergo stem cell
           collection

        -  Patients achieving stable disease or better after 8 cycles of CRd will receive
           lenalidomide extended dosing (phase I) for 12 cycles. After 12 cycles, patients will
           have the option to continue extended dosing (phase II) for one additional year.

        -  Patients will have routine blood work with SPEP and free light chains monthly

        -  Pre- and post-treatment bone marrow biopsies will be obtained for confirmation of
           diagnosis and correlative studies

        -  Patients will also undergo evaluation for minimal residual disease at regular interval
           time points, using multi-parametric flow cytometry and FDG PET-CT

        -  A single stage phase II design will be employed, with an early stopping rule. Unless 4
           or more patients in the first 20 have Grade 3 or higher neurologic toxicity in the
           first 2 completed cycles, a total of 45 evaluable patients will be enrolled in this
           study.

             measure CrCl. The measured CrCl msut be also greater than or equal to 60 ml/min.

          -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are
             currently available on the use of carfilzomib in combination with lenalidomide in
             patients less than18 years of age, children are excluded from this study, but will be
             eligible for future pediatric trials.

             commit to continued abstinence from heterosexual intercourse or begin TWO acceptable
             methods of birth control, one highly effective method and one additional effective
             method AT THE SAME TIME, at least 28 days before she starts taking lenalidomide. FCBP
             must also agree to ongoing pregnancy testing. Men must agree to use a latex condom

          -  Contraindication to any concomitant medication, including antivirals, anticoagulation
             prophylaxis, tumor lysis prophylaxis, or hydration given prior to therapy

          -  Major surgery within 1 month prior to enrollment

          -  Recruitment Strategies:

               -  Patients that progress from the SMM and MGUS Natural History Study (NCI
                  Protocol: 10-C-0096) will be potential candidates.

               -  Other participant sources will be from outside physician referrals.

               -  Our ongoing natural history study and outside physician referral network has a
