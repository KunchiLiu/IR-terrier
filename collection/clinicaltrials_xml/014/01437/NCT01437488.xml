  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is no accepted standard chemotherapy approved for use in the second line for patients
      with advanced urothelial carcinoma whose cancer has progressed on combination chemotherapy
      including either cisplatin or carboplatin. The chemotherapy class called taxanes, either as
      single agents or in combination, have demonstrated modest efficacy in small studies.
      Cabazitaxel is an agent in the taxane family designed to be active in the setting of
      acquired multi-drug resistance that arises in some tumors. The objective of this study is to
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of this agent in patients with urothelial carcinoma
      refractory compared to combination platinum based chemotherapy.

      This is a single-arm, open-label study, meaning all patients will be treated in the same
      fashion with the investigational agent. Scans will be performed every 3 cycles of treatment,
      and patients will be withdrawn from study in the event of progression or drug intolerance as
      defined within the protocol.

      Treatment will be administered on an outpatient basis. No investigational or commercial
      agents or therapies other than those described below may be administered with the intent to
      treat the patient's malignancy.

      The length of each cycle is 21 days. For the first cycle of treatment, cabazitaxel will be
      dosed at 20 mg/m2. During cycle 1, complete blood counts will be performed on days 8 and 15,
      and dosing on Day 1 cycle 2 will depend upon the nadir counts on those days. If, on toxicity
      assessment on day 1 of cycle 2, the patient has no residual &gt;grade 2 toxicity, and all other
      laboratory parameters are within acceptable limits (see below),at the investigator's
      discretion the dose can be escalated to 25 mg/m2. 25 mg/m2 is the FDA (Food and Drug
      Administration)-approved dose for prostate cancer. Neulasta will be given with each dose of
      cabazitaxel to decrease the risk of febrile neutropenic complication.
