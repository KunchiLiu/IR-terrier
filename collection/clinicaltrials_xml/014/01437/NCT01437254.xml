    <textblock>
      Patients who have had a thyroidectomy for cancer routinely have a Tc-99m Pertechnetate
      [GPERT] scan at the Cross Cancer Institute to check for thyroid tissue remnants prior to
      radioactive iodine therapy. The first 10 subjects will receive one CPTERT [cyclotron made]
      Tc-99m Pertechnetate scan after surgery. Vital signs and blood work, pre-injection and
      post-imaging will be done. The second group of 20 subjects (2 for each CPERT subject) will
      be matched as to age and gender and have a GPERT scan for qualitative comparison.

      The Canadian Government supports R&amp;D into alternative methods of medical isotope production
      that [1] do not require the construction of new nuclear reactors, [2] are not dependent on
      government subsidies and [3] will lead to a RP market. The cyclotron production model of
      pertechnetate (CPERT) has received significant validation. The University of Alberta's
      Edmonton PET Center and the ERC is a cyclotron/radiopharmacy unit, providing a safe, cost
      effective, unsubsidized and reliable supply of RPs.
