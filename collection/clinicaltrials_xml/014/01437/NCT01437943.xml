  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of a short-term aliskiren treatment on
      kidney metabolism in patients at high risk for developing kidney dysfunction (i.e. kidney
      transplanted patients). The study is aimed at evaluating if any effect on kidney metabolism
      [using proton MR Spectroscopy(1H-MRS)] can be detected following a 6 months treatment with
      aliskiren regardless of its anti-hypertensive role. 1H-MRS can record a larger number of
      chemical species (up to 40) in the kidney, and monitor changes according to the pathologic
      state and health of the transplanted kidney.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Stable patients with end stage renal disease receiving cadaveric kidney
             transplantation will be enrolled. Patients must have at least 6 months of follow-up
             to be included in the study. Patients must have stable creatinine levels in the last
             6 months (no change&gt;0.5 mg/dl).

          -  Patients with a systolic blood pressure of 120 or above

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Serum potassium &gt; 5.0 mmol/L (at the visit directly preceding Randomization);

          -  History of any cardiovascular event (stroke, TIA, MI, unstable angina, CABG,
             percutaneous coronary intervention, hospitalization due to HF) during the 3 months
             prior to Visit 1. If a patient experiences such an event between Visit 1 and
             randomization at Visit 3, he/she should be withdrawn from the screening phase. If
             suitable, the patient can be re-screened at a later stage;

          -  Hypertension (at enrollment): any patient with msSBP ≥ 170 mmHg or msDBP ≥ 110 mmHg;

          -  Congestive heart failure NYHA class III and IV;

          -  Concomitant treatment with two (2) or more renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system
             blocking agents, e.g. ACEI, ARB or aldosterone-antagonist;

          -  Unstable serum creatinine, no patients with creatinine &gt;2.5 mg/dl will be enrolled;

          -  Second (II) or third (III) degree heart block without a pacemaker;

          -  Concurrent potentially life threatening arrhythmia or other uncontrolled arrhythmia;

          -  Clinically significant valvular heart disease;

          -  Known renal artery stenosis;

          -  Any surgical or medical condition which might significantly alter the absorption,
             distribution, metabolism, or excretion of the study drugs including, but not limited
             to, any of the following: (i) History of major gastrointestinal tract surgery such as
             gastrectomy, gastroenterostomy, or bowel resection (patients with previous bariatric

             pancreatic injury, pancreatitis or evidence of impaired pancreatic function/injury as
             indicated by abnormal lipase or amylase; (iii) Evidence of hepatic disease as

             completing the study.

          -  History of hypersensitivity to any of the study drugs or to medications belonging to
