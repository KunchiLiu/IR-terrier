      This study is a Phase 2a, open-label, dose-ranging study of the safety and effectiveness of
      AA4500 for the treatment of adhesive capsulitis of the shoulder. To be eligible for
      treatment, a subject must have unilateral idiopathic adhesive capsulitis of the shoulder
      with restricted range of motion in the affected shoulder for at least 3 months but not more
      than 12 months. Subjects will be screened for study eligibility within 30 days before
      injection of study drug.

      Approximately 50 adult women and men are to be enrolled in this study. Following screening
      and determination of study eligibility, Assignment to Cohorts 1-4 is sequential. Subjects
      assigned to Cohorts 1 through 4 may receive up to 3 injections of AA4500 according to cohort
      assignment. Each injection will be separated by a minimum of 21 days. Subjects assigned to
      Cohort 5 will receive home shoulder exercises only, while subjects assigned to Cohorts 1-4
      will receive AA4500 and home shoulder exercises. Subjects in Cohort 5 will be offered
      physical therapy sessions for a period of 2 months following completion of the study.

      Dosing will range from 0.29 mg to 0.58 mg with varying volumes.
