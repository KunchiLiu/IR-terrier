  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this follow-up study is to determine if cinnamon can restore
      menstrual cyclicity in Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) subjects with oligomenorrhea. As a
      secondary purpose, the investigators intend to confirm the salutatory effect of cinnamon on
      insulin resistance in larger group of study subjects.

      Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a very common condition found in women of childbearing
      age. PCOS patients often have irregular periods, extra hair growth, or difficulty becoming
      pregnant. The syndrome can also be associated with more serious conditions such as heart
      disease, diabetes, or cancer of the uterus. Although no one knows the cause of the syndrome,
      scientific studies showed that having too much insulin can be one of the reasons. In fact,
      almost every overweight woman with PCOS has been found to have high insulin levels.

      Recently studies using rats and mice have shown that a commonly used spice, cinnamon, may
      also reduce the body's insulin level. Another study showed that daily use of cinnamon for
      forty days lowered the blood sugar level in patients with diabetes. Our own study also
      showed that using cinnamon everyday for 8 weeks decreased insulin resistance in women with
      PCOS. The purpose of this study is to see if cinnamon can help women with PCOS have more
      regular periods.

      All patients will eat a balanced diet containing 1800 calories per day, but half of the
      patients in the study will take pre-made cinnamon extract pills three times a day, while the
      other half will take placebo pills (pills with no cinnamon extract) three times a day for 6
      months. During this time, every patient will keep track of her period on a calendar.

      Blood tests measuring insulin, substances important for insulin action, cholesterol, and
      glucose (sugar) will be taken before and after the 6 months of medication. A total of 8
      separate visits will be needed to finish the study. At the end of the study, the
      investigators will then compare the number of periods, blood glucose, insulin, and
      cholesterol levels between the patients that took cinnamon and the patients that took
      placebo.
