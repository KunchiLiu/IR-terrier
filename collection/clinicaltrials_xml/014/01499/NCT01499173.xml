      Getting to the hospital quickly is the key to treating stroke. African Americans suffer more
      strokes with worse outcomes and receive stroke treatments less often than European
      Americans. This project will work to reduce these health disparities by creating and testing
      the feasibility of a peer-led faith-based behavioral intervention in an African American
      community with a goal to increase calls to 911 so stroke patients can be treated quickly.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        To meet participant eligibility criteria, individuals must be 18 years of age or older
        (adult intervention) or between 10-17 years of age (youth intervention), a resident of the
        Flint or greater Flint community, and English speaking.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        We will attempt to exclude those who cannot read English because they will not be able to
        benefit from the intervention materials. These criteria will be confirmed during
        assessment procedures prior to enrollment.
