  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      About a third of patients with breast cancer are usually treated by hormone pills called
      tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors. Aromatase inhibitors are drugs that stop female hormone
      production. Female hormone or estrogen is an important hormone for the growth of breast
      cancer cells. Letrozole is one of the aromatase inhibitors that is approved by the FDA and
      has been used to treat breast cancer since 1997. However, hormone pills usually work for
      about 6-10 months in most patients. Later on, breast cancer will start to grow again. This
      condition when hormone pills or endocrine therapy no longer work is called &quot;endocrine
      resistant&quot; breast cancer. The scientists here at University of Maryland have discovered how
      these cancer cells can become resistant to hormone pills. In our laboratory tests, the
      investigators found that lapatinib and everolimus can reverse this resistance and make
      letrozole work again. However, it is not known if the drugs can reverse the resistance in
      humans.

      The purpose of this study is to find out whether the combination of letrozole, lapatinib,
      and everolimus is effective in women with breast cancer when hormone pills no longer work.

      Lapatinib is an anti-cancer drug that is already approved by the Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA). It is the standard of care for the treatment of a particular type of
      breast cancer called human epithelial growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast
      cancer. HER2 is a protein involved in the growth of some cancer cells. This study will also
      include patients with HER2-negative breast cancer. This means that the cancer cells in these
      patients do not depend on the HER2 protein. The use of lapatinib in these patients is
      considered experimental.

      Everolimus is also an anti-cancer drug that is approved by the FDA for kidney cancer.
      Initial studies in mice and later studies in women with breast cancer have shown that
      everolimus may also slow the growth of breast cancer. The use of everolimus is experimental
      in this study.

      This is a single-institution clinical trial. Patients will be stratified according to the
      HER2 status:

      Group 1: HER2-positive in the tumor tissue Group 2: HER2 negative in the tumor tissue

      In the first part of the study, all of the patients will receive the combination of
      lapatinib 1,500 mg/day and letrozole 2.5 mg/day. We do not expect any significant toxicity
      from this combination since the previous study of lapatinib and letrozole showed that this
      combination is safe with no grade 3-4 toxicities observed. Restaging scans (CT scan, MRI, or
      bone scan) will be obtained after every 12 weeks of treatment. In those patients who
      progress from any group, everolimus 5 mg/day will be added to letrozole and lapatinib will
      be reduced to 1,250 mg/day as per the SWOG phase I study of lapatinib and everolimus. The
      outcome of each group will continue to be assessed separately. We do not expect to see
      additional serious toxicity from adding everolimus to the combination of lapatinib and
      letrozole. All of the treatment will be continued until disease progression.
