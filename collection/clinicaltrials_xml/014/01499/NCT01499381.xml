    <textblock>
      The objective of this multi-center prospective observational clinical study is to evaluate
      the clinical performance of the Carisome Prostate assay as an aid in the diagnosis of
      prostate cancer in men that have been scheduled for a prostate biopsy. Primarily, results of
      the Carisome Prostate assay will be compared with pathology results of prostate biopsy
      procedures. Secondarily, the performance of the Carisome Prostate test will be compared to
      the current standard of care for the detection of prostate cancer.
