  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      BAY94-9343 is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) directed against the cancer antigen
      mesothelin on tumor cells. This study will attempt to answer the following questions:

        -  What are the side effects of BAY94-9343 when given at different dose levels and
           schedules?

        -  What dose level and schedule of BAY94-9343 should be tested in future clinical research
           studies?

        -  How much BAY94-9343 is in the blood at specific times after administration?

        -  Does the treatment with BAY94-9343 show any effect on the tumor growth?

        -  Are there specific biomarkers that might be able to explain why some patients respond
           to treatment and others do not?

             mesothelioma.

             -- Ovarian cancer must have relapsed &gt;0 months and ≤ 12 months of the prior
             platinum-based chemotherapy regimen (platinum resistant and partially platinum
             sensitive).

          -  All patients must provide the tumor tissue sample [Formalin Fixed Paraffin Embedded
             (FFPE) slides] from archival tissue or fresh biopsy collected any time before the

          -  Mesothelin expression in the tumor tissue from archival or fresh biopsy samples
             defined as the membrane intensity score of 2+ or 3+ (on the 0-3 scale) expressed on
             at least 30% of tumor cells.

             -- Mesothelin expression must be determined by the validated Investigational Use Only
             (IUO) assay for ovarian cancer or the prototype immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay for
             mesothelioma at Ventana at any time before the general screening in patients who had
             signed a separate informed consent for tumor tissue analysis for mesothelin
             expression.

             peritoneal or pleural mesothelioma

             cancer

             Expert.

          -  Intraperitoneal administration of cytotoxic anticancer agents during tumor surgery
             will not count as systemic cytotoxic therapy in this context.

          -  Prior local radiotherapy is allowed if it is completed at least 4 weeks prior to the

          -  Anticancer chemotherapy, experimental cancer therapy, or immunotherapy within 2 weeks
             of start of first dose. Anticancer therapy is defined as any agent or combination of

          -  Radiotherapy to the target lesions within 4 weeks prior to the first BAY94-9343

          -  Use of strong inhibitors of P-glycoprotein (transporter) (P-gp) (e.g., ritonavir,
             cyclosporine, verapamil, and dronedarone) is prohibited from Day -14 and for the
             duration of the study.

          -  Impaired cardiac function or clinically significant cardiac disease [i.e., congestive
             heart failure (CHF) New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III or IV].

          -  Left ventriculat ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt;50 % [as measured at screening by Multiple
             Gated Acquisition scan (MUGA) or echocardiogram].

          -  Uncontrolled hypertension defined as systolic blood pressure &gt; 150 mm Hg and/or
             diastolic blood pressure &gt; 90 mmHg, despite optimal medical management.

          -  Mild blurry vision, either age-related or due to ocular or systemic disorder (e.g.
             diabetes, dry eyes, cataracts, uncorrected refraction abnormality) may be allowed at
             the discretion of the ophthalmologist if deemed as no constituting a predisposition
             to drug-induced corneal deposits and blurry vision.
