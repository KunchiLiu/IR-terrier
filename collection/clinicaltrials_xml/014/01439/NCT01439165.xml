  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to describe the safety and immunogenicity of repeat
      administration of Adacel vaccine approximately 10 years following initial administration of
      the vaccine. Antibody levels prior to revaccination will also be used to characterize
      antibody persistence following initial vaccination 10 years earlier.

      Primary Objectives:

        -  To compare seroprotection rates against tetanus and diphtheria induced by Adacel
           vaccine to those induced by Td Adsorbed vaccine.

        -  To compare booster response rates against tetanus and diphtheria induced by Adacel
           vaccine to those induced by Td Adsorbed vaccine.

        -  To compare anti-pertussis geometric mean antibody concentrations (GMCs) induced by
           Adacel vaccine to the GMCs induced by Daptacel® vaccine given to infants.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To describe the rates of immediate reactions, solicited reactions, unsolicited adverse
           events (AEs), and serious adverse events (SAEs) following vaccination with Adacel or Td
           Adsorbed vaccine.

        -  To describe booster response rates for pertussis antigens following revaccination with
           Adacel vaccine.

      Healthy adults &lt; 65 years of age who received Adacel vaccine 10 years previously will be
      randomized to receive either Adacel or TENIVAC (Td Adsorbed) vaccine. They will be assessed
      for immunogenicity at baseline and post-vaccination. Safety data will be collected for 6
      months following vaccination.
