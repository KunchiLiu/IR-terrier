  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      More than 70% of birch pollen allergic patients suffer from allergic reactions to certain
      foods, e.g. stone fruits, hazelnut and some vegetables. However, specific immunotherapy
      (SIT) with birch pollen extract is not effective for the treatment of associated food
      allergy in a substantial number of patients. Based on our previous clinical and
      immunological investigations of birch pollen related food allergy (BPRFA) the investigators
      hypothesize that for effective SIT of this abundant food allergy the disease-eliciting food
      allergens should be employed. To prove this concept, the investigators aim to sublingually
      administer the major apple allergen, Mal d 1, to birch pollen-allergic patients with
      concomitant apple allergy and evaluate clinical and immunological effects of this treatment.
      The investigators choose Mal d 1 as model food allergen because (i) its cross-reactivity
      with Bet v 1 has been well characterized,(ii) apple is the most frequent trigger for BPRFA
      and (iii) recombinant(r)Mal d 1 was well tolerated after sublingual administration to 20
      birch pollen-allergic patients in a previous study. Sublingual administration of a defined
      concentration of GMP-rMal d 1 will be compared with equal doses of GMP-rBet v 1 as a
      positive control and placebo-treatment. Clinical parameters will include skin prick tests
      (SPT) and objective and subjective assessment of apple and birch pollen-induced allergic
      symptoms. Immunological parameters will comprise the analysis of antibody and T cell
      responses to Mal d 1 and Bet v 1 as well as the evaluation of basophil activation.

      The proposed pilot study will be a first investigation of the concept to specifically treat
      BPRFA with the involved food allergens and thus, represents an important step in the
      development of an efficient and safe therapy in the future.
