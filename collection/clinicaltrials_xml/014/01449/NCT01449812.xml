  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this booster study is to evaluate the immune persistence in healthy Chinese
      subjects primed in study NCT01086423 with GSK Biologicals' Infanrix-IPV+Hib™ (DTPa-IPV/Hib)
      vaccine. The study will also evaluate the safety and immune response of these subjects to a
      booster dose of Infanrix-Hib™ (DTPa/Hib) and Poliorix™ (IPV) vaccine.

      This protocol posting deals with objectives &amp; outcome measures of the booster phase. The
      objectives &amp; outcome measures of the primary phase are presented in a separate protocol
      posting (NCT number = NCT01086423).
