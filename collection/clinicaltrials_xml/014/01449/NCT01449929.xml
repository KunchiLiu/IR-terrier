    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted in approximately 468 HIV-1 infected antiretroviral therapy
      (ART)-naïve subjects. Subjects will be randomized 1:1 to receive dolutegravir (DTG) 50 mg
      once daily (approximately 234 subjects) or darunavir/ritonavir (DRV/r) 800 mg/100 mg once
      daily (approximately 234 subjects), each in combination with fixed-dose dual nucleoside
      reverse transriptase inhibitor (NRTI) therapy (either abacavir/lamivudine (ABC/3TC) or
      tenofovir/emtricitabine (TDF/FTC). Subjects will be stratified by screening HIV-1 RNA and
      background NRTI selection. The primary analysis will take place after the last subject
      completes 48 weeks on therapy; an additional analysis will be conducted after the last
      subject completes Week 96 on study.

      ING114915 is a Phase IIIb randomized, open-label, active-controlled, multicentre, parallel
      group, fully-powered non-inferiority study. The study will be conducted in approximately 468
      HIV-1 infected ART-naïve subjects. Subjects will be randomized 1:1 to receive DTG 50 mg once
      daily (approximately 234 subjects) or DRV/r 800 mg/100 mg once daily (approximately 234
      subjects), each in combination with fixed-dose dual NRTI therapy (either ABC/3TC or
      TDF/FTC). The primary analysis will take place after the last subject completes 48 weeks on
      therapy; an additional analysis will be conducted after the last subject completes Week 96
      on study.

      Subjects who fulfil eligibility requirements will be randomized 1:1 to receive DTG 50 mg
      once daily or DRV/r 800 mg/100 mg once daily. In order to achieve balance across the two
      treatment groups of the study, randomization will be stratified by: screening plasma HIV-1
      RNA &gt;/ 100,000 copies/mL (c/mL) or &gt; 100,000 c/mL and background dual NRTI (ABC/3TC or
      TDF/FTC) The DTG and DRV/r doses will be administered in an open-label fashion throughout
      the study.

      Subjects randomized to receive DTG and who successfully complete 96 weeks of treatment will
      continue to have access to DTG until either it is locally approved and commercially
      available, the patient no longer derives clinical benefit, the patient meets a
      protocol-defined reason for discontinuation or until development of DTG is terminated.
      Subjects randomized to the DRV/r arm will receive DRV/r through their Week 96 visit, after
      which they will be discontinued from the study and will need to make alternative
      arrangements to access antiretroviral medication. All subjects will receive background
      dual-NRTI therapy through their Week 96 visit.

    <time_frame>Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of participants with Plasma Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1 (HIV-1) Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) &lt;50 c/mL at Week 48 was assessed using Missing, Switch or Discontinuation = Failure (MSDF), as codified by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) &quot;snapshot&quot; algorithm. This algorithm treated all participants without HIV-1 RNA data at Week 48 as nonresponders, as well as participants who switched their concomitant ART prior to Week 48 as follows: background ART substitutions non-permitted per protocol (one background ART substitution was permitted for safety or tolerability); background ART substitutions permitted per protocol unless the decision to switch was documented as being before or at the first on-treatment visit where HIV-1 RNA was assessed. Otherwise, virologic success or failure was determined by the last available HIV-1 RNA assessment while the participant was on-treatment in the snapshot window (Week 48 +/- 6 weeks).</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) Symptom Distress Module (SDM) Bother Score at Week 4, Week 24, and Week 48</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 4, Week 24, and Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>SDM is a 20-item self-reported measure that addresses the presence and perceived distress linked to symptoms commonly associated with HIV or its treatment. Each item is rated from 0 to 4 where 0 (complete absence of symptom) and 4 (very bothersome symptom). Overall score calculated as the sum of the scores for each of the 20 items of the questionnaire and ranged from 0 (best health) and 80 (worst health). Values represented are for adjusted mean. Estimates are calculated from an ANCOVA model adjusting for age, sex, race, baseline viral load, background dual NRTI therapy and baseline symptom bother score. Change from Baseline was calculated as the post-Baseline value minus the Baseline value. A positive change from Baseline indicates a decline in a participant's quality of life over that period.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in EQ-5D Utility Scores at Week 24 and Week 48</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 24, and Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>The European Quality of Life -5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) is a 5-question quality of life instrument that provides a utility score and visual analogue scale score that describes the participants' health status. The primary reason for including the EQ-5D is to elicit utility values for potential cost-effectiveness analysis for submission to health technology assessment agencies. The EQ-5D total score ranges from 0 (worst health state) to 1 (perfect health state) and 1 reflects the best outcome. Values represented are for adjusted mean. Estimates are calculated from an ANCOVA model adjusting for age, sex, race, baseline viral load, background dual NRTI therapy and Baseline EQ-5D utility score. Change from Baseline was calculated as the post-Baseline value minus the Baseline value.</description>

        <description>The percentage of participants with Plasma Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1 (HIV-1) Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) &lt;50 c/mL at Week 48 was assessed using Missing, Switch or Discontinuation = Failure (MSDF), as codified by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) &quot;snapshot&quot; algorithm. This algorithm treated all participants without HIV-1 RNA data at Week 48 as nonresponders, as well as participants who switched their concomitant ART prior to Week 48 as follows: background ART substitutions non-permitted per protocol (one background ART substitution was permitted for safety or tolerability); background ART substitutions permitted per protocol unless the decision to switch was documented as being before or at the first on-treatment visit where HIV-1 RNA was assessed. Otherwise, virologic success or failure was determined by the last available HIV-1 RNA assessment while the participant was on-treatment in the snapshot window (Week 48 +/- 6 weeks).</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With HIV-1 Associated Disease Progression With the Indicated Shift to CDC Class C, or New CDC Class C or Death at Week 48</title>
        <description>The number of participants with HIV-1 disease progression (AIDS or death) was assessed per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 1993 revised classification system for HIV infection and expanded surveillance case definition for AIDS among adolescents and adults. The CDC classifies HIV infection as Category A (participants with asymptomatic HIV infection, acute HIV infection with accompanying illness, or persistent generalized lymphadenopathy), Category B (participants with symptomatic non-AIDS condition, i.e., conditions that are attributed to HIV infection or are indicative of a defect in cell-mediated immunity; or conditions are considered by physicians to have a clinical course or to require management that is complicated by HIV infection), and Category C (includes AIDS indicator conditions as defined by diagnostic or presumptive measures).</description>

          <title>Number of Participants With HIV-1 Associated Disease Progression With the Indicated Shift to CDC Class C, or New CDC Class C or Death at Week 48</title>
          <description>The number of participants with HIV-1 disease progression (AIDS or death) was assessed per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 1993 revised classification system for HIV infection and expanded surveillance case definition for AIDS among adolescents and adults. The CDC classifies HIV infection as Category A (participants with asymptomatic HIV infection, acute HIV infection with accompanying illness, or persistent generalized lymphadenopathy), Category B (participants with symptomatic non-AIDS condition, i.e., conditions that are attributed to HIV infection or are indicative of a defect in cell-mediated immunity; or conditions are considered by physicians to have a clinical course or to require management that is complicated by HIV infection), and Category C (includes AIDS indicator conditions as defined by diagnostic or presumptive measures).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) Symptom Distress Module (SDM) Bother Score at Week 4, Week 24, and Week 48</title>
        <description>SDM is a 20-item self-reported measure that addresses the presence and perceived distress linked to symptoms commonly associated with HIV or its treatment. Each item is rated from 0 to 4 where 0 (complete absence of symptom) and 4 (very bothersome symptom). Overall score calculated as the sum of the scores for each of the 20 items of the questionnaire and ranged from 0 (best health) and 80 (worst health). Values represented are for adjusted mean. Estimates are calculated from an ANCOVA model adjusting for age, sex, race, baseline viral load, background dual NRTI therapy and baseline symptom bother score. Change from Baseline was calculated as the post-Baseline value minus the Baseline value. A positive change from Baseline indicates a decline in a participant’s quality of life over that period.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in EQ-5D Utility Scores at Week 24 and Week 48</title>
        <description>The European Quality of Life -5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) is a 5-question quality of life instrument that provides a utility score and visual analogue scale score that describes the participants’ health status. The primary reason for including the EQ-5D is to elicit utility values for potential cost-effectiveness analysis for submission to health technology assessment agencies. The EQ-5D total score ranges from 0 (worst health state) to 1 (perfect health state) and 1 reflects the best outcome. Values represented are for adjusted mean. Estimates are calculated from an ANCOVA model adjusting for age, sex, race, baseline viral load, background dual NRTI therapy and Baseline EQ-5D utility score. Change from Baseline was calculated as the post-Baseline value minus the Baseline value.</description>

        <title>Human Immunodeficiency Virus Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (HIVTSQ) Total Score at Week 4, Week 24, and Week 48</title>
        <description>Participant treatment satisfaction was measured using the self-reported scale (HIVTSQ), which consists of 10 items (1-satisfaction, 2-HIV control, 3-adverse effects, 4-level of demand, 5-convenience, 6-flexibility, 7-knowledge, 8-life habits, 9-recommendability, and 10-willingness to continue). Items are scored from 0 (very dissatisfied) to 6 (very satisfied), other than item 4, which has an inverted score from 6 (very demanding) to 0 (very undemanding). The treatment satisfaction score (range: 0-60) was the sum of the individual items.
