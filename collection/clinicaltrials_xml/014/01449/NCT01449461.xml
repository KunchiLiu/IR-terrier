    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is 2-fold: initially, in the dose escalation phase, the goal is to
      determine the safety profile of orally administered AP26113, including: the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD), dose limiting toxicities (DLTs), recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), and
      pharmacokinetic (PK) profile. Then, once the RP2D is established, an expansion phase will
      assess the preliminary anti-tumor activity of AP26113, both in non-small cell lung cancer
      (NSCLC) with ALK gene rearrangement (including patients with active brain metastases)or
      mutated EGFR, and in other cancers with abnormal targets against which AP26113 is active.
      Approximately 135 to 175 patients will be enrolled.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is the first assessment of AP26113 in patients. The trial will be conducted in 2 parts:
      an initial dose escalation phase in 30 to 70 patients with advanced malignancies (all
      histologies other than leukemia), resistant to available therapies or for whom no standard
      or available curative treatments exist, followed by an expansion phase in 5 histologically
      and molecularly defined cohorts of patients (approximately 20-25 patients per cohort,
      approximately 105 patients altogether). The objectives of the dose escalation phase are to
      determine the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic profile, and recommended phase 2 dose
      (RP2D) of orally administered AP26113. The objectives of the expansion phase are to describe
      the preliminary anti-tumor activity (overall response rate) of AP26113 in patients with
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene rearrangement
      or mutated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and in patients with any cancers with
      abnormalities in ALK or other targets against which AP26113 is active, and to continue to
      assess safety and tolerability.
