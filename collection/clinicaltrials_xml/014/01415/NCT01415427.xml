    <textblock>
      This Phase 3 extension study will evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of BMN 110 2.0
      mg/kg/week and/or BMN 110 2.0 mg/kg/every other week in patients with mucopolysaccharidosis
      IVA (Morquio A Syndrome).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, multinational, extension study to evaluate 2 dose regimens of BMN
      110 treatment in patients with MPS IVA who completed MOR-004.

      The last study visit assessments for MOR-004 will constitute Baseline for this study. The
      first study drug dose of this protocol will occur on Week 0 of MOR-005, which is the same as
      the last visit (Week 24) of MOR-004. Initially, the study will be double-blind with patients
      previously randomized to BMN 110 in MOR-004 remaining on their assigned BMN 110 dose regimen
      (qw or qow dosing). The MOR-004 placebo patients will be re-randomized (1:1 ratio) to one of
      the 2 BMN 110 dose regimen groups: 2.0 mg/kg/qw or 2.0 mg/kg/qow.

      There will be two study parts:

        -  Part 1 - randomized double-blind until the optimal BMN 110 dose regimen has been
           determined, based on the final primary efficacy analysis from MOR-004

        -  Part 2 - open-label BMN 110 treatment with the single optimal dose regimen

    <description>To evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of BMN 110 administration at 2.0 mg/kg/qw and 2.0 mg/kg/qow in patients with MPS IVA. Safety results will be determined by numbers and severity of adverse events as well as descriptive statistic analysis of other safety related assessments. Efficacy will be assessed by changes from baseline in 6-minute walk test and 3-minute stair climb test as well as urine keratan sulfate (normalized to urine creatinine.)</description>
