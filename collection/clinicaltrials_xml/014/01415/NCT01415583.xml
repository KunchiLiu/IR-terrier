    <textblock>
      Tonsillectomy (removal of the tonsils) is a very common surgery in children. Bleeding after
      tonsillectomy is one of the risks of this surgery and can be more dangerous in children
      since they have less blood volume than adults. In order to improve recovery after
      tonsillectomy, steroids (medication that is a strong anti-inflammatory) are often given
      during the surgery. Recently, a study showed steroids given at the time of tonsillectomy
      increase the risk of bleeding significantly over children who did not receive steroids. This
      finding has raised concerns in the Ear, Nose, and Throat (ENT) community since most ENT's
      use steroids during tonsillectomy in children. The investigators look to explore this
      question further.

      To answer the question of whether perioperative steroid administration significantly affects
      the rate of post-tonsillectomy bleeding, the investigators propose to test the following
      hypotheses in a prospective, randomized, blinded placebo-controlled trial: dexamethasone
      does not cause an increase in post-operative bleeding rate in tonsillectomy.

    <description>The primary objective of this study is to determine if dexamethasone at 0.5mg/kg (max dose 20mg) is associated with an increased rate of post-tonsillectomy hemorrhage in children when compared to placebo.</description>

    <measure>To compare rate of post-tonsillectomy hemorrhage when studying different groups of patients based on age, indication for surgery, or operating surgeon.</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The second objective of this study is to use a multivariate logistic regression model to determine if bleeding rates differed according to surgical indication, age, or operating surgeon. This is important since indication for tonsillectomy varies in children. Younger children tend to undergo tonsillectomy for obstructive sleep symptoms whereas older children tend to have the indication for tonsillectomy based on infectious tonsillitis.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients ages 3 to 18 undergoing tonsillectomy or adenotonsillectomy by
             electrocautery alone for the indication of sleep disordered breathing or infectious
             tonsillitis.

          -  Patients with complex medical conditions or craniofacial abnormalities will be
             included.

          -  Informed consent and child assent are required for enrollment.

          -  Eligibility will be determined by the principal investigator, associate investigator
             or research nurse.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with a known personal or family history of any bleeding disorder will be
             excluded.

          -  Subjects currently on oral corticosteroids for other medical conditions or have
             recently taken any oral corticosteroid within two weeks of surgery.

          -  Patients with tonsillectomy performed using a cold knife technique, microdebrider,
             coblation or plasma knife due to surgeon or parent preference.

          -  Where appropriate subjects who do not have informed consent or child assent signed
             will be excluded

          -  Children less than three years old will be excluded due to the fact the majority of
             these children at the collaborating centers have an adenotonsillectomy using the
             microdebrider for pain control purposes.
