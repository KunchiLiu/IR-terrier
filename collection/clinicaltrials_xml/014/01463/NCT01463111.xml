  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Forty subjects with bipolar disorder who are not receiving a mood-stabilizing medication for
      the treatment of their illness will participate in this study. The study aims to evaluate
      how decision-making is affected by treatment for bipolar disorder. Prior to beginning
      treatment, patients will complete questionnaires and a one-hour computer-administered
      assessment of decision-making. Differences between pre-post decision-making outcomes will be
      evaluated to examine whether the neuroeconomic concepts of risk aversion, loss aversion,
      risk tolerance and delay discounting are affected by treatment.

      The overall goal of this study will be to identify whether decision-making in people with
      bipolar disorder is affected by treatment. Specifically the investigators will compare
      decision-making characteristics among bipolar patients prior to treatment with how these
      decision-making characteristics change over the course of 6 weeks of standard medication
      therapy for bipolar disorder. A total of 6 decision-making tasks and one control task will
      be administered via computer to eligible subjects. The investigators will evaluate
      decision-making under varying conditions of reward, risk, and uncertainty and over time. The
      investigators hypothesize that decision-making will improve across these assessments after 6
      weeks of treatment.

      Participation in this study will require three study visits over 6 weeks. Subjects will be
      evaluated with the Structured Diagnostic Interview for DSM-IV to confirm diagnosis. They
      will also be administered the Hamilton Anxiety and Depression Rating Scales. Eligible
      subjects will then complete questionnaires related to their symptoms as well as
      decision-making and risk-taking, including: the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale, the Spielberger
      State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, and the Flinders Decision-making questionnaire. The
      Montgomery-Asburg Depression Severity scale to assess changes in depression symptom severity
      and the Young Mania Rating Scale to assess changes in manic symptom severity, will be
      conducted at screening, baseline, and endpoint. Patients will also be given the Childhood
      Trauma Questionnaire at baseline visit, to assess for a history of childhood trauma. The
      subjects will then complete the computer-generated decision-making tasks. Upon completion,
      the study physician will initiate standard-of-care treatment with a mood stabilizer (either
      lithium, valproate, or lamotrigine). Standard-of-care laboratory testing and psychiatric
      follow-up will be performed during the patient's study participation. After six weeks of
      treatment with a mood stabilizer, patients will again complete the decision-making
      computerized assessment.

    <description>Temporal discounting refers to the tendency to place less value on a reward as it moves away from the present time. Subjects will make decisions about whether to accept an immediate gain or loss verus a gain or loss occurring at some point in the future. Several iterations of choices are made using differing time frames. The results of these choices are then used to calculate the delay equivalent value.</description>
