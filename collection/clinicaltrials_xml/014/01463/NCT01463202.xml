      The investigators plan to enroll 184 women who are planning to breastfeed and use DMPA after
      delivery to find out whether the timing of postpartum administration of DMPA (prior to
      hospital discharge or 4-6 weeks after delivery) affects the duration or exclusivity of
      breastfeeding among women who plan to breastfeed their infants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the United States, depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) is given to women after
      delivery and before hospital discharge with the belief that women who delay starting DMPA
      may be more likely to become pregnant when they are not yet ready to be pregnant and that
      giving DMPA before discharge has little to no negative effect on breastfeeding.
      Administering DMPA to breastfeeding women has not been widely questioned because the limited
      existing studies do not show any adverse impact of DMPA on breastfeeding. However, these
      studies used inappropriate control groups and did not control for prior lactation
      experience.

      The investigators plan to enroll 184 women who are planning to breastfeed and use DMPA after
      delivery to find out whether the timing of postpartum administration of DMPA (prior to
      hospital discharge or 4-6 weeks after delivery) affects the duration or exclusivity of
      breastfeeding among women who plan to breastfeed their infants. The investigators will also
      look at rates of use of highly effective contraception (defined as DMPA, intrauterine
      device, implant, sterilization, or lactational amenorrhea) and postpartum depression.
