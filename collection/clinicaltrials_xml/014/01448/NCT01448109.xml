      The purpose of this study is to find out whether adult patients admitted to the Intensive
      Care Unit with septic shock who are given hydrocortisone compared to placebo (a dummy
      solution), will have an improved rate of survival 90 days later.

      Septic shock is the result of an infection, which triggers a complex response by the body
      (the inflammatory response) that causes a decrease in blood pressure and subsequently one or
      more organ systems to fail when blood supply to these organs is reduced. This may result in
      poor recovery and death. About a quarter of the people who suffer septic shock that is not
      rapidly reversed, will die.

      When patients are admitted to Intensive Care with sepsis and/or septic shock they receive a
      number of therapies. These include fluids given through a drip, antibiotics, drugs to boost
      your blood pressure and other organ systems.

      In addition to these therapies, steroids (hydrocortisone) are sometimes administered.
      Whether steroids are useful or not in the treatment of severe infections has been studied
      for more than 50 years. Previous research has suggested that the use of low dose steroid may
      have shortterm benefits in improving the circulation. However, there is no agreement amongst
      doctors around the world about whether treatment with or without low dose steroids improves
      the overall recovery and survival in patients with septic shock. This study would allow
      doctors to make informed decisions about whether the addition of low dose steroid therapy is
      better for patients with septic shock in intensive care.

      The study will include 3800 intensive care patients who have septic shock. Each enrolled
      patient will be randomised to receive either Hydrocortisone 200mg or placebo daily for 7
      days as a continuous intravenous infusion while in intensive care. The patient will be
      followed for 90 days. If the patient is discharged prior to 90 days a telephone call will be
      made for the followup information. At six months the patient will be contacted again for
      completion of a quality of life questionnaire.

      Primary Objective To evaluate the impact of intravenous hydrocortisone versus placebo on all
      cause mortality at 90 days in critically ill patients with septic shock. The hypothesis is
      that hydrocortisone, compared to placebo, reduces 90-day all-cause mortality in patients
      admitted to an ICU with septic shock. 'Shock' is defined as the need for vasopressors or
      inotropes to maintain a systolic blood pressure &gt; 90 millimetres of mercury (mmHg), or mean
      arterial blood pressure &gt; 60mmHg or a mean arterial pressure (MAP) target set by the
      treating clinician for maintaining perfusion. 'Septic shock' is shock that is secondary to
      sepsis

      Secondary Objectives To assess the impact of intravenous hydrocortisone versus placebo on
      the recovery from, and the complications of, septic shock and the development of treatment
      related adverse reactions.

      Study Design This study is a multi centre, randomised, blinded, placebo controlled trial
      comparing intravenous hydrocortisone with placebo in critically ill patients with septic
      shock.

      Randomisation will be achieved via a secure interactive web based system using permuted
      block minimisation. Randomisation will be stratified by participating site and by operative
      or non-operative admission to the ICU.

      The primary endpoint for this trial will be death from all causes at 90 days.

      Pre defined sub groups will include the following categories:

        -  Operative (admitted to ICU from operating theatre or recovery room) versus
           non-operative admission.

        -  Dose of adrenaline or noradrenaline at randomisation - ≤ 15 mcg / minute versus &gt; 15
           mcg / minute.

      3,800 patients will be enrolled in this study at approximately 50 - 60 study sites. Eligible
      patients will be randomised to receive either intravenous hydrocortisone 200mg or placebo
      per day for 7 days.

      For all patients, data will be collected at baseline and then daily whilst the patient is in
      the ICU. Patients will be followed up to day 14, regardless of where the patient resides in
      the hospital, to monitor the development of bacteraemia. Additional follow up will occur at
      90 days and at 6 months post randomisation.
