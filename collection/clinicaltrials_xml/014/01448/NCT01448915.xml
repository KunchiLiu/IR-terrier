  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The principal goal of this research project is to evaluate the extent of HCV disease and its
      treatment in coinfected IDUs. Research procedures will focus on determining liver disease
      prevalence and grade of disease within this population. The investigators will also evaluate
      if behavioral reinforcement interventions increase the rate of treatment participation and
      completion.

    <textblock>
      The principal goal of this research project remains focused on hepatitis C virus (HCV)
      infection in HIV-infected injection drug users (IDUs). The recent availability of a novel,
      non-invasive method of measuring HCV disease stage makes it possible to test the
      relationship of HCV disease stage and the management of coinfected IDUs with adequate
      precision. The investigators will apply the innovative technology, elastography (FibroScan®)
      to ask whether the marked differences in the final disease outcome, end-stage liver disease
      (ESLD), can be explained by a measure of liver stiffness as assessed by elastography
      (FibroScan®). While advances in non-invasive disease assessment are critical to HCV
      management, the greatest challenge to improving HCV treatment effectiveness in coinfected
      persons remains low rates of treatment uptake and adherence, even when freely accessible. In
      response to this glaring disparity, the investigators will test potent behavioral
      reinforcement interventions to improve the management of HCV disease by adapting a
      rigorously studied contingent behavioral incentives program to the treatment to coinfected
      IDUs. Hepatitis C Treatment Eligibility: To determine the population prevalence of
      significant liver disease in coinfected IDUs using an innovative, non-invasive methodology
      (transient elastography, FibroScan®) to measure liver stiffness. Liver Disease Staging: To
      test the hypothesis that liver stiffness, assessed by a novel, non-invasive methodology, is
      predictive of the development of ESLD, defined as hepatic decompensation, hepatocellular
      cancer, and liver-related death, in coinfected IDUs. Hepatitis C Treatment Incentives: To
      test the hypothesis that a contingent behavioral reinforcement intervention will effectively
      increase the proportion of coinfected IDUs who initiate, attend, and complete HCV treatment.
