  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1-2 study to determine the safety and immunogenicity profiles of
      DPX-Survivac, a therapeutic vaccine co-administered with a regimen of low dose oral
      cyclophosphamide. DPX-Survivac is for the treatment of ovarian, fallopian tube, and
      peritoneal cancers.

      Immunotherapy is a novel way to treat cancer and does so by targeting the immune system to
      destroy tumor cells. Many different therapeutic vaccines have been evaluated in phase 1, 2,
      and even phase 3 trials. Much has been learned about the principles of applying immune-based
      therapies and specifically the types of patients that may be most likely to mount an
      effective immune response. Cancer vaccines may have their greatest impact earlier in the
      disease course or in situations with minimal residual disease.

      ImmunoVaccine Technologies Inc. (Immunovaccine) is developing therapeutic vaccines against
      various solid cancers based on a patented vaccine delivery and enhancement system.
      Immunovaccine's vaccine formulation, termed DepoVax, is a lipid-based formulation created to
      enhance the speed, strength and duration of the immune response. Immunovaccine's hypothesis
      is that the immune enhancement properties of its formulation are the result of the
      co-delivery of antigen and adjuvant and the created depot effect. The peptide antigens
      included in DPX-Survivac are designed to target Survivin, a protein which is over-expressed
      in many cancer types, including epithelial ovarian cancers.

      This study will begin with a phase 1 safety cohort study; at least 15 non-randomized
      patients will be enrolled into the open-label dose finding study. The study will then
      progress directly into the 2:1 randomized, double-blinded phase 2 portion of the study. The
      phase 2 will be a placebo controlled efficacy study, enrolling approximately 250 patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The standard treatment for all ovarian cancer is aggressive debulking surgery followed by
      chemotherapy. Ovarian carcinoma is one of the most chemosensitive solid tumors and early
      stage patients are most responsive to treatment. However, despite improvements to the
      standard treatment over the past three decades, almost all patients with advanced stage
      disease at presentation will relapse, with an average progression free survival of 16-18
      months. When residual or recurrent disease manifests itself, resistance to chemotherapy
      often prohibits further curative therapy. Therefore, there are still significant unmet needs
      in treating ovarian cancer patients.

      Treatment with DPX-Survivac is for patients with late-stage ovarian, fallopian tube, or
      peritoneal cancer who have completed initial chemotherapy treatment and successful debulking
      surgery. The phase 1 dose finding study will administer 3 doses of DPX-Survivac with or
      without accompanying low dose oral cyclophosphamide. The phase 2, placebo controlled, study
      will administer DPX-Survivac or placebo with accompanying low dose cyclophosphamide or
      placebo.

      PHASE 1

        -  non-randomized, open-label, dose-finding study

        -  at least 15 subjects

        -  three safety cohorts (listed in the table above)

        -  safety and immunogenicity findings will determine dosage for phase 2

      PHASE 2

        -  2:1 randomized, double-blinded, placebo controlled study

        -  approximately 250 subjects

        -  two arms (1) Experimental: DPX-Survivac (injection) and low dose cyclophosphamide
           (oral) and (2) Control: placebo injection and oral placebo
