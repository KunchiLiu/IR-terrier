    <textblock>
      A randomized study is planned for 5 years to evaluate the effectiveness of the Therapeutic
      Workplace in promoting methadone treatment and abstinence in unemployed injection drug
      users. Participants will be recruited through street outreach, at agencies that serve the
      target populations, and informal word-of-mouth referrals. Participants will be invited to
      attend the workplace and to enroll in the methadone treatment. To engage participants in the
      workplace, they will be allowed to work independent of whether they enroll in methadone
      treatment and independent of their drug use. The workplace participants (N=162) will be
      randomly assigned to three groups. The &quot;Usual Care Control&quot; participants will be allowed to
      work independent of their methadone use or urinalysis results. The &quot;Methadone Contingency&quot;
      participants will be required to take methadone to attend work, and will receive a brief pay
      decrease for failing to take their medication. The &quot;Methadone &amp; Abstinence Contingency&quot;
      participants will be required to take their medication in order to attend work, as well as
      receive a brief pay decrease for any positive urine samples for both cocaine and methadone.

    <description>Methadone, which can reduce injection heroin use and injection-related HIV risk, will be used. Participants will be offered to enroll in methadone treatment and given access to a Therapeutic Workplace. Participants who are deemed eligible (N=162) will be randomly assigned to one of three groups. All groups will be invited to work in the Therapeutic Workplace and will be prescribed methadone for 6 months.</description>
