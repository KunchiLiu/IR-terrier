  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3b, multicenter, international study conducted in 2 parts. Upon completion
      of the placebo-controlled period (Part 1), participants will have the option of enrolling in
      a 2-year open-label extension (Part 2).

      Part 1: The primary objective of the study is to investigate whether treatment with
      natalizumab slows the accumulation of disability not related to relapses in participants
      with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS).

      The secondary objectives of Part 1 of this study are to determine the proportion of
      participants with consistent improvement in Timed 25-Foot Walk (T25FW), the change in
      participant-reported ambulatory status as measured by the 12-item MS Walking Scale
      (MSWS-12), the change in manual ability based on the ABILHAND Questionnaire, the impact of
      natalizumab on participant-reported quality of life using the Multiple Sclerosis Impact
      Scale-29 Physical (MSIS-29 Physical), the change in whole brain volume between the end of
      study and Week 24 using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and the proportion of participants
      experiencing progression of disability as measured by individual physical Expanded
      Disability Status Scale (EDSS) system scores.

      Part 2: The primary objective of Part 2 of the study is to evaluate the safety profile of
      natalizumab in participants with SPMS.

      The secondary objectives of Part 2 of the study are to investigate long-term disability
      (based on clinical or patient-reported assessments) in participants with SPMS receiving
      natalizumab treatment for approximately 4 years and to assess change in brain volume and T2
      lesion volume.

    <measure>Part 1: Percentage of participants with confirmed progression of disability in one or more of the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), Timed 25-Foot Walk (T25FW), or 9-Hole Peg Test (9HPT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 96 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Confirmed disability progression is defined as one or more of the following criteria, confirmed at a second visit at least 6 months later and at Week 96: • Confirmed progression in EDSS: EDSS score increased from baseline by at least 1 point if baseline EDSS ≤5.5 or by at least 0.5 points if baseline EDSS ≥6; • Confirmed progression in T25FW: T25FW increased by at least 20% of the baseline walk; • Confirmed progression in 9HPT: 9HPT increased by at least 20% of the time taken at baseline. The progression in 9HPT can occur on either hand, but will have to be confirmed on the same hand. The EDSS measures disability status on a scale ranging from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating more disability. The T25FW is a quantitative mobility and leg function performance test where the participant is timed while walking for 25 feet. The 9HPT is a quantitative test of upper extremity function that measures the time it takes to place 9 pegs into 9 holes and then remove the pegs.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Part 1: Percentage of participants with a Timed 25-Foot Walk (T25FW) response</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 96 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>T25FW response is defined as any improvement from the best pre-dose T25FW in at least 75% of the scheduled on-treatment visits through Week 96. The T25FW is a quantitative mobility and leg function performance test based on a timed walk over 25 feet. The participant is directed to one end of a clearly marked 25-foot course and is instructed to walk 25 feet as quickly as possible, but safely. The time is calculated from the initiation of the instruction to start and ends when the participant has reached the 25-foot mark. The task is immediately administered again by having the patient walk back the same distance. The score for the T25FW is the average of the two completed trials.</description>

    <measure>Part 1: Change from Baseline in the 12-Item MS Walking Scale (MSWS-12)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 96</time_frame>
    <description>MSWS-12 is a patient self-assessment of the walking limitations due to MS during the past 2 weeks. It contains 12 items that measure the impact of MS on walking. Items are summed to generate a total score and transformed to a scale with a range of 0 to 100, where higher scores indicate greater impact on walking.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Part 1: Change from Baseline in manual ability score based on the ABILHAND Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 96</time_frame>
    <description>The ABILHAND Questionnaire measures the participant's perceived difficulty in performing everyday manual activities in the last 3 months. The participant completes a 56-item questionnaire by estimating their own difficulty or ease in performing each of 56 activities. Items are summed to generate a total score and transformed to a scale with a range of 0 to 100, where high scores indicate greater impact on manual ability.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Part 1: Percentage of participants with confirmed worsening in individual Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) Physical Functional System scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 96 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The EDSS measures disability status on a scale ranging from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating more disability. Scoring is based on measures of impairment in eight functional systems on examination by a neurologist. Participants with confirmed progression of disability in EDSS physical functional system scores will be defined as those who meet one of the following criteria: • an increase of ≥ 1 point from baseline system score of ≥ 1 or an increase of ≥ 2 points from baseline system score of 0 in at least 2 physical functional systems, or • an increase of ≥ 2 points from baseline system score of ≥ 1 or an increase of ≥ 3 points from baseline system score of 0 in any 1 physical functional system. Worsening must be confirmed on a subsequent examination using the same criterion in the same functional system(s) at least 6 months later.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Part 2: Percentage of participants with disability worsening</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to week 204</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of participants with disability worsening at each scheduled efficacy visit in Part 2, defined as one or more of the following: • ≥ 20% worsening from Part 1 baseline in T25FW; • ≥ 20% worsening from Part 1 baseline in 9HPT; • Worsening from Part 1 baseline in EDSS (≥ 1 point increase if Part 1 baseline EDSS ≤ 5.5 or ≥ 0.5 point increase if Part 1 baseline EDSS &gt; 5.5). The EDSS measures disability status on a scale ranging from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating more disability. The T25FW is a quantitative mobility and leg function performance test where the participant is timed while walking for 25 feet. The 9HPT is a quantitative test of upper extremity function that measures the time it takes to place 9 pegs into 9 holes and then remove the pegs.</description>
