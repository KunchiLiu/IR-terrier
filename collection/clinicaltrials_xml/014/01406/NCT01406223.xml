    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to look at brain function in order to understand how different
      treatments work to help people quit smoking. In this study, the investigators will look at
      the effects of nicotine patches, Chantix alone or Chantix paired with Zyban.

    <time_frame>11 weeks post quit day and 6 months post quit day.</time_frame>
    <description>Days to first cigarette (i.e. lapse) will be measured via self-report. Correlations between pre- and post-quit brain imaging measures and days to lapse will be examined to assess whether brain function can predict cessation outcomes.</description>

    <description>For the first 3 days after being switched from Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT) occurring at one week before the target quit date, smokers in this group will receive varenicline at a dose of 0.5 mg once per day followed by 0.5 mg twice a day for the remaining 4 days of that week. Subsequently, the dose will be 1 mg twice per day, and will remain at that dose for the remainder of the 12 weeks. During the time they receive varenicline, smokers in this group will also receive placebo bupropion and placebo patches.</description>

    <description>For the first 3 days after being switched from Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT) occurring at one week before the target quit date, smokers in this group will receive varenicline at a dose of 0.5 mg once per day followed by 0.5 mg twice a day for the remaining 4 days of that week plus bupropion at a dose of 150mg once per day. Subsequently, the dose of varenicline will be 1 mg twice per day and the dose of bupropion will be 150 mg twice per day, and will remain at that dose for the remainder of the 12 weeks. During the time they receive varenicline and bupropion, smokers in this group will also receive placebo patches.</description>
