  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of mexiletine treatment for 6 months
      on ambulation, myotonia, muscle function and strength, pain, gastrointestinal functioning,
      cardiac conduction, and quality of life in myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1).

      This study will provide data on the long term (6 months) safety and efficacy of mexiletine
      in:

        -  improving the distance participants are able to walk in six minutes;

        -  reducing myotonia;

        -  improving muscle strength;

        -  increasing lean muscle mass;

        -  decreasing musculoskeletal pain;

        -  improving gastrointestinal function and swallowing);

        -  improving functional abilities;

        -  decreasing cardiac arrhythmias; and

        -  improving disease-specific health related quality-of-life.

    <description>Safety and tolerability are monitored by interval laboratory studies, Holter monitoring, resting echocardiograms, dula energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA)studies, and physical examinations. The participants have three in-person evaluations at the University of Rochester Clinical Research Center (Months 0, 3, and 6) and telephone evaluations every 2 weeks. Patients complete side effects diaries to record any adverse events in the interval time between the in-person evaluations.</description>
