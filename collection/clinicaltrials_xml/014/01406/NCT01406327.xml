      The objective of this post-marketing surveillance study is to evaluate the incidence of
      adverse events in Japanese subjects with pulmonary arterial hypertension treated with
      ambrisentan basd on prescribing information under the conditions of general clinical
      practice and also to grasp the following items;

        1. Unknown adverse drug reactions (ADRs)

        2. Incidence of ADRs to medical products in actual clinical practice

        3. Factors influencing safety of ambrisentan

        4. Factors influencing efficacy of ambrisentan

        5. Prognosis of subjects as well as efficacy and safety of ambrisentan in long-term use
