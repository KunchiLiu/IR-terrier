    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness, the safety, and the
      tolerability of intranasal ketorolac (Sprix) in relieving acute pain in adults ages 18-64
      who come to the ED seeking care. Considering all ED visits, pain is the most common chief
      complaint. Giving intranasal ketorolac (Sprix) after stomach and dental surgeries has been
      shown to be safe and effective, but no studies have investigated the use of intranasal
      ketorolac (Sprix) for the treatment of acute pain in the ED.

      Ketorolac (Sprix) has several advantages over other drugs commonly given for pain, including
      opioids. Ketorolac (Sprix) is non-addicting and has fewer side effects than opioids. The
      administration of ketorolac (Sprix) by other methods, such as IV, intramuscular shot, and
      oral pill form, has been shown to be safe and effective in treating acute pain.

      This study is being done to find out if giving ketorolac (Sprix) as a single dose nasal
      spray will have the same benefit in decreasing patient's pain.
