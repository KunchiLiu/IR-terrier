  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide and in the United States. The
      majority of lung cancers are non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The majority of NSCLC cases
      are advanced at the time of diagnosis. Chemotherapy has improved overall survival but
      remains limited at &lt; 12 months median overall survival. New approaches are needed for second
      line chemotherapy treatment. Cabazitaxel-XRP6258 has shown increased overall survival in
      metastatic prostate cancer and it is hopeful it can do the same in advanced NSCLC.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A substantial number of patients with lung cancer progress after first line treatment and
      require second line chemotherapy. Lung cancer appears to account for 40-50% of all known
      brain metastasis. The incidence of brain metastases among lung cancer patients ranges from
      16-20%. Chemotherapy has had limited utility due to problems crossing the blood brain
      barrier.

      Currently there are three drugs approved by the FDA for second line treatment of NSCLC but
      each has distinct toxicities. Cabazitaxel-XRP6258 is a potent novel taxane with enhanced
      activity against an increased number of cell lines including lung, prostate, colon,
      pancreas, head and neck, kidney, gastric, glioblastoma, and melanoma. It also has the
      ability to cross the blood brain barrier. Cabazitaxel-XRP6258 was found to have an improved
      antiproliferative activity than other chemotherapy agents against insensitive cell lines.
      The Phase I studies of Cabazitaxel-SRP6258 have determined dosage and schedule
      recommendations in advanced NSCLC patients to be utilized for a Phase II multicenter study.

      Subjects will be placed on one of two schedules (A or B) each with a specified dosage and
      administration schedule. All subjects will be followed for survival/progression after every
      2 cycles of therapy with imaging studies. A two stage design will be used for each of the
      two schedules. Fourteen subjects will be accrued for each schedule in the first stage with
      possible accrual of an additional 34 subjects per schedule depending upon the first stage
      results.
