      Core Study:

      To demonstrate that the efficacy of avatrombopag (in addition to standard of care) is
      superior to placebo (in addition to standard of care) for the treatment of adult
      participants with chronic immune thrombocytopenia (idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura)
      (ITP) as measured by cumulative number of weeks of platelet response over 6 months of once
      daily treatment in adults participants who received at least 1 prior ITP therapy.

      Extension Phase:

      To evaluate the safety and tolerability of long-term therapy with avatrombopag in
      participants with chronic ITP (cITP).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study consists three phases: Prerandomization, Randomization (Core Study) and Extension
      study. The overall duration of treatment (Core and Extension) is approximately 104 weeks
      with the Core study being 26 weeks and the Extension study being 76 weeks. Approximately 45
      participants 18 years of age and over who meet all the eligibility requirements will be
      randomized. No single platelet count should be greater than 35x10^9/L (liter). Participants
      will be centrally stratified at randomization by splenectomy status, baseline platelet
      count, and use of concomitant ITP medication at baseline, and randomized to receive either
      double-blind avatrombopag or placebo in a 2:1 ratio. Participants will receive blinded
      therapy at a starting dose of 20 mg avatrombopag or placebo once daily. Participants will be
      allowed to have their dose titrated up (maximum dose 40 mg avatrombopag or matching placebo)
      or down (minimum dose 5 mg for avatrombopag or matching placebo) depending on their response
      to study drug. The goal of dose modification is to maintain the platelet count at levels
      greater than or equal to 50x10^9/L and less than or equal to 150x10^9/L, and to decrease the
      need for ITP-directed concomitant medications.

    <description>Permitted ITP concomitant background therapies are as follows:
Corticosteroids and/or azathioprine taken at a stable dose for 4 weeks before randomization;
Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) or danazol taken at a stable dose for at least 12 weeks before randomization;
Cyclosporine A (CsA) (due to the fact that it is a P-glycoprotein-mediated transport [P-gp] inhibitor) is to be avoided unless deemed medically necessary; CsA taken at a stable dose for at least 12 weeks before randomization.
At the discretion of the investigator, participants will be allowed to use aspirin, other salicylates, or approved adenosine diphosphate (ADP) receptor antagonists, (eg, clopidogrel, prasugrel) during the study once their platelet count had risen.
Participants treated with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and H2 antagonist therapy will receive a stable dose for at least 6 weeks prior to randomization. Treatment with these therapies must have been completed at least 2 weeks prior to randomization.</description>
