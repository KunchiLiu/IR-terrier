  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will enroll approximately 50 adult subjects who have relapsed or refractory (r/r)
      iNHL to be infused with the study treatment, axicabtagene ciloleucel, to see if their
      disease responds to this experimental product and if this product is safe. Axicabtagene
      ciloleucel is made from the subjects own white blood cells which are genetically modified
      and grown to fight cancer. An objective response rate of 70% is targeted.

      This study will enroll approximately 50 adult subjects who have relapsed or refractory (r/r)
      iNHL to be infused with the study treatment, axicabtagene ciloleucel, to see if their
      disease responds to this experimental product and if this product is safe. Axicabtagene
      ciloleucel is made from the subjects own white blood cells which are genetically modified
      and grown to fight cancer. An objective response rate of 70% is targeted.

      All enrolled subjects will be screened for eligibility then will undergo leukapheresis to
      collect white blood cells for manufacturing. In preparation for the infusion with
      axicabtagene ciloleucel, subjects will undergo conditioning chemotherapy with
      cyclophosphamide and fludarabine for 3 days to help the study treatment be effective. After
      the product is manufactured and conditioning chemotherapy period is complete, subjects will
      be infused with axicabtagene ciloleucel and then monitored in a hospital for a minimum of 7
      days. Subjects will be followed by their study doctor for continued monitoring of the safety
      and effectiveness of the study treatment for approximately 3 months after receiving
      treatment and then will be followed for safety for up to an additional 3 Â½ years.
