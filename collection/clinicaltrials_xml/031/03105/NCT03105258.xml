  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a small study of the oral MEK1/2 inhibitor, selumetinib, to evaluate the potential
      utility of selumetinib in individuals ≥ 18 years old with Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) and
      cutaneous neurofibromas (cNFs). The study aims to determine whether selumetinib will result
      in shrinkage of existing cutaneous neurofibromas and if it prevents or delays the
      development of new cutaneous neurofibromas.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a limited institution open label pilot study of the oral MEK1/2 inhibitor,
      selumetinib, to evaluate the potential utility of selumetinib in up to 24 adults with NF1
      and cutaneous neurofibromas. The study's primary objective is to determine whether
      selumetinib results in shrinkage of existing cutaneous neurofibromas; the secondary
      objective is to assess if selumetinib prevents or delays the development of new cutaneous
      neurofibromas.

      All subjects will commence treatment with selumetinib orally at 50 mg /dose approximately
      every 12 hours (one cycle = 28 days). Patients will be able to escalate to 75mg every 12
      hours [BID], if the medication is tolerated well for the first cycle, with no toxicities of
      grade 2 or greater. Patients will undergo regular evaluation for selumetinib related
      toxicities. In absence of treatment limiting toxicity, or progression of disease, patients
      may remain on treatment for a maximum of 24 cycles unless they experience a volume decrease
      in the target cutaneous neurofibromas, in which case treatment may continue for an
      additional 12 cycles off trial.

      For response evaluation, target cutaneous neurofibromas in 3 different body regions will be
      measured using paper frames, calipers, and photography at baseline and then after every 4
      cycles. Exploratory studies will also be performed during the trial to assess the effect of
      selumetinib on skin related morbidity as well as cutaneous neurofibroma target inhibition,
      tumor microenvironment, and pathology.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must be ≥ 18 years old at the time of enrollment and have a documented
             germline NF1 mutation in a CLIA certified laboratory or a diagnosis of NF1 based on
             clinical NIH consensus criteria. In addition to substantial cutaneous neurofibroma
             burden as defined below, at least one of the criteria below have to be present:

               -  Six or more café-au-lait macules (≥0.5cm in prepubertal subjects or ≥1.5 cm in
                  post pubertal subjects)

               -  Freckling in axilla or groin

               -  Optic glioma

               -  Two or more Lisch nodules

               -  A distinctive bony lesion (dysplasia of the sphenoid bone or dysplasia or
                  thinning of long bone cortex)

               -  A first-degree relative with NF1

               -  Histologic confirmation of tumor is not necessary in the presence of consistent
                  clinical findings.

          -  Measurable disease: Patients must have substantial cutaneous neurofibroma burden
             causing distress to the patient by disfigurement or itching. Patients must have ≥ 9
             measurable cutaneous neurofibromas. For the purpose of this study measurability will
             be defined for each of the lesions selected as target lesions as a neurofibroma with
             a longest diameter ≥ 3 mm in the longest diameter.

          -  ECOG performance status &lt;2

          -  Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:

               -  hemoglobin &gt;10 g/dL (not requiring RBC transfusions)

               -  absolute neutrophil count &gt;1,500/mcL

               -  platelets &gt;100,000/mcL (not requiring platelet transfusions)

                  above institutional normal

          -  Hematologic parameters for patients undergoing biopsy only: Patients should have INR
             &lt;1.4 and PT ≤ 40 seconds (unless due to lupus anticoagulant). In patients not meeting
             these parameters, clearance by hematology will be required prior to undergoing a
             biopsy.

          -  Ability of subject or Legally Authorized Representative (LAR) to understand and the
             willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

          -  Willingness to avoid excessive sun exposure and use adequate sunscreen protection if
             sun exposure is anticipated.

          -  Willingness to avoid the ingestion of grapefruit and Seville oranges (as well as
             other products containing these fruits, e.g. grapefruit juice or marmalade) during
             the study.

          -  Prior therapy:

               -  Since there is no standard effective chemotherapy for patients with NF1 and
                  cutaneous neurofibromas, patients may be treated on this trial without having
                  received prior medical therapy directed at their PN.

               -  Since selumetinib is not expected to cause substantial myelosuppression, there
                  will be no limit to number of prior myelosuppressive regimens previously
                  received for NF1 related or other tumor manifestations.

               -  Patients who have received previous investigational agents or biologic therapy,
                  such as tipifarnib, pirfenidone, Peg-Intron, sorafenib, or other VEGFR
                  inhibitors are eligible for enrollment.

               -  Growth factors that support platelet or white cell number or function must not
                  have been administered within the past 7 days and are not permitted while on the
                  study.

               -  At least 6 weeks must have elapsed prior to enrollment since the patient
                  received any prior radiation therapy, and the target cutaneous neurofibromas
                  have to be in areas outside of a prior radiation field.

               -  At least 4 weeks must have elapsed since receiving medical therapy directed at
                  NF1 related tumor manifestations.

               -  At least 4 weeks must have elapsed since any surgeries, with evidence of
                  completed wound healing.

               -  Patients who received prior medical therapy for a NF1 related tumor must have
                  recovered from the acute toxic effects of all prior therapy to ≤ grade 1 CTCAE
                  version 4.0 before entering this study.

          -  The effects of selumetinib on the developing human fetus at the recommended
             therapeutic dose are unknown. For this reason women of child-bearing potential and
             men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth
             control; abstinence) prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation,
             and for 4 weeks after dosing with selumetinib ceases. Women of child-bearing
             potential must have a negative pregnancy test prior to entry. Should a woman become
             pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this
             study, the patient should inform her treating physician immediately. Please note that
             the selumetinib manufacturer recommends that adequate contraception for male patients
             should be used for 12 weeks post-last dose due to sperm life cycle.

          -  Informed Consent: Diagnostic or laboratory studies performed exclusively to determine
             eligibility for this trial must only be done after obtaining written informed consent
             from all patients, which can be accomplished using the study specific informed
             consent or another consent, such as the NCI, POB screening protocol. Studies or
             procedures that were performed for clinical indications (not exclusively to determine
             eligibility) may be used for screening or baseline values even if the studies were
             done before informed consent was obtained, if the patient agrees.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents, or have received an
             investigational agent within the past 30 days.

          -  May not have a NF1 related tumor such as optic pathway glioma or malignant peripheral
             nerve sheath tumor, which requires treatment with chemotherapy, radiation, or
             surgery.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, active bleeding diatheses or renal transplant, including any patient
             known to have hepatitis B, hepatitis C or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), or
             psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study
             requirements. Patients with HIV who have adequate CD4 counts and who have no
             requirement for antiviral therapy will be eligible.

          -  Pregnant or breast-feeding females are excluded due to potential risks of fetal and
             teratogenic adverse events of an investigational agent. Males or females of
             reproductive potential may not participate unless they have agreed to use an
             effective contraceptive method. Abstinence is an acceptable method of birth control.

          -  Prior treatment with selumetinib or another specific MEK 1/2 inhibitor.

          -  No supplementation with vitamin E is permitted.

          -  Inability to swallow capsules, since capsules cannot be crushed or broken.

          -  Refractory nausea and vomiting, chronic gastrointestinal diseases (e.g., inflammatory
             bowel disease), or significant bowel resection that would preclude adequate
             absorption.

          -  Strong inhibitors or inducers of hepatic microsomal isoenzymes

          -  While not an exclusion criterion, unless clinically indicated, patients should avoid
             taking other additional non-study medications that may interfere with the study
             medications. In particular, patients should avoid medications that are known to be
             strong inhibitors or inducers of hepatic microsomal isoenzymes CYP1A2, CYP2C8,
             CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4/5, UGT1A1, UGT1A3 and transporters BCRP and P-gp. Because the
             lists of these agents are constantly changing, it is important to regularly consult a
             frequently-updated medical reference. As part of the enrollment/informed consent
             procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of interactions with other
             agents, and what to do if new medications need to be prescribed or if the patient is
             considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal product.
