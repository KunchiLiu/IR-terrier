  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The central objective of this study will be to evaluate the relationship between estrogen
      levels and the pain following oocyte retrieval in women undergoing in vitro fertilization.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subject will undergo standard clinical protocols for the entire oocyte stimulation cycle and
      all assisted reproductive procedure decisions and algorithms will be decided entirely
      independent of this study.

      The anesthetic and postoperative pain regimens will use the same agents and dose ranges used
      in clinical standard practice; however, the regimens will be standardized, so as to limit
      confounding variables. The study regimen for anesthesia will differ from the current,
      clinical standard by the mandated use of actual body weight (in current practice, actual,
      adjusted ideal, or ideal body weights are used), the use of fentanyl 1 mcg/kg IV (instead of
      100 mcg for everyone), and the standardization of postoperative analgesia (noted below). The
      total amount of fentanyl, propofol, and postoperative drugs will be recorded.

      Postoperative analgesia will be standardized based on the subject's self reported verbal
      analogue score (VAS) and the timing of the report. The agents and timing used below differ
      from the current clinical standard by assessing VAS and responding with a certain regimen.
