  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The impending implementation of prenatal whole genome sequencing (PWGS) raises a host of
      ethical concerns given the massive amounts of genetic information that expecting parents
      will be able to learn about their baby. This project involves a cross-sectional quantitative
      survey of pregnant women to explore whether they want access to the kinds of information
      provided by PWGS, why and under what circumstances. The survey will address questions such
      as: What sorts of information do pregnant women want to know about their baby, and why?
      What, if anything, would they do with the information? What kind of guidance would pregnant
      women like from their medical team regarding fetal genetic testing? Given the range of
      practical and ethical challenges posed by PWGS, our data will inform practitioners
      approaches towards PWGS as the technology develops and becomes more widely available. It is
      imperative that government regulators and professional societies take into account the views
      of people directly affected by any policies that are created - including patients themselves
      - before crafting rules for whether, when and how to utilize PWGS.
