  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary study objective is to demonstrate the use of &quot;Dragon Waves Resonant Home Care&quot;
      Electronic Nerve Stimulator (DW1330) is associated with improvement of blood glucose
      control, as measured by change of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c). The second study objectives
      are to demonstrate that DW1330 is associated with the mechanism of glycemic control and
      inflammation pathways. The study is also aimed to investigate the safety of DW1330.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, prospective, double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of
      transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulator (DW1330) to improve blood glucose control in
      patients with type 2 diabetes. Subjects with type 2 diabetes who meet inclusion/exclusion
      criteria will be randomized to either of the 2 groups below:

        1. DW1330

        2. Placebo (sham TENS delivering ineffective pulse wave)

      After enrollment, subjects will be randomly assigned to receive one of the study treatments
      in a double-blind fashion. All patients enrolled should perform 1 treatment within 1 hour
      after dinner 5 days a week. The end of a 20 week treatment period, subjects will be followed
      for an additional 2 weeks for safety follow-up. The time frame includes 2 weeks of
      screening, 20 weeks of treatment, and 2 weeks of post-treatment follow-up.

      Study visits will occur every 2 or 4 weeks depending on the study phase. At randomization
      visit study device will be dispensed at the site, during the treatment period visits, all
      Adverse Events (AEs) as well as follow-up for all AEs that have not been resolved will be
      recorded, changes to concomitant medications will be noted, vital signs will be taken, and
      efficacy evaluations will be performed as well. Investigators, site staff, subjects, and the
      study team will be blinded to the device assigned. The study includes collection of blood
      and urine samples. The end-of-treatment visit and the last estimation of glycemic control
      will occur at week 20 (visit 8) for all subjects. In addition, 2-week follow up will occur
      in order to collect safety data after the device is returned. The final visit will be at
      week 22 (visit 9). Subjects will be encouraged to complete all planned visits regardless of
      their adherence to study device administration.
