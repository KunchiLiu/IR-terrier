      We aim to determine Epidiolex's promise as a pharmacotherapy for cannabis use disorder. We
      hypothesize that Epidiolex, when added to medical management, will result in greater
      reductions in marijuana use compared to placebo as measured by our 2 primary outcome
      measures: 1) quantitative THC levels and 2) self-report by Timeline Follow Back. Secondary
      outcome measures will include treatment retention, patient satisfaction, cannabis
      withdrawal, cannabis craving, depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, , compliance, and
      cigarette use.

      We will conduct a Stage 1 pilot feasibility study at McLean Hospital to begin to evaluate
      Epidiolex as a pharmacotherapy for adults with cannabis use disorder. In a randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, cannabis-dependent subjects ages 18-65 will receive
      medical management over a 6-week period, with half receiving Epidiolex treatment and half
      receiving placebo. Participants will receive either up to 800 mg Epidiolex or placebo over a
      6-week treatment period. Following treatment completion, participants will have a follow-up
      visits at 10 and 14 weeks. Primary outcomes will include self-report of cannabis smoking and
      results of quantitative urine drug screens for cannabis. Secondary outcome measures will
      include treatment retention, patient satisfaction, cannabis withdrawal, cannabis craving,
      depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, compliance, and cigarette use.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        1) Age range 18-65 years; 2) DSM 5 diagnosis of cannabis use disorder, based on the
        Structured Clinical Interview for DSM 5 (SCID-5); 3) express a desire to quit cannabis use
        within the next 30 days; 4) have used cannabis on ≥4 days within the past 30 days (i.e.,
        an average of ≥1 day per week); 5) for women of childbearing age, a negative pregnancy
        test at screening with agreement to use adequate contraception to prevent pregnancy and
        monthly pregnancy tests; for men, contraception will be discussed at the beginning of the
        study with the study physician; 6) consent for us to communicate with their prescribing
        clinician; 7) furnish the names of 2 locators, who would assist study staff in locating
        them during the study period; 8) live close enough to McLean Hospital to attend study
        visits; 9) plan to stay in the Boston area for the next 3 months; and 10) are willing and
        able to sign informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        1) Current diagnosis of other drug or alcohol dependence (excluding nicotine); 2) recent
        (within 3 months) significant cardiac disease; 3) current serious psychiatric illness or
        history of psychosis, schizophrenia, bipolar type I disorder; 4) current medical condition
        (including significant laboratory abnormalities, such as abnormal liver function tests)
        that could prevent regular study attendance; 5) mental retardation or organic mental
        disorder; 6) acutely dangerous or suicidal behavior; 7) currently in a residential
        treatment setting in which substance use is monitored and restricted, since the restricted
        access to drugs could represent an important confounding variable; 8) pregnant, nursing,
        or, if a woman of childbearing potential, not using a form of birth control judged by the
        investigator to be effective; 9) concomitant daily treatment with opioid analgesics,
        sedative hypnotics, or other known CNS depressants; 10) known hypersensitivity to
        cannabinoids or sesame oil ; 11) disease of the gastrointestinal system, liver, or kidneys
        that may impede metabolism or excretion of CBD; 12) inability to read or write in English;
        13) a history of seizures, head trauma or other history of CNS insult that could
        predispose the subject to seizures; 14) currently taking valproic acid, lamotrigine, or
        propranolol, medication metabolized by UGT1A9 or UGT2B7 enzymes (CBD may affect these UGT
        levels).
