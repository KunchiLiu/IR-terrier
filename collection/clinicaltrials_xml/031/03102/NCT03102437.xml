        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects who are 18 years of age or older

          2. Subjects who have a baseline ejection fraction greater than or equal to 25% and less
             than or equal to 45% by echocardiography.

          3. Subjects who, in the opinion of the Investigator (based on the current guidelines for
             clinical practice), have been treated for heart failure for at least 90 days and are
             currently receiving appropriate, stable medical therapy during the 30 days prior to
             enrollment for treatment of heart failure.

          4. Subjects who are in New York Heart Association functional Class III and IV at the
             time of enrollment.

          5. Subjects who are willing and able to return for all follow-up visits.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects who have a potentially correctible cause of heart failure, such as valvular
             heart disease or congenital heart disease.

          2. Subjects receiving any form of inotropic support within 30 days before enrollment,
             including subjects on continuous IV inotrope therapy.

          3. Subjects hospitalized for decompensated heart failure requiring acute treatment with
             intravenous loop diuretics, IV inotropes or hemofiltration within 30 days before
             enrollment and baseline testing.

          4. Subjects having a PR interval greater than 375ms.

          5. Subjects who are scheduled for a CABG or a PTCA procedure, or who have undergone a
             CABG procedure within 90 days or a PTCA procedure within 30 days of enrollment.

          6. Subjects who have a biventricular pacing system, an accepted indication for such a
             device, or a QRS width of 130ms or greater.

          7. Subjects who have had a myocardial infarction within 90 days of enrollment.

          8. Subjects who have mechanical tricuspid valve.

          9. Subjects who have a Left Ventricular Assist Device or prior heart transplant.

         10. Subjects on dialysis.

         11. Subjects who are participating in another experimental protocol.

         12. Subjects who are unable to provide informed consent.
