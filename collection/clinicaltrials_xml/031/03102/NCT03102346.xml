    <textblock>
      Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) after revascularization results in better clinical outcomes，and
      have been strongly recommended for patients with coronary artery disease. In China, as
      compared to the exponential increase of PCI volume, only a very small amount of hospitals
      are able to develop CR programs. There is no large-scale study to explore the feasible CR
      pattern either. Home-based CR might be more favorable and practical for so many Chinese
      revasularized CHD patients due to its feasibility and flexibility as well as low medical
      cost.

      This trial was designed to investigate the safety and efficacy of CR program at home for
      Chinese patients who underwent PCI procedure. This is a multicenter, randomized, controlled
      and observational study. The efficacy and safety of HBCR in revascularized patients will be
      evaluated through observation of its clinical characteristics and safety indicators. The
      study will involve 14 sites nationwide, with an expected sample size of 2,000 followed up
      for 12 months. The primary endpoints is the incidence of composite major adverse cardiac and
      cerebrovascular events (death from any cause, nonfatal myocardial infarction,
      revascularization, stroke).Secondary endpoints are defined as decrease of hospitalization
      due to refractory angina pectoris，the improvements of cardiorespiratory fitness,life
      quality,as well as angina pectoris.

      The subjects will be randomized into 2 different groups, HBCR group and control group. After
      comprehensive evaluation, the orders from CR staff will be given. Besides the routine health
      education in both groups, the subjects in HBCR group will be further introduced the
      instructions of exercise training. CR management software system integrating internet and
      mobile telecommunication techniques, and heart rate monitors will also be used for the
      interaction between medical staff and patients. The effect of HBCR on cardiorespiratory
      fitness, improvement of angina, cardiac function, quality of life, levels of anxiety and
      depression, as well as risk factor profile will also be evaluated. The investigators also
      aim to explore the factors which influence the adherence of subjects to our HBCR program.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Numerous studies have revealed that cardiac rehabilitation (CR) after myocardial infarction
      and/or myocardial revascularization results in better clinical outcomes, including a 20% to
      56% decrease in all-cause mortality, lower cardiac-specific mortality, re-hospitalization,
      revascularization, and better quality of life. International guidelines have been endorsed
      which strongly recommend CR, especially exercise training (ET) for patients with coronary
      artery disease (CAD). Unfortunately, even with this strong evidence, rates of participation
      in cardiac rehabilitation after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) are historically
      low in the worldwide. A variety of factors including lackness of centre-based supervised
      programs, low referral rate and poor compliance of patients turned to be the main
      impediments.

      In China, the morbidity and mortality of CAD is increasing, accompanied by a rapid increase
      in PCI volume, and medical cost. By 2015, totally 567,583 PCI procedures are performed,
      which was estimated to exceed 1,100,000 by 2020. As compared to the exponential increase of
      PCI volume, only a few hospitals have been able to develop CR programs, suggesting a severe
      mismatch between the need for and supply of CR programs. It has been estimated that the
      participation rate in CR programs in China is less than 1%. Therefore, it is important to
      explore and understand the patterns for use of CR associated with the large population of
      CAD patients and limited medical resources in China.

      Owing to the above consideration, home-based ET might be more favorable and practical for
      the large population of Chinese patients undergoing PCI compared with hospital-based ET due
      to its feasibility and flexibility as well as low medical cost. Because home-based CR
      programs could offer an important opportunity to widen patient access and improve their
      adherence, they have been introduced to patients with myocardial infarction, angina, heart
      failure or who had undergone revascularization and shown to be effective in improving their
      clinical and health-related quality of life outcomes.

      However, doubt about the safety and efficiency of home-based CR programs by cardiologists
      and patients has restricted their application in China. Further, there are no data published
      investigating whether home-based CR programs are as effective to improve the prognosis of
      Chinese CAD patients as western countries.

      Therefore, this trial was designed to investigate the safety and efficacy of CR program at
      home for Chinese patients who underwent PCI procedure. This is a randomized, multicenter,
      controlled, prospective and observational study. The efficacy and safety of HBCR in
      revascularized patients will be evaluated through observation of its clinical
      characteristics and safety indicators. The study is expected to involve 14 sites nationwide,
      and will last for about 21 months from initiation in April 2017 to completion in December
      2018, including 9 months of recruitment period, and 12 months of follow-up visits, with an
      expected sample size of 2,000.The primary endpoints is the incidence of composite major
      adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE,death from any cause, nonfatal myocardial
      infarction, revascularization, stroke).Secondary endpoints are defined as decrease of
      hospitalization due to refractory angina pectoris，the improvements of cardiorespiratory
      fitness,life quality,as well as angina pectoris.

      The CAD patients who had undergone PCI will be enrolled into the trial and be randomized
      into 2 different groups, HBCR group and control group. To identify the risk factors of CAD,
      all the subjects will supply their demographic information and medical histories
      (cardiovascular history,comorbidity,etc). Afterwards, they will receive physical examination
      and evaluation of psychological state, nutritional state, exercise habit, as well as smoking
      state. Cardiopulmonary exercise test as well as 6 minutes walking test will also be
      performed to evaluate their cardiorespiratory fitness. Then they will receive the optimal
      drug therapy and the routine health education to tell them how to change their lifestyle.
      Besides these interventions, the subjects in HBCR group will be further introduced the
      instructions of exercise training at home. Seven visits are planned for this study,
      respectively at month 0, month 1,month 2,month 3,month 6,month 9, as well as month 12.

      An exercise regimen will be decided according to the 9th edition of ACSM's guidelines for
      exercise testing and prescription following the target HR/HRAT principle. The target heart
      rate is determined mainly by reserve heart rate, sometimes combined with heart rate at AT.
      Reserve heart rate equals resting heart rate plus 60-80 percent of the difference between
      maximal heart rate and resting heart rate. If the reserve heart rate is higher than heart
      rate at AT, HRAT is taken as the final target in the exercise training. The exercise
      training starts with a warm up for 10 minutes, and followed by 30-40 minutes of aerobatic
      exercise (fast walking or cycling) to meet the target heart rate according to the exercise
      regimen, and ends by a cool down for 10 minutes. Besides the aerobatic exercise, resistance,
      stretching and balance training were also recommended. The aerobatic exercise and stretching
      exercise was planned for 5-6 times per week, while resistance and balance training twice to
      thrice a week. All kind of exercise should maintain the intensity that was between
      &quot;relatively easy and slightly tiring&quot; measured at the Borg Index 11 to 13.

      The investigators will employ a set of CR management system based on the internet and mobile
      telecommunication techniques to interact between medical staff and patients. All the
      information will be recorded also in the system and open to both CR staffs and patients. The
      orders about the medication, nutritional guide, smoke cessation advice, anti-anxiety or
      anti-depression advice as well exercise training plan will be sent by mobile phone to the
      patients periodically to remind the subjects to implement the orders. After the orders were
      implemented, the subjects are needed to confirm via mobile phone. Some health educational
      materials will also be sent to the subjects by message and wechat app. The investigators
      will also equip the subjects with the heart rate bands connected with the CR management
      system. The heart rate data will transmit to the CR data center which will reflect partially
      subjectively whether the orders from CR staff were implemented or not.

      The effect of HBCR on cardiorespiratory fitness, improvement of angina, cardiac function,
      qualityof life, levels of anxiety and depression, as well as risk factor profile will also
      be evaluated. The safety and tolerability of HBCR will also be asscessed. The investigators
      also try to investigate the impact of cardiorespirotary fitness on patient's clinical
      symptoms, cardiac function, quality of life, total mortality, cardiovascular death and
      re-hospitalization due to angina exacerbation in patients who were revascularized. The
      investigators also aim to explore the factors which influence the adherence of subjects
      within the HBCR program.

      Safety assessment includes all the adverse events(AE), monitoring and records (via subject
      follow-up, patient's diary card and telephone follow-up) of suspected adverse reactions,
      laboratory test results, vital signs, physical examinations and 12-lead ECG etc.The subjects
      will provide AE-related information to the investigator during follow-up visits. All AEs
      will be encoded with the latest version of MedDRA.

      This study will be conducted in accordance with the principles advocated by the 18th WMA
      General Assembly (Helsinki, 1964) and all the subsequent amendments, and approved by the
      ethics committee of Chinese PLA General Hospital.
