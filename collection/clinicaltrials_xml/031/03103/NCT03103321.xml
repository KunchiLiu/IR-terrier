    <textblock>
      This randomized phase III trial studies how well decision aids work in improving knowledge
      in patients with prostate cancer. Decision aids may improve patients' knowledge of their
      condition and options for treatment, and may also help when talking with their doctor.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To test the comparative effectiveness of decision aids (DA's) on patient knowledge.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To test the impact of in-visit DA's alone compared to usual care on quality of life
      outcomes and treatment utilization.

      II. To test the impact of out-of-visit DA's alone compared to usual care on quality of life
      outcomes and treatment utilization.

      III. To test the impact of combined in-visit and out-of-visit DA's compared to both usual
      care and individual DAs on quality of life outcomes and treatment utilization.

      IV. To test the comparative effectiveness of DA's on minority men's knowledge. V. To compare
      clinic time required to administer the DA's across arms.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized into 1 of 4 arms.

      ARM A: Patients receive decision aids &quot;Knowing your Options&quot; before and &quot;Prostate Choice&quot;
      during their consultation visit.

      ARM B: Patients receive &quot;Knowing your Options&quot; decision aid before their consultation visit.

      ARM C: Patients receive &quot;Prostate Choice&quot; decision aid during their consultation visit.

      ARM D: Patients undergo usual care.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 12 months.

    <description>A mixed effects regression model (also known as random effects model or multi-level model) will be utilized to examine the effects of the during-consultation Prostate Choice and the pre-consultation Knowing Your Options decision aids. Specifically, this model will contain a fixed intercept, a fixed effect for having received Prostate Choice, a fixed effect for having received Knowing Your Options, and a random, site-specific intercept to allow patients within the same site to be correlated. Baseline patient-level characteristics including race, ethnicity, severity of disease and site-level characteristics may be incorporated in this model if deemed appropriate. A similar approach will be utilized in the statistical analysis of secondary endpoints. Furthermore, descriptive statistics will be reported after incorporating cluster information, in particular, the empirical cluster size, and the observed intra-cluster correlation.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have prostate biopsy within 4 months prior to registration showing
             newly diagnosed prostate cancer, stage T1-3N0M0; in addition, patients must have:
             Gleason score 6-10

          -  Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) &lt; 50 ng/mL

          -  Patients who have had a history of non-cutaneous malignancy in the previous 5 years
             are not eligible; exception: patients with history of non-melanoma skin cancer are
             eligible

          -  Scheduled prostate cancer consultation to be the first consultation after diagnosis
             (i.e. not a second-opinion or a consultation following previous discussions of
             treatment options)

          -  Patients may not be concurrently enrolled to another clinical trial for the treatment
             of cancer; co-enrollment to biospecimen studies is allowed

          -  Patients with impaired decision-making capacity (such as with a diagnosis of dementia
             or memory loss) are not eligible for this study

          -  Patients must be able to read and comprehend English; non-English-speaking patients
             may participate so long as an interpreter (e.g., family member, clinic staff, etc.)
             is present for consent, for the decision aid administration, and gathering of
             baseline and follow-up measures
