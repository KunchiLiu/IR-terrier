  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of this study are to determine the safety and efficacy of Amivita, a
      coumpound of amino acids and vitamines in patients with Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
      (ALS)ALS. The secondary objectives are to measure quality of life before and during
      intervention. This is a self-controlled clinical trial. Twenty patients in our ALS center
      who are already receiving riluzole or other treatments but the condition is worsening will
      receive treatment for 1o months. The evaluating investigators will be blinded to treatment
      assignment. Primary outcome measures will be adverse events, the ALS Functional Rating
      Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R), and survival. Subjects will also be assessed at enrollment and at
      study end for weight loss, forced vital capacity (FVC), quality of life and grip strength.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder affecting
      upper and lower motor neurons. Survival is typically 2 to 5 years from symptom onset; death
      is usually from respiratory paralysis. Standard therapy is with Riluzole 100 mg/day, a FDA
      approved treatment for ALS that has a small effect on survival. There is a strong need for
      more effective therapies in ALS.

      In our previous studies, we have shown that Amivita, a coumpound of amino acids and
      vitamines, is effective for neuronal injury (unpublished data). We have since then use this
      regimen to treat ALS patients. Our retrospective analysis (unpublished data) of the treated
      patient indicates that this regimen can slow down the progression of ALS.

      We proposed a self-controlled clinical trial to study the safety and efficacy of Amivita.
      Secondary outcome measures include weight and quality of life. Twenty subjects in our ALS
      center who are already receiving riluzole will receive treatment for 12 months. The
      evaluating investigators will be blinded to treatment assignment. Primary outcome measures
      will be adverse events, the ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R), and survival.
      Secondary outcome measures include body weight, forced vital capacity (FVC), quality of life
      and grip strength.

      The total study length from first enrolled subject will be approximately 6 months.

      Participants in this study will be subjects with familial or sporadic ALS diagnosed as
      probable, or definite, according to the World Federation of Neurology El Escorial criteria.
      Diagnostic and Inclusionary/Exclusionary criteria will be clearly outlined in the protocol.
