    <description>Subjects will use the Kinesia-ONE™ wearable device in-clinic at Visit 1 and Visit 2 for recording of specific motor symptoms, and additionally subjects will use the Kinesia-360™ wearable device at home while awake for continuous measurement of motor symptoms. The Investigator will use these symptom data to provide feedback to subjects on their motor symptoms and to supplement standard of care to titrate the optimal dose of Neupro for any given subject.</description>

    <intervention_name>Kinesia-ONE™</intervention_name>
    <description>Kinesia-ONE™ wearable sensor uses a subject-worn finger sensor and iPad mini application (APP) to objectively measure specific motor tasks related to Parkinson's disease symptoms such as tremor, bradykinesia (slowed movements), and dyskinesia (involuntary movements) in the Investigator's office. Subjects should wear the Kinesia-ONE™ device on the most affected side.</description>

    <description>Kinesia-360™ wearable sensor includes a wrist and ankle device, along with a cell phone, which is also APP-based, and is designed for continuous day time monitoring of Parkinson's disease symptoms. Subjects will wear Kinesia-360™ while they go about their daily lives, and symptom severity is continually captured to enable objective assessment of Parkinson's disease symptoms. Subjects should wear the Kinesia-360™ device bands on the most affected side.</description>

    <description>All subjects will start Neupro treatment at a dose of either rotigotine 2 mg/24 h or 4 mg/24 h (according to the disease stage of the subject) which will then be adjusted based on symptom assessment either via standard care alone or via a combination of standard care and evaluation of the recordings made available by the Kinesia wearable technologies.</description>

             Parkinsonism

          -  Subject experiences motor symptoms associated with Parkinson's disease that are not
             sufficiently controlled by current therapy. The average of the triplicate resting
             tremor scores and triplicate finger tapping scores from Kinesia-ONE™ (6 scores in
