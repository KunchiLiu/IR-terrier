    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if adding neratinib to either taxol
      (paclitaxel) or to the combination of pertuzumab, trastuzumab, and paclitaxel can help to
      control metastatic or locally advanced breast cancer when given before other standard
      chemotherapy (doxorubicin and/or cyclophosphamide) and surgery. Researchers also want to
      find the highest tolerable dose of neratinib that can be used in these study drug
      combinations. The safety of these drug combinations will also be studied.

      Study Groups:

      If participant is found to be eligible to take part in this study, participant will be
      assigned to 1 of 3 study groups based on participant's screening results:

        -  If participant is in Group A or B, participant will receive neratinib, paclitaxel,
           pertuzumab, and trastuzumab. The difference between these 2 groups is that the dose of
           neratinib and paclitaxel may be different for participants in Group A, but all
           participants in Group B will receive the same dose.

        -  If participant is in Group A, participant will be assigned to a dose level of neratinib
           based on when participant joins this study. Up to 4 dose levels of neratinib will be
           tested. Up to 20 total participants will be enrolled in Group A. The first group of
           participants will receive the lowest dose level. Each new group will receive a higher
           dose than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen. This will
           continue until the highest tolerable dose of neratinib is found.

        -  If participant is in Group B, participant will receive doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide
           after receiving 4 cycles of the drugs listed above.

        -  If participant is in Group C, participant will receive neratinib and paclitaxel
           followed by doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide.

      Study Drug Administration:

      All participants will take neratinib 1 time a day by mouth for the first week as a 1-week
      &quot;pre-cycle&quot;. After that, all study cycles will be 21 days long and participant's drug
      administration schedule will depend on what group participant is in.

      If participant is in Group A:

        -  Participant will take neratinib tablets 1 time a day by mouth with food at the same
           time each day (in the morning, if possible) during Cycles 1 - 4. The study doctor will
           tell participant how many tablets participant needs to take every day.

        -  Participant will receive paclitaxel by vein over about 1-3 hours on Days 1, 8, and 15
           of Cycles 1 - 4.

        -  Participant will receive pertuzumab by vein over about 1 hour on Day 1 of Cycles 1 - 4

        -  Participant will receive trastuzumab by vein over about 1-2 hours on Day 1 of Cycles 1
           - 4.

        -  After Cycle 4, participant's doctor will decide what kind of treatment participant will
           receive next. The study doctor will tell participant more about what participant will
           take and how to take it.

      If participant is in Group B:

        -  Participant will take neratinib tablets 1 time a day by mouth with food at the same
           time each day (in the morning, if possible) during Cycles 1 - 4. The study doctor will
           tell participant how many tablets participant needs to take every day.

        -  Participant will receive paclitaxel by vein over about 1-3 hours on Days 1, 8, and 15
           of Cycles 1-4.

        -  Participant will receive pertuzumab by vein over about 1 hour on Day 1 of Cycles 1 - 4

        -  Participant will receive trastuzumab by vein over about 1 - 2 hours on Day 1 of Cycles
           1 - 4.

        -  Participant will receive standard-of-care doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide by vein over
           about 90 minutes on Day 1 of Cycles 5 - 8.

      If participant is in Group C:

        -  Participant will take neratinib tablets 1 time a day by mouth with food at the same
           time each day (in the morning, if possible) during Cycles 1 - 4. The study doctor will
           tell participant how many tablets participant needs to take every day.

        -  Participant will receive paclitaxel by vein over about 1 - 3 hours on Days 1, 8, and 15
           of Cycles 1 - 4.

        -  Participant will receive standard-of-care doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide by vein over
           about 90 minutes on Day 1 of Cycles 5 - 8.

      If participant is in Group B or C, participant will have standard-of-care surgery after
      participant finishes receiving doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide. Participant will receive a
      separate consent form for the surgery that describes the procedure and its risks.

      Length of Study:

      Participant will receive up to 8 cycles of study drugs. Participant will no longer be able
      to take the study drugs if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if
      participant is unable to follow study directions.

      Participation on the study will be over after the follow-up period.

      Study Visits:

      If participant is in Group A:

        -  Before Day 1 of Cycle 1, participant will have a breast core biopsy to collect tissue
           for biomarker testing.

        -  Before Day 1 of Cycles 1 - 4, and then before participant begins the next treatment,
           participant will have a physical exam including a breast and lymph node exam.

        -  Before Day 1 of Cycle 1 and then before participant begins the next treatment after
           Cycle 4, the study doctor will take pictures of both of participant's breasts.

        -  On Days 1, 8, and 15 of Cycles 1 - 4 and before participant begins the next treatment
           after Cycle 4, blood (about 1-3 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  Before Day 1 of Cycle 1, and then before participant begins the next treatment after
           Cycle 4, participant will have a mammogram of the involved breast and an ultrasound of
           the involved breast and lymph nodes. Participant may have a breast MRI if the doctor
           thinks it is needed.

      If participant is in Group B or C:

        -  Before Day 1 of Cycle 1, participant will have a breast core biopsy to collect tissue
           for biomarker testing.

        -  Before Day 1 of Cycles 1 - 5, after the last dose of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide,
           and before surgery, participant will have a physical exam including a breast and lymph
           node exam.

        -  Before Cycle 1 and Cycle 5, and then before surgery, the study doctor will take
           pictures of both of participant's breasts.

        -  On Days 1, 8, and 15 of Cycles 1 - 5 and then before surgery, blood (about 1-3
           tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  Before Day 1 of Cycle 1, before participant begins receiving doxorubicin and
           cyclophosphamide, and then before surgery, participant will have a mammogram of the
           involved breast and an ultrasound of the involved breast and lymph nodes. Participant
           may have a breast MRI if the doctor thinks it is needed.

        -  During surgery, breast tissue samples will be collected to identify tumors for routine
           testing and for biomarker testing. No additional breast tissue will be removed in
           addition to what would already be removed during surgery.

      Follow-Up:

      About 1 month after surgery, participant will be asked about participant's health and any
      side effects participant may have had. Participant may be asked during a routine clinic
      visit or participant may be called by a member of the study staff. If participant is called,
      each call should last about 2 minutes.

      This is an investigational study. Pertuzumab and trastuzumab are FDA approved and
      commercially available for the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer. Paclitaxel,
      doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide are FDA approved and commercially available for the
      treatment of breast cancer. Neratinib is not FDA approved or commercially available. The
      drug combinations are investigational and are currently being used for research purposes
      only.

      The study doctor can describe how the study drugs are designed to work.

      Up to 99 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

             amplification using FISH, if performed. If IHC is equivocal (2+), assays using FISH
             require gene amplification based on recent ASCO-CAP guideline: dual-probe HER2/CEP17
             ratio is &gt;/=2.0 and/or an average HER2 copy number &gt;/= 6.0 signals/cell. IBC is
             determined by using international consensus criteria: Onset: Rapid onset of breast
             erythema, edema and/or peau d'orange, and/or warm breast, with/without an underlying
             breast mass. Duration: History of such findings no more than 6 months. Extent
             erythema occupying at least 1/3 of whole breast. Pathology: Pathologic confirmation
             of invasive carcinoma

         11. Cohort 1: Phase II: Patient must have HER2+ (regardless of hormonal receptor status)
             stage III IBC.

         12. Cohort 2 Patient must have HER2-/ER+ stage III IBC. HER2 negative status, which
             determined by assays using IHC require negative (0 or 1+) staining score. If IHC is
             equivocal (2+) staining score, assays using FISH require the absence of gene
             amplification: dual-probe HER2/CEP17 ratio is &lt; 2.0 and an average HER2 copy number
             &lt;4.0 signals/cell. If HER2 testing result is confirmed at MDACC, it does not require
             centralized repeat testing. Hormone receptor (HR) positivity is determined by ER &gt;10%
             and /or PR &gt;10% by IHC staining.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Excisional biopsy or lumpectomy for the current breast cancer.

          2. Any other previous malignancies (except for cervical in situ cancers treated only by
             local excision, and basal and squamous cell carcinomas of the skin) within 5 years.

          3. Any other previous antitumor therapies for the current cancer event (previous
             treatment between current diagnosis and previous disease free status need to be
             confirmed). This exclusion does not apply to phase Ib part of cohort 1.

          4. Breast-feeding at screening or planning to become pregnant during the course of
             therapy.

          5. History of active or known autoimmune disease that can cause diarrhea like (but not
             limited to) Addison's Disease, Celiac Disease/Gluten Intolerance/Irritable Bowel
             Syndrome, Scleroderma.

          6. Active infection or chronic infection requiring chronic suppressive antibiotics.

          7. Active hepatitis B or hepatitis C with abnormal liver function tests.

          8. Malabsorption syndrome, ulcerative colitis, inflammatory bowel disease, resection of
             the stomach or small bowel, or other disease or condition significantly affecting
             gastrointestinal function.

          9. Persistent &gt;/= grade 2 diarrhea regardless of etiology.

         10. Sensory or motor neuropathy &gt;/= grade 2

         11. Conditions that would prohibit intermittent administration of corticosteroids for
             paclitaxel premedication. However, corticosteroid can be dropped after confirming of
             no asthma like reaction to paclitaxel after 3 doses.

         12. Uncontrolled hypertension defined as a systolic BP &gt; 150 mmHg or diastolic BP &gt; 90
             mmHg, with or without anti-hypertensive medications.

         13. Cardiac disease (history of and/or active disease) that would preclude the use of any
             of the drugs included in the treatment regimen. This includes but is not confined to:
             (A)Active cardiac diseases including: • symptomatic angina pectoris within the past
             180 days that required the initiation of or increase in anti-anginal medication or
             other intervention; • ventricular arrhythmias except for benign premature ventricular
             contractions; • supraventricular and nodal arrhythmias requiring a pacemaker or not
             controlled with medication; • conduction abnormality requiring a pacemaker; •
             valvular disease with documented compromise in cardiac function; and • symptomatic
             pericarditis. (B) History of cardiac disease: • myocardial infarction documented by
             elevated cardiac enzymes or persistent regional wall abnormalities on assessment of
             LV function; • history of documented CHF; and • documented cardiomyopathy.
