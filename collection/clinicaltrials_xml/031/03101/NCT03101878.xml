             period of study or 2) conduct run-in period for treatment naïve hypertensive patients

          -  Subject has secondary hypertension

          -  Displays evidence of volume depletion (i.e., symptoms of orthostatic hypotension, low
             urine output or increased thirst) during screening or prior to dosing on Study Day 1

          -  Subject anticipates using sildenafil (Viagra), tadalafil (Cialis), or vardenafil
