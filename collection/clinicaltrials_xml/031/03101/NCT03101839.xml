  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A Phase I, open-label, multicentre, dose-escalation study to investigate the safety,
      pharmacokinetics and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of AZD4785 in patients with advanced solid
      tumours where KRAS may be an important driver of tumour survival.

      Part A: Dose escalation in patients with solid tumours to evaluate safety, pharmacokinetics
      and dose

      Part B: Expansion cohort at the selected dose in patients with non small cell lung cancer to
      evaluate pharmacodynamics and clinical response
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a First-Time-in-Human (FTIH), Phase 1 study to determine the MTD, recommended Phase
      2 dose (RP2D), safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacokinetics of AZD4785. The
      study will be conducted in two parts: a dose-escalation part (Part A) and an expansion part
      (Part B). Part B will include three patient groups. Patients must have KRAS mutations
      (KRASm+) identified in tumour tissue samples in order to enter the study.

      AZD4785 will be given as an IV infusion over 1 hour, initially in 3 loading doses during the
      first week and then weekly thereafter. The loading doses will be given on Days 1, 3, and 5
      of the first week and weekly thereafter on Days 8, 15, and 22 of 28 Day cycles. In
      subsequent cycles AZD4785 will be administered on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 until disease
      progression, intolerable toxicity, or discontinuation criteria have been met.
