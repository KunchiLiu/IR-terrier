  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study. Subjects will be
      randomized to one of two treatment groups. Group A will receive CX-8998 and Group B will
      receive placebo. Subject randomization will be stratified by concomitant primidone use and
      site type (sub-study vs non sub-study).

      This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study. Subjects will be
      randomized to one of two treatment groups. Group A will receive CX-8998 and Group B will
      receive placebo. Subject randomization will be stratified by concomitant primidone use and
      site type (sub-study vs non sub-study).

      Tremor will be assessed via The Essential Tremor Rating Assessment Scale (TETRAS) and
      accelerometry. In order to reduce rater bias, all subjects will be videotaped during the
      TETRAS performance scale testing according to a consistent script. The videotapes will be
      rated in a blinded manner. A subset of subjects will participate in an
      electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) sub-study to record
      power-spectral brain activity in specific neuro-anatomical locations and coherence with
      movement measures.

      Subjects will be screened up to one month prior to initiation of dosing. At Baseline,
      subjects will undergo safety and tremor assessments prior to dosing, will receive their
      first dose of study drug and will be monitored for safety for one hour following dosing. For
      one week subjects will receive 4 mg (or matching placebo) twice daily. Subjects will return
      to the clinic on Day 8 for safety monitoring and dose up-titration to 6 mg (or matching
      placebo) twice daily. At Day 15 (Week 3) subjects will return to clinic for safety and
      efficacy assessments and final dose up-titration to 8 mg (or matching placebo) twice daily.
      The final efficacy visit will occur at Day 28 (Week 4). A final safety visit will occur at
      Day 35 (Week 5).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Signed informed consent form indicating that the subject has been informed of the
             procedures to be followed, the experimental nature of the therapy, alternatives,
             potential benefits, side effects, risks, and discomforts.

          -  Men or non-pregnant, non-breastfeeding women 18 years-of-age or older who are able to
             read and understand English.

          -  Diagnosis of definite or probable essential tremor (ET) as defined by the Tremor
             Investigational Group with involvement of the hands and arms without present causes
             of enhanced physiologic tremor (Deuschl et al.,1998).

          -  Diagnosis of ET before the age of 65

          -  Tremor severity score of at least 2 in at least one upper extremity on the TETRAS
             scale.

          -  Total TETRAS performance score of at least 15 (Note: Thresholds of criteria 5 and 6
             shall NOT be shared with study subjects or caregiver to limit Baseline-inflation.)

          -  Has, in the opinion of the investigator, had an inadequate response to at least one
             anti-tremor medication(s) or cannot tolerate available anti-tremor medication(s).

          -  Subjects with reproductive capability including all males and women of child-bearing
             potential (WOCBP) must agree to practice continuous abstinence or adequate
             contraception methods from time of signing informed consent until at least 30 days
             after the last dose (i.e., intermittent abstinence based on &quot;rhythm&quot;, temperature
             monitoring, or other means of timing is not acceptable). Male subjects with a partner
             of child-bearing potential must be surgically sterilized or be willing to use condoms
             with spermicide from the first dose of study drug until at least 30 days after the
             last dose.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Exposure to tremorigenic drugs or drug withdrawal states within the past month

          -  Direct or indirect trauma to the nervous system within 3 months preceding the onset
             of tremor

          -  History or clinical evidence of psychogenic tremor origin

          -  Known history of other medical conditions that may cause or explain subject's tremor,
             including, but not limited to:

          -  Parkinson's disease

          -  Hyperthyroidism

          -  Pheochromocytoma

          -  head trauma or cerebrovascular disease within 3 months prior to the onset of
