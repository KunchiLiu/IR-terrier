  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Boston Medical Center provides care to cancer patients on oral cancer medications through
      the use of Boston Medical Center Specialty Pharmacy (BMC SP). The use of oral medications in
      cancer treatments is relatively new and unfortunately, very little is known about adherence
      in cancer patients. This study will evaluate the influence of a pharmacist-driven medication
      management program on adherence and persistence rates. Boston Medical Center's Specialty
      Pharmacy Adherence Program (B-SPAP), will utilize a high-touch counseling model involving
      clinical pharmacist that will focus on educating patients about their oral cancer
      treatments. The program will require face-to-face counseling with a pharmacist, through the
      use of a proven patient teaching tool, prior to initiating treatment with oral oncolytic
      treatments and, periodically thereafter, based on protocol. This study will help improve our
      understanding of the role of the pharmacist in cancer patients. In addition, the study will
      help identify independent factors that may contribute or impact adherence. The outcomes of
      this program will be compared to a historical control group of patients that have already
      received treatment for their cancer through the BMC Specialty Pharmacy.
