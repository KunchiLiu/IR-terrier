  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3 multicenter study that includes two periods. Period 1 is designed to
      compare the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of ABT-494 Dose A once daily (QD) and Dose B
      QD versus placebo and versus adalimumab every other week (eow) in participants with
      moderately to severely active Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA) and have an inadequate response to
      non-biologic DMARDs (DMARD-IR). Period 1 is also designed to compare the efficacy of ABT-494
      Dose A QD and Dose B QD versus placebo for the prevention of structural progression. Period
      2 evaluates the safety, tolerability and efficacy of ABT-494 Dose A QD and Dose B QD in
      participants with PsA who have completed Period 1.

    <description>The percentage of participants with a greater than or equal to 75% reduction (improvement) in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score at Week 12. PASI is a composite measure of the level of erythema (redness of the skin), induration (hardening of the skin), and desquamation (peeling of the skin) on 4 sites (head, upper extremities, trunk, and lower extremities), each of which are rated on a 5-point scale from 0 (no symptoms) to 4 (very marked). The possible range for PASI score is 0 to 72, with the highest score representing complete erythroderma of the severest possible degree; a decrease in score indicates improvement.</description>
