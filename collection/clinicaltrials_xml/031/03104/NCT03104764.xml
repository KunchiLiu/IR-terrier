  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study was to compare the outcome in terms of wound healing time, surgery
      time, bleeding and patient experience of the ectomy of frenulum when performed with laser
      technology versus conventional scalpel technique. A prospective, single-blind, randomized
      and controlled stydy was performed. Wound healing was assessed five and ten days after after
      surgery. The long-term outcome were assessed blinded by a dentist not earlier involved in
      the study.

    <textblock>
      Children referred to a pediatric clinic to surgically remove a labial frenulum were
      randomized to treatment with conventional scalpel or laser treatment technology after
      parents and children had given consent to participate. During the surgery the time required
      for the procedure and the amount of bleeding the different techniques caused were measured.
      Wound healing was assessed five and ten days after surgery by a clinical judgement and by
      analysing photos. Three months after surgery an independent dentist assessed the long-term
      outcome by a clinical examination. The patients´ view of the treatment were assessed
      directly after the surgery and five days, ten days and three months after the surgery.
