      This study will assess treatment of febrile neutropenia in subjects in with relapsing or
      metastatic breast cancer whose risk level for febrile neutropenia is low and who are
      receiving second line or higher chemotherapy that incorporates doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide.

      This study will assess treatment of febrile neutropenia in subjects with relapsing or
      metastatic breast cancer by enrolling a total of 12 subjects initially to receive 1 of 4
      dose levels of EC-18 (3 subjects per dose level). Subjects will be evaluated for
      dose-limiting side effects that occur at a dose level. EC-18 administration will
      discontinued after a 3-week treatment period. EC-18 treatment will administered continuously
      for 21 days to coincide with the cycle of chemotherapy. The risk of infection based on
      absolute neutrophil count will be assessed during this period. After 21 days of EC-18
      treatment, all subjects will be followed for a 4-week safety assessment.
