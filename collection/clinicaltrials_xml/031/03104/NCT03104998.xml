      To study the effect of coenzyme Q10 on semen parameters in men with idiopathic infertility

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Decreased serum CoQ10 concentrations as well as a decrease in the CoQ10H2 to-ubiquinone
      ratio have been demonstrated in diseases associated with OS. A strong correlation among
      sperm count, motility and ubiquinol-10 levels in seminal fluid has also been reported.

      The aim of the present study is to investigate whether the effects of the exogenous
      administration of ubiquinol in the improvement of semen parameters in Pakistani men
      population.

      Patients who full filled the inclusion criteria and gave informed written consent will be
      included in the trial. Patient will start to take coenzyme q10 and will take it for 26
      weeks.

      All men undergo a thorough physical examination, a detail history, serum biochemical and
      hematological laboratory tests and measurement of serum sex and thyroid hormone levels.
      Randomization codes will provided by the first investigator using a computer generated
      random number table. The randomization codes will centrally assign by the coordination with
      the eligibility criteria. A questionnaire will be used to collect information on demographic
      characteristics. Two semen samples 1and 2 month apart will be obtained after 3 to 5 days of
      sexual abstinence and process within 1 hour of ejaculation. The mean of the two will be used
      for statistical analysis. Semen analyses will be performed using WHO recommended methods

    <description>Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is an essential component of oxidative phosphorylation at mitochondrial level, and also functions to stabilize cell membranes as well as acting as a potent antioxidant. Coenzyme Q 10 shows a very strong correlation between sperm count, motility in disease associated with oxidative stress.</description>

    <description>200 mg of CoQ10 or placebo daily by mouth from day 1 till 26 weeks. CoQ10 treatment is safe, even at the highest doses cited in the literature. Most clinical trials have not reported significant adverse effects that necessitated stopping therapy. However, gastrointestinal effects such as abdominal discomfort, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and anorexia have occurred. Allergic rash and headache have also been reported</description>
