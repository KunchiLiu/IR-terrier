  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the recent introduction of novel anti-multiple myeloma (MM) agents, high risk MM
      remains with poor prognosis and a therapeutic challenge. Elotuzumab (ELO) is a humanized
      monoclonal antibody that recognizes CS1/CD139, a molecule highly expressed in MM cells. The
      ELO (10 mg/kg), lenalidomide (LEN) and dexamethasone (DEX) combination achieves high overall
      response rates (ORR) and long progression-free survival (PFS) for patients with
      relapsed/refractory disease (RR) MM and those with impaired renal function. However, its
      efficacy for MM patients with high risk characteristics is still unknown. Pomalidomide (POM)
      is a recently approved immunomodulatory agent (IMiD) that produces response rates for
      high-risk RRMM patients when used in combination with DEX and other agents, including the
      proteasome inhibitor (PI) bortezomib (BTZ). POM has also demonstrated activity for LEN
      refractory patients. Carfilzomib (CFZ) is a potent second generation PI that has shown to be
      efficacious for IMiD and BTZ refractory patients as well as high risk patients carrying
      cytogenetic abnormalities. In this study, the investigators propose to evaluate efficacy and
      safety of ELO in combination with POM, DEX and CFZ for high-risk RRMM patients.

      This is a Phase 2, multicenter, open label, nonrandomized study with six patients safety
      lead-in cohort to evaluate efficacy and safety of elotuzumab in combination with
      pomalidomide, carfilzomib and dexamethasone among high risk relapsed and refractory multiple
      myeloma patients (See Figure 1: Study SchematicFigure 1: Study Schematic, for overview).

      This study will enroll previously treated patients that currently show evidence of
      progressive disease, and have been diagnosed with high risk multiple myeloma (see Section
      5.1). Thirty-nine patients will be enrolled in the study.

      First, six patients will be enrolled and used as a lead-in cohort for the safety evaluation
      and MTD re-determination (if necessary). The results of the safety lead-in cohort will be
      evaluated after the 6th patient has completed one full cycle of treatment. Recruitment of
      patients will be withheld during safety data analysis. Enrollment of the remaining 33
      patients will be contingent upon safety committee's decision.

      The study consists of: 1) a screening period; 2) up to eight 28-day, treatment cycles; 3) a
      final assessment to occur 28 days after the end of the last treatment cycle; and 4) a
      follow-up period.

      All drugs will be administered on a 28-day cycle schedule throughout the study. Dosing and
      drug administration in this phase 2 study is summarized in Table 4Table 4. Subjects eligible
      for this study will receive treatment with study drug for a maximum of eight 28-day
      treatment cycles. Subjects are to be treated for 8 cycles of therapy without demonstrating
      PD.

      Drug Dosing and Administration:

      Elotuzumab: During cycles 1 and 2 of this study, ELO will be administered intravenously (IV)
      at 10 mg/kg, once a week, on days 1,8,15 and 22 of a 28-day cycle. A step-wise decrease in
      the ELO infusion rate will be as follows: 1) cycle 1 dose 1: infusion time of 2h 50min with
      a step-wise increase in infusion rate (0.5mL/min to 2 mL/min); 2) cycle 1 dose 2: infusion
      time of 1h 13min with a step-wise increase in infusion rate (3mL/min to 4mL/min); 3) cycle 1
      doses 3 and 4: infusion time of 53min with an infusion rate of 5 mL/min; 4) cycle 2 and
      beyond: infusion time of 53min with an infusion rate of 5 mL/min. On cycle 3 and beyond, ELO
      will be given at 10 mg/kg on days 1 and 15 (every other week) of a 28-day cycle as an
      infusion over 53 minutes with an infusion rate of 5mL/min.

      Pomalidomide: POM capsules will be administered per Orem (PO) at 3 mg daily on days 1-21of a
      28-day cycle during all cycles.

      Carfilzomib: Carfilzomib will be given as an IV infusion over 30 min at 20 mg/m2 on days 1
      and 2 of cycle 1 and at 27 mg/m2 on days 8, 9, 15 and 16 of cycle 1, and days 1,2,8,9,15 and
      16 of the 28-day remaining seven cycles. Premedication consisting of dexamethasone (IV) will
      be administered at least 30 minutes, but no more than 4 hours before the carfilzomib
      infusion.

      Dexamethasone: On cycles 1 and 2, patients will be pre-medicated with 28 mg of dexamethasone
      administered PO in the morning the day before of ELO infusion on days 1,8,15 and 22.
      Additionally, patients will be given 8mg IV of dexamethasone on the day of ELO infusion
      45-90 minutes prior to the start of infusion on days 1,8,15 and 22 of cycles 1 and 2.

      On days 1 and 15 of cycles 3 and beyond, dexamethasone will be given PO at 28mg in the
      morning the day before and IV at 8mg 45-90 minutes prior to the start of ELO infusion,
      whereas on days 8 and 22, dexamethasone will be given at 40 mg PO once a day in the morning.

      On Days 2, 9 and 16, DEX 4mg IV will be given to patients at least 30 minutes but no more
      than 4 hours before CFZ infusion. If no infusion reaction is observed, the dexamethasone
      premedication on days 2, 9 and 16 could be dropped, but will be reinstated if there are any
      signs of infusion reaction during subsequent administration of carfilzomib.

      First six patients enrolled in this study will be used as a safety lead-in cohort, where
      safety will be the primary criteria for discontinuing therapy during the first cycle.
      Patients will follow combination drug regimen as described in Table 4Table 4. After 6th
      patient has completed 1 full cycle of the treatment, recruitment of patients will be
      withheld and safety data analysis will be performed by the evaluation safety committee, then
      continuation of this study will be contingent upon safety committee's decision.

      If dialysis is required, drugs administering PO (pomalidomide) and IV (Dexamethasone,
      Elotuzumab and Carfilzomib) will be after dialysis.
