  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Of the patients diagnosed with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) who
      underwent reperfusion therapy and have thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) 3 flow,
      about 40% have flow alterations in the coronary microcirculation, which leads to worse
      remodeling of the left ventricle with a consequent increase in the mortality of this
      population. Clopidogrel is the only known antiplatelet medication that brings benefits to
      the coronary microcirculation. Ticagrelor is significantly superior to clopidogrel in terms
      of decreasing mortality.

      The main objective of this study is to compare the effect of ticagrelor versus clopidogrel
      on the coronary microcirculation by the Myocardial Perfusion Score Index (MPSI) obtained
      using Microbubble Contrasted Echocardiography (MCE) in patients who have STEMI and treated
      with thrombolysis.

      The present project should prospectively include patients participating in the TREAT study,
      who are including individuals with Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI) treated with
      fibrinolytic and openly randomized to ticagrelor or clopidogrel within 24 hours of the onset
      of symptoms. Patients will be submitted to coronary angiography within 4 (± 2) days of the
      onset of symptoms, and those who, at the end of coronary angiography, present residual
      obstruction in the culprit vessel of less than 50% and have TIMI 3 flow, regardless of have
      undergone percutaneous coronary intervention will be included.

      Following, on day 2 (± 1) days after coronary angiography (therefore 6 ± 3 days from the
      onset of symptoms), they will be submitted to microcirculation perfusion evaluation by means
      of MPSI (myocardial perfusion score index) obtained by MCE (Microbubble contrasted
      echocardiography) - blood collection for evaluation of Platelet aggregability will be
      performed immediately prior to the start of MCE. Finally, in order to evaluate left
      ventricular remodeling, patients will undergo a new Echocardiography within 90 (± 10) days
      after discharge.
