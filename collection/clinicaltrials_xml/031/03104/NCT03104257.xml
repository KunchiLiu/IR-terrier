      The purpose of this research study is to determine the temporal course of recovery of CB1R
      availability and neural oscillations, in cannabis-dependent individuals at baseline,
      following 48 hour confirmed inpatient abstinence and after four weeks confirmed abstinence.
      This research will also examine associations between CB1R availability, neural oscillations
      and cognitive function.

      The purpose of this research study is to determine the temporal course of recovery of CB1R
      availability and neural oscillations, in cannabis-dependent individuals at baseline,
      following 48 hour confirmed inpatient abstinence and after four weeks confirmed outpatient
      abstinence (confirmed by tracking creatinine adjusted urine THC-COOH levels). This research
      will also examine associations between CB1R availability, neural oscillations and cognitive
      function using [11-C]OMAR PET imaging and electroencephalography.

      When specimens and information are stored, researchers are careful to try to protect your
      identity from discovery by others. Samples and information will receive a unique code. Other
      researchers will only receive coded samples and information, and will not be able to link
      the code to subjects. Strict security safeguards are in place to reduce the chance of misuse
      or unplanned release of information.
