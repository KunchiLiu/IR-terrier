  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Survivors of childhood cancer are known to be at higher risk of developing premature,
      serious cardiovascular disease compared with the general population. Hypertension,
      dyslipidemia, and diabetes increase this risk beyond that attributable to one's original
      cancer therapy exposures. Research has shown that childhood cancer survivors also have a
      high burden of underdiagnosis and undertreatment of these potentially modifiable conditions.
      The goal of this study is to:

        1. To determine the prevalence of underdiagnosis and undertreatment of common
           cardiometabolic conditions (i.e., hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes) in survivors of
           childhood cancer at high-risk of future serious cardiovascular disease.

        2. Among survivors who are found to be underdiagnosed or undertreated, to determine (via
           randomized clinical trial) the efficacy of a counseling/educational intervention to
           improve control of these cardiometabolic conditions.

        3. Determine barriers on among survivors enrolled on the randomized trial and their
           primary healthcare providers that contribute to undertreatment of the study's targeted
           cardiometabolic conditions.
