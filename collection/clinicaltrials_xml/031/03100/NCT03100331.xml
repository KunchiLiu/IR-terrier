  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children who are perinatally-infected with HIV are extremely vulnerable to cognitive delays
      and psychiatric disease, and the risk for neuropsychiatric illness is compounded in children
      who are internationally-adopted and may have suffered trauma, abandonment, malnutrition and
      neglect. While cognitive and psychiatric issues have been described in HIV-infected
      children, and even more so in HIV-positive adults, there have been no reports on
      neuropsychiatric interventions that can improve cognitive and psychiatric states in this
      highly vulnerable population. Without these needed data, Pediatric HIV providers have not
      been able to advocate for optimal neuropsychiatric care in perinatally HIV-infected
      children, let alone those who has suffered the additional risk of being internationally
      adopted. In the proposed study, the investigators will report on the neuropsychological
      profiles and outcomes in a cohort of internationally-adopted, perinatally HIV-infected
      children between ages 6 to 16 years who have not previously undergone neuropsychological
      testing or treatment. Data obtained from this study will provide important contributions to
      the literature by building understanding of the complex needs of this population as well as
      guiding future intervention efforts. The investigators predict that intervention efforts
      aimed at helping educators understand the learning and cognitive challenges for many of our
      patients will guide targeted academic supports in the school setting and lead to gains in
      academic skills. The detailed information obtained during the comprehensive
      neuropsychological assessment and follow-up care will be shared with the child's key
      educators at school so that individualized educational strategies can be developed, while
      maintaining confidentiality regarding the child's HIV status.
