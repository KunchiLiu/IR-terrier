  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Purpose: Implement a Patient Aligned Care Team (PACT) model that identifies and proactively
      manages Veterans at the highest risk for hospital admission and death while they are still
      in the ambulatory care setting.

      Goal:

        -  Reduce emergency department and urgent care utilization, hospitalization, and mortality
           in complex, high risk patients

        -  Improve Veteran and staff satisfaction

      Objectives:

        -  Maintain the patient in the home setting as much as possible

        -  Secure appropriate home environment to facilitate health and well-being

        -  Utilize comprehensive team-based care

        -  Engage appropriate Veteran Health Administration (VHA) programs to provide
           interdisciplinary, coordinated, and timely management of complex medical issues
