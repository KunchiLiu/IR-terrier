      The objective of this study is to evaluate sixty male and non-pregnant female patients
      diagnosed with acute moderate to severe low back pain with the onset of symptoms within 30
      days. To evaluate functional improvement following a 4-week use of an in-elastic lumbar
      sacral orthosis (LSO) as a treatment modality for acute low back pain.
