  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      MIRP (Minimally Invasive Repair of Pectus) as surgical correction of pectus excavatum or
      carinatum is performed to achieve physiological, cosmetic, and psychological benefits for
      the patient. Surgery is often associated with severe postoperative pain. In this study the
      researchers want to registrate pain, sleep, nausea/vomiting, and daily activities in short
      and long term follow up.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In order to provide pain patients with an individualized approach to their pain problem
      after MIRP we developed an electronic medical record coupled to a set of telemetric
      medical-grade devices. Appi@Home (Antwerp Personalized Pain Initiative) supports an
      innovative approach to (sub)acute conditions by offering a platform for continuous
      follow-up. Patients are provided with a toolbox and an app that continuously collects
      objective outcome data (i.e. pain intensity, sleep quality, physical activity). The
      integrated system allows the care givers to respond very quickly to changing clinical
      conditions of the patient, making a very adaptive and individualized follow-up possible for
      these patients. In addition, the patient becomes an active participant in the global
      therapeutic approach.

      Patients receive the toolbox two week prior to surgery with access to the internet platform
      for questionnaires fill-in procedure. Up to ten week after surgery pain intensity, sleep
      quality and physical activity will be monitored subjectively by a scoring table (0-10, 0 no
      pain-bad sleeping quality-no activity, 10 maximum of pain-excellent sleeping quality- a lot
      of activity) and objectively by blood pressure device, oxygen saturation monitoring,
      activity tracker and sleep registration tool.
