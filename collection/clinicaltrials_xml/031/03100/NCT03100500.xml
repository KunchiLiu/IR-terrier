        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Written informed consent must be obtained before any assessment is performed.

          -  Male and female adult patient ≥ 18 years old.

          -  Patients with a diagnosis of persistent asthma (GINA 2016) for a period of at least 1
             year prior to Visit 1.

          -  Patients who have used medium or high dose ICS plus at least 1 controller for asthma
             for at least 6 months and at stable dose and regimen for at least 4 weeks prior to
             Visit 1.

          -  Patients must have ACQ-7 score ≥ 1.5 at Visits 2 and qualify for treatment with high
             dose ICS/LABA

          -  Pre-bronchodilator FEV1 of ≥ 50% and ≤ 85% of the predicted normal value for the
             patient after withholding bronchodilators at Visit 2.

          -  Patients must demonstrate reversibility defined as an increase in FEV1 of ≥ 12% and
             200 mL within 30 minutes after administration of 400 μg of salbutamol at Visit 2.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have had an asthma attack/exacerbation requiring systemic steroids or
             hospitalization or emergency room visit within 6 weeks of Visit 1.

          -  Patients who have ever required intubation for a severe asthma attack/exacerbation.

          -  Patients who have a clinical condition which is likely to be worsened by ICS
             administration (e.g. glaucoma, cataract and fragility fractures) who are according to
             investigator's medical judgment at risk participating in the study.

          -  Patients who have had a respiratory tract infection or asthma worsening as determined
             by investigator within 4 weeks prior to Visit 1 or between Visit 1 and Visit 99.
             Patients may be re-screened 4 weeks after recovery from their respiratory tract
             infection or asthma worsening.

          -  Patients with a history of chronic lung diseases other than asthma, including (but
             not limited to) chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, sarcoidosis, interstitial lung
             disease, cystic fibrosis, clinically significant bronchiectasis and active
             tuberculosis.

          -  Patients with severe narcolepsy and/or insomnia.

          -  Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women

          -  Women of child-bearing potential unless they are using highly effective methods of
