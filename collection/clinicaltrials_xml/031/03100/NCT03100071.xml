  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cancer patients with Central Venous Catheter (CVC) Associated Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)
      will be treated with Low Molecular Weight Heparin (LMWH) and apixaban. Study duration is 12
      weeks.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cancer patients who have developed blood clot in the arm that has the central venous
      catheter will be treated with standard of care blood thinning injection of low molecular
      weight heparin for 1 week and then for apixaban 5 mg twice daily for the rest of 11 weeks.
      Data will be collected to see if the central venous catheter &quot;survived&quot; or remained in place
      and did not have to be taken out because of the clot.
