  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As many as 70-85% subjects diagnosed with a follicular lesion on biopsy and undergoing
      surgery will have benign lesions verified by histopathology after surgery.

      Currently there is no method of pre-operatively diagnosing benign follicular lesions, as a
      result these subjects will have had surgery for diagnosis of a benign lesion.

      The aim of this study is to see whether shear-wave elastography, a new ultrasound technology
      can help pre-operatively diagnose benign follicular lesions. If successful, a lot of
      patients will not need surgery for the diagnosis of a benign lesion.

      The main goal of this study will be to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of a new ultrasound
      technology (shear-wave elastography - SWE) for the diagnosis of malignancy in follicular
      lesions. Participants who have been diagnosed with a follicular lesion on thyroid biopsy and
      are scheduled for thyroid surgery will be eligible to participate. All participants will
      undergo a detailed ultrasound examination prior to their surgery. The results of the
      ultrasound will be compared with histopathology after surgery to test the diagnostic
      accuracy of SWE.

    <description>Elastography provides a quantitative score of thyroid nodule stiffness that is expected to correlate with the biological nature of the nodule.
We will compare mean elastography values of all benign lesions with mean values of all malignant lesions on histopathology obtained post surgery.</description>
