  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the best way to optimize the success of external
      cephalic version (turning the baby from the outside). Attempting to turn babies in-utero is
      recommended because it may decrease the risk of needing a cesarean section for abnormal
      presentation. While the study team knows that this procedure can be effective, the study
      team still has some un-answered questions as to the best way to perform this procedure to
      increase the chance of success. Many prior studies have shown that using spinal anesthesia
      (a shot of medication placed in your back to numb and relax the abdomen) can increase the
      success rate of a version. This ultimately has led to the finding that using this anesthesia
      can decrease the rate of cesarean section. However, there have been only a small number of
      studies assessing the success rate if spinal anesthesia is used only in the event that
      without it fails. Therefore the study team is going to compare patients who receive spinal
      anesthesia with those who only receive spinal anesthesia if the procedure to turn the baby
      (ECV) fails without it.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breech presentation occurs in approximately 3-4% of term pregnancies and leads to one of the
      most common indications for cesarean delivery. Attempting an external cephalic version (ECV)
      significantly increases the chance of cephalic presentation at time of delivery and reduces
      the chance of cesarean section (1). Since ECV does in fact reduce the rate of cesarean
      section, many studies have sought to determine the best method to perform the procedure to
      optimize the chance of success. A recent meta-analysis concluded that administration of
      neuraxial analgesia significantly increases the success rate of ECV and also increases the
      incidence of vaginal delivery (2). However, there have been only 2 prospective studies and
      no randomized trials that evaluated the success of ECV using neuraxial analgesia only when
      initial attempt without it has failed (3,4). Therefore, the study team designed a randomized
      controlled trial with two groups: Group 1- patients receiving spinal anesthesia immediately
      versus Group 2- patients attempting ECV without spinal anesthesia with reattempt using a
      spinal if first attempt fails. This study will be conducted on labor and delivery at Mount
      Sinai West hospital. Patients who present to labor and delivery at term for ECV will be
      approached for enrollment and those who consent to be part of the study would be randomized
      into a group. ECV will then be attempted and delivery and neonatal outcomes will be
      collected. Patients will likely be enrolled in the study from time of version (approximately
      37 weeks) until postpartum. This study will take approximately 1-2 years given the ECV rate.

    <description>The patient will have a spinal administered by the on call anesthesiologist using standard protocol (intrathecal bupivacaine 7.5 mg). The patient will then be administered 0.25 mg Terbutaline subcutaneously and the ECV will be attempted. Under ultrasound guidance the provider will attempt to lift the breech upward from the pelvis with one hand and guide the head with the other hand to produce a forward roll. If forward roll fails, a backward roll somersault may be attempted. ECV attempt will be abandoned if there is significant fetal bradycardia, discomfort to the patient, or if the procedure cannot be completed easily with these maneuvers. Once attempt is complete, whether successful or not, the patient will be monitored for a minimum of 30 minutes, and will be discharged once they are able to walk, void, and tolerate PO intake, only if fetal and maternal status is reassuring.</description>
