    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pivotal study is to compare the efficacy of ABL001 with that of
      bosutinib in the treatment of patients with CML-CP having previously been treated with a
      minimum of two prior ATP-binding site TKIs with BCR-ABL ratios ≥ 1% IS at screening.

             contraception methods include:

          -  Total abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the
             subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,
             post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception

          -  Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without
             hysterectomy) total hysterectomy or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking
             study treatment). In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of
             the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment

          -  Male sterilization (at least 6 months prior to screening). The vasectomized male
             partner should be the sole partner for that subject.

          -  Use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception or placement of
             an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS) or other forms of hormonal
             contraception that have comparable efficacy (failure rate &lt;1%), for example hormone
             vaginal ring or transdermal hormone contraception.

          -  In case of use of oral contraception women should have been stable on the same pill
             for a minimum of 3 months before taking study treatment.

          -  Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have
             had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical
             profile (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical
             bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy), total hysterectomy or tubal
             ligation at least six weeks ago. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the
             reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level
             assessment is she considered not of child bearing potential.

          -  Sexually active males unless they use a condom during intercourse while taking the
             drug during treatment and for 3 days after stopping treatment and should not father a
             child in this period. A condom is required to be used also by vasectomized men as
             well as during intercourse with a male partner in order to prevent delivery of the
             drug via semen.
