    <textblock>
      This post authorization safety study is designed as prospective non interventional study for
      patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who are not eligible for transplant. The
      objective is to compare the incidence of cardiovascular events between patients treated with
      a first-line lenalidomide containing regimen and those treated with a first-line
      non-lenalidomide containing regimen. Treatment in both cohorts will be done according to
      standard care. The study will gather risk factor information at baseline and throughout
      follow-up. Any cardiovascular event occurring will be assessed by an independent committee.
      Other safety endpoints will be collected through standard procedures. Observation period
      will be 3 years on treatment, with an additional evaluation of cardiovascular events 6
      months' post treatment and a follow up period until 5 years after inclusion. During follow
      up the incidence of second primary malignancies (SPM) and overall survival will be assessed.
