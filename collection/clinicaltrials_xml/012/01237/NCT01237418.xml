  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The observatory FAST MI 2010 proposes to establish a cohort of 3500 patients recruited
      prospectively over a period of 2 months.

      Patients will be followed up at 1 month and then followed annually for 10 years.

      Patients should have agreed to participate in the study, participation in the protocol, or
      refusal to participate will not affect the therapeutic approach of the physician. The study
      of genotypic or phenotypic characteristics will not change the therapeutic approach of
      health care teams.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter observational study, given to 300 prospective medical facilities, CHU,
      CHG, CHR, health facility of the Army, including a clinic or intensive care unit entitled to
      receive emergency ACS. (See attached list 10-6) A questionnaire will be sent to each center
      before the recruitment center on the type and number of beds (Appendix 10-5)

      Patients will be recruited consecutively in the CIAU member during a period of 2 months.

      The 1-month follow-up will be done by the referring physician of each ISB, by mail or
      telephone contact with the treating physician and / or patient.

      Annual follow-ups will be conducted during 10 years of clinical research technicians of the
      French Society of Cardiology, mail and / or telephone contact with the municipalities of
      birth, treating physicians and patients.

      When normal blood test done at the patient's admission into ISB, an additional quantity of

      only markers related to atherosclerotic disease

        Patients will be recruited consecutively in the CIAU member during a period of 2 months,
        including sub-populations of specific interest (diabetes and / or elderly patients, for
        example). A list of eligible patients not included and must be completed by the
        participating centers during the same period, with reasons for non inclusion.

        A questionnaire will be sent to each center prior to recruitment, including type of
        service and number of beds in the facility.

        The study will be given to any medical facility, University Hospital, CHG, CHR, health
        facility of the Army, including a clinic or intensive care unit entitled to receive
        emergency ACS. In each center, a medical consultant will be appointed to collect
        phenotypic data for the study case report forms in electronic patient.
