  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The broad, long-term objective of this research protocol is to improve the quality of life
      for patients suffering from lumbar spinal stenosis. This objective will be met by examining
      the safety and clinical efficacy of epidural steroid injections for treatment of pain
      associated with lumbar spinal stenosis. This prospective, randomized, double-blind
      controlled trial (RCT) will test the hypothesis that the effectiveness of epidural steroid
      injections (ESI) plus local anesthetic (LA) is greater than epidural injections of LA alone
      in older adults with lumbar spinal stenosis.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lumbar spinal stenosis is one of the most common causes of low back pain in the elderly and
      can lead to significant disability. The symptoms of spinal stenosis range from low back pain
      to neurogenic claudication with lower extremity pain, weakness and/or sensory changes
      related to activities. As spinal stenosis can affect the central canal as well as the
      lateral recesses and intervertebral foramen variably, symptoms can involve single or
      multiple myotomes and dermatomes. Since the causes of spinal stenosis are most frequently
      degenerative changes, the symptoms of spinal stenosis often, but not always, worsen over
      time. Despite the prevalence of spinal stenosis, treatment of spinal stenosis remains
      somewhat controversial. Common treatments include conservative measures such as
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDS), activity modification and physical therapy as
      well as more invasive treatments such as epidural steroid injections and surgery. Although
      surgery has been demonstrated to provide some benefit to many individuals with spinal
      stenosis, ESI are being used with increasing frequency as a less invasive, potentially more
      cost effective and safer treatment for spinal stenosis. However, there is a lack of data to
      demonstrate the effectiveness and safety of epidural steroid injections for spinal stenosis,
      particularly in the older adults.

      Because of the compelling need for effective therapy for patients suffering from spinal
      stenosis and because epidural steroid injections are rapidly becoming standard of care for
      treating these patients - even in the absence of compelling clinical evidence - we are
      conducting a randomized, controlled trial in order to test the hypothesis that lumbar
      epidural steroid injections improve functional status and pain associated with spinal
      stenosis. The main objective of the study is to conduct a blinded, randomized controlled
      trial (RCT) in elderly patients with spinal stenosis to test if the effectiveness of
      epidural steroid injections (ESI) plus local anesthetic (LA) is greater than LA alone.
