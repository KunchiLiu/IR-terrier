  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We propose to enroll 140 subjects scheduled for elective or urgent/emergent surgery with
      general anesthesia including endotracheal intubation. Patients qualify for the trial if they
      are considered a difficult airway case as determined by measurement of common predictive
      indices for difficult intubation (see inclusion criteria). All patients will be intubated
      with a GVL. Patients will be randomly assigned to either having their ETT placed with use of
      a pre-formed stylet provided by the manufacturer of the GVL (control group) or with a
      flexible, disposable tracheoscope (aScope, Ambu, Denmark) (intervention group). The
      randomization will be stratified as to whether patients are categorized as predicted
      difficult airway or have an immobilized cervical spine (C-collar in place).

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Intubation time</measure>
    <time_frame>During intubation</time_frame>
    <description>divided into time to successfully place the glidescope (visualization of the epiglottis), time to successfully insert the videostylet (passing through the cords) and time to verified placement of the ETT (as outlined above). Interim bag and mask time, if needed, will not be included in the intubation time. More than 5 attempts or 120 s are regarded as failure of intubation. If failure to secure the airway occurs with the GVL and videostylet, then conventional difficult intubation protocols approved by the University of Louisville Hospital will be implemented.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The number of intubation attempts</measure>
    <time_frame>30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>counted as each approach of the ETT to the glottic entrance.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Neck Movement:</measure>
    <time_frame>30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>One observer will video-record the entire intubation procedure. At a later time, an otherwise unrelated observer will watch the video-records and grade the neck movement during intubation. Neck movement will be classified as Grade 0: no neck movement, Grade 1: minimal neck movement, or Grade 2: moderate neck movement</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>laryngeal view grade</measure>
    <time_frame>30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The laryngeal view grade according to the method described by Cormack and Lehane</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Ease of intubation</measure>
    <time_frame>2-4 hours after intubation</time_frame>
    <description>After completion of the procedure the intubator will be asked to score the ease of intubation. To do this, he/she will give a score from 0-100 with 0 being the easiest and 100 being the hardest.</description>
