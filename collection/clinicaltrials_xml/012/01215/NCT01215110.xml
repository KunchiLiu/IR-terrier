      The trial will evaluate the extended bactericidal activity of 14 consecutive days of oral
      administration of TMC207 at multiple doses as determined by the rate of change of logCFU in
      sputum over the time period Day 7-14 in participants with smear positive pulmonary
      tuberculosis (TB). A control group will receive standard treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Provide written, informed consent prior to all trial-related procedures including HIV
             testing.

          -  Male or female, aged between 18 and 65 years inclusive.

          -  Body weight (in light clothing and with no shoes) between 40 and 90 kg, inclusive.

          -  Newly diagnosed, previously untreated, uncomplicated, sputum smear-positive,
             pulmonary TB.

          -  A chest X-ray picture which in the opinion of the Investigator is compatible with TB.

          -  Sputum positive on direct microscopy for acid-fast bacilli (at least 1+ on the
             IUATLD/WHO scale).

          -  Ability to produce an adequate volume of sputum as estimated from a spot assessment
             (estimated 10 ml or more overnight production).

          -  Females may participate if they are of non-childbearing potential, if they are using
             effective birth control methods and are willing to continue practicing birth control
             methods throughout treatment or if they are non-heterosexually active or willing to
             practice sexual abstinence throughout the treatment period or have a vasectomized
             partner (confirmed sterile). Therefore to be eligible for this study women of
             childbearing potential should either:1) use a double barrier method to prevent
             pregnancy (i.e. use a condom with either diaphragm or cervical cap) or 2) use
             hormonal based contraceptives in combination with a barrier contraceptive, or 3) use
             an intrauterine device in combination with a barrier contraceptive. They must also be
             willing to continue these contraception until 6 months after last study drug or 6
             months after discontinuation from study medication in case of premature
             discontinuation. (Note: Hormone-based contraception may not be reliable when taking
             TMC207; therefore, hormone-based contraceptives cannot be used by female patients to
             prevent pregnancy).

          -  Male patients must be willing to use a condom with spermicide when having
             heterosexual intercourse throughout treatment and until 1 month after last study drug
             administration or 1 month after discontinuation from study medication in case of
             premature discontinuation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Evidence of clinically significant metabolic, gastrointestinal neurological,
             psychiatric or endocrine diseases, malignancy, or other abnormalities (other than the
             indication being studied).

          2. Known or suspected hypersensitivity to study medications (including any rifamycin
             antibiotics)

          3. Rifampicin-resistant and/or isoniazid-resistant bacteria detected with a sputum
             specimen collected within the pre-treatment period and tested at the study
             laboratory.

          4. Clinically significant evidence of extrathoracic TB (miliary TB, abdominal TB,
             urogenital TB, osteoarthritic TB, TB meningitis), as judged by the investigator.

          5. Current or past history of alcohol and/or drug use that, in the investigator's
             opinion, would compromise the participant's safety or compliance to the study
             protocol procedures.

          6. HIV infected patients:

               1. having a CD4+ count &lt;300 cells/µL;

               2. or having received antiretroviral therapy medication within the last 90 days:

               3. or having received oral or intravenous antifungal medication within the last 90
                  days;

               4. or with an AIDS-defining opportunistic infection or malignancies (except
                  pulmonary TB).

          7. Significant cardiac arrhythmia requiring medication

          8. Having participated in other clinical studies with investigational agents within 8
