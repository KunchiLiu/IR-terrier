  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to study the MRD status after VELCADE based induction therapy
      (VELCADE, lenalidomide, dexamethasone or VELCADE, liposomal doxorubicin, dexamethasone) in
      patients with previously untreated multiple myeloma and study the impact of HDC and ASCT on
      MRD status post‐transplant. Our hypothesis is that MRD‐status will continue to increase
      significantly at 3 months post‐transplant and will validate that HDC and ASCT needs to be
      performed even when patients have achieved major response after induction therapy with novel
      agents.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Confirmed Multiple Myeloma as defined below within 120 days of starting cycle 1:

          -  Bone marrow plasmacytosis with ≥ 10% plasma cells or sheets of plasma cells or biopsy
             proven plasmacytoma

          -  Presence of M protein in serum or urine or both. Conventional M spike, serum free
             light chains, or 24 hour urine study. Non‐secretory myeloma is not eligible for this
             study.

          -  Hypercalcemia

          -  Renal insufficiency

          -  Bone disease manifested by lytic lesion or osteoporosis (if osteoporosis is the only
             organ dysfunction criteria then BM should have ≥ 30% plasma cells)

          -  Confirmed Multiple myeloma as defined above within 90 days of starting cycle 1

             EXCEPT if used in conjunction with palliative radiation to prevent vasogenic edema.
             In that case steroids should have been used for less than 7 days. Prior steroid use
             for non‐malignant disorders is permitted and should have been restricted to less than
             the equivalent of prednisone 10 mg per day. Prior or concurrent topical or localized
             steroid therapy to treat non‐malignant disorders is permitted

          -  Prior palliative and/ or localized radiation therapy is permitted provided at least 4
             weeks have passed from date of last radiation therapy to starting cycle 1.

          -  Patients with prior solitary plasmacytoma treated with radiation therapy with
             curative intent are eligible if the disease has now progressed to active multiple
             myeloma and meeting all eligibility criteria for the protocol

          -  ECOG PS 0, 1 or 2

          -  For women of childbearing potential a negative serum pregnancy test is required
             within 4 weeks of starting cycle 1 and then every 4 weeks during the first 4 cycles
             of induction therapy

          -  Women of child bearing potential must be willing to refrain from sexual intercourse
             or willing to employ a dual method of contraception, one of which is highly effective
             (IUD, birth control pills, tubal ligation or partner's vasectomy) and another
             additional method (condom, diaphragm, or cervical cap) during the entire course of
             the study (start of therapy until 30 days after stem cell transplant).

          -  Sexually active males should be willing to use a condom (even if they have had a
             prior vasectomy) while having intercourse with any women during the course of the
             study (start of therapy until 30 days after stem cell transplant).

          -  Voluntary written informed consent before performance of any study‐related procedure

             angina, severe uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmias, or electrocardiographic evidence
             of acute ischemia or active conduction system abnormalities. Prior to study entry,
             any ECG abnormality at Screening has to be documented by the investigator as not
             medically relevant.

          -  Patient has hypersensitivity to VELCADE, boron or mannitol.
