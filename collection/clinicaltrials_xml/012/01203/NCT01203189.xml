  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aims of this study are to compare the effectiveness of antifungal foam versus antifungal
      shampoo and determine patient compliance and satisfaction with both vehicles among African
      American females with dandruff practicing less than once weekly hair washing.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A wide variety of topical vehicles are available for medications that treat scalp disorders.
      Proper vehicle selection is important when managing scalp conditions, such as seborrheic
      dermatitis, because the efficacy of these treatments depends largely on compliance and the
      amount of active ingredient delivered to the scalp. It is therefore important to prescribe
      vehicles that are easy to apply and cause the least amount of disruption to the patients'
      pre-existing hair care practices. One of the most common rate limiting hair care practices
      among different cultures is wash frequency. Literature shows African American women are more
      likely to wash their hair less than once weekly versus Caucasian women. We hypothesize
      certain vehicles, such as foam preparations which do not require hair washing, will be more
      efficacious in African American women with seborrheic dermatitis than shampoo preparations.

    <measure>Total Dandruff Severity Score (TDSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The scalp will be divided into quadrants and for each quadrant the percent of involvement and degree of severity will be assessed. The percent of involvement will be measured on a scale of 0 to 4 in which a score of 0 means less than 10% involvement, and a score of 4, more than 76% involvement. Severity will be measured on a scale of 0 to 3 in which a score of 0 indicates normal skin, and a score of 3, marked erythema with thick confluent plates of yellowish white scales. The whole scalp score will then calculated by multiplying the total percent involvement score by the total severity score.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Compliance</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Patient compliance will be evaluated by having patients keep a diary documenting the use of study drug. They will also be questioned about their medication usage at every visit. In addition, we will weigh the study drug at every visit.</description>

    <measure>Patient Satisfaction</measure>

    <measure>Additional Improvement in the Total Dandruff Severity Score (TDSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Shampoo subjects will be able to cross over into the foam group if their TDSS score does not improve by 60% at the end of the four week treatment period. These cross over subjects will remain in the study for an additional four weeks and apply foam in the same manner as subjects in the original foam group.</description>
