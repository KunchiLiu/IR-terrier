             therapy or for which no standard therapy exists

          -  Expansion stage: Patients with one of the following epithelial,
             histologically-documented, incurable, locally advanced, or metastatic tumor that has
             progressed despite standard therapy or for which no standard therapy exists:
             colorectal cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma,
             or pancreatic cancer

          -  Use of an effective means of contraception (e.g., abstinence, hormonal or double
