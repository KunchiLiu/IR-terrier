  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People who have neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) can have tumors that grow on the auditory
      nerves and cause hearing loss. These tumors are called vestibular schwannomas (VSs), or
      acoustic neuromas. People with NF2 can also get schwannomas in other parts of their body, as
      well as tumors called meningiomas and ependymomas. Because VSs can cause hearing loss, many
      people with NF2 will have treatment to preserve their hearing. This treatment usually
      involves surgery. Because surgery has risks and is not able to help everyone with VSs, other
      methods of treatment are being explored. One area of exploration is looking to see if there
      is a drug that can be taken that might prevent the VSs from growing larger and causing
      hearing loss or brainstem compression. This study is exploring whether a drug that is
      approved by the FDA and is currently used to treat other tumors might also work to treat
      VSs. Based on people who have taken this drug to treat VSs already, there is some reason to
      think that it might be helpful to certain people with NF2. People enrolled in this study
      will receive the drug one time every three weeks for one year by infusion. This study will
      follow subjects over the course of the year that the person is taking the drug and for six
      months after the drug is stopped. This study is recruiting people who have NF2 and are
      currently having symptoms of tinnitus, dizziness, and/or hearing loss from their VSs. If you
      have NF2 and are currently having symptoms caused by your VSs, you may be eligible to
      participate.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. The primary objective of this study is to determine the activity of bevacizumab for
      treatment of symptomatic vestibular schwannomas (VS) defined as progressive hearing loss in
      patients with neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) based on objective hearing response.

      SECONDARY OJBECTIVES:

      I. Determine the safety and tolerability of bevacizumab in this patient population on an
      every three week dosing schedule of 7.5mg/kg for 12 months of therapy.

      II. Assess the rate of radiographic response (&gt;= 20% reduction in volume). III. Determine
      the growth rate of VS using volumetric MRI analysis in comparison to 1-dimensional and
      2-dimensional measurements.

      IV. Assess changes in function of the auditory system during bevacizumab treatment.

      V. Assess the vascular permeability (Ktrans), relative cerebral blood volume/flow, mean
      transit time, and mean vessel diameter from perfusion-weighted MRI.

      VI. Assess the change in circulating endothelial cells, circulating progenitor cells, and
      plasma angiogenic proteins in subjects receiving bevacizumab treatment.

      VII. Observe the impact of bevacizumab on non-VS tumors in patients with NF2 via whole body
      MRI.

      VIII. Explore hearing related QOL measures throughout treatment. IX. Explore the effect of
      treatment with bevacizumab on vestibular function (to be evaluated at NCI only).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive bevacizumab intravenously (IV) over 30-90 minutes once every 3 weeks.
      Courses repeat every 6 weeks for up to 48 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3 and 6 months.

             in this trial in the informed consent process

          -  The effects of bevacizumab on the developing human fetus at the recommended
             therapeutic dose are unknown; for this reason and because anti-angiogenic agents are
             known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use

             for urine protein creatinine (UPC) ratio or by urine dipstick; if the UPC ratio is
             greater than or equal to 0.5 or if urine dipstick shows 2+ proteinuria, 24-hour urine
             protein should be obtained and the level should be &lt; 1000 mg for patient enrollment

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not
             recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier

          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents

          -  Patients with nervous system tumors associated with NF2 (e.g., schwannomas,
             meningiomas, ependymomas, or gliomas) will not be excluded from this clinical trial
             as long as these tumors do not require treatment with radiation, surgery, or medical
             treatment at the time of enrollment on trial

             recombinant human antibodies, or compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to bevacizumab

          -  Inability to tolerate periodic MRI scans or gadolinium contrast without general
             anesthesia

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements

          -  Clinically significant cardiovascular disease, such as:

               -  Inadequately controlled HTN (adult subjects: SBP &gt; 160 mmHg and/or DBP &gt; 90 mmHg
                  despite antihypertensive medication, pediatric subjects: Requirement for
                  antihypertensive treatment prior to enrollment, or diastolic blood pressure &gt;

               -  Clinically significant peripheral vascular disease

          -  Pregnant women (positive pregnancy test) are excluded from this study because
             bevacizumab is an anti-angiogenic agent with the potential for teratogenic or
             abortifacient effects; because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse
             events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with bevacizumab,
             breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with bevacizumab; both
             fertile men and women must agree to use adequate contraceptive measures during study
             therapy and for at least 6 months after the completion of bevacizumab therapy;
             abstinence is considered an adequate contraceptive measure

               -  In the event that a minor (age 12-17) who undergoes a pregnancy test as part of
                  the screening process receives a positive result, they will be excluded from the
                  study and their parent(s) of record will be notified of this result

             all other eligibility criteria

          -  Inability to perform volumetric measurement of target VS (e.g., due to the MRI
             artifact from auditory brainstem implant or due to presence of collision tumor (two
             or more tumors abutting each other) in the cerebellopontine angle); Note: questions
             about the ability to perform volumetric analysis on a baseline MRI scan should be
             directed to the study radiologist, Dr. Gregory Sorensen

          -  Concurrent use of anti-coagulant drugs (not including prophylactic doses), history of
             coagulopathy, or evidence of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy

             the 6 months prior to enrollment), any history of symptomatic intracranial
             hemorrhage, or any history of spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage

          -  Serious or non-healing wound, ulcer or bone fracture

          -  History of abdominal fistula, gastrointestinal perforation or intra-abdominal abscess
             within 6 months prior to day 1
