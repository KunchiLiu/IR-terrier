      This phase II trial studies the side effects and how well nintedanib works in treating
      patients with endometrial cancer that has come back. Nintedanib may stop the growth of tumor
      cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth or by blocking blood flow to
      the tumor.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the proportion of patients with persistent or recurrent endometrial cancer,
      who survive progression-free without going on a subsequent therapy against the disease for
      at least 6 months and the proportion of patients who have objective tumor response (complete
      or partial), treated with BIBF 1120 (nintedanib).

      II. To determine the nature and degree of toxicity of BIBF 1120 in this cohort of patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of patients
      with persistent or recurrent endometrial cancer treated with BIBF 1120.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive nintedanib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every
      28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months for 3 years.
