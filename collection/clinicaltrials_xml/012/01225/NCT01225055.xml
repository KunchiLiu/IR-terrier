  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spinal cord injury (SCI) results in marked acute loss of bone. This study evaluates the
      effect of teriparatide (PTH) and the use of vibration as a form of mechanical stimulation on
      bone mass.

    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate PTH with vibration in a group of individuals with
      chronic SCI and loss of bone mass in their lower extremities. A convenience sample of 60
      subjects with SCI will be enrolled into a 12 month study assessing the effects of PTH (20
      ug/day) and vibration (10 min/day) individually or in combination on BMD and bone markers.
      Subjects will be evaluated at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after initiating treatment with
      measurement of bone density as well as bone markers of formation and resorption.
