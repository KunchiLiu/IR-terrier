  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Health damaging (risk) behaviors of young military personnel are reflections of health
      problems facing all young people in the U.S. Military life presents opportunities and
      challenges that may both protect against and place young troops at risk for health damaging
      behaviors. Challenges for maintaining a healthy armed force include high rates of sexually
      transmitted infections (STIs), unintended pregnancies (UIPs), misuse of alcohol and other
      substances. The common thread through these negative health outcomes is volitional behavior.
      Such behaviors do not only result in illness or injury, but also negatively impact
      performance of military duties and threaten military readiness. Despite military leadership
      in setting standards and policies regarding professional behavior and universal health care
      for preventing and eliminating such negative health outcomes, many health problems remain.
      Building on our previous military research, we will evaluate the effectiveness a
      cognitive-behavioral, skills-building intervention to prevent and reduce young troops' risk
      for and acquisition of STIs and UIPs and will seek to reduce a number of their associated
      risk factors including, alcohol misuse, other substance use, and victimization due to IPV in
      male and female U.S. Army soldiers who are receiving Advance Individual Training (AIT) in
      Fort Jackson, SC.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary hypotheses to be tested in this research are as follows. AIT soldiers
      participating in the experimental STI/UIP prevention intervention will: (a) have increased
      knowledge about the risk factors for and prevention of STIs, UIPs, alcohol and other
      substances, and intimate partner violence (IPV); (b) be more highly motivated to change risk
      behaviors associated with STIs and UIPs; (c) have higher levels of skills to prevent risk
      behaviors associated with STIs and UIPs and skills; (d) engage in more health promoting
      behaviors and fewer risk behaviors associated with STIs and UIPs, and (e) have fewer STIs
      and UIPs post-intervention compared with AIT solders who participate in a comparable control
      intervention focused on increasing healthy eating, maintaining physical fitness, and
      preventing fitness-related injuries.

      The overall goal of this research is to evaluate the effectiveness a cognitive-behavioral
      skills-building intervention to prevent risk for and acquisition of STIs and UIPs and will
      seek to reduce a number of their associated risk factors including, alcohol misuse, other
      substance use, IPV in AIT soldiers. Specifically, we will evaluate whether AIT soldiers who
      participate in the experimental intervention entitled, Staying Safe and in Control:
      Increasing Knowledge and Building Skills to Prevent Sexually Transmitted Infections and
      Unintended Pregnancies will reduce their risk for and acquisition of STIs, UIPs and their
      associated sexual and substance use behaviors compared with AIT soldiers who undergo the
      control intervention entitled, Fit You: Practical Tools for Healthy Eating, Physical
      Fitness, and Injury Prevention. This intervention will focus primarily on promoting healthy
      eating, maintaining physical fitness, and preventing work-related and exercise injury.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All participants will be 18 years of age or older, will be fluent in English, and
             able to provide written, informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  AIT soldiers under the age of 18 will be excluded since it will be difficult to
             obtain parental consent. We anticipate that this exclusion will be rare.
