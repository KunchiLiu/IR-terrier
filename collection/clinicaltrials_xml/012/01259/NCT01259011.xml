  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed randomized controlled trial will test the SPIRIT (Sharing the Patient's Illness
      Representations to Increase Trust) intervention designed to improve discussions about
      end-of-life care between patients and their surrogate decision makers. Subjects will be 200
      Caucasian and African-American patients with ESRD (end-stage renal disease) recruited from
      outpatient dialysis clinics and their chosen surrogate decision makers. We hypothesize that
      (1) SPIRIT will lead to significantly less patient decisional conflict and significantly
      greater dyad congruence and surrogate decision making confidence than the standard care
      control at 2, 6, and 12 months post-intervention and (2) SPIRIT will reduce surrogate
      decisional conflict and psychosocial morbidities at 2 weeks after the patient's
      hospitalization requiring surrogate decision making significantly more than the standard
      care control.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dialysis is central to survival for 450,000 Americans with end-stage renal disease (ESRD).
      Yet patients on dialysis have significant comorbidities and high mortality rates (24%
      annually). One out of four ESRD patient deaths occurs after a decision to stop dialysis.
      However, when persons have lost their decision capacity if there has been no prior
      discussion between the patient and surrogate regarding goals of care, the issue of whether
      to continue dialysis can pose an ethical impasse and cause profound psychological distress
      for surrogate decision makers. Using the representational approach to patient education, we
      developed and pilot tested the SPIRIT intervention (Sharing the Patient's Illness
      Representation to Increase Trust) to improve discussions about end-of-life care between
      patients and their surrogate decision makers. SPIRIT is a 6-step, 2-session, face-to-face
      intervention presented to both patient and surrogate by a trained interventionist in an
      interview format.

      The proposed randomized controlled trial will test the effects of the SPIRIT intervention in
      improving preparedness for end-of-life decision making among ESRD patients and their
      surrogates and reducing surrogates' conflict during decision making and psychosocial
      morbidities. Subjects will be 200 Caucasian and African-American patients with ESRD
      recruited from outpatient dialysis clinics and their chosen surrogate decision makers.
      Preparedness outcomes (dyad congruence, patient decisional conflict, and surrogate decision
      making confidence) will be measured at 2, 6, and 12 months post-intervention. Surrogate
      decisional conflict and psychosocial morbidities (anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic
      distress symptoms) will be measured 2 weeks after the patient's hospitalization that
      required surrogate decision making. To compare the effects of SPIRIT to those of standard
      care on surrogates after the patient's death, psychosocial morbidities will be measured at 3
      and 6 months after the patient's death. We will also explore the potential impact of race on
      intervention effects and examine mediators and moderators of the intervention effects.
