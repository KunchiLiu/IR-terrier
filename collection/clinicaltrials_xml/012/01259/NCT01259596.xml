  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)and
      supportive therapy delivered by telephone are effective for reducing worry and anxiety in
      rural older adults with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Older adults in rural locations often face significant barriers to treatment, including
      stigma, transportation, lack of local appropriately trained service providers, and impaired
      mobility. The proposed treatment is delivered in a workbook format and by telephone, which
      maximizes its portability. Treatment will be compared with nondirective supportive therapy,
      a very credible comparison condition equivalent to the intervention in therapist attention.
      We propose to randomize 88 adults â‰¥ 60 years with a diagnosis of GAD to either cognitive
      behavioral therapy delivered by telephone, or nondirective supportive therapy. The 2 primary
      treatment outcomes are anxiety symptoms as assessed by the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale,
      and worry symptoms as assessed by the Penn State Worry Questionnaire-Abbreviated. The
      proposed secondary outcomes are depressive symptoms, sleep, disability, and quality of life.
      Further, mediators and moderators of the treatment effect will also be examined. Mediators
      include process variables (therapeutic alliance, adherence, participant satisfaction, and
      treatment credibility) and new psychotropic medication use; moderators include demographic
      information (age, education, gender, race, income), psychiatric variables (baseline anxiety
      severity, baseline depressive disorders, baseline psychotropic medication use), medical
      comorbidity, and therapist assignment. Maintenance of response will be assessed over 6
      months. This research has great public health significance, because it is a low-cost
      intervention with high potential for widespread dissemination, and it targets an underserved
      group - community-dwelling rural elders - who currently lack effective treatment
      interventions tailored to their needs.
