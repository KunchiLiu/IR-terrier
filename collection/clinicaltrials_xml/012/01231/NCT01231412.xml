  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase III trial studies how well graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis
      works in treating patients with hematologic malignancies undergoing unrelated donor
      peripheral blood stem cell transplant. Giving chemotherapy and total-body irradiation before
      a donor peripheral blood stem cell transplant (PBSCT) helps stop the growth of cancer cells.
      It may also stop the patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. When the
      healthy stem cells from a donor are infused into the patient they may help the patient's
      bone marrow make stem cells, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Sometimes
      the transplanted cells from a donor can make an immune response against the body's normal
      cells. Giving total-body irradiation (TBI) together with fludarabine phosphate (FLU),
      cyclosporine (CSP), mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), or sirolimus before transplant may stop
      this from happening.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the effectiveness of 2 GVHD prophylaxis regimens in preventing acute grades
      II-IV GVHD.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Compare non-relapse mortality in the 2 arms.

      II. Compare survival and progression-free survivals in the 2 arms.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      All patients receive FLU intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days -4 to -2 followed by 2-3
      Gy TBI on day 0.

      ARM I: Patients receive CSP orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days -3 to 96 with taper to day
      150 and MMF PO three times daily (TID) on days 0-29 and then BID on days 30-150 with taper
      to day 180.

      ARM II: Patients receive CSP as in Arm I and sirolimus PO once daily (QD) on days -3 to 150
      with taper to day 180. Patients also receive MMF PO TID on days 0-29 and then BID on days
      30-40. MMF will then be discontinued without taper unless GVHD or disease
      relapse/progression occurs.

      TRANSPLANTATION: Patients undergo allogeneic PBSCT on day 0 following the TBI.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.

               -  Hodgkin lymphoma: must have received and failed frontline therapy

               -  Multiple myeloma: must have received prior chemotherapy; consolidation of

               -  Acute myeloid leukemia (AML): must have &lt; 5% marrow blasts at the time of
                  transplant

               -  Acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL): must have &lt; 5% marrow blasts at the time of
                  transplant

               -  Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML): patients in 1st chronic phase (CP1) must have

                  marrow blasts at time of transplant

               -  Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia: must have failed 2 courses of therapy

          -  DONOR: FHCRC matching allowed will be grades 1.0 to 2.1: Unrelated donors who are
             prospectively:

               -  Matched for human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A, B, C, DRB1 and DQB1 by high
                  resolution typing

               -  Only a single allele disparity will be allowed for HLA-A, B, or C as defined by
                  high resolution typing

          -  DONOR: Donors are excluded when preexisting immunoreactivity is identified that would
             jeopardize donor hematopoietic cell engraftment; this determination is based on the
             standard practice of the individual institution; the recommended procedure for
             patients with 10 of 10 HLA allele level (phenotypic) match is to obtain a panel
             reactive antibody (PRA) screens to class I and class II antigens for all patients
             before HCT; if the PRA shows &gt; 10% activity, then flow cytometric or B and T cell
             cytotoxic cross matches should be obtained; the donor should be excluded if any of
             the cytotoxic cross match assays are positive; for those patients with an HLA class I
             allele mismatch, flow cytometric or B and T cell cytotoxic cross matches should be
             obtained regardless of the PRA results; a positive anti-donor cytotoxic crossmatch is
             an absolute donor exclusion

          -  DONOR: Patient and donor pairs homozygous at a mismatched allele in the graft
             rejection vector are considered a two-allele mismatch, i.e., the patient is A*0101
             and the donor is A*0102, and this type of mismatch is not allowed

          -  DONOR: Only filgrastim (G-CSF) mobilized PBSC only will be permitted as a
             hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) source on this protocol

        Exclusion Criteria:

             cancers) or those with non-hematological malignancies (except non-melanoma skin
             cancers) who have been rendered with no evidence of disease, but have a greater than
             20% chance of having disease recurrence within 5 years; this exclusion does not apply
             to patients with non-hematologic malignancies that do not require therapy

          -  Fungal infections with radiological progression after receipt of amphotericin B or
             active triazole for greater than 1 month

          -  Cardiac ejection fraction &lt; 35% (or, if unable to obtain ejection fraction,
             shortening fraction of &lt; 26%); ejection fraction is required if age &gt; 50 years or
             there is a history of anthracycline exposure or history of cardiac disease; patients
             with a shortening fraction &lt; 26% may be enrolled if approved by a cardiologist

             nodules

          -  Patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of liver disease would be evaluated for
             the cause of liver disease, its clinical severity in terms of liver function, and the
