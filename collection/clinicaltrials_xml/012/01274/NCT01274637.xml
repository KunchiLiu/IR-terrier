  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if it is feasible to conduct a multi-center
      randomized trial to determine whether a blood thinner, low-molecular-weight-heparin (LMWH),
      is effective at preventing blood clots, thromboembolism (VTE), in postpartum women at risk.

      The PROPSER pilot is a randomized, open-label pilot study comparing prophylactic low
      molecular weight heparin (LMWH) to saline placebo. The PROSPER pilot study will assess the
      feasibility of conducting a full trial as measured by the number of subjects recruited per
      center per month. In addition, clinical data will be collected to determine an estimate of
      the primary outcome event rate (symptomatic VTE or asymptomatic proximal deep vein
      thrombosis (DVT) and major bleeding event rate for the full trial in LMWH and control
      groups. If our pilot results indicate that no substantial changes are needed to the study
      design, we will include the pilot data in the primary and secondary outcome analyses for the
      full trial (i.e. a &quot;Vanguard trial&quot; or internal pilot trial).

      Eligible consenting women at risk of postpartum thrombosis will be randomized within 36
      hours after delivery of the placenta and will be equally allocated to 2 trial arms, either
      the treatment group: prophylactic-dose LMWH, subcutaneously once daily for 10 days (+/-3
      days), or the control group.

      At 10 days (+/- 3 days), all women will have a study visit to assess for study outcomes,
      including bilateral leg ultrasound screening for VTE and a D-dimer test. A final telephone
      follow-up will occur at 90 days for outcome assessment of subsequent VTE, bleeding or other
      adverse events.

Clinically Relevant Non-major Bleeding does not meet the criteria for major bleeding but meets at least one of the following: Hospitalization; Medical intervention; Unscheduled contact with a physician; Discomfort (pain, or impairment of activities of daily life).</description>

    <description>All subjects who develop thrombocytopenia (platelets less than 80 x 109/L and/or with &gt;50% decrease from baseline) will be investigated for Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT) by having ELISA and serotonin release assays to confirm or refute a diagnosis of HIT. HIT will be diagnosed with a positive PF4 (platelet factor 4) HIT ELISA assay.</description>
