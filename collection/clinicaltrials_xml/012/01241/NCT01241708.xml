  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplantation is commonplace in the treatment of
      multiple myeloma. This treatment uses a chemotherapy drug called Melphalan that has been
      used in several thousand bone marrow transplant recipients worldwide for the same or similar
      disorders.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many patients with multiple myeloma receive 2 stem cell transplantations within a few months
      of each other as part of their treatment. Usually the drug Melphalan is used for both
      transplants.

      Bortezomib is a drug that is used for treating multiple myeloma and has been used in
      combination with melphalan for stem cell transplantation for patients with multiple myeloma.

      The purpose of this trial is to study the effects of doing 2 transplants, first using
      melphalan and second using melphalan and bortezomib. The trial is aiming to find out if
      adding the Bortezomib to the second transplant will increase the chances of staying in
      remission longer.
