  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this randomized controlled study (RCT) financed by the Norwegian
      Research Council (grant no. 182012/V50) is to establish the effectiveness of situational
      feedback to the self-management of fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) using innovative means of
      patient-provider communication in a randomized controlled study (RCT). Thereby this project
      will contribute to the knowledge of treatment of patients with FMS. The effectiveness of the
      intervention will be expressed in terms of a) reduced pain, b) psychometric outcomes, c)
      quality of life, d) improved engagement in daily activities and e) prevented transition to
      chronic disability. We furthermore aim to 1) determine the effectiveness of providing
      regular situational feedback in enhancing self-management and, consequently 2) study the
      effectiveness of enhancing self-management in reducing pain and physical disability.

      Self-management of chronic pain is increasingly seen as an important tool in providing
      adequate care to patients with FMS and other types of Chronic Non-malignant Pain. Enhancing
      the patient's self-management of her/his condition is thought to be effective in reducing
      pain and disability. However, sufficient empirical evidence to support this is yet
      unavailable. This may be due to the non-situational nature of many interventions studied so
      far: Patients are taught management skills in a clinical setting, and may not be able to
      successfully use these skills in daily care. Therefore, enhancing self-management of chronic
      pain, by providing immediate feedback that is directly related to patient's daily life
      (&quot;situational&quot; feedback) complementary to care-as usual, is thought to be more effective
      than conventional interventions in a clinical setting. This may even be even more effective
      when the patient receives quick response feedback using mobile communication technology,
      i.e. any place any time.
