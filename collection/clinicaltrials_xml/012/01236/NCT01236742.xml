  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to compare eyeball elongation in existing ortho-k subjects
      who stop the treatment with subjects who continue ortho-k lens wear and control subjects
      wearing single-vision glasses.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children wearing ortho-k have been shown to have slower rate of myopic progression than
      those wearing single-vision spectacles (Cho et al. 2005) or soft lenses (Walline et al.
      2009). Both studies showed that the effect of myopic control was most significant during the
      first six months of the treatment. It is unknown whether the myopic control effect would
      dissipate upon the discontinuation of the treatment or whether the myopic control effect
      only happened in the first six month of lens wear and was maintained thereafter. The current
      study aims at evaluating the effect of discontinuation of ortho-k treatment on myopic
      control in children who are currently on the treatment. This knowledge is necessary and
      important as patients/parents have concerns about the permanent dependency on ortho-k once
      they enrolled in the treatment.

      Children who have been on the treatment for two years and have recently completed the myopic
      control studies at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, i.e. the ROMIO, TO-SEE and HM-PRO
      studies, will be invited to participate in this 14-month study. Ortho-k subjects will be
      randomly assigned to study group or the ortho-k control group. The study group subjects will
      be required to stop lens wear for 7 months at the completion of the previous study (Phase I)
      and resume lens wear for next 7 months (Phase II). The ortho-k control group subjects will
      be required to continue the current treatment for another 14 months. Control subjects in the
      existing myopic control studies will be required to continue using the same treatment, i.e.
      single-vision glasses, for another 14 months. Rate of myopic progression among the 3 groups
      and at the two study phases will be determined and compared.
