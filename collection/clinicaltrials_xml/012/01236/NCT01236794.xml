      The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of a lifestyle intervention program on
      type 2 diabetes risk factors and quality of life in overweight Latino youth.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With the increasing prevalence of obesity, the incidence of obesity-related co-morbidities
      including depression and type 2 diabetes have emerged as critical public health conditions.
      Furthermore, Latinos experience a disproportionately greater burden of these obesity-related
      disorders. Therefore, we have developed a 12-week community-based lifestyle intervention
      that includes weekly education sessions for children and their parents and 3 exercise
      sessions per week for youth. The program will be delivered at a local YMCA in the greater
      Phoenix Metropolitan area.

    <description>The intervention will include a ~1-2 hour weekly education session to address the following constructs: health awareness, healthy eating, physical activity, roles and responsibilities, self-esteem, self-efficacy, diabetes knowledge, communication, and peer / family relationships. In addition to the education classes youth will participate in 3 exercise sessions per week (~1-1.5 hrs) that will consist of individual and group physical activities to include both aerobic and resistance exercises. The exercise intensity will progressively increase over the 12-week intervention. Both the education and activity sessions will be delivered at the Lincoln Family YMCA.</description>
