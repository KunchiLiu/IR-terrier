    <textblock>
      This study will test the null hypothesis that low-dose ketamine given peri-operatively will
      have no effect on the development of chronic post-surgical pain, in patients undergoing
      thoracotomy or video assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) procedures

      A double-blind, randomised placebo-controlled trial will be used to test the null
      hypothesis. Potential participants due to undergo either thoracotomy or video assisted
      thoracic surgery (VATS) will be identified by the collaborating thoracic surgeons in the
      out-patient department. Patients will be sent information about the study by post, prior to
      admission for surgery. If they are willing to participate, written consent will be sought on
      the ward preoperatively, where they will complete baseline measures of pain.

      Patients will be randomised to receive an intravenous infusion of placebo (saline) or
      ketamine running at 0.1mg/kg/hour, starting 10 minutes prior to the surgical incision and
      continuing for the first three postoperative days (96 hours in total). Prior to starting the
      infusion a loading dose of ketamine (0.1 mg per kg) will be administered.

      This study will test the null hypothesis that low-dose ketamine given peri-operatively will
      have no effect on the development of chronic post-surgical pain, in patients undergoing
      thoracotomy or video assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) procedures

      A double-blind, randomised placebo-controlled trial will be used to test the null
      hypothesis. Potential participants due to undergo either thoracotomy or video assisted
      thoracic surgery (VATS) will be identified by the collaborating thoracic surgeons in the
      out-patient department. Patients will be sent information about the study by post, prior to
      admission for surgery. If they are willing to participate, written consent will be sought on
      the ward preoperatively, where they will complete baseline measures of pain.

      Patients will be randomised to receive an intravenous infusion of placebo (saline) or
      ketamine running at 0.1mg/kg/hour, starting 10 minutes prior to the surgical incision and
      continuing for the first three postoperative days (96 hours in total). Prior to starting the
      infusion a loading dose of ketamine (0.1 mg per kg) will be administered. All staff,
      including the anaesthetist, surgical team, ward nurses and the principal investigator will
      be blind to the treatment given throughout the study. The key to the randomisation will be
      revealed at the end of the study.

      Patients will be asked to complete a numeric pain score (NPS) and standard pain
      questionnaires which includes the Brief Pain Inventory [BPI], short form Leeds Assessment of
      Neuropathic Symptoms and Signs [S-LANSS]) prior to surgery, then at 6 weeks, 3, 6 and 12
      months after surgery. The surgical area will also be examined at 6 weeks, 6 and 12 months
      for signs of neuropathic or nerve pain. Whilst in hospital patients will be asked to score
      their pain daily, on a numeric pain scale of 0 to 10. Consumption of morphine and
      side-effects will be recorded.

      Patients will receive standard post-operative analgesia.

      A sample size calculation based on a previous study, to detect a reduction in pain of 2
      points the 10 point numeric pain scale at the 6 week assessment, with α = 5%, 1 - β = 90%
      and a bilateral hypothesis, would require a sample size of 36 per group, 72 patients in
      total. This will require a total study population of 144 patients, as both video assisted
      thoracic surgery (VATS) and thoracotomy patients will be studied.

      A two samples t-test will be used to compare the numeric pain scores between the ketamine
      and placebo groups at each time point. If these data are not normally distributed then the
      Mann Whitney test will be used. The scores from the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) and short
      form Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic Symptoms and Signs (S-LANSS) will be analysed in the
      same manner. The Chi Squared test will be used to compare dichotomous data, such as the
      incidence of side-effects.

    <time_frame>24 hours, 48 hours, 6 weeks, 3, 6 and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Analgesia consumption will be measured post-operatively and at the time points stated above. The cumulative dose of opioid, measured in oral morphine equivalents, will be obtained from the time of the patient's arrival in recovery (T0), to 24 hours post-operatively (T0 + 24) and to 48 hours post-operatively (T0 + 48). Analgesia consumption will also be measured at six weeks, three months, six months and one year. All analgesia will be converted to oral morphine equivalents (in mg) by multiplication by a factor depending on the analgesia taken (codeine 0.15, tramadol 0.17, oxycodone 2)</description>

    <description>Hypoaesthesia: light touch of the blunt end of a paintbrush was felt less precisely, than in healthy tissue.
Hyperalgesia: the pain induced by a sterile neurotip, applied perpendicular to the skin is felt abnormally strongly, in comparison to the contralateral side.
Static allodynia: the application of a Von Frey hair number 14. (8g) was unpleasant, in comparison to the contralateral side.
Dynamic allodynia: three successive gentle strokes of an 8 mm-wide paintbrush over a 40 mm distance, is unpleasant, in comparison to the contralateral side.</description>
