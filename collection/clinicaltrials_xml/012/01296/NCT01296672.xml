      The investigators will propose a novel method to improve prostate cancer screening with PSA,
      using a 3-month treatment with finasteride, a drug used to treat Benign Prostatic
      Hyperplasia (BPH) and proven to reduce a man's risk of developing prostate cancer. The
      investigators will also examine three additional promising tests that may further improve
      diagnosis of prostate cancer.

      The primary goal of this proposal is to determine if a 5-alpha reductase 'challenge'
      improves screening performance of PSA and DRE in men who are scheduled for prostate biopsy.
      Currently a higher PSA level leads to a recommendation for prostate biopsy, causing hundreds
      of thousands of unnecessary biopsies annually in the U.S. We will show that a three-month
      treatment with finasteride for men with high PSA levels will better predict the man who
      should have a prostate biopsy. PSA performance after finasteride 'challenge' will also be
      compared with new tests for prostate cancer. Finasteride is supplied by Merck and Company,
      Incorporated.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Risk of prostate cancer 20-60% calculated with the on-line Prostate Cancer Prevention
             Trial (PCPT) prostate cancer risk calculator.
             (www.prostate-cancer-risk-calculator.com). PSA value must be obtained within 3 months
             prior to study entry. A description of the frequency of these individuals in the
             population is provided in Specific Aim 2

          2. Patient has been recommended to undergo and plans to have a prostate biopsy.

          3. Patient is willing to delay prostate biopsy for a 3-month finasteride vs placebo
             treatment.

          4. No allergy to finasteride or other five alpha reductase inhibitors.

          5. Patient is willing to take finasteride vs placebo 5 mg orally daily for 3-month
             treatment period.

          6. Age 55 or older. (This age is selected as the PCPT risk calculator is only valid for
             this age range.)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Risk of cancer greater than 60% or less than 20%.

          2. Prior history of prostate cancer.

          3. Prior treatment with finasteride or dutasteride in the past 6 months

          4. Younger than age 55.
