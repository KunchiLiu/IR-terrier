  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to test genes for BRCAness(BRCA[BReast CAncer] gene) Studying
      these genes could help predict which patients would benefit from treatment with satraplatin,
      a medication being used for subjects who have failed prior chemotherapy. All subjects will
      have a biopsy of metastatic lesions to measure BRCAness (a gene signature). This gene
      signature may be able to predict response to satraplatin and a tool will be developed to be
      able to screen patients likely to benefit from satraplatin. Subjects will all receive
      Satraplatin days 1-5 and Prednisone 5 mg twice daily every 35 days. Response rates will be
      evaluated every 2 cycles or approximately every 9 weeks. Patients will be considered
      responders if they have measurable disease meeting criteria for partial or complete
      response. PSA will be measured day one of each treatment cycle. Each treatment cycle is 35
      days.

      We will be developing a genomic based signature of &quot;BRCAness&quot; based on literature of genomic
      signatures from women with breast cancer and germline BRCA mutations.The &quot;BRCAness&quot; breast
      cancer signature will differentiate germline BRCA 1/2 breast cancers from standard
      estrogen-receptor (+) breast cancers. We will obtain a library of genomic signatures
      Recently these techniques have been used to develop a transcriptional &quot;signature&quot; for
      androgen receptor (AR) activity in men with CRPC(Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer). The
      investigator will apply the &quot;BRCAness&quot; breast cancer signature to pathological prostate
      cancer specimens to determine the percentage of patients in the overall prostate cancer
      population that express this signature, as well as the clinical and histological phenotype
      of this population.

      This novel prostate cancer &quot;BRCAness&quot; signature will be developed over a period of 4-6
      months. This &quot;BRCAness&quot; signature has not previously been evaluated in prostate cancer
      patients and would be expected, based on known characteristics of BRCA mutant breast and
      ovarian cancers, to be more platinum-responsive. Relevant clinical data, including
      histology, grade, stage, size of residual tumor, recurrence, and survival, will be obtained
      from outpatient and inpatient charts to perform subsequent correlative studies.

      All patients enrolled in the phase II clinical trial with satraplatin will have
      pre-treatment biopsies of metastatic sites. All of the specimens will be frozen, batched and
      stored as previously described. We anticipate that all patients will be enrolled 16 months
      from when the trial opens. When the last patient is enrolled in the trial and all of the
      metastatic biopsies have been collected, they will be shipped in bulk on dry ice to
      laboratory for RNA(ribonucleic acid) isolation, RNA quality assessment and processing,
      microarray hybridization, microarray data quality assessment, and &quot;BRCAness&quot; prostate cancer
      signature application. Frozen biopsies will be processed for microarray analysis using laser
      capture microdissection and RNA amplification using adaptations of previously published
      methods. The application of the prostate cancer BRCAness signature will take place over two
      months.

    <description>Response will be evaluated in this study using PSA (Prostate-Specific Antigen) measurements (every 4 weeks) and by using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors(RECIST) every 2 cycles (or approximately every 9 weeks). PSA response will be measured as the percentage of change in PSA from baseline to 12 weeks in therapy (or earlier if patients discontinue therapy prior to 12 weeks) as well as the maximum decline in PSA that occurs at any point during treatment. PSA decline will be reported globally using a waterfall plot.</description>
