  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      When smokers are hospitalized they quit smoking, either voluntarily or involuntarily. Most
      of them, however, go back to smoking soon after discharge. This study will test an
      innovative approach which includes dispensing nicotine patches at discharge, providing
      proactive telephone counseling post discharge, or giving a combination of the two. The
      interventions are aimed at increasing the long term quit rate of these patients.

      The specific aims of the study are to demonstrate the effects of two interventions,
      dispensing nicotine patches at discharge and providing proactive telephone counseling soon
      after discharge, on 12-month quit rates of hospitalized smokers in a 2 x 2 factorial design.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Most smokers in the U.S. actually do quit smoking when hospitalized, either voluntarily or
      involuntarily because of hospital's nonsmoking policy. However, the majority of them return
      to smoking soon after their discharge from the hospital. A hospital stay, therefore, is a
      &quot;teachable moment&quot; for these patients, a good opportunity to encourage them to lead a
      smoke-free life after they are discharged. Research, however, has found that brief
      counseling provided to smokers while they are hospitalized has limited effect. The
      scientific data clearly show that smokers should be identified at the hospital, provided
      counseling, and given intensive interventions with follow up extended to 1 month post
      discharge. Providing such clinical services to these patients will reduce their chance of
      relapse to smoking and the rate of re-hospitalization. In practice though, hospitals have
      had difficulty providing even basic bedside counseling with a subgroup of patients, not to
      mention a much longer follow up post-discharge with all patients.

      The proposed study aims to demonstrate that state quitlines can help bridge the gap between
      the recommendations from existing scientific data and the current practice by hospitals.
      Quitlines deliver counseling services by telephone. This is convenient for patients because
      they do not have to go anywhere in order to receive the counseling. Moreover, telephone
      counseling can be delivered proactively by the counselor.

      The potential impact of this study is that if this model is proven effective in a rigorous
      study design, then it is likely that state quitlines across the U.S. will adopt it and start
      working with hospitals that are interested in using such as system. If the new JCAHO
      requirements get adopted, there will be a strong incentive for the hospitals to work with
      partners like the quitlines that can help provide follow up counseling.

      With the proposed project the investigators intend to establish a practical model that lends
      itself to broader dissemination, while testing the effectiveness of the interventions with
      the rigor of a randomized design.

    <description>Telephone counseling is conducted in the appropriate language (Spanish and English) by veteran counselors at the California Smokers' Helpline. The counseling protocol is similar to that used by the Helpline in previous efficacy studies. Counseling is proactive so after the smoker calls in subsequent calls are made by the counselor, a process that reduces attrition. The counseling group will receive proactive sessions initiated by quitline staff within 2 days of discharge, and a total of 6 individualized telephone counseling session that extend to two months post discharge. Counseling includes a 30-40 minute comprehensive pre-quit session plus up to 5 shorter follow-up calls (about 10 minutes) that are scheduled according to the probability of relapse. Counselors will use a structured protocol so that there will be a record for each counseling call. Quantitative information that will be available for analysis include: timing, length, and frequency of counseling calls.</description>
