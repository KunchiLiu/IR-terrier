      The purpose of this study is to determine how common oral HPV infections are in college
      women. The investigators also will find out what risk factors are associated with having
      oral HPV infections. The investigators hypothesize that approximately 3% of women will have
      oral HPV, and that HPV will be associated with oral sexual behaviors and with smoking
      behaviors. Finally, for those women with oral HPV- the investigators will determine whether
      the infections are persistent (still present) at 3-, 6-, and 12-months after the initial
      diagnosis.
