  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators want to find out if the drugs Velcade and temsirolimus given together are
      effective in treating cancer. Velcade and temsirolimus are each FDA approved individually
      for certain types of cancer (Velcade for multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma, and
      temsirolimus for renal cell carcinoma) but are not currently approved in combination for
      B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The investigators are trying to find out if giving these 2
      drugs together will improve the period of time that the patient's cancer is stopped or
      slowed from growing and causing symptoms.

    <description>The primary objective of this study is to determine whether Velcade in combination with temsirolimus provides benefit to subjects with relapsed or refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma as assessed by overall response rate (ORR) to therapy. ORR is the sum of patients with a Complete Response and Partial Response to therapy.</description>
