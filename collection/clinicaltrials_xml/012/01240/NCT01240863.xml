      osteoarthritis or low back pain as assessed by the weekly Average Pain Intensity (API) at
      week 12.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient is able to speak English and is willing to provide written informed
             consent, including a written opioid agreement, to participate in this study.

          -  The patient must be willing and able to successfully self-administer the study drug,
             comply with study restrictions, complete the electronic diary, and return to the
             clinic for scheduled study visits as specified in this protocol.

          -  Women of childbearing potential (not surgically sterile or 2 years postmenopausal),
             must use a medically accepted method of contraception and must agree to continue use
             of this method for the duration of the study and for 30 days after participation in
             the study, and have a negative pregnancy test at screening.

          -  The patient has pain of at least 3 months' duration associated with osteoarthritis or
             low back pain.

          -  The patient reports an average pain intensity score, over the prior 24 hours, of 5 or
             more on the NRS-11.

          -  If the patient is receiving physical therapy, biofeedback therapy, acupuncture
             therapy, or herbal remedies, these therapies must remain unchanged during the study.

          -  The patient must not participate in other study involving an investigational agent
             while enrolled into the present study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient has known or suspected hypersensitivities, allergies, or other
             contraindications to any ingredient in the study drug.

          -  The patient has a recent history (within 5 years) or current evidence of alcohol or
             other substance abuse with the exception of nicotine or caffeine.

          -  The patient has medical or psychiatric disease that, in the opinion of the
             investigator, would compromise collected data.

          -  The patient is taking a total (ie, around-the-clock plus rescue medication) of more
             than 135 mg/day of oxycodone, or equivalent, during the 14 days prior to screening.

          -  The patient has a history of suicidality.

          -  The patient is expected to have surgery during the study.

          -  The patient's primary painful condition under study is related to any source of

             values.

          -  The patient has cardiopulmonary disease that would, in the opinion of the
             investigator, significantly increase the risk of treatment with opioids.

          -  The patient has participated in a study involving an investigational drug in the
             previous 30 days.

          -  The patient has received a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) within 14 days before
             the first treatment with study drug.

          -  The patient has any other medical condition or is receiving concomitant
             medication/therapy (e.g., regional nerve block) that would, in the opinion of the

          -  The patient is involved in active litigation in regard to the pain currently being
             treated.

          -  The patient has a positive urine drug screen (UDS) that is not medically explainable.
