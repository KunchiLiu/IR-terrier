  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to determinate the prevalence of moderate dehydration among children
      aged 9 to 11 who are going to school.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many children have a limited caloric intake at the breakfast with a limited amount of water
      intake. There is no data about the prevalence of dehydration in children who are regularly
      going to school in France.
