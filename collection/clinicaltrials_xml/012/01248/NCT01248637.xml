  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study involves the administration of a hypoxia marker, pimonidazole hydrochloride,
      taken orally approximately 24 hours before surgical resection of a pancreatic tumor in order
      to identify areas of lower oxygen content on tumor samples.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intratumoral hypoxia (low oxygen concentration or pO2) occurs when oxygen consumption
      exceeds its delivery by the vascular system. Hypoxia is associated with adverse patient
      outcome in many human cancers and this association is hypothesized to be due to a
      combination of treatment resistance and aggressive tumor biology.

      The study of hypoxia is also important as new cancer drugs are being developed that are
      specifically active on cancer cells in area of tumors with lower oxygen levels.

      his study involves administering the hypoxia probe pimonidazole hydrochloride to patients
      prior to resection of pancreatic adenocarcinoma to evaluate the extent, molecular context
      and clinical relevance of hypoxia in clinical pancreatic cancer samples and the subsequently
      derived primary xenograft tumors.

      We propose accrual of patients over a 5-year period to evaluate hypoxia within 100 clinical
      tumor specimens and corresponding primary xenograft tumours where available. The
      complementary techniques of wide-field multicolor fluorescence image analysis microscopy and
      high level flow cytometry will be used to identify potential relationships between
      intratumoral hypoxia and cell proliferation, differentiation, and the expression of putative
      cancer stem cell markers.

    <intervention_name>Pimonidazole hydrochloride</intervention_name>
    <description>Pimonidazole is a 2-nitroimidazole that is selectively reduced and covalently binds to intracellular macromolecules in areas of hypoxia (by definition, p02 &lt;= 10mm Hg) within normal and tumour tissue. Pimonidazole adducts can then be detected by immunolabelling techniques (microscopy, ELISA, flow cytometry etc). In this study, pimonidazole will be administered orally as a one time dose of 0.5gm/m2 24hrs prior to surgery. Since the drug has a half-life of approximately 5 hrs, this time-frame ensures low circulating levels at the time of surgery and therefore reduces the confounding effects of surgical hypoxia on tumour analysis.</description>
