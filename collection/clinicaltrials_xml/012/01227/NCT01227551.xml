  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 63 patients with stage IIIc or stage IV melanoma will receive 10 intratumoural
      injections of CAVATAK (Coxsackievirus A21) over 18 weeks.

      Disease progression will be monitored by computed tomography (CT) and rated by the RECIST
      1.1 assessment criteria. Patients will be monitored for 1 year from their first treatment.

      CAVATAK is an oncolytic (cancer killing) virus. Direct injection of the virus into tumors
      may kill cancer cells by the lytic action of the virus. This action also releases tumor cell
      debris that may illicit a response by the patients own immune system against the tumour.
      This study seeks to assess the performance of CAVATAK in both of these actions in late stage
      melanoma.

      Study objectives include:

        -  Immune-related Progression-Free Survival

        -  Durable Response Rate

        -  Progression Free Survival at 6 months

        -  Quality of Life

             to be a target lesion for RECIST 1.1 criteria
