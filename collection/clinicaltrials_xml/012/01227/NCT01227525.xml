  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Behavioral and physiologic observations suggest that the injection of local anesthetic is
      among the most feared or anxiety producing procedures during dental intervention. Discomfort
      during the injection is currently reduced by pharmacologic or mechanical methods. No
      technique has proven to be effective for every patient. The VibraJect LLC (USA) was first
      introduced in 1995 and was developed under the hypothesis that a vibrating needle would
      stimulate large diameter nerve fibers and thereby close the gate to smaller nerves carrying
      the pain signal from the injection site. Studies on adult patients have been promising. The
      purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy of the VibraJect dental syringe
      attachment in reducing injection discomfort and procedural anxiety in the pediatric dental
      population.

      One hundred children will be recruited from the UNMC Pediatric Dentistry clinic. Eligible
      children will be selected from the 4-6 year group who are scheduled for routine dental
      restorative treatment and who have or have never received a dental injection. Each patient
      will randomly participate in either a control or experimental condition. The device will be
      attached for both conditions. During the control injection, the dentist will perform the
      dental injection as usual. During the experimental injection, the dentist will activate the
      attached device and perform the injection. Immediately following each injection, the patient
      will rate the pain on a visual analog scale and a trained observer will rate the child's
      behavior on a Frankl behavior scale. A videotape of the procedure will be reviewed by an
      independent dentist who will evaluate the child's response and any perceived disruptive
      behavior. This observer will be blind to whether the instrument is functioning.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Attending the UNMC pediatric dentistry clinic for dental restorations requiring
             injection of local anesthetic for restorative procedures with or without use of
             inhalation anesthesia but without physical restraint

          2. age 4 to 8

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. No parent or legal guardian is present

          2. Parent does not give consent

          3. Non-English speaking participants will be excluded because PI is English speaking and
             this study needs behavior guidance of children that only the dentist can deliver and
             not an interpreter.
