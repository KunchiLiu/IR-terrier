  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      BRF113683 is a Phase III, randomized, open-label study comparing the efficacy, safety, and
      tolerability of GSK2118436 to dacarbazine (DTIC), in subjects with BRAF mutant advanced
      (Stage III) or metastatic (Stage IV) melanoma. Subjects will be randomized to receive 150 mg
      of GSK2118436 twice daily or 1000 mg/m2 DTIC every 3 weeks and continue on treatment until
      disease progression, death, or unacceptable adverse event. Subjects who progress on DTIC
      will be allowed to crossover to an optional extension arm of the study to receive
      GSK2118436.

    <measure>Progression-free Survival (PFS) as Assessed by the Investigator</measure>
    <time_frame>Time interval between the date of randomization and the earlier of the date of disease progression or the date of death due to any cause (up to 9.9 months)</time_frame>
    <description>PFS is defined as the interval of time between the date of randomization and the earlier of the date of disease progression or the date of death due to any cause. Disease progression was based on radiographic or photographic evidence, and assessments were made by the investigator according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. PD is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as a reference, the smallest sum of diameters recorded since the treatment started (e.g., percent change from nadir, where nadir is defined as the smallest sum of diameters recorded since treatment start). In addition, the sum must have an absolute increase from nadir of 5 millimeters (mm). For participants who did not progress or die, PFS was censored at the date of last contact. Data are presented as median and 96% confidence interval.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With a Best Overall Response of Confirmed Complete Response (CR) or Confirmed Partial Response (PR) as Assessed by the Investigator: Randomized Phase</measure>
    <time_frame>From randomization until the first documented evidence of a confirmed complete response or partial response (median of 6.6 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>A participant was defined as a responder if he/she achieved either a CR (the disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes must be &lt;10 mm in the short axis.) or PR (at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as a reference, the Baseline sum of the diameters [e.g., percent change from Baseline]). Response was evaluated by an investigator per RECIST, version 1.1. A participant without a post-Baseline assessment of response was considered a non-responder. Confirmation, per RECIST version 1.1, requires a confimatory disease assessment of CR or PR at least 28 days after the initial disease assessment of CR or PR.</description>

    <description>Dermatological examinations were performed by the investigator, or at the discretion of the investigator, referred to a dermatologist.

      <pre_assignment_details>In the Randomized Phase, participants receiving GSK2118436 150 milligrams were treated for up to 16.4 months, and participants receiving dacarbazine 1000 milligrams per meters squared were treated for up to 12.2 months.</pre_assignment_details>

          <description>Participants (par.) were randomly assigned to receive oral GSK2118436 150 milligrams (mg) twice a day (BID). Dose reductions were permitted based on the severity of the hematological toxicity. Stopping recommendations for study treatment were also provided for cases of reoccurring skin toxicity, cardiovascular complication or abnormalities, and liver abnormalities. Participants continued on treatment until disease progression (DP), death, the occurrence of an unacceptable adverse event (AE), or withdrawal from the study. Participants who experienced investigator-reported DP but were benefitting from study treatment were permitted to continue GSK2118436 treatment upon approval of the GlaxoSmithKline Medical Monitor.</description>

          <description>In the RP, par. received intravenous (IV) Dacarbazine (DTIC) 1000 mg per meters squared (mg/m^2) every 3 weeks. Dose reductions were permitted based on the severity of the hematological toxicity. Stopping recommendations for study treatment were also provided for cases of reoccurring skin toxicity, cardiovascular complication or abnormalities, and liver abnormalities. Par. continued on treatment until DP, death, the occurrence of an unacceptable AE, or withdrawal from the study. Par. who received DTIC in the RP and experienced DP had the option, at the discretion of the Investigator, of receiving GSK2118436 150 mg BID in the Crossover Phase. Par. who permanently discontinued DTIC treatment due to an AE, withdrawal of consent, or for any reason other than DP were not eligible for crossover to GSK2118436. Crossover par. continued on GSK2118436 until further DP was noted. After DP on GSK2118436, par. were followed for response, progression, survival, and further anti-cancer therapy.</description>

        <title>Progression-free Survival (PFS) as Assessed by the Investigator</title>
        <description>PFS is defined as the interval of time between the date of randomization and the earlier of the date of disease progression or the date of death due to any cause. Disease progression was based on radiographic or photographic evidence, and assessments were made by the investigator according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. PD is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as a reference, the smallest sum of diameters recorded since the treatment started (e.g., percent change from nadir, where nadir is defined as the smallest sum of diameters recorded since treatment start). In addition, the sum must have an absolute increase from nadir of 5 millimeters (mm). For participants who did not progress or die, PFS was censored at the date of last contact. Data are presented as median and 96% confidence interval.</description>

Dose reductions were permitted based on the severity of the hematological toxicity.

Participants continued on treatment until disease progression (DP), death, the occurrence of an unacceptable adverse event (AE), or withdrawal from the study.

        <title>Duration of Response as Assessed by the Investigator: Crossover Phase</title>
        <description>Duration of response for participants with either a CR (the disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes must be &lt;10 mm in the short axis.) or PR (at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as a reference, the Baseline sum of the diameters [e.g., percent change from Baseline]) was defined as the time from the first documented evidence of a PR or CR until the first documented sign of PD or death due to any cause. PD is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as a reference, the smallest sum of diameters recorded since the treatment started (e.g., percent change from nadir, where nadir is defined as the smallest sum of diameters recorded since treatment start). In addition, the sum must have an absolute increase from nadir of 5 mm.</description>

            <description>Participants who received DTIC in the RP and experienced DP had the option, at the discretion of the Investigator, of receiving GSK2118436 150 mg BID in the Crossover Phase. Participants who permanently discontinued DTIC treatment due to an AE, withdrawal of consent, or for any reason other than DP were not eligible for crossover to GSK2118436. Crossover participants continued on GSK2118436 until further DP was noted. After DP on GSK2118436, participants were followed for response, progression, survival, and further anti-cancer therapy.</description>
