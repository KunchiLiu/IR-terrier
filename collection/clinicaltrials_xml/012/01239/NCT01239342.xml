  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies the side effects and how well Akt inhibitor MK2206 or
      everolimus works in treating patients with kidney cancer that does not respond to treatment.
      Akt inhibitor MK2206 and everolimus may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of
      the enzymes needed for cell growth. Everolimus may also stop the growth of kidney cancer by
      blocking blood flow to the tumor. It is not yet known whether Akt inhibitor MK2206 or
      everolimus is more effective in treating kidney cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess progression free survival (PFS) of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)
      therapy refractory renal cell carcinoma (RCC) patients who receive either MK-2206 (Akt
      inhibitor MK-2206) or everolimus.

      II. To assess safety of MK-2206 in patients with VEGF therapy refractory RCC.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess overall response rate (ORR) and overall survival (OS). (Clinical) II. To assess
      time to treatment failure (TTF). (Clinical) III. To determine whether baseline AKT
      activation is predictive for clinical benefit after treatment with MK-2206 or everolimus.
      (Pre-clinical/exploratory) IV. To determine whether circulating cytokines and angiogenic
      factors predict for clinical benefit after treatment with MK-2206 or everolimus.
      (Pre-clinical/exploratory) V. To assess impact of karyotype on outcome in patients treated
      with MK-2206 or everolimus. (Pre-clinical/exploratory)

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive Akt inhibitor MK2206 orally (PO) on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Courses
      repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Patients who are progression free after 1 year may receive a 12 week study drug supply of
      Akt inhibitor MK2206.

      ARM II: Patients receive everolimus PO once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 4
      weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months.
