  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether aripiprazole (marketed dopamine
      stabilizer) is effective in reducing of alcohol craving and drinking compared to placebo
      depending on participant's baseline level of impulsivity.

      Non-treatment seeking individuals meeting criteria for alcohol dependence (N=120) will be
      recruited through advertisement and paid for their participation. Subjects will have blood
      drawn for DNA analysis of various brain dopamine system genes. Alcoholics, after baseline
      evaluation, will be assigned through urn randomization to one of two experimental groups,
      depending on their baseline level of impulsivity, in which they will receive either
      aripiprazole (up to 15 mg/day) or an identical placebo. Subjects will take the study drug or
      placebo for 8 days (day 1-6 being the natural observation period). After a minimum of 24
      hours of abstinence from alcohol (day 7-8) they will undergo an alcohol administration
      (priming dose) and motivated free choice drinking procedure (on day 8). Alcoholic subjects
      will receive a brief counseling session at the end of the study to enhance their awareness
      of problem drinking and to motivate them to seek treatment. Referral for treatment will be
      offered.

      Each subject will undergo a functional MRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) brain
      scan with cue stimulation on day 7, on the evening before the alcohol administration
      paradigm. fMRI (functional magnetic resonance) imaging brain imaging technology will be used
      to determine if alcoholics treated with aripiprazole differ in alcohol cue-induced activity
      in the nucleus accumbens. It is hypothesized that aripiprazole will reduce nucleus accumbens
      activation to alcohol cues compared to placebo.

      Whether dopamine system genetic differences will be predict drinking, nucleus accumbens
      activity, and aripiprazole response will be explored.

          1. Age 21 - 40 (to focus on an age group still on a trajectory of increasing alcohol
             consumption).

          2. Meets the DSM IV criteria for current alcohol dependence including criterion 3 and/or
             4 &quot;loss of control over drinking&quot; or &quot;the inability to cut-down or stop drinking&quot;.
