      Health outcome studies should examine food patterns, because foods are consumed together and
      nutrients are metabolized jointly. To examine associations between food patterns and markers
      of systemic and vascular inflammation at baseline, in a population-based cohort in Malmö,
      Sweden, and after 13 years of follow-up food pattern associations with CVD incidence.

        The Malmö Diet and Cancer Cohort (MDC), a large-scale, population-based, prospective
        cohort study, was designed in the early 1990s to identify dietary and lifestyle risk
        factors related to the incidence of cancer. Men aged 46-73 years (n =11 063) and women
        aged 45-73 years (n = 17 035) living in Malmö, the third largest city in Sweden, at that
        time, were examinedinvited to participate. Baseline examinations took place at the MDC
        CentreCenter at the Skåne Malmö University Hospital in Malmö between March 1991 and
        October 1996.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The &quot;cardiovascular sub-cohort&quot; is a random sample (i.e., 50 percent) of those who
             joined from November 1991 to February 1994. This group underwent additional
             examinations to assess carotid arteriosclerosis by ultrasound (n = 6103) and donated
             blood after fasting (n = 5533).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects were excluded, either because they were using medication for diabetes
             mellitus or had previously been diagnosed as having diabetes mellitus.
