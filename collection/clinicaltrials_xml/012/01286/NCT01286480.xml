  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the potential role of a cardiology clinic-based
      educational intervention for 15 to 17 year olds with congenital heart disease (CHD) and
      their parents, and to determine whether this intervention results in improved
      self-management skills (e.g., renewing medication prescriptions), teens having greater
      knowledge of their heart condition, and more teen and parent satisfaction with services. The
      results of this study will form the basis for a website that in turn may serve as an
      additional means of providing transition interventions. The results of this study may also
      be applicable to youth with other special health care needs.

    <description>Youth seen in the Cardiology clinic see a nurse only to measure weight, height, and blood pressure. They rely on their cardiologist for information about their heart condition. The approach and amount of time taken by each cardiologist with a youth varies. Time-pressured clinic visits limit the opportunity to discuss many of the topics noted above.</description>

    <description>This will involve a 60 minute interaction between the teen and an advanced practice nurse (APN) in the cardiology clinic. A MyHealth passport will be created covering the name of the teen's cardiac condition, previous cardiac interventions, and name and purpose of the teen's medications. Potential late cardiac complications and contact names and location of local adult CHD cardiologists will also be reviewed. Three scenarios regarding adolescent risk taking behaviors (written in the 3rd person) will be presented to the teen who will be asked what advice he/she would offer to the teen in each of those scenarios. The teen will be given a study email address and encouraged to contact the APN by email or text messaging with follow-up questions. If no contact is initiated after 1 week, the APN will email or text (based on preference) the youth, to discuss additional questions.</description>
