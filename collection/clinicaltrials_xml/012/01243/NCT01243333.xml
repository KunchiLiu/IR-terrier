      The treatment of cancer is increasingly aimed at molecular targets derived from studies of
      the oncogenes and tumor suppressors known to be involved in the development of human
      cancers. The increased specificity obtained from these new targeted treatments has developed
      over the past many decades. From the use of general cytotoxic agents such as nitrogen
      mustard in the 1940s, to the development of natural-product anticancer drugs in the 1960s
      including the Vinca alkaloids and anthracyclines there has been improvements in cancer
      chemotherapy. Early in the development process drugs were used that were found to be more
      cytotoxic to cancer cells than normal cells. Later developments included the use of specific
      monoclonal antibodies and immunotoxins targeted to cell surface receptors. In addition, as
      our knowledge of molecular biology increased, specific agents that inactivate kinases in
      growth-promoting pathways were used to treat cancer. These newer more targeted approaches
      have improved the response rate in cancer and reduced side effects of anticancer treatment
      but have not yet resulted in cures for the majority of patients with metastatic disease.
      There are general broad classifications of chemotherapeutic drug effects. One of the
      earliest and still most utilized are the cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents.

      Positron emission tomography (PET) is a molecular imaging modality that can probe various
      aspects of tumor biology using a variety of radio-labeled imaging agents also called
      &quot;tracers&quot;. Oncologic PET imaging has seen a dramatic rise in clinical utilization over the
      past decade for cancer detection, staging, and evaluating residual or recurrent disease
      following therapy. These clinical scans use the tracer [18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG),
      which accumulates in cells in proportion to glucose (GLUT) transporter and hexokinase
      activity. FDG provides a measure of tissue glucose metabolism. Concurrent with this clinical
      growth, a number of other PET tracers have received significant attention in research for a
      variety of imaging targets. Of special interest are the tracers
      3'-deoxy-3'-[18F]fluorothymidine (FLT) and [15O]water (H215O). The uptake,
      retention/washout, and ultimate biodistribution of these tracers are each related to
      different functional or molecular processes. As such, each can be used to probe a different
      aspect of tumor biology: FLT directly assesses tumor proliferation and H2O quantifies tumor
      perfusion.

      This companion clinical study is designed to obtain pre-therapeutic imaging assessments
      using positron emission tomography (PET) imaging in 50 evaluable patients (those patients
      who had baseline and follow-up PET imaging) with various forms of malignancy and at
      approximately 28 days (day 25 -32).

      Overview of the PET Tracers FDG, FLT, and H2O The use of more specifically targeted imaging
      agents, such as PET radiopharmaceuticals, has great potential for overcoming the limitations
      of standard anatomic imaging in malignancy

      Hypotheses to be Tested:

      The driving hypothesis for the overall line of research is that multiple PET imaging
      biomarkers can provide improved image-guided personalized care of patients with various
      malignancies receiving investigational therapies and recently approved therapies at Huntsman
      Cancer Institute (HCI). The term &quot;personalized care&quot; is used here to broadly include the
      prediction of tumor behavior prior to the start of therapy, tumor surveillance,
      prognostication, and eventually individualized assignment of patients to conventional,
      aggressive, or investigational therapies early in their clinical courses. This pilot project
      will obtain initial data on the value of these PET biomarkers for such image-guided
      personalized care.

      Specific hypotheses to be tested include:

        -  HYPOTHESIS I: Dynamic single-scan PET imaging provides biologically relevant functional
           assessments of effect early in the course of therapy when compared to standard Response
           Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST)metrics of response. A composite
           standardized uptake value (SUV) will be constructed from all the PET tracers applied to
           each individual. Subjects with &lt;35% decrease in composite SUV with be classified as
           &quot;progressing by PET&quot;, and subjects with â‰¥ 35% decrease in composite SUV will be
           classified as &quot;non-progressing by PET&quot;.

        -  HYPOTHESIS II: Multi-tracer PET biomarkers, obtained in conjunction with a novel
           therapeutic, are better able to predict tumor aggressiveness than conventional
           radiographic imaging. This will include better prediction of time to progression (TTP)
           and patient survival

        -  HYPOTHESIS III: Characterization of multiple aspects of tumor function (glucose
           metabolism, proliferation, and perfusion) at baseline and after therapy provides new
           insight into tumor status that can eventually guide selection of the most appropriate
           therapy.

      Sufficient statistical power is expected to be obtained under this companion protocol to
      validate the experimental imaging evaluations in hypothesis I. Hypotheses II and III will be
      exploratory and provide insight into valuable information to be uses in subsequent
      multi-tracer PET studies.

      Data regarding these three hypotheses will be obtained in this work by studying the
      correlation of PET imaging biomarkers with clinical outcomes and available tumor biologic
      information.

      Clinical Rationale:

      This companion clinical study is designed to obtain pre-therapeutic imaging assessments
      using positron emission tomography (PET) imaging in 50 evaluable patients (those patients
      who had baseline and followup PET imaging) with various forms of malignancy and at
      approximately 28 days (day 25-32), after institution of the therapeutic drug various primary
      therapeutic clinical trials. The proposed PET imaging companion studies will be used in
      patients receiving investigational or recently approved therapies. The investigational
      therapies and recently approved therapies will vary and the appropriate companion PET
      imaging studies will be used to assess the most relevant therapeutic effect.

    <description>Initial scan will be done before starting the trial. The other two will be done about 25 to 32 days after the trial starts. Each of the 4 PET scans will be done with up to three of the tracers (FDG, FLT, and water) depending on the type of drug they are receiving and the tumor type. The timing of the PET scans will vary. Typically the first series of PET scans will be within a few days of each other but will be obtained within one week of each other. Similarly the follow-up series of PET scans at about 28 days will be within a few days of each other depending on scheduling issues but also within one week of each other.</description>

             and Accountability Act (HIPAA) authorization in accordance with institutional
             guidelines.

          5. Female patients who are not postmenopausal or surgically sterile will undergo a serum
             pregnancy test prior to baseline and the subsequent set of multi-tracer PET scans.
