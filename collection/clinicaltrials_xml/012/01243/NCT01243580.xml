      This is an open-label study comprised of two parts. Part I is a single-arm, run-in cycle
      with AG200-15 administered to all subjects as a 21-7 day regimen (three consecutive weeks of
      patch wear followed by a patch-free week).

      Part II employs crossover design with subjects randomly assigned to one of the two treatment
      sequences. Each sequence will include AG200-15 and oral contraceptive (Ortho-Cyclen®) as
      described below: Sequence 1: AG200-15 (Period 1) followed by oral contraceptive,
      Ortho-Cyclen® (Period 2); Sequence 2: Oral contraceptive, Ortho-Cyclen® (Period 1) followed
      by AG200-15 (Period 2) Both AG200-15 and Ortho-Cyclen® will be administered as 21-7 day
      regimen (three consecutive weeks of drug-taking followed by a drug-free week). Duration of
      each treatment Period is 28 days (one cycle of therapy).
