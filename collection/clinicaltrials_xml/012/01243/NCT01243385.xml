      RATIONALE: Metformin hydrochloride may make some enzymes active. These enzymes may block
      other enzymes needed for cell growth and stop the growth of tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the safety of giving metformin hydrochloride as
      first-line therapy in treating patients with locally advanced or metastatic prostate cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To determine the activity and safety of metformin hydrochloride as first-line therapy
           in patients with locally advanced or metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral metformin hydrochloride twice daily on days 1-28. Treatment repeats
      every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Previously collected and post-treatment tumor tissue may be analyzed for PTEN status and
      PI3kinase-dependent pathway activation via immunohistochemistry. Blood samples may also be
      collected periodically and analyzed for biomarkers, pharmacogenetics, pharmacodynamics,
      pharmacokinetics.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up every 3 months.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS:

          -  Histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate

               -  Locally advanced or metastatic disease with no curative therapy possible

          -  PSA progression defined as the following:

               -  Increase in PSA of ≥ 25% (and an absolute increase of ≥ 2 ng/mL) over nadir
                  value on hormonal therapy measured on 3 successive occasions at least 1 week
                  apart

                    -  If the third measurement is not higher than the second, a fourth
                       measurement will be taken and only if the fourth measurement is higher than
                       the second, the patient may be enrolled

          -  PSA doubling time ≥ 55 days (if used to define progression, must not be older than 6
             months)

          -  PSA &lt; 114 ng/mL
