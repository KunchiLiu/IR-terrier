  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, two-part study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of combination
      treatment with dalotuzumab + MK-2206, dalotuzumab + MK-0752, or dalotuzumab + MK-8669
      (ridaforolimus). The study will determine the dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) observed after
      administration of each of the combinations at various doses and define the maximum tolerated
      dose of each combination. Preliminary anti-tumor activity of these combinations, in two
      groups of participants having selected tumor biomarkers, will be assessed: one group with
      metastatic or recurrent platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, fallopian tube cancer, or primary
      peritoneal cancer and one group with metastatic or recurrent colorectal cancer. The
      dalotuzumab + MK-8669 and dalotuzumab + MK-2206 arms will be enriched with female
      platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, fallopian tube cancer, or primary peritoneal cancer
      participants. The dalotuzumab + MK-0752 arm will be enriched with metastatic or recurrent
      wild-type kirsten rat sarcoma (KRAS) colorectal cancer participants.
