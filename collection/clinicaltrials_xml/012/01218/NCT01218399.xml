  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an investigator-initiated study in which Dr. Nadeau wrote the protocol and received
      funding from an Astra Zeneca grant to direct, perform, and monitor the study on her own with
      Stanford staff. We hypothesize that the budesonide/formoterol combination improves the
      efficacy of budesonide alone.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subjects will be considered for inclusion in this study based on meeting all of the
        following criteria:

          1. Male or female, aged 12 to 65 years

          2. Subjects with mild to moderate asthma as determined by NHLBI 2007 guidelines

          3. Subjects with exacerbation of their asthma symptoms by NHLBI 2007 guidelines

          4. IgE level at study entry less than 50 IU/mL

          5. Men and women of reproductive potential who document use of adequate contraception
             during the study and for 3 months after the conclusion of treatment with study
             drug/placebo

          6. Historical documentation of asthma in the patient's medical record. The patient
             should have 6 months or more of asthma medication and management by a Stanford
             physician.

          7. Women of childbearing potential who have a negative pregnancy test (urine or serum)
             at the time of study entry

          8. Subject's guardians who are capable of understanding the purpose and risks of the
             study and who sign a statement of informed consent for the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects will be ineligible for this study based on any one of the following criteria:

          1. With a chronic or acute disease that might interfere with the evaluation of Symbicort
             or Pulmicort Flexhaler therapy

          2. Pregnancy or lactation

          3. Current or prior malignancies (excluding non-melanoma skin carcinoma or carcinoma in
             situ of the cervix that has been adequately treated)

          4. History of infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HSC-1), hepatitis B virus
             (HBV), or hepatitis C virus (HCV); or Hepatitis A virus (HAV)

          5. Infections that require intravenous antibiotic therapy

          6. Significant organ dysfunction, including cardiac, renal, liver, CNS, pulmonary,
             vascular, gastrointestinal, endocrine, or metabolic (e.g., creatinine &gt;1.6 mg/dL; ALT
             or AST &gt; 1.5x the upper limit of normal; history of myocardial infarction, congestive
             heart failure, or arrhythmias within 6 months prior to study entry)

          7. Treatment with a humanized or chimeric antibody therapy within 4 weeks prior to study
             entry

          8. Treatment with any investigational drugs or therapies within 2 weeks prior to study
             entry

          9. Any use of oral, systemic corticosteroids within 2 weeks prior to study entry
