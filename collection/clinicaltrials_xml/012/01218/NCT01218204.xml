    <textblock>
      This study investigates the safety, pharmacokinetics and effects of GSK1292263 when taken
      alone or when co-dosed with atorvastatin to subjects with dyslipidemia.

    <textblock>
      This compound has been studied in healthy subjects and subjects with type II diabetes and is
      now being studied in subjects with dyslipidemia. Because many patients with dyslipidemia are
      on statins, it is important to study how GSK1292263 behaves when taken with a potent statin,
      atorvastatin. The cholesterol lowering drug, ezetimibe, is included for comparison.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy adult males and females of non-child-bearing-potential, aged 18-75 years who
             is capable of giving informed consent.

          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of:

               -  Non-childbearing potential defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented
                  tubal ligation or hysterectomy; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of
                  spontaneous amenorrhea. In questionable cases, a blood sample with simultaneous
                  follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) &gt; 40 MlU/ml and estradiol &lt;40 pg/ml (&lt;140
                  pmol/L) is confirmatory in the absence of a clear post-menopausal history.

               -  Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) must discontinue HRT to allow
                  confirmation of post-menopausal status prior to study enrollment. For most forms
                  of HRT, at least 2-4 weeks will elapse between the cessation of therapy and the
                  blood draw; this interval depends on the type and dosage of HRT. Following
                  confirmation of their post-menopausal status, they can resume use of HRT during
                  the study.

          -  Male subjects must agree to use one of the contraception methods listed in the
             protocol. This criterion must be followed from the time of the first dose of study
             medication until seven days following the last dose.

          -  Body weight &gt; 50 kg (110 pounds) and body mass index (BMI) between 19.0 and 39.0
             (inclusive).

             tolerating the drug well, or (ii) Subjects not on lipid-modifying therapy who have a
             fasting low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLc) &gt;= 130mg/dL.

          -  In Part B at Screening: Subjects who are on statins or Vytorin treatment for &gt;= 4
             weeks.

          -  Part B at the end of the 4 week washout: Subjects who have a fasting LDL cholesterol
             of &gt;=120mg/dL and &lt;=180mg/dL and fasting triglycerides of &gt;=100mg/dL and &lt;=400mg/dL.

          -  Part B at the end of the 4 week run-in on atorvastatin: Subjects who are tolerating
             well atorvastatin 10mg or 80mg (as determined by the Investigator).

          -  Part B: Subjects must be willing to discontinue statins or Vytorin for the duration
             of the study.

          -  Liver enzymes, AST and ALT &lt; 2x upper limit of normal (ULN); alkaline phosphatase and
             bilirubin =&lt; 1.5xULN (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN is acceptable if bilirubin is
             fractionated and direct bilirubin &lt;35%). Subjects with Gilbert's syndrome are allowed
             to participate in the study.

          -  Average QTcB or QTcF &lt; 450msec; or QTc &lt; 480msec in subjects with right bundle branch
