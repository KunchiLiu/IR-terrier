  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to show that chemotherapy delivered directly through the artery
      supplying the eye (ophthalmic artery) to patients with retinoblastoma is a safe and
      effective treatment alternative to conventional systemic chemotherapy, external beam
      radiation, and surgical removal of the eye.

    <textblock>
      Delivering the chemotherapeutic agent in the arterial system through the ophthalmic artery
      transforms the treatment of retinoblastoma from systemic chemotherapy to local chemotherapy.
      Administration of the drug directly to the targeted site thus avoids the complications and
      adverse events associated with toxicity from systemic, rather than local, chemotherapy.

    IAC was initially not an available retinoblastoma treatment at Johns Hopkins. It is now
    recognized as part of the standard of care treatment options in the US.

    <description>Drug administered intra-arterially (injection in the artery).
Standard dose:
2.5mg (3-6 month old) 3.0 mg (6-12 month old) 4.0 mg (1-3 year old) 5.0 mg (&gt;3 years old)
Dose modification: decrease standard dose by 25% if there are signs of toxicity. Increase the dose by 25% if there is inadequate tumor response.
Frequency: 2 treatment cycles at 3-4 week intervals, with a third treatment cycle administered if the tumor requires it.
Dose not to exceed 0.5mg/kg, per treatment cycle.</description>
