    <textblock>
      This study is being done to study the healthful benefits of eating garlic. Previous studies
      suggest that garlic may help prevent cancer. The investigators are recruiting healthy
      volunteers to participate in a study to determine the ways in which eating garlic may reduce
      cancer risk.

      A crossover design will be utilized with each participant completing each treatment phase,
      and participants will be randomly assigned to a sequence of dietary treatments. There will
      be a 17-day washout period in between diet periods. Participants will consume a garlic-free
      diet for the first 10 days of each diet period. The dietary treatments will be administered
      on day 11 of each diet period. Dietary treatments will be incorporated into food as follows:
      1) 5 gram (0.175 oz.) of garlic mixed with 15 g margarine on top of 270 kcal white bread,
      served as breakfast, or 2) 15 g margarine on top of 270 kcal white bread, served as
      breakfast.

On day 11, subjects will consume one of two dietary treatments, consisting of either 1) 270 kcal white bread, 15 g margarine, and 5 g (0.175 oz.) of crushed garlic, or 2) 270 kcal white bread with 15 g margarine (during the control phase).</description>
