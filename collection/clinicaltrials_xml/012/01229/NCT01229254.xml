        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  In the opinion of the investigator, participant requires long term anticoagulation
             for stroke prevention in AF.

          -  Men and women ≥18 years of age.

          -  Participant has current NVAF or atrial flutter or ECG or Holter documentation within
             past 12 months.

          -  Participant has an INR ≤ 2.2 at allocation (Visit 2).

          -  A participant who is of reproductive potential agrees to remain abstinent or use (or
             have their partner use) 2 acceptable methods of birth control for the duration of the
             study. Acceptable methods of birth control are: intrauterine device (IUD), diaphragm
             with spermicide, condom, vasectomy, and hormonal contraception.

          -  Participant understands the study procedures and risks involved with the study, and
             voluntarily agree to participate by giving written informed consent.

          -  Participant has a history of mental instability, drug/alcohol abuse within the past 5

             pulmonary embolism, untreated hyperthyroidism).

          -  Participant is to undergo pulmonary vein isolation or surgery for treatment of AF.

          -  Participant had a severe, disabling stroke within the previous 6 months, any stroke
             within the previous 14 days, thromboembolism within previous 30 days or a transient
             ischemic attack (TIA) within 3 days prior to Visit 1.

          -  Participant requires renal replacement therapies (hemo- or peritoneal dialysis).

          -  Participant has any of a list of defined laboratory abnormalities.
