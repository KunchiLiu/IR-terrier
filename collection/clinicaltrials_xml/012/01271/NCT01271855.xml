  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypothesis:

      The routine use of belladonna/opium (B&amp;O) suppositories will improve patient's self-reported
      pain control in the first 24-hours after delivery.

      Commonly employed methods of controlling post-partum pain include opioid analgesics,
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatories, acetomenophen, and topical analgesics. Pain medication is
      generally administered via oral or IV route. Several studies have investigated suppositories
      as an alternative method of improving pain following delivery.

      Rectal analgesia provides a means of improving pain control through local effects on the
      perineum and uterus while possibly decreasing systemic absorption, which may in turn
      decrease systemic side effects and transmission to the newborn infant through breast milk.
      B&amp;O suppositories contain two medications that could potentially decrease post-partum pain.
      This quality may significantly improve pain from uterine contractions during the post-partum
      period.

    <time_frame>Twenty four hours</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome will be pain as measured for 24-hours after delivery. Patients will be asked to report a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) pain score at 8, 16, and 24 hours after delivery. This score will be recorded by the patients' nurse at time of administration of next dose.</description>

    <description>Study participants randomly assigned to the control group will receive routine post-partum pain management per physician preference. Typical post-partum prescriptions for pain at our institutions generally include Norco or Tylenol # 3 and Motrin as needed. Intraveneous Toradol is often given to patients for 24 hours following cesarean deliveries. Post-partum pain medications sometimes include oral Tramadol as well as Epifoam and Dermaplast topical anesthetics. In addition, patients will be given a vegetable oil suppository (placebo) per rectum immediately after delivery, then scheduled every 8-hours for the first 24 hours.</description>
