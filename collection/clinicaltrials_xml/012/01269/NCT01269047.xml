      After signing an informed consent, prior to study enrollment, a screening evaluation will be
      performed in the Clinical Research Center (CRC).

      The evaluation will consist of: a medical history, a physical examination with vital signs,
      Tanner staging, and a waist circumference. The following clinical laboratory tests will be
      done: CBC, HbA1c, creatinine,Liver function tests, amylase,adiponectin, leptin, C-reactive
      protein, lipid profile, IL-6, lipase, urine for pregnancy test (when appropriate) and
      microalbumin. A urine pregnancy test will be done at each study visit in menstruating
      females. Also an anti-GAD, ICA512, and anti-insulin antibody if they were not previously
      done or if records are not available. Each subject will have a continuous glucose monitoring
      sensor (CGMS) inserted and will need to wear it for 3 days (72 hours). A person,trained to
      insert the subcutaneous sensor, will insert the sensor. The sensor is inserted
      subcutaneously with an injector device. This site insertion is very similar to an insulin
      pump site insertion. A recorder is attached to the sensor and records blood glucose data for
      72 hours. The subject will need to test their blood glucose at least 4 times a day while
      wearing the sensor. The subject will be asked to keep a log on diet, insulin and exercise
      while wearing the CGMS. At the end of the 3 day sensing period, the subject will remove the
      sensor and place the recorder on a charger. The sensor will be brought back by the subject
      to Visit #1. A Mixed Meal Tolerance Test will be performed at this visit (as described
      below): Preparation for Mixed Meal Tolerance Test (MMTT)

        1. The test will be performed in the morning (between 7 and 10 AM)

        2. Test will be conducted only if fasting value by capillary blood glucose meter is
           between 70-200 mg/dl (3.9-11.1 mMol). If the blood glucose prior to start of MMTT is
           greater than 350 mg/dl, then urine ketones will be measured. If a subject's blood
           glucose is less than 70 mg/dl before the Mixed Meal Tolerance Test, they will receive
           5-10 grams of dextrose 50% by IV. If a subject develops hyperglycemia after the MMTT
           (which is expected), they will receive a supplemental bolus of fast acting insulin
           based on their usual insulin sensitivity factor. The subject will be instructed by the
           study staff on the amount needed. The subject will administer the bolus themselves

        3. Participants on injections will not withhold taking long acting insulin on the morning
           of the test. Participants can take very short acting insulin (e.g. Humalog or Novolog)
           up to 2 hours before the test if necessary and then that will be withheld during the
           test.

        4. Participants on insulin pumps will continue with the normal basal rate. Participants
           can take very short acting insulin (e.g. Humalog or NovoLog) up to 2 hours before the
           test if necessary.

        5. The participant will be fasting for at least 8 hours and have had no food or drink
           (with the exception of water).

        6. Local anesthetics may be used as needed to start the I.V. line. Conducting the Mixed
           Meal Tolerance Test (MMTT)

      1. Baseline blood samples will be drawn at -30 minutes; -10 minutes and 0 minutes
      (immediately before the participant starts drinking the liquid meal) Baseline samples will
      include glucose, insulin, C-peptide, amylin, GLP-1, glucagon and active ghrelin. 2. The
      participant will have a standardized liquid meal: Boost HP 6 ml/kg, with a maximum of 360
      ml, to be ingested within 5 minutes. 3. Blood samples will be drawn at times: 15, 30, 60, 90
      and 120 minutes for glucose, insulin, C-peptide, amylin, GLP-1, active ghrelin and glucagon
      after the start of ingestion of Boost. 4. After the test is completed, the participant will
      receive their usual morning dose of short acting insulin analog. The short acting analog
      will be dosed according to the subject's usual sensitivity factor and insulin to
      carbohydrate ratio for breakfast as prescribed by the investigator. Subjects on insulin pump
      therapy will receive a short acting analog via the pump dosed according to the subject's
      usual sensitivity factor and insulin to carbohydrate ratio for breakfast as prescribed by
      the investigator. Subjects will receive a meal tray once the premeal insulin is
      administered.

      A total of 107.6 ml of blood will be drawn at the screening visit.

      Visit 1 (0 months):

      If subjects qualify after screening, they will have the opportunity to enroll in the study.
      They will meet with a study coordinator in the CRC to make adjustments to their insulin
      dosage (if necessary) to optimize treatment and improve glycemic control. As shown in the
      preliminary data section, insulin glargine (Lantus), a long acting analog, may be used when
      mixed with short acting insulin analogs so as to decrease the total number of injections.
      This may also increase compliance to the medication regimen. Parental supervision for
      medication administration will be advised. Hypoglycemic events and adherence to insulin
      regimen will be noted. QOL questionnaires will be administered.Subjects will have vital
      signs, waist circumference, HbA1C, Glycomark, and a urine pregnancy test (as
      appropriate).Dual-emission X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) body scan will be done on this day to
      estimate total body fat. Patients will also be asked to bring in food diary kept for 3 days
      so that it can be analyzed for calories being consumed. During the entire study period,
      subjects will be assessed using a home blood glucose monitor that will electronically
      transfer data to PI (Glucomon). Data will be reviewed daily for weeks 1 and 2, and then once
      a week for weeks 3 and 4. Starting at week 5, data will be reviewed once every two weeks for
      the remainder of the study. Contact will be similar for all subjects. Subjects will receive
      their Glucomon at this visit. At this visit, subjects will be randomized into one of three
      possible groups.

      Randomization: Subjects will be randomized using a random number table. Group 1: Pramlintide
      + Insulin Group 2: Exenatide + Insulin Group 3: Insulin monotherapy

      Study Medications:

      Exenatide dosing: Exenatide will be started at 1.25 mcg as previously determined by us in an
      earlier study. Exenatide injection will be given subcutaneously twice a day (within 30
      minutes after the start of the meal) and will be separate from insulin injections. Exenatide
      dose will be titrated to 2.5 or 5 mcg (depending on response) to keep 2 hr post-prandial
      blood glucose concentrations below 200 mg/dl. Initially, premeal bolus insulin dose will be
      reduced by 30%. Basal insulin dose will not be changed. Insulin dose may be increased if
      pre-meal blood glucose concentrations are greater than 150 mg/dl or to decrease
      post-prandial hyperglycemia.

      Pramlintide dosing: Based on our preliminary studies, pramlintide will be started at 15 mcg
      and then titrated up to 30-45 mcg and capped at 60 mcg. This will be based on demonstration
      of acceptable post-prandial glucose excursions without hypoglycemia. Subjects will receive
      pramlintide subcutaneously twice a day (within 30 minutes after the start of the meal) and
      will be separate from insulin injections. Initially, premeal bolus insulin dose will be
      reduced by 30%.Insulin dose may be increased if pre-meal blood glucose concentrations are
      greater than 150 mg/dl or to decrease post-prandial hyperglycemia.

      At the outset, we will decrease premeal bolus insulin dose by 30% for both groups, but
      insulin may be increased as necessary once the subjects are better able to tolerate the
      drugs (personal communications regarding unpublished data with Dr. David Maggs, Amylin
      pharmaceuticals, on the management of exenatide and/or pramlintide with insulin).

      Insulin monotherapy: Subjects randomized to insulin monotherapy will continue on either
      long-acting and short acting insulin analogs or subcutaneous insulin pump therapy. Insulin
      dose changes will only be made to optimize therapy.

      A total of 5.5 ml of blood will be drawn at the Visit 1.

      Visit 2 (1 month):

      Subjects will have vital signs, waist circumference, HbA1C, Glycomark, and a urine pregnancy
      test (as appropriate).

      Adherence to insulin/medication regimen and adverse event reporting will be obtained.

      A total of 5.5 ml of blood will be drawn at the Visit 2.

      Visit 3 (4 months):

      Subjects will undergo a medical history, physical examination, vital signs, waist
      circumference, HbA1C, Glycomark,amylase, lipase, Liver function tests, CBC, creatinine,
      adiponectin, leptin, C-reactive protein, lipid profile, IL-6, and a urine pregnancy test (as
      appropriate) . Adherence to insulin/medication regimen and adverse event reporting will be
      obtained. Quality of Life (QOL) questionnaires will be repeated. Additionally, subjects will
      come in fasting and undergo a MMTT as described in the Screening visit but if subjects are
      on pramlintide/ exenatide (Byetta) they will receive that dose prior to the boost
      administration. DEXA scan will be done on this day to estimate total body fat. Patients will
      also be asked to bring in food diary kept for 3 days so that it can be analyzed for calories
      being consumed. Each subject with have a continuous glucose monitoring sensor (CGMS)
      inserted and will need to wear it for 3 days (72 hours). A person, trained to insert the
      subcutaneous sensor, will insert the sensor. The subject will receive instruction on
      completion of logsheets and how to properly remove the sensor. Pramlintide and exenatide
      will be stopped after the subject removes the sensor which is again 3 days from its
      insertion. Each family would be given a prepaid envelope to mail back the sensor recorder
      and the remaining study medication. A total of 104.6 ml of blood will be drawn at the Visit
      3. Control subjects during the MMTT will receive pramlintide or exenatide as a one time dose
      without insulin.

      Visit 4 (6-7 months):

      This will be a post-study visit. Subjects will undergo a medical history, physical
      examination, vital signs, waist circumference. This visit will be similar to visit 3 for
      testing and lab work and pregnancy test (as appropriate). Except that the subject will not
      have DEXA scan and a Continuos Glucose Monitoring Sensor. If the subject received
      pramlintide previously as study drug in visit 3 they will receive exenatide as a one time
      dose with the MMTT. QOL questionnaires will be repeated. Adherence to insulin regimen and
      adverse event reporting will be obtained. Subjects will return their Glucomon and all the
      blood glucose log books at this visit. A total of 104.6 ml of blood will be drawn at the
      Visit 4.

      During the entire study period, subjects will be assessed using data collected from a study
      issued home blood glucose monitor. The subject's blood glucose data will be electronically
      transmitted to the PI ensuring data security and patient privacy. Data will be reviewed
      daily for weeks 1 and 2, and then once a week for weeks 3 and 4. Starting at week 5,data
      will be reviewed once every two weeks for the remainder of the study.
