  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, phase II study of ADI-PEG 20 in subjects with relapsed SCLC. ADI-PEG
      20 will be administered intramuscularly (IM) at a fixed dose of 320 IU/m2 once weekly for a
      4-week cycle. The primary objective is the assessment of clinical efficacy with a primary
      endpoint of tumor response by RECIST after 4 weeks. Secondary objectives are the assessment
      of safety, pharmacodynamics, and immunogenicity of ADI-PEG 20, as well as, clinical efficacy
      with a secondary endpoint of overall survival.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients must have histologically documented small cell lung cancer (SCLC)

          2. Cohort 1: &quot;Sensitive&quot; disease patients who had one previous line of chemotherapy and
             maintained an appropriate response for 90 days or more

             Cohort 2:

               -  &quot;refractory&quot; disease patients, who had one previous line of chemotherapy and
                  either had no response or progressed in less than 90 days after completing
                  treatment

               -  any patient (&quot;sensitive&quot; or &quot;refractory&quot;) in need of 3rd line therapy, i.e., who
                  completed or failed two previous lines of chemotherapy

          3. Measurable disease using RECIST criteria

          4. ASS tumor expression must be either negative or &lt; 5% + tumor cells (by IHC analysis)

          5. ECOG performance score of 0 to 2

          6. Laboratory parameters for vital functions should be in the normal range. Laboratory
             abnormalities that are not clinically significant are generally permitted, except for
             the following laboratory parameters, which must be within the ranges specified:

               -  Neutrophil count ≥ 1.5 x 109/L

             ability of the patient to fulfill the study requirements.

          5. Metastatic disease to the central nervous system, unless treated and stable.

          6. Known immunodeficiency or HIV positivity.

          7. Participation in any other clinical trial involving another investigational agent

             Section 5.3.

             with the requirements of the study.
