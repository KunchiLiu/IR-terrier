      The investigators hypothesize that the extent of sulfation of toxic BAs and their urinary
      elimination can be used as a biomarker to predict the severity and prognosis of
      hepatobiliary diseases. The investigators rationale in this project is that the discovery of
      biomarkers specific to liver injury would provide the foundation for a specific and
      non-invasive tool to evaluate disease prognosis, determine patients with higher risk of
      developing end-stage liver diseases, and determine patients with higher risk of recurrence
      of hepatobiliary complications after liver transplant. The investigators propose the
      following specific aims to test the investigators hypothesis:

      Specific Aim #1: Establish a baseline of individual and total urinary BAs and BA-sulfates in
      healthy controls and patients with hepatobiliary diseases. A baseline reference of the
      average and distribution of the percentage of urinary BA-sulfates will be determined in
      healthy subjects and in patients with hepatobiliary diseases including chronic hepatitis
      C/B, alcoholic liver disease, hereditary, drug-induced, and autoimmune hepatobiliary
      diseases. The investigators working hypothesis is that patients' capability to sulfate total
      or specific BAs, as determined by the percentage of total or specific BAs excreted in the
      sulfate form, can predict the severity of hepatobiliary diseases, as determined by mayo
      model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score and compensation status(compensated and
      decompensated). Patients with higher MELD score are considered to be at higher risk of
      developing severe hepatobiliary complications.

      Specific Aim #2: Determine the relationship between BA sulfation and the progression of
      hepatobiliary diseases. This is an exploratory aim to collect preliminary data on the
      relationship between urinary BAs and the progression of hepatobiliary diseases in
      liver-transplant and non-liver-transplant patients, as monitored over a1-year period. The
      investigators working hypothesis is that patients' capabilities of sulfating BAs determine
      the progression of the disease.

      Patients on the liver transplant list are continuously monitored during their
      hospitalization and are scheduled for follow-up visits for 12 months after their release
      post-surgery. Disease progression will be evaluated by monitoring MELD scores, survival,
      incidence of liver transplant, and incidence of complications related to hepatobiliary
      conditions such as fluid retention, GI bleeding, encephalopathy, and biliary stricture
      complications.
