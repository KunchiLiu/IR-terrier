  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effects, good and/or bad, of posaconazole and
      micafungin in preventing fungal infections after chemotherapy for acute leukemia or
      myelodysplastic syndrome. When people take chemotherapy, they are more likely to get
      infections. Posaconazole has been approved for the prevention of fungal infections in
      patients who receive induction chemotherapy for acute leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome.
      Posaconazole is available only as an oral suspension and has to be given with food. After
      chemotherapy, many patients are not able to tolerate food or oral medication because of
      severe mucositis. Patients unable to tolerate food and oral medications cannot take
      posaconazole.

      Micafungin is an antifungal medication that is given only intravenously. Micafungin is
      approved for the treatment of certain fungal infections and for preventing fungal infections
      in patients who receive bone marrow transplant. The investigators know that micafungin is
      safe. Micafungin has not been tested for the prevention of fungal infections in patients
      receiving chemotherapy for acute leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome. Because micafungin
      is given by vein, it can be given even in patients who cannot take food or medications by
      mouth after chemotherapy. In this study the investigators want to compare micafungin to
      posaconazole when given for the prevention of fungal infections in leukemia and
      myelodysplastic syndrome patients.
