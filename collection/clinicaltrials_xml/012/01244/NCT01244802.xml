      The objective of this study is to study immune memory generated against the yellow fever
      (YFV) vaccine in participants who have previously received the vaccine. Volunteers will not
      receive vaccine shots; only immune responses to previous yellow fever vaccination will be
      studied. The study involves one or multiple blood draws.
