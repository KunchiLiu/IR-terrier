  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prevention of complications in veterans with diabetes depends heavily on assessment of blood
      glucose and HbA1c. The HbA1c is a blood test that measures the exposure of hemoglobin (Hb)
      to a person's average blood glucose over the lifespan of a red blood cell (RBC). The test is
      heavily relied upon as a measure of blood glucose control. It is normally assumed that all
      people (those with and without diabetes) have a narrow range of red blood cell survival. It
      has been recently shown that this is not a valid assumption.

      A more precise test of red blood cell survival, using a biotin label method, demonstrated a
      substantial difference of red blood cell survival among otherwise normal people. There is
      sufficient difference in red blood cell survival to alter the estimate of glycemic control
      from the HbA1c test by as much as 30 per cent. This introduces concern that HbA1c values do
      not mean the same thing in a significant number of people.

      Although the evidence is clear that there is variation in RBC survival among people,
      attributing this variation to differences between individuals depends on answering several
      simple questions which surprisingly remain unanswered: whether RBC survival is stable over
      time within an individual and whether blood glucose control affects its stability.
      Therefore, the goal of the proposed studies is to define these characteristics.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The first Specific Aim tests the hypothesis that mean RBC age is stable in subjects without
      diabetes and in subjects with diabetes at stable glycemic control. The second Specific Aim
      tests the hypothesis that mean RBC age will not change in subjects with diabetes studied
      initially in poor glycemic control, and again after being treated to stable, improved
      glycemic control for &gt;8 months. To accomplish the two aims, RBC survival and mean blood
      glucose will be determined at two times separated by at least eight months in 10 subjects
      without diabetes, 10 subjects with diabetes and stable glycemic control, and up to 15
      subjects with diabetes in initial poor glycemic control in order to re-study 10 subjects
      subsequently in improved glycemic control. The RBC survival will be measured using the same
      novel biotin RBC label in conjunction with mean glucose determination by continuous glucose
      monitoring. Mean blood glucose will be assessed using blood glucose testing meter ,
      continuous glucose monitoring equipment, HbA1c, fructosamine and glycated albumin
      determinations HbA1c is the most highly valued clinical test for long term monitoring of
      glycemic control and the prediction of diabetes complications risk is relied upon for
      hundreds of thousands of clinical decisions made every year in veterans with diabetes. The
      proposed studies, by further defining RBC survival stability necessary to develop a new
      approach to HbA1c interpretation, therefore has the potential to dramatically support the
      Department of Veterans Affairs in its mission to reduce the burden of diabetes and its
      complications

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Specific Aim 1: To determine the stability of MRBC (mean RBC age)over time at stable glycemia. The hypothesis is MRBC will be stable in subjects without diabetes and in subjects with diabetes at stable glycemic control.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 8 months later</time_frame>
    <description>We will determine MRBC and MBG (by both 7 point profile and continuous glucose monitoring), twice in 10 subjects without diabetes and in 10 subjects with diabetes at stable glycemic control. Since the time course study for following the disappearance of re-infused labeled RBCs is approximately 4 months, performing the biotin labeling of the cells for the second study at least 8 months after completion of sampling for the first, effectively samples MRBC at two time points at least one year apart.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Specific Aim 2: To determine the impact of glycemic control on MRBC. The hypothesis is MRBC will be similar in subjects with diabetes studied initially in poor glycemic control compared to re-study after stable, improved glycemic control for &gt;8 months.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 8 months later</time_frame>
    <description>Up to 15 subjects participating in Aim 2 will be studied initially in poor glycemic control, while their second biotin/glucose monitoring study will be performed at least 8 months later after achieving stable glycemic control. If RBC survival varies, and in particular if it varies with glycemic control, then the relationship between HbA1c and MBG will change. Several studies have reported that HbA1c rises linearly with MBG until there is the appearance of a plateau suggesting a saturation maximum.</description>
