      This study aims to examine the antidepressant efficacy of riluzole, employing a randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, 8 week trial of adjunctive trial in treatment-resistant
      major depressive disorder (TRD). Preclinical studies have shown riluzole to modulate Glu
      release and clearance, and to have potent neuroprotective properties, promoting
      neuro-resiliency. Other preclinical data now also show the drug to have antidepressant-like
      effects in rodent models used to screen for antidepressant activity. In addition, several
      small open-label clinical studies further suggest riluzole has antidepressant and anxiolytic
      properties, even in patients who do not respond to standard monoaminergic antidepressant and
      anxiolytic medications.

    <time_frame>8 weeks of therapy</time_frame>
    <description>This 10 item instrument is completed by the clinician by using a structured interview and defined anchor points, and aims to quantify the degree of depression over the past 7 days. The MADRS is a widely studied instrument for depression, and its reliability and validity are high. This instrument is administered at every study visit during the double-blind RCT, and at the screening, and baseline.</description>
