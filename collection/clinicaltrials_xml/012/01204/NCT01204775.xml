        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and female patients eligible if 10 years of age, up to 17 years and 32 weeks of
             age at the time of randomization, diagnosed as having type 2 diabetes prior to study
             enrollment.

          -  HbA1c ≥7.0% and ≤10.5%

             other study drug or participation in a clinical research trial within 30 days of
             planned enrollment to this study (or a longer period if dictated by local regulatory

             transplantation or subjects diagnosed with human immunodeficiency virus. k) Subjects

             exercise program.

          3. Physical and Laboratory Test Findings a) Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) &gt; 255 mg/dL
             (14.2 mmol/L) at screening will exclude the patient. b) Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)

             DPP4-inhibitor and/or incretin mimetics b) Current use of prescription or
             non-prescription weight loss drugs and their use within 3 months of screening.

        2) Medical History and Concurrent Diseases

        or secondary diabetes (steroid use, Cushing's disease, acromegaly). c) Significant
        cardiovascular history. d) History of hemoglobinopathies (sickle cell anemia or
        thalassemias, sideroblastic anemia). e) History of unstable or rapidly progressive renal
        disease. f) History of alcohol or drug abuse. g) Psychiatric or cognitive disorder that
        will, in the opinion of investigators, limit the patient's ability to comply with the
        study medications and monitoring. h) Administration of any other study drug or
        participation in a clinical research trial within 30 days of planned enrollment to this
        study (or a longer period if dictated by local regulatory authorities). i) Any condition,
        which in the investigator's opinion may render the subject unable to complete the study or
        may pose significant risk to the subject. j) Immunocompromised individuals such as
        subjects that have undergone organ transplantation or subjects diagnosed with human
