  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study it to determine whether the use of a gonadotropin releasing
      hormone (GnRH)-agonist (depot-leuprolide acetate) during cyclophosphamide (CYC) therapy in
      women with rheumatic diseases will provide greater ovarian protection than placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be women ages 18-40 with either a severe rheumatic disease requiring
      cyclophosphamide or interstitial lung disease requiring cyclophosphamide to be administered
      either daily orally; monthly intravenously; or intravenously every 2 weeks for 6 doses.
      Because cyclophosphamide treatment may be required urgently for some indications, study
      entry may occur before either the first or second dose of cyclophosphamide for patients
      receiving cyclophosphamide intravenously.

          3. Diagnosis consistent with a rheumatic or autoimmune disease requiring 3-6 months of
             daily or intermittent cyclophosphamide therapy. This may include, but is not limited
             to:

               -  Systemic lupus

               -  Sjogren's syndrome

               -  Systemic vasculitis

               -  Isolated vasculitis of the central nervous system

               -  Other autoimmune neurologic diseases requiring cyclophosphamide including
                  transverse myelitis, peripheral neuropathies, multiple sclerosis, neuromyelitis
                  optica, and retinal vasculitis

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Symptoms consistent with ovarian failure based on gynecologic evaluation and

          5. Prior adverse or allergic reaction to GnRH-a

          6. A history of severe psychiatric disorders, particularly severe depression that is

          7. History of significant noncompliance with medical treatment

          8. Patients with major risk factors for decreased bone mineral content such as chronic
             alcohol and/or tobacco use, strong family history of osteoporosis, or chronic use of
             drugs that can reduce bone mass such as anticonvulsants that have not already been
             addressed with appropriate measures to preserve bone mass.

          9. Pregnant or breastfeeding

         10. Significant thrombotic event requiring treatment that will not have received
