  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well vinorelbine tartrate and cyclophosphamide
      work in combination with bevacizumab or temsirolimus in treating patients with recurrent or
      refractory rhabdomyosarcoma. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as vinorelbine tartrate and
      cyclophosphamide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by
      killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as
      bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells
      to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing
      substances to them. Bevacizumab may also stop the growth of rhabdomyosarcoma by blocking
      blood flow to the tumor. Temsirolimus may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of
      the enzymes needed for cell growth. It is not yet known whether combination chemotherapy is
      more effective when given together with bevacizumab or temsirolimus in treating
      rhabdomyosarcoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      l. To determine the feasibility of administering bevacizumab in combination with intravenous
      vinorelbine (vinorelbine tartrate) and cyclophosphamide (VC) in patients with recurrent
      rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS).

      II. To determine the feasibility of administering temsirolimus in combination with VC in
      patients with recurrent RMS.

      III. To estimate the event-free survival (EFS) of patients with recurrent/refractory RMS
      treated with bevacizumab and VC and compare with the EFS of those treated with temsirolimus
      and VC.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the initial (2 cycle) response rate of patients with recurrent/refractory RMS
      treated with bevacizumab and VC and compare with the response rate of those treated with
      temsirolimus and VC, and to also compare the best response rate on each regimen of protocol
      therapy.

      II. To evaluate surrogate biological markers in patients with recurrent RMS and to estimate
      differences in these markers following treatment with bevacizumab and temsirolimus.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive vinorelbine tartrate intravenously (IV) over 6-10 minutes on days 1
      and 8 and cyclophosphamide IV over 30-60 minutes on day 1. Patients also receive bevacizumab
      IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1.

      ARM II: Patients receive vinorelbine tartrate and cyclophosphamide as in arm I. Patients
      also receive temsirolimus IV over 30-60 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15.

      In both arms, treatment repeats every 21 days for 12 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up annually for 5 years.

    <description>First, the distributions of these markers will be compared at 'end of 2 cycles' between treatments using a 2-independent sample non-parametric test. The mean will also be modeled for each of these markers (or a transformation of the marker to near normality) as a function of time and treatment using GEEs which are designed to take into account the internal correlation of repeated measurements taken on the same subject. Associations between progression-free survival and changes in each of the biomarkers will be investigated using univariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis.</description>

    <description>The data reported in 2 groups will be summarized using numbers and percentages of patients in each stratum and at each time point (baseline, after course 2, at the time of best response and end of therapy or progressive disease, whichever comes first). A binomial generalized estimating equation (GEE) model will be fitted to the data. The variables in the model will be time, treatment group and a biomarker. The beta coefficient of the biomarker will quantify the strength of the association between clinical response and the biomarker, beyond the association of the outcome to the other variables.</description>
