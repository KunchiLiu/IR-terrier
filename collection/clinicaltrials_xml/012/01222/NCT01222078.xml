  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study to assess the safety and tolerability of re-dosing at 6 months
      with otelixizumab (given as an 8-day series of intravenous infusions) in adult subjects with
      newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes mellitus
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this phase IIa, open-label, multi-centre study is to assess the
      safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of re-dosing at 6 months with an 8 consecutive day
      series of otelixizumab intravenous (IV) infusions in 8 adult subjects with newly diagnosed
      type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). Although it is hoped that the β cell preserving effect of
      otelixizumab will be long-lasting, it is possible that the effect may decline over time and
      thus T1DM subjects may require re-treatment. Six months is the minimum time expected between
      treatments.

      After baseline assessments, eligible subjects will receive 8 consecutive days of
      otelixizumab infusions, each given over a 30 minute period. Prophylaxis for cytokine release
      syndrome AEs will be given. At Month 6, following a review of any new medical conditions,
      concomitant medications, lymphocyte count, Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) viral load and other
      re-dosing eligibility criteria, subjects will be re-treated with the same dosing regimen.
      Subjects will be followed for 24 months in this study.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female, aged 18 to 45 years. Women are allowed if they are of
             non-childbearing potential or agree to use one of the contraception methods listed in
             the protocol.

          -  Diagnosis of type 1 autoimmune diabetes mellitus according to ADA and WHO criteria

          -  No more than 90 days between diagnosis and the first dose of study drug.

          -  Currently requires insulin for T1DM treatment, or has required insulin at some time
             between diagnosis and the first dose of study drug.

          -  Positive for one or more of the autoantibodies typically associated with T1DM:
             antibody to glutamic acid decarboxylase (anti‑GAD); antibody to protein tyrosine
             phosphatase-like protein (anti‑IA‑2); or insulin autoantibodies (IAA). A subject who
             is positive for insulin autoantibodies (IAA) and negative for the other
             autoantibodies will only be eligible if the subject has used insulin for less than 7
             days total.

          -  Stimulated C-peptide level greater than 0.20 nmol/L and less than or equal to 3.50
             nmol/L

          -  Body mass index not greater than 32 kg/m2.

          -  QTc &lt;450 millisecond (msec) or &lt;480msec for patients with Bundle Branch Block

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant from the beginning of the
             screening period or at least 14 days prior to initial dosing until at least 60 days
             after the last dose of the second treatment course of study drug.

          -  Current or prior malignancy, other than non-melanoma skin cancer (subject must have
             had fewer than 5 occurrences of non-melanoma skin cancer, and the last occurrence
             must not be within 3 months of study entry).

          -  Clinically significant abnormal laboratory values during the Screening period, other
             than those due to T1DM. Permitted ranges for selected laboratory values are shown in
             the protocol. A clinically significant abnormal value will not result in exclusion
             if, upon re test, the abnormality is resolved or becomes clinically insignificant.

          -  Significant and/or active disease in any body system likely to increase the risk to
             the subject or interfere with the subject's participation in or completion of the
             study. Examples of significant diseases include, but are not limited to, coronary
             artery disease, congestive heart failure, uncontrolled hypertension, renal failure,
             emphysema, history of bleeding peptic ulcers, history of seizure(s), addiction to

             of screening

          -  Significant systemic infection during the 6 weeks before the first dose of study drug
             (e.g., infection requiring hospitalisation, major surgery, or IV antibiotics to
             resolve; other infections, e.g., bronchitis, sinusitis, localised cellulitis,
             candidiasis, or urinary tract infections, must be assessed on a case-by-case basis by
             the investigator regarding whether they are serious enough to warrant exclusion).

          -  History of current or past active tuberculosis infection and or latent tuberculosis
             infection. Further details are given in the protocol.

          -  A positive test for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody or risk factors which
             predispose subject to HIV infection.

             mononuclear cells (PBMCs) as determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction
             (qPCR). If there is any clinical suspicion that a subject who is EBV seronegative and
             with EBV PCR &lt;10,000 copies per 10xe6 PBMCs has symptoms consistent with infectious
             mononucleosis prior to administration of study drug, then a monospot test result must
             be negative before the subject can be dosed.

             chronic basis, methotrexate, cyclosporine, or anti-TNF agents) within the 30 days
             before the first dose of study drug, or expecting to require such treatment within 3
             months after the last dose of study drug. (Intranasal, inhaled, and topical
             corticosteroid medications are permitted if used at recommended dosages.)

          -  Used an atypical antipsychotic drug (e.g., risperidone [Risperdal], quetiapine
             [Seroquel], or clozapine [Clozaril]) within the 30 days before first dose of study
             drug, or expecting to require such treatment during the study.

             rodent antibody.

          -  Undergone a major surgical procedure within 30 days before the first dose of study
             drug, or planning to undergo any such surgery within 3 months after the last dose of
