        Inclusion Criteria

          -  Subjects must have histologically proven breast cancer

          -  Subjects are being considered for preoperative chemotherapy

          -  Subjects must be â‰¥ 18 years old. Sensor Sub-Study Only

          -  Palpable subcutaneous or known disease with one surface &lt;1cm below surface of skin.

          -  A subset of patients who have a mass located on any surface of the breast that is
             accessible for Lucerno sensor placement will have additional testing.

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  Children will be excluded from this study.

          -  Pregnant women and women who are breast feeding will be excluded from this study.
             (The Vanderbilt University Medical Center radiology &quot;PET Procedure Screening Form&quot;
             will be used to identify and exclude subjects who are pregnant or breastfeeding. A
             urine pregnancy test/or serum beta HCG will also be performed for women of child
             bearing potential).

          -  Patients who are acutely ill who are deemed by their treating physician as not
             suitable candidates for this study.

          -  Intraluminal lesions will be excluded from the sensor sub-study.

          -  Non biopsy proven malignancy will be excluded from this study.

          -  Palpable subcutaneous or known disease with one surface &gt;1cm below surface of skin
             will be excluded from the sensor sub-study.

          -  Draining or exposed malignant tumor will be excluded from the sensor sub-study.
