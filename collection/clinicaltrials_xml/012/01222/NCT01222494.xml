      This K23 award application is relevant to multiple topic areas in the recent Institute of
      Medicine (IOM) research priority list, as well as the recent IOM report brief and White
      House &quot;Let's Move&quot; Campaign focused on childhood obesity. The US prevalence of
      childhood-onset obesity and type 2 diabetes, both predictors of cardiovascular risk, have
      increased to epidemic proportions in recent decades. Children with mental illness,
      especially those treated with antipsychotic medications, are at additional risk for obesity
      and related risk conditions. Despite known increases in obesity-related outcomes, including
      premature mortality, associated with childhood-onset versus adult-onset obesity, there
      remains an under-appreciation of these risks in children. A variety of noninvasive
      techniques to assess cardiometabolic risk have begun to be applied in children, including
      carotid intima media thickness (IMT) measured by ultrasound, and hepatic triglyceride
      content (IHTG) measured by 1H Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS). These measures allow
      for the early, noninvasive study of metabolic risk. Unfortunately, none of these promising
      methods have been applied to the high-risk population of children with psychiatric
      disorders, and cardiac triglyceride content has not been evaluated in children at all,
      preventing accurate characterization of risk or the effectiveness of interventions the
      reduce risk in this vulnerable population. The overall aim of this two-study research plan
      is to characterize the level of measurable risk using these sensitive markers in treated and
      untreated children with mental health disorders, and to evaluate the magnitude of change in
      risk that can be observed using these biomarkers in children receiving a well established
      behavioral weight-loss intervention.

      The proposed research seeks to increase knowledge regarding biomarkers of metabolic risk in
      children with mental health conditions, building on measures of body composition and insulin
      sensitivity used in MEAC. This project will utilize sensitive, early biomarkers of disease
      risk, including hepatic triglyceride content (HTGC) and carotid IMT, directly relevant to
      diabetes and cardiovascular disease risk, respectively. The overall aim is to characterize
      metabolic risk associated with weight using these sensitive biomarkers in children with
      mental health disorders, and to evaluate the magnitude of change observed in these
      biomarkers in children receiving an established behavioral weight-loss intervention. This
      will be accomplished in two phases.

      Study PHASE 1 will involve piloting testing a 17-week behavioral weight loss intervention,
      as well as feasibility of evaluating HTCG and IMT values in 3-5 overweight/obese
      psychiatrically ill youth ages 6-18 who are treated with antipsychotic medications.

      Aim 1: To test the feasibility of delivering an existing family-based behavioral weight loss
      program in families of psychiatrically ill youth who are overweight or obese.

      Primary Hypotheses: psychiatrically ill youth and their families can participate in an
      existing intensive behavioral weight loss intervention.

      Study PHASE 2 will involve a randomized controlled trial, testing the effects of a family
      based weight loss intervention on weight and metabolic biomarkers in overweight or obese
      mentally ill children (30) compared to age-, gender- and BMi%ile-matched healthy controls
      (30). Participants in the antipsychotic treated group will be randomized 2:1 to either
      weekly &quot;study&quot; group or a monthly &quot;standard of care&quot; group. A group of healthy controls will
      receive the weekly &quot;study&quot; treatment (20) and a reference group will receive the monthly
      standard of care condition (10). In addition, a pilot study will be performed to determine
      the feasibility and explore associations between obesity treatment response, measures of
      executive functioning and reward sensitivity, and rs-fcMRI of the default mode network (DMN)
      and reward networks in antipsychotic-treated and healthy control youth participating in the
      17-week behavioral weight loss parent study as described above. Each participant in this
      pilot study will undergo baseline fMRI brain imaging and cognitive processing evaluation.

      Aim 1: To evaluate the effect of 17-weeks of the behavioral weight loss intervention on
      DEXA-measured whole body adiposity in overweight/obese antipsychotic-treated children
      compared with healthy controls.

      Aim 2: To evaluate the effect of 17-weeks of the behavioral weight loss intervention on
      hepatic tissue triglyceride concentration (HTGC) in overweight/obese antipsychotic-treated
      children compared with healthy controls.

      Aim 3: To evaluate the effect of 17-weeks of the behavioral weight loss intervention on
      carotid IMT in overweight/obese antipsychotic-treated children compared with healthy
      controls.

      Aim 4: To characterize baseline cognitive processing in 15-20 obese antipsychotic-treated
      and healthy control youth prior to participation in a 17-week behavioral weight loss
      intervention.

      Aim 5: Characterize baseline brain volumetric and resting state functional connectivity in
      15-20 obese antipsychotic-treated and healthy control youth prior to engagement in a 17-week
      behavioral weight loss intervention.

      Primary Hypothesis: Change in DEXA-measured total fat and HGTC/IMT will be more pronounced
      in the weight loss intervention groups compared to diet and exercise education alone.

      Exploratory Aims: To evaluate changes in standard cardiometabolic risk factors (e.g.,
      fasting lipids, insulin, glucose, adiponectin, fibrinogen, high sensitivity C-reactive
      protein and very low density lipoprotein particle size) and differences in adherence to an
      intervention between mentally ill and non-mentally ill youth.

        of whom can meet criteria for any DSM-IV Axis I psychiatric illness); iv) Currently
        treated with an atypical antipsychotic medication (EXCEPT for the Obese or Overweight
        Healthy Control Group in PHASE 2, none of whom can be treated with any psychotropic

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR PHASES 1 and 2: i) Do not meet DSM-IV criteria for any Axis I
        psychiatric illness per PI discretion (EXCEPT for Overweight or Obese Healthy reference
        group in PHASE 2); ii) Any lifetime use of antipsychotics (EXCEPT for
        Antipsychotic-Treated Participants in PHASES 1 and 2, with the individuals in the latter
        group possibly having a remote, brief prior antipsychotic exposure that may be considered
        for enrollment on a case by case basis by the PI); iii) The presence of any serious
        medical disorder that may confound the assessment of relevant biologic measures or
        diagnoses, including: significant organ system dysfunction; endocrine disease, including
        type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus; coagulopathy; anemia; or acute infection; all based on
