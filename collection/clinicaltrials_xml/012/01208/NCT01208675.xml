    <textblock>
      The present study aims at combining biochemical methods with various types of imaging
      techniques to identify the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The main interest is
      to find markers associated with the very early steps in the pathology of this disease. The
      investigators shall thus screen for i) molecules in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma
      specific for AD, and ii) brain imaging markers (e.g. MRI and PET) that correlate to detailed
      clinical assessments.

      Biomarkers of interest would then be useful to:

        1. Enable accurate detection of the disease early on. Such biomarkers need to specifically
           reflect the very early pathophysiology of AD and distinguish it from disorders with
           similar symptomatology, such as other types of dementia and major depression. The
           sensitivity and specificity of these biomarkers in combination with clinical assessment
           should be of at least 90%.

        2. Enable prediction of the course of events of the disease, such as the disease rate in
           individual patients. Biomarkers that can predict the pattern of future symptoms will be
           extremely valuable.

        3. Allow monitoring of early effects of new disease-modifying therapies (so-called
           surrogate biomarkers). Currently clinical therapeutic trials for AD require large
           patient groups together with long-term treatment. Both size of the groups and treatment
           time will be reduced with the help of surrogate biomarkers.

        4. Study the pathogenesis of the disease. Biomarkers can be used to investigate in detail
           early alterations in AD patients. For instance, changes in the levels of certain
           molecules in CSF together with genetic predisposition could then be correlated to
           clinical signs and changes detectable by brain imaging. This can lead to identification
           of new therapeutic targets that could easily be monitored in future trials.

      1. Baseline investigations of patients with mild cognitive deficits

           We are conducting a prospective, longitudinal study in which we consecutively include
           patients with mild cognitive deficits (MCI), who seek medical care at the
           Neuropsychiatric Clinic (Malmö, Sweden) or Unit for Cognitive Medicine (Lund, Sweden).
           At baseline the MCI patients undergo detailed neurological and psychiatric examination,
           including assessment of depressive symptoms and ADL-capacity as well as cognitive and
           motor tests. Patients are also genotyped for APOE. Samples of plasma, blood (for DNA
           and mRNA) and CSF are also collected. All patients undergo an advanced MRI scan of the
           brain. A subset will undergo 18F-Flutemetamol PET. We will include patients over a
           period of three years.

           1.2 Follow-up of MCI patients

           Thereafter, we follow patients for at least 4 and for a maximum of 6 years with
           repeated testing and clinical evaluation. During clinical follow-up we estimate how
           many of the patients develop any type of dementia, for instance AD. Moreover we also
           estimate how aggressive the progression of the disease is in those patients that
           develop AD with the help of repeated cognitive testing.

        2. Baseline investigations of healthy elderly volunteers

           To answer the question if new biomarkers could detect early signs of AD in healthy
           people, we have included 200 elderly volunteer subjects. These people are recruited
           from a population-based study in Malmö (&quot;Malmö Kost Cancer&quot;) where people without
           memory problems or cognitive difficulties, and who performs well on cognitive tests,
           are offered to participate. These individuals will undergo the same baseline studies
           that MCI patients (see above), including cognitive tests, psychiatric assessment,
           lumbar puncture, blood tests and MRI scan. A subset is also examined with
           18F-Flutemetamol PET.

           2.1 Follow-up of elderly volunteers

           This population will also be followed-up for 4-6 years with repeated cognitive tests to
           determine which subjects develop cognitive impairment (e.g. memory problems) over this
           period of time.

        3. Analyses of CSF and plasma/blood

           CSF and plasma/blood sampling is done at baseline, 2 and 4 years of follow-up. To find
           novel and better biomarkers to predict AD in both healthy and MCI patients, the CSF,
           plasma and blood will be analyzed by various biomedical techniques. We will also screen
           for biomarkers that can help us to predict how fast the disease will progress. We will
           use two different approaches, namely: a) analysis of various candidate biomarkers and
           b) unbiased screening using proteomics.

        4. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) MRI is done at baseline, 2 and 4 years of follow-up,
           using the same MRI scanner. We will evaluate the potential benefits of new MRI
           protocols for prediction of future AD. MRI will also be used to study the pathogenesis
           of AD. These new approaches include: 3D-MP RAGE, T2* GRE, DTI/DTT, ASL and MRS.
