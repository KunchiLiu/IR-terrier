  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Overall rationale: Prophylactic NAC irradiation after nipple-areola sparing mastectomy and
      immediate reconstruction for patient with ductal carcinoma in-situ or invasive breast cancer
      will allow better cosmesis and patient's satisfaction.

      Study design: Phase I trial assessing the safety, feasibility and toxicity of prophylactic
      NAC irradiation after nipple-areola sparing mastectomy and immediate reconstruction in
      patients with ductal carcinoma in-situ or invasive breast cancer.

      Primary objective: To determine the recommended phase I dose of post-operative prophylactic
      NAC irradiation.

      Secondary objectives: To provide extensive descriptive data regarding NAC-sparing surgery
      with reconstruction, including both surgeon experience and patient evaluation of cosmetic
      results. Survival and recurrence will be assessed.

      Study size: Between 12 and 18 patients will be enrolled in this phase I study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  The use of NAC-sparing mastectomy followed by postoperative NAC (nipple-areola complex)
           external beam radiotherapy for selected patient with early stage invasive or in-situ
           breast cancers will be technically feasible and with acceptable complication rates.

        -  The cosmetic results after NAC-sparing mastectomy followed by postoperative external
           beam radiotherapy to the NAC will be better comparable with Skin Sparing Mastectomy.

        -  The local control rate in the NAC will be more than expected for a NAC sparing
           mastectomy without postoperative radiotherapy.

        -  The patient's satisfaction after NAC-sparing mastectomy followed by postoperative NAC
           external beam radiotherapy will be better than after Skin Sparing Mastectomy.

    <description>The recommended phase II dose will be the highest irradiation dose level at which &lt;= 1 out of 6 study patients experiences dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). This dose will be the phase dose II of post-operative prophylactic NAC irradiation after NAC-sparing mastectomy with reconstruction in patients with ductal carcinoma in-situ or invasive breast cancer.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 5 Years</time_frame>
    <description>Surgery success rate, defined as the proportion of patients who had successful NAC sparing surgery with reconstruction divided by the total number of study patients, will be determined.
Cosmetic results will be assessed by both the physician(s) and the patients at 3, 6 and 12 months, using a 4-category ordinal scale (excellent, good, fair, and poor).</description>
