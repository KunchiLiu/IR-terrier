      The purpose of this center grant is to translate basic behavioral science on habituation
      theory into clinical intervention using a vertical hierarchical approach from laboratory
      studies to field studies to the clinical intervention to improve weight loss outcomes in
      pediatric obesity treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Habituation is one factor that may be related to excess energy intake. Research has shown
      that the rate of habituation is inversely related to the amount of food consumed and slower
      habituation may be a factor that is relevant to obesity, as overweight youth and adults
      habituate slower and consume more energy than their peers. Habituation is a basic form of
      learning that is observed in many response systems. We believe that habituation is an
      important process that mediates food regulation during a meal and across meals. However,
      there has been no research in children that translates basic research on habituation to food
      into clinical interventions for pediatric obesity. In the first phase, we will implement a
      series of laboratory studies to assess the effects of stimulus specificity and variety and
      the simultaneous reduction of variety for high energy density foods on short (within meal)
      and long-term (across meal) habituation. The second phase is designed to implement a series
      of field studies that will extend basic research from the first phase as well as define the
      optimal interval for reducing variety to facilitate long-term habituation to high energy
      density foods in the natural environment. The third phase is designed to develop and pilot
      test a family-based behavioral intervention for children that incorporates findings from
      phase2 into a clinical intervention.
