  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Good bone healing and bone build-up are necessary for the success of dental implants.
      Research in animals and humans has shown that a drug, called Forteo, can increase bone
      build-up and bone strength over time. Forteo has been approved by the Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) for use in patients with a condition where bone is broken down and
      weakened, called osteoporosis. The investigators do not know, however, whether Forteo is
      effective for use in humans for improving bone healing after implant placement, and whether
      it will have the same bone-building and bone-strengthening effects as for patients with
      osteoporosis. This research study is being done to learn what effect 7 weeks of treatment
      with Forteo will have on bone build-up and strengthening of bone for patients receiving
      implants.

      A single center, placebo-controlled, double blind parallel study of teriparatide use in
      patients requiring dental implant therapy is planned. Subjects who qualify based on the
      inclusion/exclusion criteria will be randomly placed into one of two treatment groups,
      teriparatide (20 Î¼g/day) or placebo control. Both patients and investigators will be
      blinded. Serum and gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) samples, radiographs, and a
      tetracycline-labelled bone core will constitute the main data gathered for analysis. After
      implant surgery, patients will return at 2 weeks for post-operative care and then at 14
      weeks for an implant impression and again at 16 weeks to receive the final restoration.
      Twelve months after implant placement, patients will be seen for a follow-up exam and
      standardized radiograph to ensure proper healing.
