    <textblock>
      This randomized phase III trial studies how well combination chemotherapy plus bevacizumab
      with or without oxaliplatin works in treating older patients with colorectal cancer that has
      spread to other places in the body. Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to
      stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from
      dividing. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more tumor cells.
      Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, may block tumor growth in different ways by
      targeting certain cells. Bevacizumab may also stop the growth of cancer by blocking blood
      flow to the tumor. It is not yet known whether combination chemotherapy plus bevacizumab is
      more effective with or without oxaliplatin in treating colorectal cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the progression-free survival (PFS) of elderly patients with metastatic
      colorectal carcinoma who are randomized to receive fluoropyrimidine (fluorouracil)-based
      therapy plus bevacizumab, with or without oxaliplatin.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. In a prospectively planned pooled analysis with a similar trial to be conducted by the
      Japanese Clinical Oncology Group (JCOG), evaluate and compare the overall survival (OS) of
      elderly patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma who are randomized to receive
      fluoropyrimidine-based therapy plus bevacizumab, with or without oxaliplatin.

      II. To assess and compare response rates and adverse events of elderly patients with
      metastatic colorectal carcinoma randomized to receive fluoropyrimidine-based therapy plus
      bevacizumab, with or without oxaliplatin.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM A: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups based on physician decision for
      fluoropyrimidine.

      ARM A1: Patients receive fluorouracil intravenously (IV) over 46-48 hours, leucovorin
      calcium IV over 2 hours, and bevacizumab IV over 10-90 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat
      every 14 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM A2: Patients receive capecitabine orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-14 and
      bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM B: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups based on physician decision for
      fluoropyrimidine.

      Arm B1: Patients receive mFOLFOX7 comprising oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours, leucovorin calcium
      IV over 2 hours, and fluorouracil IV over 46-48 hours on day 1. Patients also receive
      bevacizumab IV over 10-90 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 14 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Arm B2: Patients receive XELOX comprising oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on day 1 and
      capecitabine PO BID on days 1-14. Patients also receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on
      day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for 5 years.
