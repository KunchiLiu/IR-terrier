  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the safety, tolerability, and effectiveness of changing the
      order of receiving radiation therapy for treating brain cancer. The investigators hope that
      changing the sequence of radiation therapy will lower the risk of cancer spreading
      throughout your spinal fluid, which covers your brain and spinal cord.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All subjects must have history of histologically confirmed malignancy. Brain biopsy
             is not required unless diagnosis is judged to be in doubt by the treating physician.

          -  Newly diagnosed brain metastases (four or fewer by post-contrast MRI obtained within
             six weeks of study entry)

          -  At least one brain metastasis (index tumor) must be within 2-6 cm in maximum diameter
             and deemed appropriate for surgical resection by the treating neurosurgeon.

          -  Karnofsky performance status (KPS) of greater than or equal to 60 (Appendix B)

          -  Age greater than 19

          -  Life expectancy greater than 12 weeks

          -  Subjects given written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with small cell lung cancer and lymphoma are ineligible.

          -  More than four metastases by baseline post-contrast MRI

          -  Prior whole brain radiation therapy

          -  Insufficient recovery from all active toxicities of prior therapies

          -  Subjects who are deemed to be poor surgical risks by the treating neurosurgeon
             because of medical comorbidities

          -  Pregnant or nursing women

          -  Women of childbearing potential who are not using an effective method of
             contraception are excluded. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative
             urine or serum pregnancy test within 24 hours prior to administration of SRS.
