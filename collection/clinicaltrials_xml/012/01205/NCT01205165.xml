  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Objective(s) The primary study objective is to assess the antiviral effect of 12 weeks of
      adefovir dipivoxil treatment in Korean patients with chronic hepatitis B and compensated
      liver disease. The secondary study objectives are to assess the antiviral effect, clinical
      benefit and safety of 52 weeks of adefovir dipivoxil treatment.

      Endpoint(s) The primary efficacy endpoint is &quot;Mean log10 reduction in serum HBV DNA level
      from baseline to Week 12&quot;.

      The secondary efficacy endpoints include (a) the proportion of patients achieving serum ALT
      normalization at Week 52, (b) other assessments of antiviral effects (the proportion of
      patients achieving HBV DNA no less than 300 copies per mL at Week 52), (c)HBeAg loss, HBeAg
      seroconversion, HBsAg loss and HBsAg seroconversion, (d)the proportion of patients achieving
      serum ALT normalization at Week 12.

      Study Design This is an open label, multi centre phase IV study for Korean patients with
      chronic hepatitis B and compensated liver disease, assessing the antiviral effect of 12
      weeks treatment of Adefovir dipivoxil as a primary objective and antiviral effect, clinical
      benefit and safety of 52 weeks treatment as secondary objectives.

      Patients will be screened for eligibility criteria and the baseline visit for the treatment
      initiation should occur no more than 4 weeks after screening. Total treatment period will be
      52 weeks and patients will return to the clinic for assessments as scheduled during
      treatment period. After the 52 week study period, it is likely that the patient will benefit
      from continued treatment with commercial adefovir. If in the investigator's clinical
      judgement this is the case, the investigator should ensure that a routine prescription is
      available in a timely manner, and that no unnecessary interruption in treatment occurs.

      Study Population A minimum of 100 male or female Korean patients more than 18 years of age
      with HBeAg positive chronic hepatitis B and compensated liver disease who meet the
      eligibility criteria will be enrolled.

      Study Assessments and Procedures

      Potential patients will be screened prior to study entry and eligible patients who have
      given their consent will have further baseline assessments. Following the screening, the
      first doses of study medications will be given at baseline and patients will return to the
      clinic for assessment as scheduled during treatment period. Patients who discontinue
      treatment prematurely will be followed up every 4 weeks for 12 weeks following the
      withdrawal visit. The following key assessment and or measurement will be made at one or
      more visits during the study. (See section 14.1 Appendix 1. Time and event schedule):

        -  Pregnancy test (females of child-bearing potential only)

        -  Haematology and serum chemistry profile including prothrombin time(PT) and AFP

        -  HBV DNA (Roche COBAS AMPLICOR HBV MONITOR Test, LLOD 300 copies per ml)

        -  Hepatitis B markers: HBeAg(Anti HBe will be tested if HBeAg is negative), HBsAg(Anti
           HBs will be tested if HBsAg is negative) Investigational Product(s) Adefovir dipivoxil
           10mg tablets will be supplied by GlaxoSmithKline and presented as a white to off white,
           round tablets, packaged in the bottle containing 30 tablets
