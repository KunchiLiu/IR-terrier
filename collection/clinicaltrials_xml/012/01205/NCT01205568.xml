  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of transcatheter
      Cutting Balloon therapy for branch pulmonary artery stenosis resistant to low pressure
      dilation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study will be a prospective, multi-center, randomized, blinded trial comparing
      2 treatments for pulmonary artery stenosis. Specifically, vessels that fail to respond to
      balloon inflation at 8 ATM will be individually randomized to 1 of 2 treatment pathways. In
      the first treatment pathway, the vessel is dilated using a CB, followed by additional low
      pressure balloon dilation (&lt; 8ATM). In the second pathway,the vessel is dilated with high
      pressure balloon angioplasty, with balloon inflation pressures exceeding 15 ATM. Cross-over
      therapy will be permitted for failed high pressure treatment starting with enrollment of
      patient #15. The primary outcome assessment for efficacy will be a comparison of percent
      change in minimum lumen diameter before and after randomized therapy, as determined by a
      core laboratory blinded to pathway assignment. The primary outcome assessment for safety
      will be a comparison of the proportion of vessel dilations resulting in any serious adverse
      events, as determined by the Data and Safety Monitoring Board. Patient-level safety
      endpoints will also be tabulated. Patients can have multiple vessels enrolled; analytical
      techniques will adjust for potential intra-patient correlation.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patient Inclusion Criteria (Determined Prior to Cardiac Catheterization)

        a. At least 1 branch pulmonary artery stenosis referred for planned catheterization for PA
        dilation b. At least one of the following: i.greater than one half systemic right
        ventricular pressure ii. regional decrease in pulmonary blood flow by lung scan iii.
        elevated pulmonary artery pressures (&gt; 20 mmHg MPAP) iv. cyanosis at least in part due to
        PA stenosis c. Informed consent of patient and/or parent/guardian; assent of mature minors
        d. Agreement to participate in protocol, including follow-up testing

        Vessel Inclusion Criteria (Determined During Cardiac Catheterization)

          1. Native pulmonary artery or branch which fails balloon dilation up to 8 ATM; as
             defined by failure to eliminate a waist

          2. Native pulmonary artery or branch with a balloon waist diameter less than 7.5 mm
             (i.e.,0.5 mm less than the largest available CB) with dilation at 8 ATM

          3. All eligible vessels that are dilated during the catheterization must be enrolled as
             study vessels; &quot;off-study&quot; use of Cutting Balloons or high pressure dilations in
             eligible vessels is not allowed.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        3. Patient Exclusion Criteria (Determined Prior to Cardiac Catheterization)

          1. Prior pulmonary artery angioplasty or surgery on the vessel within the previous 6
             weeks

          2. Pregnancy

        Vessel Exclusion Criteria (Determined During Cardiac Catheterization)

          1. Vessel with an aneurysm from a prior dilation or surgery, defined as a local
             enlargement of the vessel greater than 100% of the lumen diameter both proximally and
             distally to the aneurysm. The maximum aneurysm diameter and vessel lumen diameter
             proximal and distal to the aneurysm will be recorded. The location of the aneurysm
             relative to the angioplasty site will be determined and reported as proximal, distal,
             or in the region of waist formation.

          2. Prior stent placement associated with the obstruction

        i. balloon inflation for the purpose of expanding the diameter of the stent along its
        length with no residual waist proximal or distal to the stent edges ii. balloon inflation
        resulting in waist formation within the edges of a stent iii. dilation of a vessel through
        the cells of a stent c. Unifocalized nor non-unifocalized systemic to pulmonary artery
        collaterals. d. A vessel requiring therapy at a site not amenable to delivery or safe
        positioning of a Cutting Balloon device due to unfavorable anatomy as determined by the
        physician and based on as assessment of vessel angles, size, length, and proximity to
        other vessels.
