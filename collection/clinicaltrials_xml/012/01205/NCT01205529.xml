    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to look for a similarity in people's genes that may help
      understand which people could benefit from certain drugs for the treatment of atrial
      fibrillation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Current drug therapies to suppress AF are incompletely and unpredictably effective and carry
      significant (albeit generally small) risks of serious adverse effects, including
      drug-induced long QT syndrome (diLQTS), other forms of proarrhythmia, increased mortality
      through uncertain mechanisms, and extracardiac toxicity. Identification of clinical and
      genetic subtypes of AF will permit stratification of therapeutic approaches and thereby
      facilitate the practice of personalized medicine. Furthermore, limited success of drug
      therapy and increase in drug toxicity in AF is probably because the arrhythmia represents a
      final common pathway of multiple initiating mechanisms, including those some that are
      genetically-defined.

      Identifying specific intermediate phenotypes (&quot;endophenotypes&quot;) associated with defined
      clinical courses in AF represents a potential method to systematically subtype patients by
      underlying mechanism and represents a much-needed clinical advance. Clinical endophenotypes
      that have been studied include atrial fibrillatory rate, prolonged signal-averaged P-wave
      duration, and biomarker profiles. The endophenotype we will study here is right precordial
      ST segment elevation, seen not only in Brugada syndrome (BrS) (where it is unmasked by
      sodium channel blocking drugs) but also commonly in lone AF and in patients with
      AF-associated rare variants in genes encoding the cardiac sodium channel α- or β-subunits.
      Taken together these data suggest the hypothesis to be tested in this study, that variants
      in multiple genes can culminate in a similar AF-prone substrate by reducing sodium current
      that can be identified by screening for baseline or manifest right precordial ST segment
      elevation endophenotype after sodium channel block with intravenous procainamide.
