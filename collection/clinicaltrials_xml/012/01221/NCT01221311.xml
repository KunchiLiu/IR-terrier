  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current standard of care for benign bile duct strictures involves placement of multiple
      plastic stents under endoscopic and fluoroscopic guidance to progressively dilate or stretch
      it open. This approach necessitates multiple procedures which may extend over one year
      before the stricture is adequately dilated. The investigators propose a study comparing the
      standard approach of plastic stenting with the use of newer, fully coated metallic stents
      which are self-expandable, thereby permitting successful dilation of benign bile duct
      strictures with fewer procedures.

  <detailed_description>

      Randomization, as detailed below, is stratified by etiology of the stricture: chronic
      pancreatitis and postoperative (such as post-liver transplant).

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Early Clinical Success</measure>
    <time_frame>Post-stent removal (up to one year after enrollment)</time_frame>
    <description>Early clinical success will be defined as fluoroscopic resolution at the time all stent(s) are removed. If there is a persistent stricture after 12 months of stent therapy in either group, the patient will be classified as a clinical failure. We will compare early clinical success rates in each group.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Technical success</measure>
    <time_frame>After each procedure, procedures are performed every 3 months for up to one year</time_frame>
    <description>Technical success will be defined as the completion of the initial and each follow-up ERCP, including stent deployment and removal. Cases where stents cannot be deployed or removed via endoscopy will be considered technical failures. We will compare technical success rates in each group.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Late clinical success</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to two years after enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>Late clinical success will be defined as fluoroscopic resolution at the time of final stent(s) withdrawal as well as the absence of objective findings of stricture recurrence during the one year, post-stenting follow-up period.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cost analysis</measure>
    <time_frame>One year post-stent removal (up to two years after enrollment)</time_frame>
    <description>For patients at the coordinating center, costs will be measured from multiple sources. The primary source of direct costs associated with cSEMS and PS is from the billing department of the local health system, which has agreed to provide us with the paid charges for our enrolled patients for two years from the first ERCP. We will include all care directly related to the stricture, including inpatient hospitalizations for the management of complications.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Complication rates</measure>
    <time_frame>Throughout study period (up to two years after enrollment)</time_frame>
    <description>Complication rates will be assessed by the number of procedure-related complications, including post-ERCP pancreatitis, bowel perforation, gastrointestinal bleeding, stent-associated stricture/change (see below) and stent migration. In addition, the endoscopic removability of the cSEMS will be recorded. Complications will be classified as major or minor. A major complication will be defined as any procedure-related complication that requires procedural intervention or hospitalization for &gt; 5 days. All other complications will be classified as minor.</description>

    <measure>Stent-associated ductal changes</measure>
    <time_frame>Post-stenting (up to one year after enrollment)</time_frame>
    <description>Physicians with extensive experience in ERCP will review completion cholangiograms that are obtained at the time of final stent withdrawal.</description>

    <description>Among patients randomized to the covered, self-expandable metallic stent (cSEMS) group, the endoscopist will deploy a cSEMS of sufficient length to traverse the papilla. Dilation will not be performed unless the cSEMS deployment catheter cannot be advanced over a guidewire beyond the stricture. A biliary sphincterotomy may be performed at the discretion of the treating endoscopist.</description>

    <description>Patients randomized to the plastic stent (PS) group will be treated using a standard algorithm. Specifically, the stricture will be dilated using a passage dilator and/or dilation balloon catheter, and multiple (as many as technically feasible) PS will be deployed depending on the baseline characteristics of the stricture as well as the diameter of the proximal and distal bile duct (standard of care). The endoscopist will sequentially dilate and upsize the cumulative stent diameter on ensuing endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), until the stricture has been obliterated using clinical and fluoroscopic criteria (details below).</description>
