  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine whether the investigational drug GM602,
      is effective and safe in the treatment of ischemic stroke (strokes caused by a blood clot
      blocking the flow of blood through one, or more of the blood vessels supplying the brain)
      when administered up to 18 hours after symptoms begin.
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is a serious and life threatening disease. About 85% of all strokes are ischemic,
      caused by a blood clot or plaque that blocks a blood vessel in the brain. The thrombolytic
      drug tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is the only early treatment for acute ischemic
      stroke approved by the FDA. Treatment with tPA must be administered within three hours of
      the stroke onset. Furthermore, tPA treatment carries a recognized risk of bleeding in the
      brain. GM602 is an investigational drug that may act as a neuroprotectant in patients who
      have had a stroke. It is thought to stop cell death and reduce inflammation in the injured
      area of the brain. This study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of GM602
      administered intravenously to patients in three consecutive daily doses of 320 mg/dose or
      480 mg/dose, the initial dose administered within 18 hours after onset of acute ischemic
      stroke in the Middle Cerebral artery region.

    <description>The Modified Rankin Scale is the most commonly used global scale. It is a simple overall measure of independence that allows comparisons between patients with different kinds of neurologic deficits, and it also helps to evaluate recovery.The best possible score is 0; the worst is 5.
