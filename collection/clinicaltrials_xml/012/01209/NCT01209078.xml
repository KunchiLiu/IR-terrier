    <textblock>
      This is a phase IIa, multicenter, randomized, parallel group, double-blind, double dummy
      study to assess the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of GSK1322322 when given as 1500mg
      twice daily over a 10-day period versus linezolid (600mg twice daily for 10 days) in adults
      with suspected Gram positive Acute Bacterial Skin and Skin Structure Infection who are not
      currently receiving antibacterial therapy. Subjects will be randomized (2:1) to GSK1322322
      or linezolid. This study consists of a screening visit, a 10-day treatment period, and
      follow-up evaluations 7 and 28 days following the last dose.
