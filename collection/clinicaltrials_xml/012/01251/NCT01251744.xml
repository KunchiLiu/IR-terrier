    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate maternal virological and immunological parameters to
      determine their ability to predict congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. When a
      pregnant woman is infected with CMV, her immune system (which protects her from infection)
      is activated and the virus can be found in the woman's bodily fluids (blood, saliva, urine,
      vaginal secretions). The aim of this study is to find out if there is a link between either
      the pregnant woman's immune response or the presence of the virus in these bodily fluids and
      the child/foetus being infected with the virus.
