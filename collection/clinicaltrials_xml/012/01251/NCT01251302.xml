    <textblock>
      To investigate whether the use of a gene expression score blood assay changes the diagnostic
      testing pattern in patients referred to a cardiologist for the evaluation of chest pain or
      anginal equivalent symptoms.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A prospective cohort of 88 subjects receiving the gene expression score assay were compared
      to a retrospective cohort of 83 subjects that did not receive the assay.
