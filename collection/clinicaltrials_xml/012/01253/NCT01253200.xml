  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the BLOCk-CTI study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the
      Blazer® Open-Irrigated Ablation Catheter for the treatment of sustained or recurrent type 1
      atrial flutter. This study will compare outcomes in patients treated with the Blazer®
      Open-Irrigated Ablation Catheter to outcomes in patients treated with open-irrigated
      radiofrequency ablation catheters that have received FDA market approval for the treatment
      of type 1 atrial flutter.

      The BLOCk-CTI study is a prospective, multicenter, single blind, 1:1 randomized study. The
      study is designed to demonstrate that the safety and effectiveness of the Blazer®
      Open-Irrigated Ablation Catheter are non-inferior to the safety and effectiveness of the
      control catheters. In this study, the control catheters are open-irrigated radiofrequency
      ablation catheters that have received FDA market approval for the treatment of type 1 atrial
      flutter.

    <description>A procedure-related complication is defined as an adverse event that results in death, a life-threatening complication, or a persistent or significant disability/incapacity or required intervention to prevent a permanent impairment of a body function or damage to a body structure. All adverse events related to the investigational or control devices or ablation procedure will be considered procedure-related events.</description>

    <measure>Acute success rate</measure>
    <time_frame>30 minutes after the last radiofrequency application in the cavo-tricuspid isthmus</time_frame>
    <description>Acute success is defined as demonstration of bidirectional cavo-tricuspid isthmus block (ie, lack of electrophysiological conduction through the isthmus) 30 minutes after the last radiofrequency application in the cavo-tricuspid isthmus with the investigational or control catheter only.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  At least 1 documented episode of type 1 atrial flutter in the 180 days (6 months)
             preceding enrollment documented by 12-lead ECG, Holter monitor, rhythm strip, or
             transtelephonic monitor

          -  Patients are clinically indicated for catheter ablation

          -  Patients receiving oral anti-arrhythmic drug therapy (class I or class III) for a
             tachyarrhythmia other than type 1 atrial flutter must be controlled on the
             anti-arrhythmic drug for a minimum of 30 days prior to enrollment. If type 1 atrial
             flutter was documented prior to the development of other tachyarrhythmias, this
             30-day period is not required.

          -  Age 18 or above, or of legal age to give informed consent specific to state and
             national law

          -  Any prior right atrial cavo-tricuspid isthmus ablation or any cardiac ablation for
             non-atrial flutter arrhythmias within 90 days prior to enrollment

          -  Cardiac surgery within 90 days prior to enrollment

          -  Documented atrial or ventricular tumors, clots, thrombus, or have a known clotting
             disorder within 90 days prior to enrollment

          -  Implantation of permanent leads of an implantable device in or through the right
             atrium within 90 days prior to enrollment

             regurgitation, tricuspid valve stenosis, tricuspid valve replacement, Ebstein's
             anomaly, or other congenital heart disease) that would preclude catheter introduction
             and placement, as determined by the Investigator

          -  Any cerebral ischemic event (including transient ischemic attacks) within 180 days
             prior to enrollment

          -  Creatinine greater than 2.5 mg/dl or creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min within

          -  Any other significant uncontrolled or unstable medical condition (e.g. sepsis, acute
             metabolic illness)

          -  Enrolled in any concurrent study without BSC written approval

          -  Women who are pregnant or plan to become pregnant within the course of their
