    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine effective methods of preventing the transmission of
      HIV from mother to child during pregnancy, labor, and delivery. This is one part of the
      three-part PROMISE study. This study will be conducted at resource-limited locations in
      Africa and other parts of the world where women typically receive a short course of highly
      active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) during pregnancy and where formula feeding (FF) is
      standard.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of mother-to-child transmission of HIV has decreased in recent years in the
      United States, Europe, and other resource-advantaged countries. Several factors have
      contributed to this decrease, including the administration of HAART during pregnancy,
      caesarean section delivery methods, and the use of formula instead of breastfeeding to feed
      infants. However, these improvements have mostly been seen in the United States, Europe, and
      other resource-advantaged areas. In resource-limited countries, barriers to the
      implementation of effective interventions for the prevention of mother-to-child transmission
      (PMTCT) still remain.

      The PROMISE study is evaluating effective methods of preventing the transmission of HIV from
      a mother to her baby during pregnancy, labor and delivery, and breastfeeding. This version
      of the PROMISE study will be conducted at research sites in Africa and other parts of the
      world where formula feeding is standard.

      This study is divided into two parts:

        1. Antepartum Component:

           This part of the study will compare the safety and effectiveness of different HAART
           regimens at preventing the transmission of HIV during pregnancy, labor, and delivery.

           Pregnant HIV-infected women will be randomly assigned to one of the following three
           groups:

           Arm A: Participants will receive zidovudine (ZDV) + single dose nevirapine (sdNVP) +
           emtricitabine-tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (Truvada [TRV]) tail. Participants will
           receive ZDV from 14 weeks gestation through delivery, sdNVP and TRV at onset of labor,
           and TRV postpartum for 7 days or through the Week 1 visit (6-14 days postpartum),
           whichever is later.

           Arm B: Participants will receive lamivudine (3TC)-zidovudine (ZDV) + lopinavir
           (LPV)-ritonavir (RTV). Participants will receive the triple antiretroviral (ARV) study
           drug regimen from 14 weeks gestation through the Week 1 visit (6-14 days postpartum).

           Arm C: Participants will receive TRV/LPV-RTV. Participants will receive the triple ARV
           study drug regimen from 14 weeks gestation through the Week 1 visit (6-14 days
           postpartum).

           Fixed-dose FTC-TDF-RPV (Complera) may be used as an alternative first-line regimen for
           mothers who are not able to tolerate or adhere to LPV-RTV or ATV-RTV. The FTC-TDF-RPV
           regimen is not defined in the protocol and should be determined at the discretion of
           staff at the study sites.

           All infants born to women enrolled in this study will receive NVP once a day through 42
           days of age or until the Week 6 study visit, whichever is later, regardless of which
           study arm their mother is enrolled in. Should women need HAART or to switch HAART
           regimens for their own health, they will be moved into Step 2 or Step 3 of this part of
           the study.

           During pregnancy, participants will attend study visits at study entry, 2 and 4 weeks
           after entry, and then every 4 weeks until labor and delivery. Women and infants will be
           monitored during labor and delivery and will attend a study visit 6 to 14 days after
           delivery. Follow-up visits will occur at Weeks 1, 6, and 14. Thereafter, they will be
           once a month for infants and every 3 months for women. Study visits may include a
           medical history review, questionnaires, interviews, physical exam, and blood
           collection.

        2. Maternal Health Component:

      This part of the study will examine if women who received a triple ARV regimen during
      pregnancy have better health outcomes than women who discontinue a triple ARV regimen.

      Participants will include women who were receiving the triple ARV regimen in the Antepartum
      Component.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two study arms:

      Arm A: Participants will continue to receive the triple ARV regimen (TRV and LPV-RTV).

      Arm B: Participants will discontinue the triple ARV regimen.

      Study visits will occur at Weeks 4 and 12, then every 3 months thereafter. Women who are
      infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) will have an additional visit at Week 8. Study visits
      may include a medical history review, questionnaires, physical exam, and blood collection.
      Should women need a triple ARV regimen or to switch triple ARV regimens for their own
      health, they will be moved into Step 2 or Step 3 of this part of the study.

      The total duration of the two study components is 5 years. Women will remain in the study
      for follow-up for 2 to 5 years, depending on when they enroll. Infants will remain in the
      study through 74 to 104 weeks of age. Follow-up for all women and infants will be completed
      by the end of September 2016.

      <textblock>
        Antepartum Component Inclusion Criteria (Step 1):

          -  Confirmed HIV-1 infection, documented by the results of testing performed on two
             separate specimens at any time prior to study entry. More information on this
             criterion can be found in the protocol.

          -  Currently pregnant and at greater than 14 weeks gestation based on clinical or other
             obstetrical measurements

          -  CD4 count greater than or equal 350 cells/mm^3 or greater than or equal to the
             country-specific threshold for initiation of treatment, if that threshold is greater
             than 350 cells/mm^3 on a specimen obtained within 30 days prior to study entry

          -  Results of HBV screening (hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg] testing) available from
             specimen obtained within 30 days prior to entry

          -  Certain laboratory values from a specimen obtained within 30 days prior to study
             entry. More information on this criterion can be found in the protocol.

          -  Plans to deliver in the study-affiliated clinic or hospital

          -  Has no plans to move outside of the study site area during the 24 months following

        Antepartum Component Exclusion Criteria (Step 1):

          -  Participation in PROMISE for a prior pregnancy

          -  Ingestion of any ARV regimen with three or more drugs (regardless of duration) or
             more than 30 days of a single or dual ARV regimen during current pregnancy, according
             to self report or available medical records

             350 cells/mm^3 or clinical indications); however, could have received prior ARVs for
             the sole purpose of PMTCT in previous pregnancies; prior PMTCT regimens could have
             included a triple-ARV regimen, ZDV, 3TC-ZDV, and/or single-dose NVP for PMTCT as well
             as use of a short dual-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) &quot;tail&quot; to
             reduce risk of NVP resistance
