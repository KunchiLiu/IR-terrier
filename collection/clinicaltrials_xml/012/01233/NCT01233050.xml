  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgical site infections (SSI) are one of the most common complications in the
      post-operative patient, and the second most common health care associated infection overall.
      It is estimated that there are between 500 thousand and 1.1 million surgical site infections
      in the United States each year. Given the magnitude of the problem, prevention of surgical
      site infections is a major goal of peri-operative care. However, skin preparation prior to
      surgery has not been as rigorously examined. The primary objective of this study is to
      compare the efficacy of two FDA approved, popular peri-operative skin preparations 2%
      chlorhexidine gluconate / 70% isopropyl alcohol to Iodine Povacrylex [0.7% available Iodine]
      / 74% Isopropyl Alcohol in the prevention of superficial surgical site infection. Male and
      female patients, age 18 years and older undergoing elective colorectal surgical procedures
      involving a laparotomy will be enrolled. These patients are at high risk of SSI. Eligible
      patients will be assessed at regular intervals for SSI and characterization of bacterial
      pathogen(s) in patients with SSI. Patients will remain enrolled into the study until 35 days
      postoperatively.
