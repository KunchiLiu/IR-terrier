  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      All people who have a heart transplant are at risk for developing cardiac allograft
      vasculopathy (CAV). CAV means narrowing of the heart transplant vessels, which is associated
      with poor heart transplant function. People who develop antibodies after transplant have a
      higher risk of developing CAV. Infections, high cholesterol, and rejection also increase the
      risk of developing CAV. People who develop CAV usually have to receive another transplant.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to see if a study drug called rituximab (Rituxan®)
      prevents CAV. Rituximab destroys certain types of white blood cells called B cells. B cells
      are important cells in the immune system that help the body fight infection by producing
      substances called antibodies. B cells and the antibodies they produce are also involved in
      some kinds of rejection after organ transplantation. Rituximab decreases the number of B
      cells in the blood and other tissues. The goal of this study is to determine if decreasing B
      cells with Rituximab can prevent injury to the transplanted heart.
