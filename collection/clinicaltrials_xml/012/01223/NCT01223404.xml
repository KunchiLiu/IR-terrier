  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many disorders where attentional problems are a hallmark, such as Alzheimer's disease and
      schizophrenia, display abnormal regulation of the so-called default network of resting brain
      function that maintains internally directed thought when the mind is free to wander. These
      regions can be overactive or less readily deactivated with attention-demanding tasks, and
      excess activity is thought to impair performance. There is indication that nicotine may
      improve attention by aiding the deactivation of the default network, and this mechanism may
      be of therapeutic benefit for the above disease states. The current project aims at
      providing a proof of concept by demonstrating that nicotinic drugs modulate default network
      function. The nicotinic agonist nicotine is hypothesized to improve attention by
      facilitating the down-regulation of default network activity, and the nicotinic antagonist
      mecamylamine is hypothesized to impair attention by impeding the down-regulation of default
      network activity during attentional task performance.
