  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A steroid (triamcinolone) 40 mg will be compared to placebo in a randomized
      placebo-controlled clinical trial testing the effect of this steroid versus placebo given
      into the study knee joint that has osteoarthritis (OA). The knee injection will be given
      once every 12 weeks over two years for a total of eight knee injections. How well each
      participant tolerates each injection and all the injections over time will be assessed. The
      safety of getting a knee injection every 12 weeks will be assessed by collecting reported
      adverse effects, knee examinations, and clinical laboratory tests. Participants will
      complete questionnaires, X-ray, MRIs, and bone density tests as part of this study.
