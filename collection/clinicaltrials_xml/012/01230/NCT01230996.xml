      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin, work in different ways to stop the
      growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.
      Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Specialized radiation therapy
      that delivers a high dose of radiation directly to the tumor may kill more tumor cells and
      cause less damage to normal tissue. Giving cisplatin together with radiation therapy may
      kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of cisplatin given
      together with radiation therapy in treating patients with locally advanced cervical cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine the feasibility of dose-escalation of chemoradiotherapy comprising
           cisplatin in combination with simultaneous-boost intensity-modulated radiotherapy
           (IMRT) in patients with locally advanced cervical cancer.

      Secondary

        -  To assess the objective response rates in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  To assess the local control of the disease in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  To correlate toxicity with dose-volume histogram data in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, phase I, dose-escalation study followed by a phase II study.

      Patients receive cisplatin IV over 1 hour weekly for up to 5 weeks. Patients also undergo
      intensity-modulated radiotherapy 5 days a week for approximately 6 weeks.

      Patients complete a quality-of-life questionnaire at baseline, during, and after completion
      of study therapy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4 and 12 weeks, every 3
      months for 2 years, and then periodically for 5 years.
