  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Introduction: The Internet holds promise for a wide-scale promotion of dietary and lifestyle
      behavioural change. Website-delivered interventions have a potentially broad population
      reach as it is available 24 hours, and could be hosted by both government and
      non-governmental agencies. To date, there is no published study focused on dietary behaviour
      change in adults with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) via a website-based system.

      Objective: To improve nutrition knowledge, attitude and behaviour (KAB) of the patients with
      T2DM through a 6-month dietary education programme delivered via a website. The secondary
      objectives of this study are to improve the participant's selected anthropometric
      measurements, dietary practices and biomarkers.

      Hypothesis: A 6-month web-based dietary education programme will improve diabetic patients'
      nutrition KAB.

      Methods: This is a two-armed matched-design randomized controlled trial (RCT) scheduled for
      two years in three public hospitals in Klang Valley. It will be carried out with
      quantitative techniques to measure the primary and secondary outcomes. Permission from
      relevant authorities has been obtained for this purpose. The targeted sample size is 100
      subjects, with 50 subjects in each arm. The intervention group will be required to
      participate in a 6-month web-based dietary intervention, while the control group will
      receive the usual care given to diabetic patients. The subjects will then be followed up for
      another 6 months. Data collection will be held at baseline, 6-month and 12-month.

      Expected results: The dietary recommendations are personalised according to the Stages of
      Change (SOC) the patient is in. The improvements in knowledge and attitude, and progress in
      SOC are expected to be reflected in the patients' dietary behaviour. Adoption of healthy
      dietary practices then is expected to be reflected on the anthropometric measurements and
      biomarkers. In the long run, the findings are expected to assist promotion of healthy diet
      and lifestyle to high-risk groups as well as Malaysian public in line with technology
      development. Moreover, the output from this research may serve as recommendation to Ministry
      of Health and other related NGOs on effective dietary intervention strategies for prevention
      of T2DM and complications which arise from the disease in this country.
