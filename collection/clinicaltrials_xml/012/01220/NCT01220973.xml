      RATIONALE: Atorvastatin calcium and celecoxib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking
      some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving atorvastatin calcium together with
      celecoxib may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving atorvastatin calcium together with
      celecoxib works in treating patients with rising PSA levels after local therapy for prostate
      cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine the effect on the biological activity, as assessed by prostate-specific
           antigen (PSA) response, of atorvastatin calcium and celecoxib in patients with D0
           prostate cancer.

      Secondary

        -  To document the safety and feasibility of atorvastatin calcium and celecoxib in
           patients with early-stage prostate cancer.

        -  To evaluate the effects of the combination of atorvastatin calcium and celecoxib on
           nuclear factor-kB (NFkB), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), prostaglandin E2
           (PGE2), and IL6 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC).

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral atorvastatin calcium once daily and oral celecoxib twice daily on days
      1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients may undergo blood sample collection at baseline and after completion of study
      therapy for correlative studies.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS:

          -  Histologically confirmed prostate cancer

               -  Stage D0 disease

                    -  Tumor originally diagnosed as being limited to the prostate and now having
                       a rising prostate-specific antigen (PSA) after definitive local therapy

          -  Must have undergone local treatment via prostatectomy or radiotherapy

               -  PSA values must be ≥ 0.2 ng/mL as determined by 2 measurements, ≥ 1 month apart
                  and ≥ 6 months after prostatectomy

               -  PSA values must be ≥ 2.0 ng/mL as determined by 2 measurements, ≥ 1 month apart
                  and ≥ 6 months after radiotherapy

               -  The first two PSA values along with a third value must all be rising (i.e.,
                  there must be an overall rising trajectory, such that the third value cannot be
                  lower than the first value)

          -  No metastatic disease by baseline bone scan and CT scan of the abdomen and/or pelvis
