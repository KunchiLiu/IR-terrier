    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to help answer if LY2127399 is safe and effective in
      the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in patients with an inadequate response to one or more
      Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF α) inhibitors.

      This study is comprised of 2 periods:

      Period 1 - 24 week blinded treatment

      Period 2 - 48 week post treatment follow up
