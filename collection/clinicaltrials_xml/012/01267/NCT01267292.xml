  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic cocaine use may produce disruption of neurotransmitter functions (including
      dopamine). This may in turn contribute to measurable dysfunction in important cognitive and
      behavioral processes. Stimulants that enhance dopamine (DA) function may help in treating
      cocaine dependence and improving behavioral function -- supporting the notion that these
      processes are related. An important step is to understand the subjective, physiological, and
      behavioral effects of potential medications for cocaine dependence.

      DA-modulating drugs may be targets for pharmacotherapy for substance dependence, and
      particularly for stimulant drugs like cocaine, which disrupt normal DA function. Buspirone
      is currently the only available dopamine subtype 3 (DA3) approved for human administration,
      and is thus a viable investigational compound.

      This project proposes to evaluate the DA-modulating effects of buspirone on behavioral
      deficiencies related to DA depletion. Accordingly, the project aims to characterize the
      effects of buspirone in individuals with cocaine dependence. Employing a daily dosing
      designs within an acute stimulant challenge (methylphenidate), the experiment will
      characterize the subjective effects, cardiovascular effects, and behavioral effects
      (attentional bias to drug cues and risky decision making). The primary hypotheses are that
      buspirone will attenuate the increases in subjective drug effects (&quot;stimulated&quot;, &quot;like
      drug&quot;) and behavioral effects (increases in attentional bias and risky decision making) that
      are produced by acute methylphenidate administration.

      Chronic cocaine use may produce disruption of monoamine systems (including dopamine). This
      may in turn contribute to measurable dysfunction in important cognitive and behavioral
      processes. Pharmacotherapy with stimulants that enhance dopamine (DA) function has shown
      efficacy in treating cocaine dependence and improving behavioral function -- supporting the
      notion that these processes are related. In the development of novel pharmacotherapies for
      cocaine dependence, an important step is a full characterization of the
      psychopharmacological properties of potential medications for cocaine dependence, including
      subjective, physiological, and behavioral effects. Selective medications may play a key role
      in the modulation of DA neurotransmission by enhancing DA receptor activation.

      The D3 receptor is an autoreceptor that may function to control phasic DA activity and
      mediate sensitization of DA agonists, thus playing a role in conditioning of drugs of abuse
      like cocaine. Growing evidence suggests that D3 receptor antagonists may be targets for
      pharmacotherapy for substance dependence, and particularly for stimulant drugs like cocaine,
      which disrupt normal DA function. Importantly, administration of D3 antagonists may disrupt
      reactivity (attention) to drug cues and attenuate cue-induced craving. Buspirone is
      currently the only available D3 antagonist approved for human administration, and is thus a
      viable investigational compound.

      This project proposes to evaluate the potential pharmacotherapeutic action of the D3
      antagonist buspirone. The DA-modulating effects of buspirone may help with affective and
      behavioral deficiencies related to DA depletion. Accordingly, the project aims to
      characterize the psychopharmacology of buspirone in individuals with cocaine dependence.
      Employing chronic dosing designs within an acute stimulant challenge (methylphenidate), the
      experiment will be conducted using well-established psychopharmacological methods in order
      to characterize the shape and magnitude of chronic pretreatment-mediated change in the
      methylphenidate dose-response curve. Measures will include subjective effects,
      cardiovascular effects, and behavioral effects (attentional bias to drug cues and risky
      decision making). These data will compliment and provide valuable information to clinical
      trials using these agents to treat cocaine dependence.

    <measure>Cocaine-Stroop</measure>
    <time_frame>M, W, F @ 11:30 AM over 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The task assesses attentional biases to cocaine-related (drug-related) and rewarding (non-drug related) stimuli vs. neutral stimuli. Participants are instructed to respond to words shown in different colors on the screen, by pressing as quickly and accurately as possible on one of three colored buttons. The primary outcome measure is reaction times (RT), with attentional bias measured as the difference in RTs on cocaine vs. neutral words.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Risky decision making</measure>
    <time_frame>M, W, F @ 11 AM over 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The task provides subjects with three choice options on each of 100 repeated trials. Options are low, moderate, and high risk, based on variance and probability in gain/loss amounts. The low risk option is more adaptive over many trials. The outcome measure is a risk index (ranging from 0.33 to 100) that factors in tolerance for variability and amount of gains and losses across the three options.</description>

    <measure>ARCI</measure>
    <time_frame>M, W, F @ 10 time points, over 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Addiction Research Center Inventory. The ARCI short form [173] will be used. It is a 49-item true / false questionnaire that has been empirically-derived to assess five different factors, including euphoria, sedation, and dysphoria [174]. The PCAG scale has proven to be a sensitive measure of subjective effects in many studies administering stimulant drugs [174, 175]. We have employed it extensively in our laboratory [155, 175].</description>

    <measure>POMS</measure>
    <time_frame>M, W, F @ 10 time points, over 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Profile of Mood States. The POMS is a self-rating measure of current mood [176]. It consists of six subscales: depression, vigor, confusion, tension, anxiety, and fatigue. This instrument has been used in hundreds of studies in both clinical and healthy control populations, and has been demonstrated to be sensitive to a range of acute drug effects, including amphetamine [171], cocaine [38], and caffeine [108, 177]. We will use the 37-item short form of the POMS, which correlates highly with the full scale [178].</description>

    <measure>DEQ</measure>
    <time_frame>M, W, F @ 10 time points, over 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Drug Effects Questionnaire. The DEQ (e.g., [95]) is visual analog scale questionnaire (Drug Effects Questionnaire, or DEQ) that assesses the extent to which subjects experience four subjective states: &quot;Feel Drug&quot;, &quot;Feel High&quot;, &quot;Like Drug&quot;, and &quot;Want More&quot;.</description>

    <measure>VAS</measure>
    <time_frame>M, W, F @ 10 time points, over 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The VAS (e.g., [179]) presents 100-mm horizontal lines labeled with an adjective: &quot;stimulated&quot;, &quot;high&quot;, &quot;anxious&quot;, &quot;elated&quot;, &quot;hungry&quot;, and &quot;nauseated.&quot; The scale is anchored by &quot;not at all&quot; (0) on the left, and &quot;extremely&quot; (100) on the right.</description>
