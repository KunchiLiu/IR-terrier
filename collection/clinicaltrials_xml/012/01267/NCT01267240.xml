    <textblock>
      This partially randomized phase II trial studies giving capecitabine and vorinostat in
      treating patients with head and neck cancer that has come back after previous treatment or
      that has spread to other areas in the body. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as
      capecitabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing
      the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Vorinostat may stop the growth of tumor cells
      by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. It is not yet known whether giving
      capecitabine together with vorinostat is more effective than capecitabine alone in treating
      patients with cancer of the head and neck cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the objective response rate (complete and partial) and duration of response
      of the combination of vorinostat and capecitabine in patients with recurrent and/or
      metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). (SCCHN) II. To determine
      the objective response rate (complete and partial) and duration of response of the
      combination of vorinostat and capecitabine in patients with recurrent and/or metastatic
      nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). (NPC)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of the combination of vorinostat and capecitabine
      in patients with recurrent and/or metastatic SCCHN. (SCCHN) II. To determine the rate of
      progression-free survival (PFS) at 6 months. (SCCHN) III. To determine the rate and duration
      of stable disease (SD). (SCCHN) IV. To determine the median PFS, and the rate of PFS at 1
      year. (SCCHN) V. To determine the median overall survival (OS), and rates of overall
      survival at 6 months and at 1 year. (SCCHN) VI. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of
      the combination of vorinostat and capecitabine in patients with recurrent and/or metastatic
      NPC. (NPC) VII. To determine the duration of objective response. (NPC) VIII. To determine
      the rate and duration of stable disease (SD). (NPC) IX. To determine the median PFS, and the
      rate of PFS at 1 year. (NPC) X. To determine the median overall survival (OS), and rates of
      overall survival at 6 months and at 1 year. (NPC)

      OUTLINE: This is a non-randomized, open-label study of patients with SCCHN and NPC (Stage
      I), followed by a randomized study of patients with NPC (Stage II).

      STAGE I: Patients receive capecitabine orally (PO) twice daily (BID) and vorinostat PO daily
      on days 1-14. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      STAGE II: Patients with NPC are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive capecitabine PO BID and vorinostat PO daily on days 1-14. Courses
      repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive capecitabine PO BID on days 1-14. Courses repeat every 21 days in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients will be followed up at 3-4 weeks and then
      every 6 months for 1 year.
