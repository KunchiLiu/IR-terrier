      The purpose of this study is to determine, whether there is clinical benefit of using
      fdg-PET/CT (F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose- positron emission tomography/computed
      tomography)compared to contrast-enhanced CT in primary treatment of advanced epithelial
      ovarian cancer (EOC)

        -  Objectives

             -  the impact of preoperative PET/CT compared to CT on EOC stage definition

             -  to compare the value of preoperative PET/CT, CT and laparoscopy in intra-abdominal
                tumour assessment. Laparotomy findings evaluated by surgeon and histopathologic
                results serve as the reference standard.

             -  to compare serum markers HE4(human epididymis protein 4) and CA125 (cancer antigen
                125) with FDG-PET/CT and CT in treatment response evaluation during neoadjuvant
                chemotherapy and primary treatment of EOC

        -  Methods

             -  All the patients will undergo FDG-PET/CT prior surgery, after possible neoadjuvant
                chemotherapy (NACT) and 4 weeks after completion of primary platinum-based
                chemotherapy.

             -  CA125 and HE4 levels are measured pre-operatively and with every chemotherapy
                cycle.

    <measure>PET/CT (positron emission tomography/computed tomography)compared with contrast-enhanced CT in preoperative evaluation of disease burden in patients with advanced Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC).</measure>
    <time_frame>PET/CT, contrast-enhanced CT and surgical status and histopathological findings are compared 1 month after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Patient is scanned with whole body Fdg PET/CT and contrast-enhanced CT in a row within 3 weeks preoperatively. Findings are compared with intraoperative surgical status evaluated by operator and confirmed with biopsies.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) response evaluation with PET/CT compared with contrast-enhanced CT after 3 cycles of chemotherapy</measure>
    <time_frame>Outcome measure: after interval debulking surgery, about 4 months</time_frame>
    <description>Fdg PET/CT and a contrast-enhanced CT are performed in a row at the time of diagnosis and repeated after 3 cycles of chemotherapy. Finding are compared with disease status in the interval debulking surgery evaluated by operator and histological specimen.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Serial measurement of HE4 (human epididymis protein 4) and CA125 (cancer antigen 125)during primary treatment of EOC (Epithelial ovarian cancer)</measure>
    <time_frame>From diagnosis until the end of EOC primary therapy, about 8 months</time_frame>
    <description>HE4 and CA125 are measured at the time of diagnosis, perioperatively, and at each chemotherapy cycle (6-9). Treatment outcome is evaluated with contrast-enhanced CT at the end of primary therapy. HE4 and CA125 are compared with each other in different treatment outcomes (complete response, partial response, stable disease and progression)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Response to first line treatment: evaluation with PET/CT</measure>
    <time_frame>PET/CT taken about 4 weeks after the last chemotherapy cycle</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment outcome measured with RECIST 1.1 and GCIC criteria is compared with PET/CT results. The prognostic role of persistent metabolic activity in PET/CT is evaluated.</description>
