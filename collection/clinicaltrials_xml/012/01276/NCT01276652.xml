  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study examines the feasibility of assessing sleep and circadian rhythmicity in
      critically ill patients undergoing mechanical ventilation. Secondarily, it will examine the
      feasibility of reducing subject exposure to environmental light and noise and of delivering
      routine care according to classical day/night routines.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over 1 million patients develop respiratory failure annually in the United States; yet, the
      sleep of patients undergoing mechanical ventilation has received little attention. This
      protocol enrolls acutely ill medical patients undergoing mechanical ventilation. The
      feasibility of assessing sleep and circadian rhythmicity through the use of continuous
      bedside polysomnography and the measurement of core body temperature and urinary hormonal
      levels at frequent intervals will be explored. As a secondary goal, the feasibility of
      delivering routine care according to classical day/night routines, and of employing various
      noise and light reduction strategies at night, will be explored in a subset of subjects.

    <description>This study assesses the feasibility of studying sleep and circadian rhythmicity in acutely ill, mechanically ventilated patients utilizing continuous bedside polysomnography and the collection of urinary samples for 6-sulfatoxymelatonin analysis.</description>

    <measure>Feasibility of strengthening the day/night routine of acutely ill, mechanically ventilated patients.</measure>
    <time_frame>Average 2 weeks (patients followed to hospital discharge)</time_frame>
    <description>A subset of subjects will be randomly assigned to receive routine care according to a classical day/night routine (rather than a 24-hour care cycle) at various points in time. The feasibility of employing additional measures to limit environmental disruption, such as the use of eyeshades and noise reduction strategies, will also be explored.</description>
