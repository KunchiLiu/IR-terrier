  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe skin adverse drug reactions can result in death. Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) has
      the highest mortality (30-35%); Stevens-Johnson syndrome and transitional forms correspond
      to the same syndrome, but with less extensive skin detachment and a lower mortality (5-15%).
      Hypersensitivity syndrome, sometimes called Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic
      Symptoms (DRESS), has a mortality rate evaluated at about 10%. The aims of this project are
      (1) to compare the effect of treatment between systemic steroid and anti-TNF α. Including
      skin re-epithelization time, internal organ recovery time, mortality rate, and (2) to
      investigate the pathogenesis of severe cutaneous adverse reaction.

    <textblock>
      Severe cutaneous adverse drug reactions, including Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN),
      Stevens-Johnson syndrome(SJS), Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms
      (DRESS)is a life threatening disease. There is no gold standard in the therapy of SCAR.
      Treatment with highdose systemic glucocorticoids is controversial. Although there have been
      recent reports of success with various therapies such as plasmapheresis and high-dose
      intravenous immunoglobulins, their efficacy is not yet proven. Assessment of these therapies
      is difficult because of their non-specific immunosuppressant or immunomodulating modes of
      action. Recent studies have shown evidence of the pathogenetic importance of tumour necrosis
      factor (TNF)-a,6 suggesting a new therapeutic approach in selective blockade of TNF-a using
      specific antibodies. We report successful treatment TEN using monoclonal IgG
      anti-TNF-antibodies. The aims of this project are (1) to compare the effect of treatment
      between systemic steroid and anti-TNF α. Including skin re-epithelization time, internal
      organ recovery time, mortality rate. (2) to investigate the pathogenesis of severe cutaneous
      adverse reaction. This is a open-label, prospective, randomized, control study. Total 90
      SCAR patients are collected.

      Including criteria: Patients are diagnosed with SCAR, including SJS, TEN, DRESS. And the age
      of patient are above 18 year-old. Exclusive criteria: pregnancy or breast-feeding women,
      allergy to anti-TNF-α agent before, active tuberculosis, active infection systemic disease,
      active HBV or HCV hepatitis, immunocompromise patient.
