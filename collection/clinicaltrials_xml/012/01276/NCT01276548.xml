        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects who aged 18 years or older

          2. Subjects whose written informed consent was obtained complying with the local
             regulatory requirements prior to their participation in the trial

          3. Subjects who have histologically or cytologically confirmed unresectable or
             metastatic epithelial cancer of the exocrine pancreas. High-quality contrast-enhanced
             CT scanning is required to evaluate resectability. Measurable disease is not
             required.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects who have received prior radiation therapy (XRT) for pancreatic cancer unless
             progression was documented after XRT and 6 weeks have elapsed between completion of
             XRT and start of trial medication.

          2. Subjects who have had systemic treatment such as chemotherapy or immunotherapy, for
             pancreatic cancer. However, prior use of chemotherapy, e.g. 5-FU or capecitabine, for
             radiation sensitization is allowed. If gemcitabine was given in the adjuvant setting,
             only subjects relapsed with cancer after 6 months of completing the last dose of
             gemcitabine can participate in the trial.

          3. Subjects who have had a major surgery within 2 weeks prior to the screening/baseline
             visit
