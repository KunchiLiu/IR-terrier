  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed randomized clinical trial will investigate a novel pharmacotherapy for
      hazardous drinking, HIV-infected men and women, using the 5-HT3 antagonist ondansetron. The
      investigators predict that participants who are treated with active doses of ondansetron
      will reduce their drinking more and show better HIV treatment participation and progress
      compared to participants who are treated with placebo. This study will provide important new
      safety and efficacy results on drinking and HIV outcomes following alcohol pharmacotherapy
      in HIV-infected persons.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hazardous drinking is particularly harmful in HIV-infected persons. It impairs the immune
      system, accelerates HIV disease progression, slows initiation of ART and decreases
      adherence. Thus, the development of effective alcohol treatments for this clinical
      population is particularly important. The investigators are proposing to investigate the
      effectiveness of ondansetron pharmacotherapy for the treatment of hazardous alcohol use and
      alcohol abuse/dependence among HIV-infected patients. Ondansetron, a 5-HT3 antagonist, will
      be studied for several reasons: 1) evidence of effectiveness in persons who want to cut-down
      or reduce their drinking and who are not abstinent at medication initiation; 2)
      moderate-to-strong effects among early onset problem drinkers, a characteristic that is over
      represented in our clinic patients; 3) a very mild side-effect profile, making it an ideal
      pharmacotherapy candidate in patients who are often receiving multiple other medications
      with significant side-effects; and 4) its primary indication is for treatment of nausea, a
      common side-effect of antiretroviral (ARV) medications.

      The proposed study is a placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial of ondansetron for the
      treatment of hazardous drinking and alcohol use disorders among HIV-infected patients
      recruited from the Baltimore/Washington area. Participants will be genotyped for a
      functional polymorphism of the serotonin transporter gene. They will be randomized to one of
      three treatment groups: placebo, low dose ondansetron (0.2 mg bid) and moderate dose
      ondansetron (0.8 mg bid). All subjects will undergo 16 weeks of pharmacotherapy in
      combination with medication management, and will be followed for 3 and 6 months after
      medication has ended.

    <description>The Time-line Follow-back (Sobell, Sobell, Leo &amp; Cancilla, 1988) is used to obtain this secondary dependent measure. Alcohol use will be assessed biweekly and quantified over the 16-week medication period.
