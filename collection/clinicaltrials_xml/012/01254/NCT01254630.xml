  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess the safety and
      tolerability of V212 when administered to adults with solid tumor malignancy (STM) or
      hematologic malignancy (HM) and to determine whether V212 reduces the incidence of herpes
      zoster (HZ) in adults with STM or HM, as compared to placebo.
