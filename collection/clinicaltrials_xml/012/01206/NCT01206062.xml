  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Elevated blood pressure (BP) is an important public health concern. It is highly prevalent,
      the prevalence may be increasing, and it is a risk factor for several adverse health
      outcomes, especially coronary heart disease, stroke, heart failure, chronic kidney disease,
      and decline in cognitive function. The Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT)
      is a 2-arm, multicenter, randomized clinical trial designed to test whether a treatment
      program aimed at reducing systolic blood pressure (SBP) to a lower goal than currently
      recommended will reduce cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      SPRINT will randomize about 9250 participants aged ≥ 50 years with SBP ≥130 mm Hg and at
      least one additional CVD risk factor. The trial will compare the effects of randomization to
      a treatment program of an intensive SBP goal with randomization to a treatment program of a
      standard goal. Target SBP goals are &lt;120 vs &lt;140 mm Hg, respectively, to create a minimum
      mean difference of 10 mm Hg between the two randomized groups. The primary hypothesis is
      that CVD event rates will be lower in the intensive arm. Participants will be recruited at
      approximately 90 clinics within 5 clinical center networks (CCNs) over approximately a
      2-year period, and will be followed for 4-6 years.

    <description>Participants in the Intensive arm have a goal of SBP &lt;120 mm Hg. Use of once-daily antihypertensive agents will be encouraged unless alternative frequency is indicated/necessary. One or more medications from the following classes of agents will be provided by the study for use in managing participants in both randomization groups to achieve study goals:
Angiotension converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitors Angiotension receptor blockers (ARBs) Direct vasodilators Thiazide-type diuretics Loop diuretics Potassium-sparing diuretics Beta-blockers Sustained-release calcium channel blockers (CCBs) Alpha1-receptor blockers Sympatholytics
