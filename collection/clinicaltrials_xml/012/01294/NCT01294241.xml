    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare intra-individually the efficacy and tolerance of
      Sericare® versus standard treatment in accelerating the epithelialization of skin lesions of
      patients with Epidermolysis bullosa hereditaria.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The design of the trial is a case-series documentation of each individual patient involved
      in the trial, and an assessment of the treatment for each patient without the need for
      comparison and statistical analysis of different groups of patients. A comparison of the
      Sericare® treated Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB) wounds with the untreated part of the same
      wound will enable independent experts to assess the outcome of the treatment. Objective
      methods will be applied to evaluate the wound healing progress, i.e., the grade of
      epithelialization of the wound.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients aged 1-95 years who have provided written informed consent. In case of minor
             patients, written informed consent of parents or legal representatives is available.

          -  EB Patients with at least one skin lesion between 10 and 200 cm2.

          -  prepared and comply with all trial requirements, including the following:

               -  Application of Sericare on one half of the wound at every change of wound
                  dressing;

               -  Regular clinic visits during the treatment period and follow-up period (14 days
                  for disease with recent wounds or 28 days for disease with delayed wound healing
                  after the start of the treatment).

          -  Negative pregnancy test of women of childbearing potential performed within 7 days
             prior to the start of treatment.

          -  Women of childbearing potential must agree to use an effective method of
             contraception (Pearl-Index &lt; 1, e.g. hormonal contraception including the combined
             oral contraceptive pill, the transdermal patch, and the contraceptive vaginal ring,
             intrauterine devices or sterilization) during treatment and for at least 6 months
             thereafter.

          -  Men of procreative capacity must agree to use an effective method of contraception
             during treatment and for at least 6 months thereafter.

          -  received treatment with systemic steroids during the last 30 days;

          -  uncontrolled diabetes or diabetic ulcers;

          -  diseases or conditions that could, in the opinion of the investigator, interfere with
             the assessment of safety, tolerance or efficacy;

          -  a skin disorder that is chronic or currently active and which the Investigator
             considers will adversely affect the healing of the recent wounds or involves the
             areas to be examined in this case-series documentation;

          -  a history of clinically significant hypersensitivity to the trial medication or
             surgical dressings to be used in this case-series documentation;

          -  known multiple allergic disorders;

          -  taking, or have taken, any investigational drugs within 3 months prior to the
             screening visit;

          -  undergoing investigations or changes in management for an existing medical condition;

          -  not likely to complete the case-series documentation for whatever reason.
