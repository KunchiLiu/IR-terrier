  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the efficacy of the use of Marcaine in femoral nerve
      blocks and hematoma blocks for post operative pain relief for femoral shaft fractures in a
      pediatric population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children with femur fractures can have severe pain after elastic nail fixation. The current
      national standard for post operative pain control would be intravenous narcotics. In
      addition to the use of intravenous narcotics, there are two alternative methods used during
      the surgery in order to potentially decrease the pain post-operatively. These methods are
      hematoma block or a femoral nerve block. Both are proven safe and effective in children,
      however little research has been done to look at the effectiveness of these various methods
      compared to one another.
