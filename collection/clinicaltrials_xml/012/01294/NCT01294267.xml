      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the safety and feasibility of the Impella
      2.5 Circulatory Support System for use during mapping and ablation of ventricular
      tachycardia in the setting of Ventricular dysfunction.

    <textblock>
      The Impella 2.5 is a percutaneous heart pump that will be used to provide partial
      circulatory support -. The Impella 2.5 is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration
      and is being tested to see if it helps keep the patient's blood pressure stable during the
      cardiac ablation procedure. The Impella 2.5 Circulatory Support System works by placing a
      small pump into the left pumping chamber of the heart which will then help the heart
      circulate blood throughout the body. The Impella 2.5 Circulatory Support system will be
      removed once the heart no longer needs help with the pumping action which can be at any time
      from just after the completion of the heart procedure up to several days post procedure as
      determined by physician.

    <intervention_name>Impella 2.5 Circulatory Support system insertion</intervention_name>
    <description>Femoral angiography will be performed, and if the anatomy is suitable, the femoral artery preclosure technique will be employed. The Impella 2.5 will be inserted through th femoral artery into the left ventricle. Anti-coagulation will be titrated to achieve a therapeutic ACT level. Organ perfusion and Hemodynamic data will be collected during simulated VTs and throughout the course of the case. The performance level of the device may be adjusted during the case to quantify hemodynamic effects</description>
