      Background:

        -  The adrenal glands, located above the kidneys, produce hormones called glucocorticoids
           and mineralocorticoids. Glucocorticoids, especially the hormone cortisol, act on nearly
           all cells in the body with effects that are especially important to the body's stress
           response. They maintain heart function, blood pressure, and proper blood sugar levels,
           and help regulate the body's responses to infections and injury. Mineralocorticoids
           help to regulate salt and water levels in the body.

        -  Blood levels of cortisol have a natural day-to-night pattern: the highest levels occur
           in the morning and the lowest levels occur at night. This pattern is regulated by the
           hormone ACTH, which is made by the pituitary gland, and causes increased or decreased
           cortisol levels in response to the levels in the blood. Research has shown that older
           men have higher ACTH and cortisol levels than younger men, and that endurance-trained
           athletes have different cortisol levels than more sedentary individuals. Researchers
           are interested in studying these differences in cortisol levels and their potential
           effects on health.

      Objectives:

      - To compare cortisol levels and responses in sedentary young men and endurance-trained male
      athletes and elderly men.

      Eligibility:

        -  Healthy men between 18 and 30 years of age who have exercised less than 1 hour each
           week for the past 3 years.

        -  Healthy men between 18 and 30 years of age who have regularly run more than 45 km (28
           miles) per week for at least 3 months.

        -  Healthy men between 65 and 80 years of age who have exercised less than 1 hour each
           week for the past 3 years.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a full medical history and physical examination, as
           well as blood and urine samples.

        -  Participants will collect saliva and urine samples at home, both for cortisol
           measurements. Saliva samples should be collected in the evening on 2 separate days, and
           urine samples should be collected continuously for 12-hour intervals (7 AM to 7 PM and
           7 PM to 7 AM) over a single 24-hour period. Participants will provide baseline blood
           samples at the National Institutes of Health when they drop off the saliva and urine
           samples.

        -  Participants will have four separate evening/overnight tests at the National Institutes
           of Health. At these tests, participants will take study drugs or a look-alike capsule
           to block the effects of only glucocorticoid, only mineralocorticoid, both
           glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid, or neither. Blood, saliva, and urine samples will
           be collected regularly from 7 PM to 7 AM the next morning.

        -  Participants will have a final clinic test in which they will take dexamethasone late
           in the evening (11 PM to midnight) and visit the National Institutes of Health by 8 AM
           the next morning to provide a blood sample.

    <textblock>
      Adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) secretion is normally exquisitely regulated through endogenous
      stimulation by corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) and negative feedback inhibition by
      cortisol, resulting in a circadian rhythm of cortisol. Recent evidence suggests that older
      men and younger men who are endurance-trained athletes both have reduced sensitivity to
      negative feedback, and perhaps increased basal levels of cortisol and ACTH. To investigate
      these possibilities, we propose to examine multiple aspects of the
      hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in younger endurance trained and sedentary men, and in
      older sedentary men.

      Subjects will collect saliva during two evenings before additional testing, and will on the
      same evening collect urine for twelve hours, both for cortisol measurements. Blood samples
      will be collected to evaluate the function of white blood cells and their responses to
      dexamethasone. We also will assess ACTH and cortisol responses to medications that reduce
      negative inhibition of ACTH. This testing will occur in the evening and will include
      administration of the glucocorticoid antagonist mifepristone, the mineralocorticoid
      antagonist spironolactone, and/or a look-alike tablet, on four occasions.
