  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients scheduled to go home after ankle surgery at HSS typically receive a sciatic nerve
      block in the popliteal fossa and oral analgesic tablets (such as Percocet). Popliteal fossa
      nerve blockade has reduced pain for these patients (YaDeau et al, Anesth Analg
      2008;106:1916-20), but unfortunately the patients still often experience moderate to severe
      pain after the block wears off. The investigators wish to study two additives that may
      prolong the period of analgesia provided by the nerve block. The additives will be studied
      in the context of a standardized postoperative multimodal analgesic pathway.

      Primary outcome:

      Does adding dexamethasone and / or buprenorphine prolong the analgesia provided by a
      popliteal fossa nerve block?

      Secondary outcomes:

      Does adding dexamethasone and/or buprenorphine to a popliteal fossa nerve block improve:
      Pain scores? Quality of recovery? Satisfaction?

      Does adding dexamethasone and/or buprenorphine to a popliteal fossa nerve reduce:Opioid
      consumption? Opioid-related symptoms? Sleep disturbance?

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients of Dr Levine or Dr Roberts.

          2. Scheduled for discharge from HSS after foot or ankle surgery.

          3. A single-injection popliteal fossa nerve block is judged appropriate.

          4. Surgery confined to foot and ankle (no iliac crest bone graft planned - iliac
             aspirate is not an exclusion criterion).

          5. Patients aged 18-75 years.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Surgery that will cause pain at sites outside the distal lower extremity (e.g. iliac
             crest bone graft).

          -  Bilateral surgery

          -  Chronic pain (defined as regular use of opioid analgesics for &gt; 3 months).

          -  Chronic use of steroids (defined as regular use of steroids for &gt; 3 months).

          -  Contraindication to performance of the popliteal fossa nerve block with 30 cc 0.25%
             bupivacaine with clonidine (e.g. alleged bupivacaine sensitivity, low body weight,
             clonidine allergy, etc.).

          -  Contraindications to dexamethasone or buprenorphine (e.g. allergy, Insulin Dependent
             Diabetes Mellitus, etc.)

          -  Inability of the patient to describe postoperative pain (e.g. psychiatric disorder,
             dementia).

          -  Non-English speaking patients (the questionnaire is in English, and translations
             would have to be separately validated)
