    <textblock>
      This is a pilot research study examining two types of behavioral counseling along with the
      nicotine patch for smoking cessation. The study is designed to find out whether one of these
      counseling interventions is more effective for smoking cessation among individuals with
      sleep problems. The study has three parts: 1) an intake session; 2) a 10-week treatment
      phase, and 3) a 1-month follow-up.

      This is a developmental study to: 1) create and test an integrated cognitive-behavioral
      smoking cessation and insomnia intervention with 30 smokers who report current insomnia.
      Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 counseling conditions. The cognitive-behavioral
      intervention provides standard care smoking counseling along with counseling to address
      insomnia. The smoking counseling intervention provides standard care smoking counseling
      adapted from the American Lung Association Freedom from Smoking program. Efficacy data from
      this trial will be used to determine effect size estimates for biologically confirmed
      self-reported point prevalence smoking abstinence at the end of treatment and 1 month after
      completing treatment. Changes in sleep efficiency and self-control to resist smoking urges
      will also be examined. If the effect size estimates are sufficiently large and medically
      important to pursue a definitive trial, these data will be used to propose a full scale
      large study.
