    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to compare the immunogenicity and safety of a booster dose of
      BoostrixTM Polio to that of Sanofi Pasteur MSD's RepevaxTM, when co-administered with a
      second dose of PriorixTM, in healthy 3 and 4-year-old children.

             study period.

          -  Chronic administration of immunosuppressants or other immune-modifying drugs within
             six months prior to the booster vaccine dose.

          -  Administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol within 30 days prior

          -  Concurrently participating in another clinical study, at any time during the study
             period, in which the subject has been or will be exposed to an investigational or a
             non-investigational product.

          -  Previous booster vaccination against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, poliomyelitis
             since primary vaccination in the first year of life.

          -  Previous measles, mumps and/or rubella second dose vaccination.

          -  Evidence of previous or intercurrent diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, poliomyelitis,
             measles, mumps and/or rubella disease.

          -  Known exposure to measles, mumps and/or rubella within 30 days prior to study start.

             medical history and physical examination.

          -  History of any reaction or hypersensitivity likely to be exacerbated by any component
             of the vaccine.

          -  Administration of immunoglobulin and/or any blood products within the three months
             preceding the booster dose or planned administration during the study period.

          -  Occurrence of transient thrombocytopenia or neurological complications following an
             earlier immunisation.

          -  Occurrence of any of the following adverse events after a previous administration of

               -  Hypersensitivity reaction to any component of the vaccine;

               -  Encephalopathy of unknown aetiology occurring within 7 days following previous
                  vaccination with pertussis-containing vaccine;

               -  Fever &gt;= 40Â°C within 48 hours of vaccination, not due to another identifiable
