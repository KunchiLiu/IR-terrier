      The aim of the study is to establish whether treatment of ST with low-molecular-weight
      heparin in preventive or therapeutic doses prevents disease progression and thromboembolic
      events (deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism), whether efficacy of
      low-molecular-weight heparin differs with regard to the dosage used (prevention, treatment),
      and to recognize groups of patients in which treatment with heparin is most efficient, as
      well as to determine factors that influence the efficacy of ST treatment with heparin.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Until recently thrombophlebitis was regarded as a benign and self-limiting disease. Recent
      studies have shown that various complications, especially vein thrombosis and pulmonary
      thromboembolism, often accompany ST. An observational study (Prospective Observational
      Superficial Thrombophlebitis - POST) showed that three months after onset of the disease
      thromboembolic events occurred in 10% of patients: pulmonary embolism in 0.4%, disease
      progression in 3.1% and disease recurrence in 1.9% of patients. Therefore, ST is now
      frequently regarded as a part of the thromboembolic syndrome. On the basis of the evidence
      referred to above anticoagulants, especially heparin, are used more and more often for
      treatment of ST instead of anti-inflammatory drugs and non-steroidal antirheumatics. Several
      studies performed so far have examined efficacy of standard and low-molecular-weight heparin
      in various doses, but no final conclusion on the efficacy of treatment of ST with heparin
      has been established yet.

      A study by Marchiori and colleagues showed that 8-12-day treatment of ST with preventive and
      therapeutic doses of low-molecular-weight heparin significantly reduces progression and
      relapse of the disease, but not its thromboembolic complications. Another study demonstrated
      that low-molecular-weight heparin in combination with elastic compression was not
      significantly more effective than compression alone. Comparison of preventive and
      therapeutic doses of low-molecular-weight heparin given to patients over the period of one
      month after disease onset showed no differences in the efficacy in prevention of disease
      progression and thromboembolic complications. The standard (unfractionated) heparin was also
      shown to be effective in preventing disease progression, however, but not in preventing
      thromboembolic complications. It is also not clear how long the treatment with heparin
      should last. So far only one study compared the efficacy of treatment with various doses of
      low-molecular-weight heparin from one month to three months' duration; it demonstrated that
      1-month treatment with lower doses of heparin was as effective as 3-month treatment with
      therapeutic doses of heparin. A recent study (CALISTO) compared efficacy of preventive doses
      of fondaparinux (2.5 mg) with placebo in more than 3,000 patients with ST and concluded that
      anticoagulant treatment of ST probably does not significantly influence prevention of
      thromboembolic complications (Abstract presented at the 5th ASA Annual Meeting of the
      American Society of Hematology).

      Results of recent studies therefore show that heparin (standard or low-molecular-weight
      heparin) in various doses prevents ST progression, but no final agreement has emerged as to
      whether they prevent occurrence of thromboembolic complications as well. Interpretation of
      the results is difficult because of the heterogeneity of the patients included in certain
      studies and especially because of unavailability of subgroup analyses, which would help to
      establish whether treatment with heparin is more effective in certain groups of patients
      with ST than in those with presenting forms of the disease. Latest (2008) guidelines for
      prevention of venous thromboembolic events adopted by the American College of Chest
      Physicians (ACCP) recommend treatment with at least preventive or median doses of
      low-molecular-weight heparin or standard heparin for the duration of not less than 4 weeks.
      This recommendation is based on a very low evidence level (level 2B).

      In this study the investigators will therefore try to ascertain whether the extensiveness of
      thrombophlebitis and the distance of the end of blood clot from saphenofemoral and
      saphenopopliteal junction influence the efficacy of ST treatment with heparin. The
      investigators shall also monitor the expression of systemic inflammatory parameters that
      might be related to the efficacy of the treatment and progression of the disease.
