  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Moderate to severe sleep apnea (a high number of breathing pauses on a sleep study) is a
      common health problem that is often associated with loud snoring and sleepiness.The medical
      term for this problem is obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). People with OSA often have an
      increased risk for developing heart disease or may already have a diagnosis of heart
      disease.

      A clinical research study is being conducted at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Beth Israel
      Deaconess Medical Center to compare the effects of continuous positive airway pressure
      (CPAP) to conservative medical therapy with participation in one of four groups:

        -  CPAP Therapy Group: Standard medical treatment for sleep apnea, with CPAP mask worn
           during sleep. Participants randomized to either Respiratory Therapist (RT)only or RT
           with Cognitive Behavioral Therapist.

        -  Alternative CPAP Group: Different air delivery level from mask than CPAP Therapy Group.
           RT meetings.

        -  Conventional Medical Therapy (CMT) Group: Receive one year supply of nasal strips and
           follow guidelines for how to change sleep habits to minimize apnea.Frequent follow-up
           support with research coordinator.

      A sleep doctor or cardiologist will have indicated that a potential participant is an
      appropriate candidate to receive CPAP or CMT as acceptable approaches to treat his/her sleep
      apnea. Participants will be recruited between the ages of 45-75 years who have diagnosed
      heart disease or between 55-75 years for those who have risk factors for developing heart
      disease.

      This is a 12 month study* to evaluate alternative ways to address the potential for OSA
      treatment to reduce heart disease and to identify those features that would strengthen a
      later, large-scale randomized controlled trial.

      *For those randomized after December 31, 2012, the study will be 6 months long.

      We will test the hypothesis that active treatment for OSA with CPAP reduces CVD morbidity
      and mortality.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this pilot randomized controlled trial, we will assess the effectiveness of CPAP therapy
      to reduce the burden of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and CVD risk factors in patients with
      moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) presenting to a sleep disorders clinic. A
      total of 700 patients with a new diagnosis of moderate to severe OSA will be recruited from
      BWH-affiliated sleep disorder clinics, BWH, MGH, and Faulkner Hospital Cardiology Clinics
      (and similar specialized clinics seeing patients with cardiovascular risk factors, such as
      endocrinology and hypertensive clinics), Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Joslin
      Diabetes Center. After completing a 2 week run-in period, randomized participants
      (approximately 150 participants will be randomized) will undergo baseline and 6 month
      assessments of key study exposure and outcome variables.

      Participants will be randomized after completion of Baseline visit. The treatment arms are
      as follows:

      The active groups are:

        -  Active CPAP treatment delivered using standard respiratory therapist (RT) adherence
           education and support

        -  Active CPAP treatment administered using adherence education and support delivered by a
           RT and enhanced by a behavioral promotion intervention

      The control arms are:

        -  Sham-CPAP

        -  CMT, alone

      Participants randomized before December 31, 2012 (n=108) also will undergo 12 month
      follow-up assessments. Participants will be offered a 12 month supervised conservative
      medical therapy (CMT) program for OSA over the duration of the study intervention. Subjects
      would be contacted at bimonthly intervals by alternating phone and office visits to assess
      safety, identify adverse events, identify health care utilization, and reinforce protocol
      adherence. At 6 and 12 months, study outcomes will be reassessed by collecting data from
      sources.

      Patients randomized after December 31, 2012 will undergo only 6 months of follow-up
      assessment. Participants will be offered a 6 month supervised conservative medical therapy
      (CMT) program for OSA over the duration of the study intervention. Subjects would be
      contacted at bimonthly intervals by alternating phone and office visits to assess safety,
      identify adverse events, identify health care utilization, and reinforce protocol adherence.
      At 6 months, study outcomes will be reassessed by collecting data from sources.

    <description>All participants will meet with a research assistant who will provide ~30 minutes of instruction on sleep hygiene and healthy lifestyle guidelines. Each subject's sleep routine will be reviewed with the aim to identify appropriate bed and wake times that provide a consistent schedule and allow for at least 7 hours of time in bed per night. Habits that may impact sleep, such as alcohol consumption, tobacco use, and exercise close to bedtime will be reviewed with appropriate guidance on how to minimize sleep disrupting exposures. Subjects will be provided external nasal dilator strips (Breath Right®) and advised on how to maximize sleep time in a non-supine position using bed elevation, wedge pillows and/or objects affixed to the back of their night clothes as appropriate.</description>

    <description>In addition to receiving CMT and CPAP specialist-guided adherence support, participants randomized to active PAP with the BPA intervention would meet with a behavioral interventionist at the time of PAP prescription and one week later. Participants also would speak with the behavioral interventionist 6 times over the course of the study: at 3 weeks, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks, 5 months and 8 months after beginning CPAP, or until study follow-up is concluded. The duration of the initial behavioral promotion intervention is estimated to be 45 minutes long, with subsequent interventions 10 to 15 minutes long. The intervention will be based on social cognitive theory and feedback concerning adherence with targeted problem solving training.</description>

    <description>In addition to receiving CMT, participants in this treatment arm will receive a sham CPAP unit. Sham devices look like active PAP devices, however, the exhalation port is increased and an orifice-resistor is inserted between the pump and tubing, creating a marginal pressure. A heated humidifier will be provided with this device and PAP masks will be fit and provided following the same procedures as for the active PAP arms.</description>

    <description>In addition to receiving CMT, participants would be scheduled to meet with the CPAP specialist again one week after initiating PAP to reinforce PAP use and make any adjustments in the mask or pressure setting. Thereafter, the CPAP specialist would meet with the participant in person at months 1, 3, 6, and 9, using the available data from the PAP monitor on PAP use, mask leak, and residual AHI to assist with troubleshooting. Adjustments to equipment (mask replacement, use of chin strap, addition of expiratory pressure release) would be performed as needed to improve adherence. It is estimated that each in-person follow-up adherence visit with the CPAP specialist would last ~ 15 minutes.</description>
