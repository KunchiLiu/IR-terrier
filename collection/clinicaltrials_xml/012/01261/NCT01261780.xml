  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Painful chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a common complication of cancer
      therapy with few treatment options. CIPN is a complex side effect that varies between
      individuals and can be difficult to describe, difficult to treat and can significantly
      effect quality of life for patients.

      The purpose of this study is to determine if patients with painful CIPN will have a decrease
      in pain scores after treatment with the MC-5A device.
