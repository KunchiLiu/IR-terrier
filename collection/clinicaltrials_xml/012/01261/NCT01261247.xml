    <textblock>
      Panobinostat may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for
      cell growth. This phase II trial is studying how well panobinostat works in treating
      patients with relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the proportion of confirmed response of LBH589 in
      patients with relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To
      describe the toxicities associated with LBH589 in patients with NHL. II. To evaluate overall
      survival, progression-free survival, and duration of response in patients treated with
      LBH589. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of LBH589. II. To assess
      the correlation between clinical (toxicity and/or tumor response or activity) effects with
      the pharmacologic (pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic) parameters, and/or biologic (correlative
      laboratory) results. OUTLINE: Patients receive oral panobinostat 3 times weekly. Treatment
      repeats every 28 days for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6
      months for up to 2 years.

             medication prior to starting study drug

          -  Active bleeding tendency. NOTE: Patients on therapeutic anticoagulation should be
             monitored carefully to maintain therapeutic level of anticoagulation to avoid
             increased risk of bleeding due to concurrent drug induced thrombocytopenia. It is
             suggested that patients who require anticoagulation therapy while on therapy use low
             molecular weight heparin (LMWH).
