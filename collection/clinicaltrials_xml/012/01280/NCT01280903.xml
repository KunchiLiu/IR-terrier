    <textblock>
      The purpose of the Staying Active with Arthritis (STAR) research study is to determine if a
      6-month program will improve leg exercise, fitness walking, and clinical outcomes (function,
      blood pressure, leg strength, pain, fatigue, and health-related quality of life) in older
      adults with osteoarthritis of the knee and high blood pressure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over 9 million Americans have symptomatic osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee, a chronic disease
      associated with frequent joint pain, functional limitations, and quadriceps weakness that
      intrude upon everyday life. At least half of those with OA of the knee are diagnosed with
      hypertension or high blood pressure (HBP), one of the most prevalent risk factors for
      cardiovascular disease. Many other individuals with OA of the knee unknowingly have HBP and
      remain untreated. Our own work and that of others suggest that persons with OA of the knee
      experience reductions in BP when they participate in a regular regimen of physical activity.
      Even small decreases in systolic and diastolic BP found with physical activity are
      clinically significant, e.g., a 2 mm Hg decrease reduces the risk of stroke by 14% - 17%,
      and the risk of coronary heart disease is reduced by 6% - 9%. Yet, only 15% of persons with
      OA and 47% with HBP engage in regular physical activity. The purpose of this study is to
      investigate how the individually delivered, home-based, 6-month modified Staying Active with
      Arthritis (STAR) intervention, guided by self-efficacy theory and modified to address
      comorbid HBP, affects lower extremity exercise (flexibility, strengthening, and balance),
      fitness walking, functional status, BP, quadriceps strength, pain, fatigue, and
      health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in a convenience sample of 224 adults age 50 years or
      older with OA of the knee and HBP. Using a randomized controlled, 2-group design, we (1)
      hypothesize that at the end of the 6-month intervention period and 6 months after the
      intervention period ends those who receive the modified STAR intervention will be more
      likely to perform lower extremity exercise, participate in fitness walking, show
      improvements in objective functional status, and demonstrate reductions in BP than those who
      receive attention-control. Secondarily, we will (2) evaluate the impact of the modified STAR
      intervention, compared to attention-control, on subjective functional status, quadriceps
      strength, pain, fatigue, and HRQoL at both time points; (3) explore the impact of the
      modified STAR intervention, compared to attention-control, on self-efficacy and outcome
      expectancy at both time points; (4) explore the relationship between self-efficacy and
      outcome expectancy; and (5) explore the extent to which self-efficacy and outcome expectancy
      mediate the relationship between the modified STAR intervention and performance of lower
      extremity exercise and participation in fitness walking. Data will be analyzed using
      repeated measures modeling.

    <description>The 24-week modified Staying Active with Arthritis (STAR) intervention, guided by self-efficacy theory and modified to address comorbid hypertension, consists of 6 weekly individual face-to-face exercise sessions by a licensed physical therapist, 9 biweekly telephone counseling sessions by a registered nurse to continue the use of self-efficacy strategies, and lower extremity exercise and fitness walking being carried out at home between sessions. There will be no contact with participants during weeks 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, and 23. During the 6-month follow-up period, the participants will be contacted briefly by telephone by a registered nurse at weeks 30, 36, and 48 for a general check-up.</description>

    <description>Attention-Control is a 24-week general health education program for older adults that consists of 6 weekly telephone sessions by a registered nurse followed by 9 biweekly telephone sessions by a registered nurse. There will be no contact with participants during weeks 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, and 23. Topics include cancer screenings; immunizations; osteoporosis; low vision; hearing loss; talking with your primary care provider; eating healthy (two parts); sleep and aging; injury prevention (two parts: balance problems and falls); oral health; foot care; and mental health (depression). During the 6-month follow-up period, the participants will be contacted briefly by telephone by a registered nurse at weeks 30, 36, and 48 for a general check-up.</description>
