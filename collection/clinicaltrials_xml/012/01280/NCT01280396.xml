    <textblock>
      Second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs), including clozapine, are commonly used nowadays as
      treatment for psychosis. There are increasing concerns about their related metabolic
      side-effects over weight gain, risks to cause glucose intolerance and hyperlipidemia, and a
      specific condition known as metabolic syndrome. All these side-effects might be associated
      with the increased risk of cardiovascular diseases and diabetes mellitus.

      This study is to analyze the simple physical measurements (weight and height) and venous
      blood tests (for fasting blood glucose and lipid) results collected routinely since 2008
      (recommended by the local hospital authority as a territory-wide &quot;SGAs Monitoring Program&quot;)
      from those outpatients receiving SGAs (amisulpride, aripiprazole, olanzapine, paliperidone,
      quetiapine, risperidone and ziprasidone) and/or clozapine, at a local psychiatric outpatient
      clinic in Hong Kong. The investigators hypothesized that there should be differential risks
      on metabolic side-effects amongst these SGAs.
