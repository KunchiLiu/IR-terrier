  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal is to develop a two-tiered monitoring system to improve the care of patients at
      risk for clinical deterioration on general hospital wards (GHWs) at Barnes-Jewish Hospital
      (BJH). The investigators hypothesize that the use of an automated early warning system (EWS)
      that identifies patients at risk of clinical deterioration, with notification of nurses on
      the GHWs when patients are identified, will reduce the risk of ICU transfer or death within
      24 hrs of an alert. As a substudy, the investigators will pilot the use of a wireless pulse
      oximeter to establish feasibility and to develop algorithms for a real-time event detection
      system (RDS) in these high-risk patients.

    <description>An automated algorithm (EWS) will identify patients at potential risk of clinical deterioration. When a patient satisfies the algorithm, a nurse on the patient's ward will be notified. S/he will assess the patient and institute any interventions that are clinically required.</description>
