      This phase II trial studies how well carboplatin and paclitaxel with or without viral
      therapy works in treating patients with pancreatic cancer that has come back or has spread
      to other places in the body. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as carboplatin and paclitaxel,
      work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by
      stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Viral therapy may be able
      to kill tumor cells without damaging normal cells. It is not yet known whether carboplatin
      and paclitaxel are more effective with or without viral therapy in treating pancreatic
      cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the improvement in progression-free survival with Reolysin (wild-type
      reovirus), carboplatin, and paclitaxel relative to carboplatin and paclitaxel alone in
      patients with recurrent or metastatic pancreatic cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of Reolysin in combination with carboplatin and
      paclitaxel versus without Reolysin in patients with recurrent or metastatic pancreas cancer.

      II. To compare the treatment groups for other efficacy endpoints such as overall response
      rate and overall survival.

      III. To define how the combination of Reolysin and carboplatin and paclitaxel (CP) modulate
      factors regulating immunity to reovirus and its persistence in the system circulation of
      patients with pancreatic cancer.

      IV. To prospectively establish and validate the relationship between Ras mutations in tumor
      samples and response to Reolysin.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over 3 hours and carboplatin IV over
      30 minutes on day 1 and wild-type reovirus IV over 60 minutes on days 1-5. Courses repeat
      every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive paclitaxel and carboplatin as in Arm I. Courses repeat every 21
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with disease
      progression may crossover to Arm I.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 month and then every 2
      months thereafter.
