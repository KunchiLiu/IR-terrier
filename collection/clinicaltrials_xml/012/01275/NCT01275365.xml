  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group, double blind, clinical trial
      in community dwelling, older men, 65 years of age or older, who have mobility limitation and
      low protein intake. The study will have a 2 X 2 factorial design, which will allow us to
      investigate the effects of dietary protein intake and testosterone separately and together.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for protein, set at 0.8 grams/kg/day for adult men
      and women, has engendered debate and many experts advocate protein intakes substantially
      above the RDA to help maintain muscle anabolism in older individuals. It is not known
      whether increasing protein intake in older Americans, whose current intake is below the RDA,
      increases skeletal muscle mass, muscle performance and physical function.

      Our first aim is to determine whether administration of 1.3 g/kg/day of protein, compared to
      the RDA (0.8 g/kg/day), will result in greater improvements in lean body mass, maximal
      voluntary muscle strength and power, and self-reported and performance-based measures of
      physical function in older men. Our second aim is to determine whether the gains in lean
      body mass, maximal voluntary strength and self-reported and performance-based measures of
      physical function during testosterone administration are greater with 1.3 g protein than
      with the RDA in older men on a eucaloric diet.

      We will conduct a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial using a 2 X 2 factorial
      design. Community dwelling men, 65 years or older, who have self-reported mobility
      limitation, a daily protein intake of &lt;0.8 g/kg/day and no contraindications for
      testosterone therapy, will be randomly assigned to one of four groups: placebo injections
      plus protein 0.8 g/kg/day; placebo injections plus protein 1.3 g/kg/day; testosterone
      enanthate 100 mg weekly plus protein 0.8 g/kg/day; testosterone enanthate 100 mg weekly plus
      protein 1.3 g/kg/day. Treatment duration will be 6 months. The primary outcome is change in
      lean body mass from baseline to 6 months, measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry.
      Secondary outcomes include change in maximal voluntary strength in leg and chest press
      exercises, leg power, self-reported (physical function domain of SF-36) and
      performance-based measures of physical function (6-min walking distance and speed, stair
      climbing power, and load carrying), fatigue, well-being and affectivity balance. Safety
      measures include urinary calcium excretion, hematocrit, prostate specific antigen (PSA) and
      prostate examination.
