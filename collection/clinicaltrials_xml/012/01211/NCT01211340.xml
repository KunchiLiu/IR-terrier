      The ACTIVE Intervention to Improve Hospice Caregiver Pain Management The major goal of this
      project is to implement and test this promising intervention in three hospice programs. The
      mixed methods evaluation of this RCT will provide evidence-based data for a tested
      intervention manual that hospice staff members can use to integrate the intervention into
      their practices. We will rigorously test the effectiveness of the ACTIVE intervention (RQ1).
      We will investigate whether the assessment of the ICG perception of pain management will
      identify those who will benefit most (RQ2) and whether changes in the perceptions of
      informal caregivers will result in improvement of patient pain (RQ3). With a cost effective
      intervention (RQ4, 5) and an understanding for a translation plan (RQ6, 7), involving the
      informal caregivers and patients (when able) on the IDT team can become the standard of
      care. This intervention may have the potential to influence not only hospice care but also
      care for other patients experiencing chronic or terminal pain.
