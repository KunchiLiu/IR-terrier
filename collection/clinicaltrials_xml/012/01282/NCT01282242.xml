  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was jointly developed and is jointly led by investigators at Massachusetts
      General Hospital and the intramural division of NINDS. We are doing this research study to
      find out if Activase ® (also called alteplase or rt-PA) can safely be given to people with
      an acute ischemic stroke when their stroke onset was not witnessed making them ineligible
      for standard thrombolytic (clot busting) therapy. We also want to find out if rt-PA can help
      people recover better from their stroke.

      The purpose of this study is to: 1) see if it is safe to give intravenous (IV) rt-PA to
      people with unwitnessed stroke but with MRI evidence of early ischemic stroke, 2) see if
      rt-PA is effective if given to people who are selected for treatment based on MRI evidence
      of an early stroke, and 3) get information about this new MRI diagnostic methods for guiding
      stroke treatment.

      This study was jointly developed and is jointly led by Massachusetts General Hospital and
      the NINDS. This is a multi-center, open-label, Phase IIa safety study in adult acute
      ischemic stroke patients to determine if it is safe to extend intravenous thrombolytic
      treatment to subjects who are evaluated within 24 hours from last known well (&quot;stroke
      onset&quot;) and eligible to receive thrombolytic treatment within 4.5 hours from symptom
      discovery with the assistance of an MRI-based &quot;witness&quot; when no human witness of stroke
      onset is available. The study is designed to investigate the safety in using standard
      diagnostic MRI in selecting patients for thrombolytic therapy when the last known well time
      places the patient beyond the current IV thrombolytic time-window.
