  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the investigators pilot study is to assess the pharmacokinetic profile of
      two corticosteroid drugs, prednisone and prednisolone, in children who present to the
      pediatric emergency department with an asthma exacerbation. The investigators hypothesis is
      that the pharmacokinetic profile in this population will be similar to healthy children and
      adults.

    <textblock>
      The standard of practice in treating children with asthma exacerbations is to give
      corticosteroid drugs early in the course of the exacerbation. These drugs decrease symptoms,
      provide faster time to recovery and improve of quality of life. However, there is 100%
      variability in a child's response to corticosteroids at a standard dose which is based on
      primarily on adult studies. The pharmacokinetic analysis or the process by which a drug is
      metabolized by the body is the first step to determine the proper dose.

      Patients between the ages of 2 and 16 years with asthma exacerbations will be recruited from
      the pediatric emergency department. After the patients get the drugs, blood samples will be
      drawn over 8 hours to get the following parameters: maximum concentration reached in the
      body, the time for the drug to be eliminated from the body, how long the drug stays in the
      body, how much of the drug is found in the urine after it is given, and concentration of
      metabolites or breakdown products in urine and blood. These are the parameters needed to
      make the pharmacokinetic profile and is the first step towards appropriate dosing of these
      two medications for asthma exacerbations in children.

    <description>The children will receive prednisone or prednisolone by mouth at current standard dose of 1mg/kg. Blood samples will be drawn from the catheter at baseline (0 hours), 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 hours post ingestion of the medication. All samples will be analyzed for prednisone and prednisolone concentrations, and breakdown product concentrations. Urine samples will be collected prior to discharge for analysis of fractional excretion of prednisone, prednisolone, and the metabolites.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  patients aged 2 to 16 years

          -  acute asthma exacerbation requiring an oral corticosteroid (either prednisone or
             prednisolone)

          -  any &quot;reactive airways disease&quot; treated like asthma

        [Asthma is defined as at least 2 wheezing episodes and/or the patient has been treated
        with beta agonist and/or inhaled, oral or intravenous corticosteroids for the recurrent
        episodes of wheezing in the past] [Acute asthma exacerbation is defined as wheezing
        episode with any of the following symptoms: tachypnea, dyspnea, use of accessory muscles,
        or an increased need for short acting beta agonist prior to presentation to PED]

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  any systemic corticosteroid use within 1 week of presentation to PED

          -  use of any other corticosteroid apart from oral prednisone or prednisolone for the
             current acute asthma exacerbation

          -  bronchiolitis

          -  underlying chronic medical condition other than asthma (ie: cystic fibrosis,
             nephrotic syndrome, epilepsy, etc)

          -  liver impairment (including elevated transaminases)

          -  renal impairment

          -  primary or secondary immunodeficiences

          -  concomitant immunosuppressive medication use

          -  IVIG use within 4 weeks

          -  need for assisted ventilation
