  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim of the study is to compare the effects of three types of beverages -
      sugar-sweetened (SSB), artificially sweetened (ASB), and unsweetened (USB) - on
      cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors and body weight among young adults.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Consumption of sugar sweetened beverages (SSB) has been linked to obesity and, independent
      of body weight, risk for diabetes and cardiovascular disease. With rising public health
      awareness of these potential adverse effects, consumption of artificially sweetened
      beverages (ASB) has increased dramatically. These low-calorie products are marketed as
      &quot;diet,&quot; with the implication that they promote weight loss and improved health. However,
      there are no long-term experimental studies of ASB and body weight or any other health
      outcome. Several recent prospective observational studies have linked intake of ASB to
      increased risk of the metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, and obesity. In the proposed
      clinical trial, 270 young adults who habitually consume SSB will be randomly assigned to one
      of three groups: 1) to continue consuming habitual levels of SSB; 2) to substitute ASB for
      SSB; or 3) to substitute unsweetened beverages for SSB. Each group will receive home
      delivery of the targeted beverage for 1 year, using methods that build upon previous
      successful work. Careful attention will be given to assuring treatment fidelity, equivalence
      of treatment intensity, and avoidance of experimental confounders. The primary study
      endpoint will be the ratio of serum triglyceride to HDL-cholesterol concentrations.
      Secondary endpoints will include changes in other cardiovascular disease risk factors, body
      weight, dietary quality, and taste preferences.
