      The purpose of this study is to assess if putative brain injury biomarkers have utility as
      blood-based traumatic brain injury (TBI) diagnostic and monitoring tools. This will be
      accomplished by examining the relationships between potential serum-based TBI biomarkers and
      clinical measures of injury severity, occurrence of complications, and outcome, in subjects
      with mild or moderate TBI. The assay will be evaluated in a sample population of subjects
      over the age of 18 who have been referred to the health care provider for closed head injury
      evaluation.
