  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ability of vitamin D to modulate the immune system and strengthen bones may mitigate the
      adverse medication consequences of HIV/AIDS, but little is known about either the health
      benefits of vitamin D supplements, or about the optimal dosing regimen for patients on
      highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). This trial is a comparison of two regimens for
      administering vitamin D and calcium to HIV-positive individuals taking antiviral
      medications. This study will help physicians make evidence-based decisions about the most
      effective way to use vitamin D in their patients and enable the design of large multi-center
      trials in the future.

    <textblock>
      In the post-HAART era, patients continue to suffer from the adverse medical consequences of
      HIV/AIDS. The adverse effects include incomplete immune reconstitution, chronic
      inflammation, depression, increased risk of cardiovascular and metabolic disease, and low
      bone density. Clinical trials suggest that vitamin D supplements can increase bone density,
      reduce inflammation, alleviate depression, and increase longevity if given in adequate
      doses. To achieve maximum benefits, most vitamin D experts in the HIV field agree that
      vitamin D treatments should raise the concentration of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] above
      30 ng/ml. A growing number of HIV care providers desire an evidence-based protocol for
      achieving these 25(OH)D target levels. This project addresses the need for a validated
      protocol for treating vitamin D deficiency in HIV-positive individuals on HAART. The goal of
      Aim I is to conduct a 12-mo randomized, double-blinded trial comparing two dosing regimens
      of oral vitamin D plus 0.5 g/d of calcium in patients on stable HAART who have 25(OH)D
      levels â‰¤ 25 ng/ml and undetectable HIV viral load at baseline (100 per arm). Medication
      event monitoring system (MEMS) caps will be used to record supplement use and to promote
      adherence. Subjects in Protocol A will receive 50,000 IU/wk of vitamin D2 for 8 wk followed
      by 1000 IU/d of vitamin D3 for 48 wk. Subjects in Protocol B will receive 2000-4000 IU/d of
      vitamin D3, depending on the basal 25(OH)D level, with dose titration, as necessary, based
      on the slope of the initial response. The primary outcome measure is the difference in the
      percentage of subjects with 25(OH)D levels in the range of 30-60 ng/ml at 12 mo. The
      secondary outcome is the slope of the 25(OH)D response curve during various time intervals.
      The goal of Aim II is to compare the impact of the two protocols on markers of disease. The
      primary outcome measure is the change in the CD4+T cell count. Secondary outcomes include
      changes in CD4+ T cell subsets, markers of inflammation, markers of bone and calcium
      metabolism, self-reported psychological status, viral load, side effects, safety, and
      adherence. To our knowledge, this trial is the first head-to-head comparison of a regimen
      that uses a loading dose of vitamin D2 with a regimen that uses a tiered starting dose of
      vitamin D3. The project will yield a validated protocol for treating vitamin D deficiency in
      HIV-infected patients on HAART and will provide initial data about the risks and health
      benefits of vitamin D and calcium supplements. This information is essential for designing
      definitive multicenter trials in the future.
