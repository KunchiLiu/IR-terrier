  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will evaluate the effect of metformin therapy during 4 months in
      non-diabetic patients following ST-elevation myocardial infarction on left ventricular
      ejection fraction as measured with cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, compared to placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this trial, the investigators will evaluate the effect of metformin therapy following
      ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in a total of 380 non-diabetic patients. This
      trial is a randomized, double blind, controlled trial. The intervention, which consist of
      metformin 500mg twice daily or placebo twice daily, will commence within three hours after
      the percutaneous coronary intervention, and will be continued for 4 months. The primary
      endpoint is the difference between the two intervention groups (metformin vs placebo) in
      left ventricular ejection fraction, as measured with magnetic resonance imaging after 4
      months. The investigators hypothesize that metformin therapy results in a significantly
      higher ejection fraction in this population.

    <description>The primary efficacy parameter of the GIPS-III trial is LVEF measured by cardiac MRI 4 months after randomization, based on an intention-to-treat analysis. It is hypothesized that metformin therapy will result in a higher ejection fraction after 4 months.</description>

    <description>Cardiovascular events include major cardiac adverse events (MACE; death, recurrent MI, target lesion revascularization), stroke, non-elective hospitalizations for chest pain or heart failure, all recurrent coronary interventions, and internal cardiac defibrillator implantations. Mortality will be divided into cardiac and non-cardiac. Cardiac death will be divided into three categories: heart failure, sudden death and other. A cardiologist will confirm deaths from cardiovascular causes by examining medical records obtained from hospitals and attending physicians or from attending general practitioner if the patient died at home.</description>
