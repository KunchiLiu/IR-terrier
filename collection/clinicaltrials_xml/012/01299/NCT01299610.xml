      This study is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess the efficacy of
      GW870086X cream formulation in subjects with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. Subjects
      will be assigned to take 3 out of the 4 possible treatments for 21 ±2 days: GW870086X 0.2%
      cream, GW870086X 2% cream, FP 0.05% cream (as a positive control) and placebo cream. All
      subjects will be randomised to receive placebo cream. Three index lesions located on the
      arms and/or legs (one on each) will be identified per subject and each treatment will be
      applied to the same lesion.

      This study is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess the efficacy of
      GW870086X cream formulation in subjects with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. The
      primary objective of this study is to assess 3 lesions using the Three Item Severity (TIS)
      score. The secondary objectives are to assess safety and tolerability of GW870086X, assess
      individual lesions using the Investigators Global Assessment (IGA) and to assess the
      pharmacokinetics of 21 days dosing of GW870086X administered as a cream. Twenty-five (25)
      subjects with atopic dermatitis will be randomised to receive placebo and 2 of the following
      treatments: GW870086X 0.2%, GW870086X 2%, FP 0.05% and placebo. All subjects will receive
      placebo. Subjects will apply all 3 treatments once daily during the 21 day treatment period.
      Three index lesions located on the arms and/or legs (one on each) will be identified per
      subject and each treatment will be applied to the same lesion throughout the 21±2 day
      treatment period. Each index lesion should represent the most common lesions for each
      patient i.e. not the most or least severe lesions.
