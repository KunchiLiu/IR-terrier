    <textblock>
      This is a single dose study of radio-labeled [14C]-LY3009104 in healthy male volunteers to
      study the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination of LY3009104. This study
      requires minimum of 7 days and maximum of 22 days stay. This study is for research purposes
      only and is not intended to treat any medical condition.
