    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well pazopanib hydrochloride works in treating patients with
      uterine cancer that has come back or has not responded to treatment. Pazopanib hydrochloride
      may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.
      Pazopanib hydrochloride may also stop the growth of uterine cancer by blocking blood flow to
      the tumor.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the activity of pazopanib in patients with persistent or recurrent
      carcinosarcoma of the uterus as measured by the proportion of patients who survive
      progression-free for at least 6 months and the proportion of patients who have objective
      tumor response (complete or partial).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the frequency and severity of adverse events as assessed by Common
      Terminology Criteria of Adverse Events version 4.0 (CTCAE v4.0).

      II. To determine the duration of progression-free survival and overall survival.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive pazopanib hydrochloride orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Courses
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months for 3 years.
