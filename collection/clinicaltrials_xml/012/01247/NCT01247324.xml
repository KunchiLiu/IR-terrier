  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group study will evaluate the efficacy
      and safety of ocrelizumab in comparison with Rebif (interferon beta-1a) in participants with
      relapsing multiple sclerosis. Participants will be randomized to receive either in Group A,
      ocrelizumab 600 milligrams (mg) intravenously (iv) every 24 weeks plus Rebif placebo
      subcutaneously (sc) three times weekly, or, in Group B, Rebif 8.8 micrograms (mcg) (Weeks 1
      and 2), 22 mcg (Weeks 3 and 4), and 44 mcg (Week 5 and thereafter) sc three times weekly
      plus ocrelizumab placebo iv every 24 weeks. Planned duration of double-blind treatment is 96
      weeks. Participants who complete the 96-week double-blind treatment will have an option to
      enter a single group, active treatment open label extension, providing they fulfill the
      eligibility criteria.
