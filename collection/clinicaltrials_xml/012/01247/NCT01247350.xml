        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy males or females. Male subjects:Agree to use 2 forms of highly effective
             methods of birth control with female partners of childbearing potential for the
             specified duration. Female subjects: Females must not be pregnant, breastfeeding, or
             at risk to become pregnant during study participation. Female subjects of
             childbearing potential must test negative for pregnancy at screening and agree to use
             2 forms of highly effective methods of birth control, or remain abstinent for the
             specified duration.

          -  Up to third generation Japanese, that is defined as all of the subject's biological
             grandparents are of exclusive Japanese decent and have been born in Japan.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Are subjects who have previously completed or withdrawn from this study or any other
             study investigating LY3009104, and received the study drug.

          -  Have a history of or current cardiovascular, respiratory, hepatic, renal,
             gastrointestinal, endocrine, hematological, or neurological disorders capable of
             significantly altering the absorption, metabolism, or elimination of drugs; of
             constituting a risk when taking the study medication; or of interfering with the
             interpretation of data.

          -  Show evidence of significant active neuropsychiatric disease.

          -  Have current or recent history of herpes zoster or simplex in the last 90 days prior
             to randomization, or history of herpes zoster, such as disseminated herpes zoster
             involving multiple dermatomes, ocular involvement, including herpes zoster involving
             the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve.

          -  Have or have a history of rheumatoid arthritis.

          -  History of malignancy, with the exception of cured basal cell or squamous cell
             carcinoma of the skin.

          -  History of stomach or intestinal surgery, except that appendectomy and/or
