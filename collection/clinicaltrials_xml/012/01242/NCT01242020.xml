      The purpose of this study is to test a method of imaging (taking a picture) of the abdomen
      (belly), neck, thigh and calf (lower leg) areas of the body, using ultrasound along with a
      drug which makes the pictures look clearer. Ultrasound is a type of imaging that uses sound
      waves to create a picture of the inside of the human body. Two sets of pictures will be
      taken on two different days to see if the results are the same each time.

      DEFINITY® is a drug given intravenously (through the vein). DEFINITY® is approved by the FDA
      to be used as an ultrasound contrast agent (makes the pictures look clearer) while taking
      pictures of the heart. In this study, DEFINITY® will be used while taking pictures of blood
      vessels in your abdomen (belly), neck, thigh and calf (lower leg). Since this use of
      DEFINITY® is different than the use approved by the FDA, this study will be performed under
      an FDA Investigational New Drug (IND) application.
