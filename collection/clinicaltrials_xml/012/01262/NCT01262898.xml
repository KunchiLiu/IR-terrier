  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GSK962040 is a novel small molecule motilin agonist. The Phase I studies (MOT107043 and
      MOT109681) demonstrated that single doses of GSK962040 up to 150 mg and repeat dosing of up
      to 125 mg/day for 14 days were well tolerated with adverse events not occurring in greater
      prevalence than placebo, and no significant abnormal vital sign, ECG, or clinical laboratory
      findings. Pharmacokinetic parameters were linear and approximately dose proportional over
      the range of doses administered. Single doses of 50 mg - 150 mg GSK962040 significantly
      increased the rate of gastric emptying up to 40% as measured by the 13C octanoic acid stable
      isotope breath test. A similar effect of 50 mg and 125 mg on gastric emptying was observed
      throughout repeated dosing to healthy volunteers for 14-days.

      The aims of the present investigation (MOT114479) are to assess the pharmacodynamic effects
      (gastric emptying and symptoms), safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of GSK962040
      after 28 days of once-daily dosing in Type I and Type II diabetic subjects with
      gastroparesis. An additional aim is to characterize the dose/exposure - pharmacodynamic
      effect relationship.
