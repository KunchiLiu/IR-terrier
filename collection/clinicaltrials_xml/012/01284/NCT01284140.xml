  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this project is to determine whether the sleep and circadian rhythms of
      critically ill patients undergoing mechanical ventilation can be improved through practical
      strategies that can be employed at the bedside.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nearly 1 million patients develop respiratory failure annually in the United States; yet,
      the sleep of patients undergoing mechanical ventilation has received little attention. This
      project is designed to characterize sleep and circadian rhythmicity in critically ill
      patients and to explore the efficacy of a non-pharmacological intervention to improve sleep
      and normalize circadian phase. The study will examine the effect of a protocol employing
      noise reduction and enforcement of a robust light-dark cycle on sleep quality and circadian
      rhythmicity. A secondary analysis will examine the relationship between delirium and sleep
      disruption and loss of circadian rhythmicity. Circadian rhythmicity will be characterized
      through the measurement of urinary 6-sulfatoxymelatonin levels at frequent intervals, while
      sleep will be assessed using continuous polysomnography.

    <description>This multifaceted intervention will attempt to enhance sleep and circadian rhythmicity through improved scheduling of nursing procedures, enforcement of a day/night routine, increased light exposure during the day, and decreased light and sound exposure during the night. Supplemental bright lights and eyeshades and noise cancelling headphones may also be employed.</description>
