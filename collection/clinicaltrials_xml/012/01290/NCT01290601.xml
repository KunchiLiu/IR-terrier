  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase II study is designed to determine whether a single 600 mg dose or 400mg/day for 3
      days of tafenoquine is efficacious, and well tolerated for clearing P. vivax malaria
      infection (blood schizontocidal and gametocytocidal activity) and preventing P. vivax
      relapse (hypnozoite eradication). It will also further establish the safety and tolerability
      of these doses of tafenoquine.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Positive smear for P. vivax.

          3. Age: 20-60 years old

          4. Willing to sign consent form

          5. Willing to be hospitalized for 29 days and remain in a malaria free region for 60
             days thereafter for follow-up.

          6. A female is eligible to enter and participate in this study if she is of:

        a non-childbearing potential (i.e., physiologically incapable of becoming pregnant),

        licensed contraceptives such as diaphragm and condom (by the partner) or intrauterine
        device and condom. The use of oral/patch contraceptives during the study is not considered
        sufficient contraceptive protection.

             clinically).

          7. Clinically significant abnormal laboratory values as determined by history, physical
             examination or routine blood chemistries and hematology values (laboratory guideline
             values for exclusion are hemoglobin &lt;7 gm/dL, platelets &lt; 50,000/μl, White Blood Cell
             count (WBC) &lt; 2000/μl, serum creatinine &gt;2.0mg/dL, or ALT or AST more than 3 times
             the upper limit of normal for age.

          8. History of allergy to chloroquine, mefloquine, tafenoquine, primaquine or any other
             8-aminoquinolines.

          9. Subject has taken another investigational drug within 30 days or 5 half lives
             (whichever is longer), of study start.

             identified in baseline ophthalmological examination.

         11. Subjects taking concomitant medications likely to affect renal or ophthalmic function
             or that are known to be metabolized primarily by the cytochrome P450 isoforms 3A4/5
             and 2C9 and whose therapeutic effect occurs within a narrow plasma concentration
             range (e.g. warfarin, ketoconazole).

         12. Subjects whom, after examination by the study ophthalmologist, are judged to be at
             risk for acute angle closure glaucoma.
