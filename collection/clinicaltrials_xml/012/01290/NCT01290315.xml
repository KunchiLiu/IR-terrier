    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare safety and the oxidative stress potential of two
      doses of an investigational IV iron, ferric carboxymaltose (FCM), compared to an equal
      single dose of IV iron sucrose or IV iron dextran in the treatment of Iron Deficiency Anemia
      (IDA) in female subjects.
