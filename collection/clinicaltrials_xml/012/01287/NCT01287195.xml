      This study will assess the safety and efficacy of orally delivered short-term OKT3 in
      patients with active ulcerative colitis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic disease of unknown etiology characterized by
      infiltration of inflammatory cells into the intestinal tract. OKT3 is an approved drug for
      intravenous use in the treatment of solid-organ transplantation. However, intravenous dosing
      has been limited by significant toxicities. Data from animal models suggest that anti-CD3
      administered via the oral route is effective at treating a variety of autoimmune diseases.
      No side effects were observed in a recent phase I study of healthy subjects receiving oral
      anti-CD3 mAb.

      The objectives of the current study are to assess the safety, immunologic effects and
      efficacy of short-term oral administration of OKT3 in patients with active ulcerative
      colitis . OKT3 will be delivered orally as a 1 mg or 2 mg dose with Omeprazole 20 mg daily
      for 30 consecutive days in an open-label pilot trial. Thirty two subjects will be screened
      for a targeted completion of 16 enrolled patients. The subjects will be evaluated at
      baseline, day 1, day 2, week 1, week 3, as well as after completion of therapy at week 5 and
      10 after the initiation of treatment. Lab tests will be performed at screening, baseline,
      day 2, week 1, week 3, week 5 and week 10. Clinical data will be collected at all study
      visits and via diary entries throughout the study period. A flexible sigmoidoscopy will be
      done at baseline and at week 5. Stool studies will be performed at screening to rule out
      infection.

      To be eligible for this study, subjects must be between the ages of 18 and 65 years and have
      a history of moderately to severely active UC as defined by a Mayo score of 6 to 12. They
      may not be taking concurrent biologic or immunomodulator therapy for UC.
