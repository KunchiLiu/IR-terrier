      Background:

      - Procedures that use medical tools in or near a possible abnormality in the body often use
      computed tomography (CT) scans to locate the abnormality and guide the path that a needle
      will take to collect a sample of tissue. Xperguide and electromagnetic (EM) tracking are two
      new procedures being studied to help guide the needle. Xperguide is software that uses CT
      images to help the doctor choose the needle path. EM tracking uses special medical tools
      with miniature coils that act like a GPS device to show the location of the needle in the
      body. Xperguide and EM tracking have been used in humans and have good results, but they
      have not been compared with each other and regular CT to determine whether they are better
      than the standard approach.

      Objectives:

      - To compare the results of Xperguide, electromagnetic tracking, and regular computed
      tomography during a guided percutaneous procedure.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who are required to have a CT-guided percutaneous
      procedure.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a physical examination and medical history, and the
           results of any previous imaging studies will be examined before study enrollment.

        -  After a pilot phase, the study will involve two phases to compare the results of the
           different procedures. The first phase will involve comparing Xperguide to CT, and the
           second will involve comparing Xperguide to EM tracking.

        -  Phase 1 participants will be assigned to one of two procedure groups: Group 1 will have
           Xperguide, and Group 2 will have regular CT. Participants who are scheduled to have
           repeated procedures (like a biopsy before and after chemotherapy) will be randomized
           for the first procedure and the second procedure will be done using the other method.

        -  Phase 2 participants will be assigned to one of two procedure groups: Group 1 will have
           Xperguide, and Group 2 will have EM tracking. Participants who are scheduled to have
           repeated procedures (like a biopsy before and after chemotherapy) will be randomized
           for the first procedure and the second procedure will be done using the other method.

        -  Standard post-procedure followup care will be given after the study procedure is
           completed.

      This is a phase II prospective randomized trial comparing a novel navigation method,
      Xperguide to conventional CT and electromagnetic tracking (EM) during percutaneous image
      guided procedures. Xperguide is a navigation tool that utilizes a cone beam CT (CBCT)
      obtained in the angiography suite overlaid on fluoroscopy for needle guidance during image
      guided procedures. The needle entry point and path are planned on the CBCT and the
      determined path is overlaid on fluoroscopy image for real time guidance.

      SPECIFIC AIMS/OBJECTIVES

        1. The primary aims are:

           a. Pilot trial:

           i. To familiarize operators with outcome measures allowing for fair comparison in the
           subsequent study

           b. Main trial will have 2 phases with similar outcomes criteria and aims (below):

           i. comparing Xperguide to conventional imaging (superiority design):

      ii. comparing Xperguide to EM tracking (equivalence design):

        1. To compare the accuracy of final device tip position and path (vector)

        2. To compare the number of repositioning maneuvers

        3. To compare the radiation dose

        4. To compare rates of definitive pathological diagnosis and response rate per EASL
           criteria for ablations

      METHODS/METHODOLOGY

      For non-vascular image guided interventions, patients undergoing biopsies and ablations
      procedures requiring CT guidance are eligible for inclusion and randomization. An initial
      pilot study will be done in which each operator will perform at least 5 cases using
      Xperguide completing the case report forms. This will ensure experience with outcome
      measures and fair comparison in the subsequent study. Once one of the operators reaches the
      minimal required cases, the main trial will begin for that operator. However every other
      operator must each complete the minimal number of cases with the case report forms to enroll
      patients in the main trial. Initially, we will compare Xperguide with conventional CT with
      several cohorts of patients mainly: lung biopsies, and ablations, kidney biopsies/ablations
      and other abdominal biopsies/ ablations. In ablations of large lesions, Xperguide composite
      ablation software can provide input on the expected ablation zones. Each probe will be
      positioned in the same manner as any biopsy needle following steps described in section 4.
      If this specific composite ablation module of the

      software is not commercially released and FDA cleared at the time of the study, then this
      software will only be used on protocol to help the physician determine ideal needle
      positioning for complete ablation. Once consent is obtained the participant is randomized to
      either conventional imaging or Xperguide. In addition, if it is known that the patient is
      participating in a trial which requires a repeat (paired, pre and post treatment) procedure
      of the same site, then the randomization will determine which modality is used for guidance
      at the first visit and the other modality will automatically be used for the second
      procedure. In these cases, if the patient gives consent they will be randomized to one of
      two categories:

        1. Xperguide for the initial procedure and conventional CT for the 2nd procedure

        2. Conventional CT for the initial procedure and Xperguide for the 2nd procedure

      Then in the second phase of the trial, Xperguide will be compared to EM tracking for
      biopsies and ablations requiring CT guidance, in an equivalence study. Once consent is
      obtained, the participant will be randomized into EM tracking or Xperguide. The patients
      would be divided into different cohorts depending on the anatomic site of the interventions
      i.e. lung, kidney, liver and other abdomen. If the patients are participating in a trial
      requiring paired procedures (i.e. pre and post treatment), the randomization will determine
      which modality is used for the initial procedure and the other modality will be used for the
      second procedure. In summary there will be two potential categories:

        1. EM tracking for the initial procedure and Xperguide for the 2nd procedure

        2. Xperguide for the initial procedure and EM tracking for the 2nd procedure

      If a patient has a lesion that is only visible on PET-CT/MR, or demonstrates heterogenous
      PET-CT/MR uptake, there will be a separate cohort of PET-CT/MR guided biopsies and ablations
      using Xperguide vs EM tracking. There is also the need for a cohort for ablations with
      complimentary use of ultrasound at the discretion of the operator in order to conform to our
      standard of care at the NIH.

      ELIGIBILITY

      Subjects are eligible if:

        1. they are over 18 years of age

        2. they are scheduled for image guided procedure

        3. the lesion is not superficial (deeper than 3cm)

      Subjects are excluded if:

        1. they have an altered mental status that precludes understanding or consenting for the
           procedure

        2. they are unable to hold reasonably still on a procedure table for the length of the
           procedure

        3. they are unable to hold their breath if the procedure will be performed with conscious
           sedation and without general anesthesia

        4. their gross body weight is over 375 pounds which the upper limit of the CT and

      angiography tables

      REQUIRED SAMPLE SIZE

      A pilot study will be performed to ensure operator experience with Xperguide and EM
      tracking, for fair comparison. In the pilot study each operator must perform 5 cases with
      Xperguide completing the case report forms. There are 5 potential operators therefore a
      maximum of 25 patients (if all 5 operators participate to the fullest).

      The first phase of the main trial comparing Xperguide with conventional CT was powered (for
      sample size) with a standard superiority design aimed to statistically establish that
      Xperguide is better than conventional CT (defined as requiring fewer needle repositioning
      efforts). These calculations yield a total sample size of 60 patients with 20 patients per
      anatomical site.

      For the second phase of the trial comparing Xperguide to EM tracking, a two sided
      equivalence design (based on accuracy and number of needle repositioning) was used for
      sample size considerations, and yielded 192 patients. Therefore 16 patients per modality per
      anatomical site will be randomized with two additional cohorts for PET-CT/MR procedures and
      composite ablations.
