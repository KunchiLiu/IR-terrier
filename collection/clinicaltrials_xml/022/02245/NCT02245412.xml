      The objectives of this trial are to evaluate the safety, tolerability,
      pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) and efficacy of intravenous (IV) ALXN1007 in
      subjects with acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) of the lower gastrointestinal (GI)
      tract.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must be males or females age 18 years or older.

          -  Subjects with Stage 1-4 (per the Modified Keystone Grading Schema) acute GVHD of the
             lower GI tract, without signs of chronic GVHD, at the time of diagnosis, which
             developed in the first 180 days following allogeneic hematopoietic cell
             transplantation (HCT) using bone marrow, peripheral blood, or cord blood; or after
             preplanned donor lymphocyte infusion.

          -  Subjects are willing to undergo or must have had an endoscopy of the upper and/or
             lower GI tract and biopsy to confirm GI GVHD.

          -  Subjects must be receiving systemic corticosteroids.

             (for at least 3 months after the last dose of ALXN1007 if study treatment is stopped
             early or subject withdraws consent).

          -  Male subjects must not donate sperm during the Screening and Treatment periods, and
             for at least 3 months after the last dose of ALXN1007.

               -  Stage of acute GVHD of the lower GI tract will be determined using the Modified
                  Keystone Grading Schema.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with a body weight &gt; 140 kg (for Cohorts dosing 20 mg/kg of ALXN1007 and
             higher only).

             withdrawal.

             donor lymphocyte infusion.

          -  Subjects who received previous systemic treatment for acute GVHD, except for a
             maximum of 3 days (72 hours) of 2 mg/kg corticosteroid therapy.

          -  Subjects with unresolved veno-occlusive disease of the liver.

          -  Subjects with creatinine clearance &lt;40 mL/minute at Screening, as calculated by the
             Cockroft-Gault formula.

          -  Subjects known to be infectged with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B
             or hepatitis C.

          -  Subjects known to have an uncontrolled thyroid disorder.

          -  Subjects who are pregnant, breast feeding or sexually active and unwilling to use
             effective birth control for the duration of the study.

          -  Subjects who participated in any other investigational drug trial or had exposure to
             any other investigational agent, device or procedure &lt;4 weeks prior to Screening and
             throughout the entire trial, with the exception of investigational drugs administered
             prophylactically for CMV post allogeneic HCT.
