  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The sentinel node has a fundamental role in the management of early breast cancer.

      Currently, the double detection of blue and radioisotope is recommended. A radioactive
      material requires the presence of a nuclear medicine department and the approval of health
      authorities. In many centers, this technique is not available. The use of blue is easier to
      implement technique. However, allergic reactions and prolonged breast tattoo led many teams
      to stop the practice.

      So in common practice, many center use a single method. However, with a single detection,
      the risk of false negatives and the identification failure rate increased to a significant
      extent and the number of sentinel lymph node detected and removed is not enough.

      Under these conditions, find another method of detection seems crucial. According to the
      literature, the fluorescence method (ICG) is a technique that seems safe and reliable.

      The investigators therefore propose a prospective, randomized study to investigate the
      interest of fluorescence associated with the isotopic method.
