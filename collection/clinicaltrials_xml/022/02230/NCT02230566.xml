  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Phase 3 study will use a novel randomized, intra-subject placebo-controlled, single
      crossover design, referred to as Blind Start, to evaluate the safety and efficacy of UX003.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Blind Start is a novel design whereby subjects will be randomized to one of 4 groups,
      each representing a different treatment sequence, and cross over to UX003 at different
      pre-defined time points in a blinded manner. All groups will receive a minimum of 24 weeks
      treatment with 4 mg/kg UX003 every other week.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Confirmed diagnosis of MPS 7 based on leukocyte or fibroblast glucuronidase enzyme
             assay or genetic testing

          -  Elevated uGAG excretion at a minimum of 3-fold over the mean normal for age (at
             Screening)

          -  Apparent clinical signs of lysosomal storage disease as judged by the Investigator,
             including at least one of the following: enlarged liver and spleen, joint
             limitations, airway obstruction or pulmonary problems, limitation of mobility while
             still ambulatory

          -  Aged 5 - 35 years, inclusive

          -  Willing and able to provide written informed consent, or in the case of subjects
             under the age of 18 (or 16 years, depending on the region), provide written assent
             (if required) and written informed consent by a legally authorized representative
             after the nature of the study has been explained, and prior to any research-related
             procedures.

          -  Sexually active subjects must be willing to use acceptable highly effective methods
             of contraception while participating in the study and for 30 days following the last
             dose.

          -  Females of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test at Screening
             and be willing to have additional pregnancy tests during the study. Females
             considered not of childbearing potential include those who have not experienced
             menarche, or have had tubal ligation at least one year prior to Screening, or who
             have had total hysterectomy.

          -  Naïve to treatment with UX003

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Undergone a successful bone marrow or stem cell transplant or has any degree of
             detectable chimaerism with donor cells

          -  Major surgery within 3 months prior to study entry or planned major surgery during
             the study that may not allow safe participation in the study

          -  Presence or history of any hypersensitivity to rhGUS or its excipients that, in the
             judgment of the Investigator, places the subject at increased risk for adverse
             effects.

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding at Screening or planning to become pregnant (self or
             partner) at any time during the study

          -  Use of any investigational product (drug or device or combination) within 30 days
             prior to Screening, or requirement for any investigational agent prior to completion
             of all scheduled study assessments.

          -  Presence of a condition of such severity and acuity that, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, warrants immediate surgical intervention or other treatment or may not
             allow safe participation in the study.

          -  Concurrent disease or condition, or laboratory abnormality that, in the view of the
             Investigator, places the subject at high risk of poor treatment compliance or of not
             completing the study, or would interfere with study participation or introduce
             additional safety concerns.
