    <description>The primary efficacy endpoint of this study is the overall intracranial response rate (OIRR), which is defined as the percentage of subjects whose intracranial response is a confirmed Complete Response (CR) or Partial response (PR) assessed by Investigators using modified RECIST, version 1.1</description>

    <description>Vemurafenib (960 mg twice a day) will be taken on Days 1 - 28 of each 28-day treatment cycle. The first dose of vemurafenib should be taken in the morning, and the second dose should be taken in the evening. Vemurafenib can be taken with or without a meal and should be taken with a glass of water.
Cobimetinib (60 mg once a day) will be taken on Days 1 - 21 of each 28-day treatment cycle. The cobimetinib tablet should be taken at approximately the same time each day in the morning with the vemurafenib dose, but no later than 4 hours after the scheduled time. Cobimetinib can be taken with or without a meal and should never be chewed, cut, or crushed and should be taken with a glass of water.</description>

          -  Histologically confirmed metastatic melanoma (Stage IV), carrying BRAF V600-mutation

          -  Melanoma must be documented to contain a BRAFV600 mutation by a CLIA approved
             laboratory

          -  At least one measurable intracranial target lesion for which all of the following
             criteria are met:

               1. previously untreated or progressive according to RECIST 1.1 (equal to or greater
                  than 20% increase in longest diameter on baseline scan) after previous local
                  therapy (SRS and/or craniotomy)

               2. immediate local therapy clinically not indicated or patient is not a suitable
                  candidate to receive immediate local therapy (SRS and/or craniotomy)

               3. largest diameter of ≥ 0.5cm but ≤ 4 cm as determined by contrast-enhanced MRI

          -  Prior therapies for extracranial metastatic melanoma including chemo-, cytokine-,
             immuno-, biological- and vaccine-therapy will be allowed but prior BRAF or MEK not
             allowed

          -  ECOG PS 0-2

          -  Life expectancy &gt;12 weeks

          -  Age 18 years or older

          -  Adequate bone marrow function as indicated by the following:

               1. ANC &gt; 1500/µL

               2. Platelets ≥ 100,000/µL

               3. Hemoglobin &gt; 9 g/dL

          -  Adequate renal function, as indicated by creatinine =/&lt; 1.5 x the upper limit of
             normal (ULN)

          -  Adequate liver function, as indicated by bilirubin =/&lt; 1.5 x ULN

          -  AST or ALT &lt; 3 x ULN (patients with documented liver metastases: AST and/or ALT =/&lt; 5
             x ULN)

          -  Able to swallow pills

          -  Negative serum pregnancy test within 7 days prior to commencement of dosing in
             premenopausal women. Women of non-childbearing potential may be included without
             serum pregnancy test if they are either surgically sterile or have been
             postmenopausal for ≥ 1 year

          -  Fertile men and women must use an effective method of contraception during treatment
             and for at least 6 months after completion of treatment as directed by their
             physician. Effective methods of contraception are defined as those which result in a
             low failure rate (i.e., less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly
             (for example implants, injectables, combined oral contraception or intra-uterine
             devices). At the discretion of the Investigator, acceptable methods of contraception
             may include total abstinence in cases where the lifestyle of the patient ensures
             compliance. (Periodic abstinence [e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,
             post-ovulation methods] and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.)
