  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Beta-2-agonists are effective in reducing airway narrowing in asthma and protecting against
      stimuli that produce bronchoconstriction. The combination of long-acting beta agonists
      (LABA) and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) has become the most commonly used asthma controller
      medication class in the United States, but unfortunately, even when LABAs are added to ICS
      and used regularly, 58-81% of patients with asthma fail to achieve total control. Regular
      use of beta-agonists, both short and long-acting, reduces the ability of these agents to
      protect against the airway narrowing that occurs in asthma in response to bronchoconstrictor
      stimuli. We refer to this reduced effect as loss of bronchoprotection. In this proof of
      concept trial we aim to determine if alendronate, which diminishes beta-2 adrenergic
      receptor internalization, can reduce the loss of bronchoprotection that occurs with regular
      use of LABAs, even when used in combination with ICS.
