  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Family health history can help identify patients at higher than average risk for disease.
      There is no standardized system for collecting and updating family health history, using
      this information to determine a patient's disease risk level, and providing screening
      recommendations to patients and providers. Patients will enter their family health history
      into MeTree, a family history software program. The program will produce screening
      recommendations tailored to the patient's family health history. The investigators will
      examine whether this process increases physician referrals for, and patient uptake of,
      guideline-recommended screening for colorectal cancer.

    <textblock>
      Eligible patients are aged 40-65 years, enrolled in primary care, do not have a personal
      history of colorectal cancer, and have some knowledge of family health history. In Aim 1, a
      retrospective chart review will be conducted to determine the baseline rate of documenting
      family health history of colorectal cancer in the medical record for patients enrolled in
      the Aim 2 randomized trial. In Aim 2, consented patients will be randomized to provide
      patient-entered family health history and receive patient and provider decision support at
      enrollment or 12 months later (wait-list control). The primary outcome is risk-appropriate
      CRC screening/surveillance referral for patients 12 months post-enrollment. Secondary
      outcomes include patient uptake of recommendations and referral for genetic consultation 12
      months post-enrollment. In Aim 3, qualitative interviews will be conducted with physicians
      and clinic leaders; data will be analyzed using conventional content analysis. In Aim 4,
      data will be obtained from the administrative databases and patient medical records to
      conduct a budget impact analysis.
