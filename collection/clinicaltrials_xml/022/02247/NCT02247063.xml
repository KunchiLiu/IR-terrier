    <textblock>
      The investigators are doing a study to learn about the effects of a type of low-energy
      non-surgical electrical brain stimulation (HD-tDCS) on chronic pain in people's jaw joints.
      Disorders in these joints are called temporomandibular joint disorders, or TMD.

    <textblock>
      Chronic temporomandibular joint disorders (TMD) represent clinical problems in which
      empirical treatments offer uncertain relief for a large number of patients. Many
      conventional therapies are ineffectual, leading to persistent treatment failure and/or poor
      iatrogenic-induced results; which raises the possibility that the cause for their pain
      endurance may also lie in the brain milieu. Although MRI-based techniques have provided
      insights into some neuroplastic mechanisms of TMD in humans, many questions regarding its
      molecular mechanisms in vivo are still unanswered. First, how are endogenous μ-opioid
      mechanisms in the brain, known to be centrally involved in pain regulation, affected by
      acute and chronic TMD pain? Second, how can they be directly modulated to provide analgesic
      effect on pain measures? Finally, what are the neuroplastic effects in the brain after
      continuous modulation of those molecular mechanisms? The understanding of these processes is
      crucial to determine the mechanisms engaged in the persistence and, most important, the
      alleviation of TMD.

      Preliminary studies from our center, using positron emission tomography (PET) with [11C]
      carfentanil, a selective radiotracer for mu-opioid receptor (muOR), have demonstrated that
      there is a decrease in μOR availability (non-displaceable binding potential -BPND) in key
      pain-related structures in the brains of chronic trigeminal pain patients, which correlated
      with their clinical pain measures. We propose to demonstrate that acute (masseteric pain
      challenge) and chronic clinical pain measures in TMD patients are correlated with μ-opioid
      receptor (µOR) non-displaceable binding potential (BPND) in the thalamus and other
      pain-related regions.

    <description>The subjects in the placebo arm will participate in 5 daily M1 High-Definition Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (HD-tDCS) sessions. During each session, a modular EEG recording cap will be placed on the subject's head and the anodal electrode will be placed on the motor cortex contralateral to the worst TMD pain side (C3). Current will be applied only for 30 seconds - this is a reliable method of sham stimulation (Gandiga et al., 2006) as sensations arising from tDCS treatment occur only at the beginning of application.</description>
