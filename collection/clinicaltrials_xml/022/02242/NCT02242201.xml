  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Total hip arthroplasty is a one of the most commonly performed surgical procedures with
      increasing numbers anticipated over the next several decades. Differences in the analgesia
      outcomes between these three intervention groups would provide for an evidenced-based
      clinical pathway that will emerge as a result of this study.

      Hypothesis:

      Patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty within a clinical pathway utilizing preemptive
      low-dose opioid and non-opioid medications for multimodal analgesia randomized to peripheral
      nerve blockade will report less pain with movement on an NRS scale POD #1 compared to
      randomization to periarticular injection with ropivacaine mixture or periarticular injection
      with liposomal bupivacaine (Exparel&amp;#174;).

    <description>To evaluate the hypothesis that our current total joint regional anesthesia pathway of continuous posterior lumbar plexus nerve block with multimodal analgesia is more effective than two other pathways utilizing periarticular local anesthesia injections for numeric rating score (NRS) of pain with movement after total hip arthroplasty (THA) on POD #1 morning. The periarticular injections include one consisting of ropivacaine and the other consisting of liposomal bupivacaine (Exparel®).</description>
