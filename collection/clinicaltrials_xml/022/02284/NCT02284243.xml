  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the analgesic efficacy, on Post-Operative
      Day (POD) 1, of DEX-IN compared with placebo, using the summed pain intensity difference
      over the first 48 hours (SPID48) in subjects with acute moderate to severe pain following
      unilateral bunionectomy.
