  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer routinely undergo a CT scan to identify whether
      the cancer has spread to other parts of the body, but diagnosis of secondary cancer in the
      liver is difficult using conventional CT. MRI is known to be better than CT at diagnosing
      cancer in the liver but it takes a long time to do. Recently it has been suggested that
      limited MRI of the liver can identify most cancer in the liver, however this has not yet
      been proven to be effective in patients with a new diagnosis of colorectal cancer. The
      purpose of this study is to test whether a quick MRI scan of the liver at the time
      colorectal cancer is diagnosed can identify more cancer that has spread to the liver than
      conventional CT.

      All patients who have been diagnosed with a high risk type of colorectal cancer but no liver
      metastases on CT will be eligible to take part in the study.

    <textblock>
      Everyone who agrees to take part will have a short specialist MRI scan, called diffusion
      weighted MRI, to look for cancer in the liver. Normally you will have this scan within 4
      weeks of joining the study. You will be able to start your cancer treatment while you are in
      the study so having this scan will not delay the start of your treatment. If the diffusion
      weighted MRI scan of the liver is abnormal you will asked to return for another MRI scan of
      your liver, this time with an injection of contrast during the scan, to establish whether
      you have cancer in the liver. If this scan is positive for cancer your doctors will discuss
      with you the best method of treating your colorectal cancer and the cancer in your liver,
      which may include additional chemotherapy, radiotherapy or another operation.

      We also want to find out about your quality of life; therefore we will ask you to fill out a
      short questionnaire at one year and at two years after you join the study.

      All participants will be followed up by their doctors, as per standard. There are no follow
      up visits specifically for the study although we will carefully monitor your progress for
      three years.
