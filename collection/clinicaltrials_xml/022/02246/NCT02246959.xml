  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In a 4-arm, randomized controlled trial, we will evaluate the relative effectiveness and
      cost-effectiveness of improving cholesterol levels among participants who are at high risk
      of CVD and who have elevated LDL cholesterol levels by testing process versus outcomes
      financial incentives. Participants will use electronic pill bottles that continuously
      monitor statin adherence. The primary outcome will be change in LDL cholesterol over 12
      months.
