  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of
      ascending doses of adjuvant in combination with a single dosage level of RSV sF in adults 60
      years or older who are healthy or who have stable, chronic underlying medical conditions.
      This study will also provide preliminary safety and immunogenicity data to support
      concurrent dosing of MEDI7510 with influenza vaccine (IIV), and to assess the safety of
      MEDI7510 at a dose previously assessed in the Phase 1a study.

      A Phase 1b, double-blind, randomized, controlled cohort escalation study evaluating the
      safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of MEDI7510.

      Approximately 264 subjects will be enrolled at approximately 5 study centers in the US and
      randomized by cohort (Cohort 1 [4:1]; Cohorts 2 and 3 [8:8:3]; Cohort 4 [5:1]) to receive a
      single intramuscular dose of 1 study vaccine (Cohorts 1 and 4) or a single intramuscular
      dose of each of 2 study vaccines (Cohorts 2 and 3) administered in contralateral arms.

      Cohort 1: MEDI7510 formulation (n = 40) or IIV (n = 10) Cohort 2: MEDI7510 formulation and
      placebo (n = 40) or MEDI7510 formulation and IIV (n = 40) or placebo and IIV (n = 15) Cohort
      3: MEDI7510 formulation and placebo (n = 40) or MEDI7510 formulation and IIV (n = 40) or
      placebo and IIV (n = 15) Cohort 4: MEDI7510 formulation (n = 20) or IIV (n = 4)

             11 g/dL for men

          -  Subject able to complete follow-up period of 360 days after dosing

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of allergy to: any component of the vaccine; IIV or intolerance of IIV; eggs
             in adulthood

          -  Receipt of seasonal flu shot within 60 days prior to dosing

          -  Any unstable acute or chronic medical condition, including one that has resulted in
             change in therapy (medication or other) in the 30 days prior to randomization or
             hospitalization in the previous year or might be predicted to result in
             hospitalization in the year after enrollment. Subjects with severe, untreated or
             uncontrolled underlying medical disease that might either compromise subject safety
             or affect the ability to assess safety of the investigational product are excluded.
             Medications taken on an as-needed basis are permitted to start or stop during the 30
             days prior to randomization unless they are medications not previously taken by the
             subject

          -  Clinically significant abnormalities in screening laboratory assessments or screening
             ECG

             infection, or medications. Any oral prednisone dosing within 30 days of enrollment or
             planned dosing within the 360-day follow-up period would disqualify. Expected need
             for immunosuppressive medications during the 360-day follow-up period would
             disqualify

          -  History of splenectomy or of condition affecting splenic function (eg,
             hemoglobinopathy)

          -  History of cancer within preceding 5 years other than treated non-melanoma skin
             cancer

          -  Body Mass Index 40 or higher

          -  Expected receipt of antipyretic or analgesic medication on a daily or every other day
             basis from randomization through 72 hours after receipt of IP (Note: A daily dose of
             aspirin is not considered a contraindication to enrollment.)

          -  Subjects who have significant scarring, tattoos, abrasions, cuts, or infections over
             the deltoid region of both arms that, in the investigators opinion, could interfere
             with evaluation of injection site local reactions

          -  Concurrent enrollment in another clinical study that involves any invasive clinical
             procedure, including phlebotomy
