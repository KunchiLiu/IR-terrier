  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate and compare the efficacy of 3% oregano extract ointment
      prepared in aqueous solution versus 1% hydrocortisone ointment, a standard treatment, in
      decreasing the inflammation associated with mild to moderate atopic dermatitis. We plan to
      recruit 40 patients on the ages comprised between 2 and 17 years old and the study duration
      for each of the patient is 1 month.

      A single-center, investigator initiated, randomized controlled, double-blind trial will be
      conducted to determine the effects of an oregano extract in aqueous solution versus 1%
      hydrocortisone in the treatment of acute-subacute pediatric AD. We suspect that topical
      oregano will serve as an effective, non-steroidal AD therapy, simultaneously offering extra
      benefits to pediatric patients as oregano is a natural product with antimicrobial,
      anti-inflammatory, and antiseptic properties that lacks reports of adverse effects
      associated with steroids, which children have been noted to be more susceptible to.
