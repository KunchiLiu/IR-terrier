      The purpose of this study is to determine whether undermining during cutaneous surgery
      improves scar cosmesis compared to wound closure without undermining. Our aims are to
      compare outcomes using a split wound model, where half the wound is undermined and the other
      half is not. This will be measured via the physician observer scar assessment scale, a
      validated scar instrument and via wound width. Our hypothesis is that wound undermining will
      result in cosmetically superior wound outcomes.

    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>After surgical procedure, half of the subject's wound will be closed after undermining, while the other half is closed without undermining. After 3 months, subjects will return to clinic for evaluation of the cosmesis of both types of closure techniques.</description>

    <measure>Measurement of Scar Width</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The width of the scar will be measured 1 centimeter from the midline on both sides. There is no defined width that is considered satisfactory or not satisfactory. The measurements will be compared between subjects.</description>

    <description>The side assigned to undermining will have undermining performed prior to wound closure in the subcutaneous plane. The amount of undermining will range from 1 cm for wounds with low tension to 2 cm for those with moderate tension. Since wound diameter will be 3 cm or less and exclude the scalp, high tension wounds are not anticipated.</description>
