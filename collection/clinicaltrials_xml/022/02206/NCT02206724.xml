      The investigators aim to test the safety and feasibility of prostate gland stereotactic body
      radiotherapy (SBRT) plus best systemic therapy in newly diagnosed metastatic prostate
      cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators and other investigators have previously documented the safety and efficacy
      of definitive intent stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) in the treatment of localized
      prostate cancer.

      In the metastatic setting for multiple malignancies, improved survival rates and disease
      outcomes have been shown with definitive treatment of the primary disease site. This concept
      of &quot;cytoreductive&quot; surgery or decreasing the primary tumor burden is now considered the
      standard of care for metastatic colon, ovarian, renal cell, and some breast carcinomas (plus
      post-surgery irradiation).

      With new guidelines and declining rates of PSA screening, the incidence of newly diagnosed
      metastatic prostate cancer is expected to increase. A recent population-based study has
      concluded significant improvements in the definitive treatment of the local prostate cancer
      in the stage IV setting with either radical prostatectomy or conventional prostate radiation
      treatments/brachytherapy. To our knowledge, one prospective phase II trial is currently
      accruing patients to best systemic therapy or best systemic therapy (BST) plus definitive
      treatment with either radical prostatectomy or conventionally fractionated radiation therapy

      The investigators hypothesize that the addition of primary disease SBRT to best systemic
      therapy for newly diagnosed metastatic prostate cancer would be associated with an
      acceptable safety profile, quality of life, disease progression, and overall survival. The
      addition of SBRT to best systemic therapy is also expected to be better-received for stage
      IV patients (with relatively limited prognosis), vs. fully fractionated radiation therapy,
      brachytherapy, or radical prostatectomy. The above endpoints would initially be tested in a
      prospective phase II multi-institutional trial and in comparison with historical controls.
