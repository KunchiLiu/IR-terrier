      RATIONALE: Currently, adjuvant endocrine therapy often follows a &quot;one-size-fits- all&quot;
      approach, with most premenopausal women receiving tamoxifen, and most postmenopausal
      receiving aromatase inhibitor therapy. In current clinical practice, patients with invasive
      lobular carcinoma are treated no differently than patients with invasive ductal carcinoma
      based on the void of information specific to patients with this tumor type. Identification
      of a biological signal of tamoxifen and/or AI-resistance and/or fulvestrant-sensitivity in
      ILC patients would have dramatic implications for the future management of this breast
      cancer subtype.

      PURPOSE: To study whether fulvestrant is more effective than anastrozole or tamoxifen in
      reducing Ki67 in ILC and whether that Ki67 reduction will correlate with alterations in
      expression of ER and ER-regulated genes. Differential Ki67 effect in this study will serve
      as a surrogate for outcome of ILC patients on endocrine therapy.

      Primary Objective:

      To determine the change from baseline to post-treatment Ki67 values in ER-positive,
      HER2-negative ILC tissue derived from postmenopausal women awaiting definitive surgery or
      further neoadjuvant treatment who are randomized to 21-24 days of neoadjuvant endocrine
      treatments with fulvestrant (two 250 mg IM injections given on day 1), anastrozole (1mg
      given orally daily), or tamoxifen (20mg given orally daily).

      OBJECTIVES

      Primary

      To determine the change from baseline to post-treatment Ki67 values in ER-positive,
      HER2-negative ILC tissue derived from postmenopausal women awaiting definitive surgery or
      further neoadjuvant treatment who are randomized to 21-24 days of neoadjuvant endocrine
      treatments with fulvestrant (two 250 mg IM injections given on day 1), anastrozole (1mg
      given orally daily), or tamoxifen (20mg given orally daily).

      Secondary

        -  To evaluate ER protein expression in ILC tissues at baseline and following neoadjuvant
           endocrine therapy.

        -  To evaluate PR protein expression in ILC tissues at baseline and following neo-adjuvant
           endocrine therapy.

        -  To evaluate ER-related and ILC-specific candidate gene mRNA expression in ILC tissues
           at baseline and following neoadjuvant endocrine therapy in an effort to identify
           biomarkers of endocrine response and putative drivers of endocrine resistance in ILC.

        -  To evaluate associations between changes in Ki67 in ILC tissues following neoadjuvant
           endocrine therapy with ER and PR protein expression, or ER and candidate gene mRNA
           expression at baseline and post-treatment.

      Exploratory

        -  To evaluate DNA methylation in ILC tissues at baseline and following neo-adjuvant
           endocrine therapy.

        -  To evaluate associations between germline and somatic DNA sequence variants with
           changes in Ki67 in ILC tissues following neo-adjuvant endocrine therapy.

        -  To evaluate the activity of signaling pathways in ILC tissues by immunohistochemical or
           other protein analyses, such as histone modifications, at baseline and following
           neo-adjuvant endocrine therapy.

    <measure>Ki67 proliferative index</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 21 compared to baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Ki67 proliferative index is measured as the percent of positively staining cells. Given the log-normal distribution of the Ki67 measurements generally observed in this population[59], values will be log-transformed for statistical analysis. Therefore, the primary endpoint of the change in Ki67 at Day 21 compared to baseline is given by log(Ki67Day 21/Ki67BL). For descriptive purposes, summary statistics and corresponding 95% confidence intervals for BL, Day 21 and percent change from baseline will be reported within study arm on the original scale.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically confirmed invasive lobular breast cancer that is hormone
             receptor-positive and HER2-negative, measuring at least 1 centimeter (cm)
             radiographically or clinically, clinical stages I-III. Invasive lobular histology
             will be diagnosed at the enrolling institution for purposes of study participation.
             Subsequently, invasive lobular histology will be confirmed by central pathology
             review, but this central review will not be required prior to patient enrollment.

          -  Prior to initiation of study agents, study participants must agree to both a baseline
             research core biopsy, and if definitive surgery is not performed at day 21-24 after
             treatment, a second post-treatment research core biopsy. For patients undergoing
             surgery, the second biopsy will be removed from tissue excised during their
             operation.

          -  Hormone receptor (HR) status of the invasive component must be documented on the
             diagnostic core biopsy before trial enrollment. The tumor must be ER-positive. ER
             will be considered positive if staining is 1% or greater. This will be determined at
             the enrolling institution for purposes of study participation and enrollment onto the
             trial. Subsequently, HR status will be confirmed by central pathology review, but
             this central review will not be required prior to enrolling the patient.

          -  Patients must be female

          -  Participants must be fully postmenopausal

          -  ECOG performance status of 0, 1 or 2

          -  Adequate organ and marrow function as defined below:

               -  leukocytes &gt;3,000/mm3

               -  absolute neutrophil count &gt;1,500/mm3

               -  platelets &gt;100,000/mm3

               -  total bilirubin within normal laboratory limits

               -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) &lt;2.5 times the laboratory upper limit of normal

               -  creatinine within normal laboratory limits

          -  Prior use of hormone contraceptives and replacement therapy is allowed (e.g.,
             estrogen and/or progestin), but must have been discontinued at least 30 days prior to
             the diagnostic biopsy. Vaginal preparations (e.g., Vagifem® or Estring®) are allowed.

          -  Participant must be aware of the nature of her malignancy, understand the study
             requirements and risks and be able and willing to sign a written informed consent
             document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior or concurrent use of hormonal therapy, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or
             novel therapy to treat the current breast cancer, including any history of prior
             irradiation to the ipsilateral breast.

          -  Concurrent use of any other investigational agents.

          -  History of allergic reactions/hypersensitivity attributed to compounds of similar
             chemical or biologic composition to tamoxifen, anastrozole, or fulvestrant or any of
             their ingredients.

          -  History of thromboembolic disease or uterine cancer that is considered a
             contraindication to tamoxifen.

          -  Active hepatitis viral infections.

          -  Uncontrolled current illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  HER-2 positivity.
