    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Abbott Sensor
      Based Glucose Monitoring System Personal (System-P) and Abbott Sensor Based Glucose
      Monitoring System Professional (System-Pro) when used as an adjunct to blood glucose testing
      over a 14-day wear period in adult subjects. The Abbott Sensor Based Glucose Monitoring
      System - Professional Sensors will be worn by adult subjects over a 14-day wear period.

      The primary objective is to characterize the Systems performance with respect to YSI
      reference venous sample measurements. The device performance will be primarily evaluated in
      terms of point and rate accuracy of the Abbott Sensor Based Glucose Monitoring Systems in
      reference to YSI.

      Safety of the Abbott Sensor Based Glucose Monitoring Systems will be characterized by
      Adverse Device Effects and Serious Adverse Device Effects experienced by study participants.

      240 subjects will be enrolled and additional healthy subjects may also be enrolled in the
      study as training subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sensors are inserted into the back of the subject's upper arm for up to fourteen (14) days.
      The subjects are expected to perform capillary BG tests during the 14-day sensor wear. Three
      in clinic visits are scheduled during the 14-day sensor wear period. During each in-clinic
      visit, study staff performed IV blood draws to obtain venous blood for YSI reference glucose
      measurements.

               -  intensive insulin therapy (insulin therapy through an insulin pump and/or
                  multiple daily insulin injections) or

               -  non-intensive insulin therapy (Basal insulin, injectable non-insulin
                  anti-diabetic agents such as a pramlintide or GLP-1 agonists, NPH insulin either
                  alone or in combination with regular insulin or fast acting insulin analogue, or
