  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children who are hospitalized are especially vulnerable to the effects of tobacco use and
      dependence among their caregivers, and they are more likely to be exposed than children who
      are not hospitalized. Hospitalization is an important teachable moment for health care
      providers to intervene with tobacco dependent parents, and help them reduce their child's
      exposure, potentially improving outcomes after hospitalization, and their future health.
      Understanding the best way to approach and intervene with these families will provide the
      investigator with the necessary information to create a sustainable intervention that can be
      disseminated to hospitals across the country that provide pediatric care, and to ultimately
      make a significant improvement in the health of children.

      This study is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to determine whether the proposed bundled
      intervention is superior to usual care in the pediatric inpatient setting can decrease
      children's secondhand smoke exposure, and encourage their parents to make smoke-free home
      rules and quit smoking, as measured by a validated survey and biomarkers.

      We have developed an intervention that bundles the best evidence for tobacco dependence
      treatment, including the United States Public Health Service (USPHS) guidelines, and
      evidence from parent-specific interventions, to create a sustainable, transferrable
      intervention specific to using the inpatient stay to help parents quit smoking and reduce
      their children's exposure. The intervention bundle includes screening for exposure,
      assessing readiness to quit, providing at least one brief motivational interviewing session
      in the hospital, dispensing nicotine replacement therapy if appropriate, providing a smoking
      cessation/reduction starter kit and arranging for follow up after the child is discharged.

      INSPIRE specific aims:

      Aim 1: To assess the efficacy of the intervention in increasing parent report of having
      smoke-free homes and cars 6 and 12 months after hospitalization

      Aim 2: To demonstrate whether children whose parents receive the intervention bundle have
      greater decreases in cotinine levels 6 and 12 months post-hospitalization

      Aim 3: To assess the efficacy of the intervention in increasing parent quit rates 6 and 12
      months after hospitalization

      Aim 4 (Exploratory): To use implementation process measures from the RE-AIM framework to
      assess the extent that our intervention results in hospital-wide systems change, including
      automatic screening for tobacco smoke exposure and delivery of tobacco control services.
