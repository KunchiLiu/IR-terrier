  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to see whether wearing a weighted vest during a period
      of active weight loss can decrease the loss of muscle and bone that occurs during weight
      loss. We will also determine if study participants who wear the weighted vest will have
      greater improvements in physical function and self-reported disability, pain, stiffness,
      fatigue and quality of life. This knowledge could impact weight loss programs designed for
      older adults.

      Hypothesis: Participants randomized to VEST will experience similar weight loss, but less
      loss of lean mass and bone density, than participants randomized to Control.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The loss of muscle mass and bone density during weight loss is partially attributed to the
      decrease in mechanical stress on these tissues as weight is reduced. As a result, performing
      exercises that enhance muscle and gravitational loading during the period of caloric
      restriction usually diminishes the relative amount of muscle and bone loss for a given
      weight loss, but these interventions do not fully prevent all muscle and bone loss.In
      addition, conventional exercise training interventions often require expensive equipment,
      on-site participation, and, ideally for older, obese adults, safety supervision by trained
      exercise leaders. Moreover, the exercises performed may not fully translate into improvement
      in daily tasks due to training specificity, and are not always tolerated or sustained,
      especially in obese persons with OA. On the other hand, it is conceivable that treating the
      decrease in mechanical load from weight loss by externally replacing lost weight via use of
      a weighted vest may also be effective for reducing muscle and bone loss during caloric
      restriction. In animal models, mechanisms regulating skeletal tissue structure and function
      respond in a similar fashion to increases in actual or externally-added body mass. Also,
      research shows that exercising while wearing weighted vests can improve bone density, muscle
      mass, and lower extremity strength in older adults. However, no prior studies have examined
      the effects of weighted vest use on muscle mass and bone density during a period of
      intentional weight loss.

      The main objective of this pilot study is to assess feasibility (accrual, retention,
      compliance) of daily use of a weighted vest during a diet intervention, to estimate the
      variability of outcome measures, and to obtain preliminary estimates of treatment efficacy.
      A controlled, randomized design will be used so we can obtain a realistic estimate of
      accrual and an unbiased estimate of treatment efficacy.

      A total of 36 older (age=65-79 yrs), obese (BMI=30-40 kg/m2), sedentary men and women with
      x-ray evidence of knee OA will undergo a 22 week weight loss intervention (targeting 10%
      weight loss) with randomization to one of two groups (n=18/grp): 1) No vest use (Control);
      or 2) Progressive weighted vest use during normal daily activities (VEST).
