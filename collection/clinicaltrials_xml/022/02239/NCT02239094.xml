      We propose to conduct a pilot study of biological predictors of lurasidone response in
      bipolar depression.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We propose to enroll 20 participants with a bipolar disorder who are currently in an episode
      of major depression.We shall conduct magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), recordings of brain
      electrical activity (EEG), and psychological testing to explore possible predictors of
      lurasidone treatment response. Blood samples will be collected for a future study of blood
      protein predictors of response. After testing, participants will receive an open-label
      8-week trial of lurasidone (Latudaâ„¢) at approved dosage levels. Participants who attain
      remission of their major depressive episode will be eligible for a six-month continuation
      phase to explore predictors of sustained response to continuation treatment. Data analyses
      will use statistical testing to explore potential biological predictors of lurasidone
      response. This will provide a framework for clarifying which patients are best suited to
      this treatment and begin to develop a model for precision treatment of this
      difficult-to-treat disorder.

          4. At least moderate severity of depression

          5. Agrees to, and is eligible for, electroencephalogram (EEG) / psychological testing,
             magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and blood draws

          6. Provides informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Current drug or alcohol abuse/dependence, except nicotine (within 6 months for

             anticonvulsants, mood stabilizers, stimulants, antidepressant medications,
             medications with significant interactions with lurasidone, except during the washout
             prior to testing and blood collection

          3. Unstable medical condition, including significant liver disease, hypothyroidism
             (i.e., condition not adequately stabilized for 3 months), and conditions likely to
