  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators assume that transcutaneous electric acupoint stimulation (TEAS)
      pretreatment may activate the endogenous protective mechanism, as a result protect the
      patients against subsequent surgical stress pregnancy. And TEAS may induce the production of
      endogenous analgesic transmitters, so develop an anesthetic-sparing effect. The
      investigators believe this intervention will reduce the subsequent incidence, duration and
      severity of organ dysfunction, possibly reducing the morbidity, even mortality. So in this
      study, the investigators hypothesize that TEAS before anesthesia and during surgery would
      decrease the morbidity and mortality of postoperative complications in 30 days after
      digestive surgery in elderly patients .

      Patients older than 65 years old are at higher risk of postoperative morbidity and
      mortality. With the increasing number of old patients scheduled for digestive surgery,
      exploring methods to decrease postoperative morbidity is very important. Noninvasive methods
      may be easier to clinically use. Transcutaneous electric acupoint stimulation (TEAS)has been
      proved to decrease need for general anesthetics during anesthesia, and to alleviate systemic
      inflammatory response. Considering the morbidity and mortality after surgery is closely
      related to use of anesthetics and inflammatory response,TEAS may be a good selection for
      improving postoperative outcomes.Among the postoperative complications, pulmonary
      complication and systemic inflammatory response syndrome is with higher incidence, so we
      will focus on these two complications in our study.
