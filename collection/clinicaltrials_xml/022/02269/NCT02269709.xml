  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to distinguish between the impacts of congestion and fibrosis
      on liver stiffness in post-Fontan operation pediatric patients using a new form of
      ultrasound (Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse (ARFI) elastography)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Fontan repair for single ventricle congenital heart lesions consists of three stages,
      and long-term survival is expected. Stage 3 introduces immediate congestion of blood within
      the liver by increasing central venous pressure (CVP) and many patients later develop
      progressive liver fibrosis. There are no established, noninvasive means of detecting the
      liver fibrosis until it has become severe. Ultrasound acoustic radiation force impulse
      (ARFI) elastography can noninvasively measure the stiffness of the liver, which is increased
      both by congestion and fibrosis.

      The investigators hypothesize that liver stiffness will be increased by stage 3 of the
      operation due to onset of liver congestions. Using ARFI elastography, the investigators will
      measure liver stiffness before and immediately after stage 3 of the Fontan operation, when
      congestion of blood is likely the only contributor to any change in liver stiffness. The
      investigators will also characterize the relationship between liver stiffness and CVP. The
      investigators will then trend liver stiffness over a one-year time point by repeating the
      ARFI imaging.

    <description>To confirm that sound waves and impulses produces by this new ultrasound-based imaging effectively aids in the diagnosis of liver conditions such as fibrosis in pediatric post Fontan operation patients. ARFI shear wave measurements of the liver will be taken of the right and left lobe to assess stiffness. Measurements are measured in m/s. A total of 32 measurements (16 of each lobe) will be performed on each subject.</description>

    <description>This research scan uses acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) shear wave velocity imaging (SVI), a new ultrasound technology in which unique sound waves create the images/pictures of the liver beng examined/scanned. This ultrasound scan will take approximately 10 minutes to complete.</description>
