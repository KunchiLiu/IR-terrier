  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being implemented to identify the role of prophylactic use of ethanol lock in
      adult patients on home parenteral nutrition (HPN). Central catheter related blood stream
      infection is a major complication in patients on HPN. The investigators hypothesize that the
      prophylactic use of ELT will decrease the number of catheter related blood stream infections
      compared to the control group. The investigators further hypothesize that with the
      introduction of prophylactic ELT, the number of infections will decrease. This will improve
      the quality of life (assessed using Questionnaire) in HPN patients.

    <textblock>
      Catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI) is a serious complication for home parenteral
      nutrition (HPN) patients causing morbidity, mortality, and prolonged hospitalization. CRBSIs
      may also result in the need for central venous catheter (CVC) removal and replacement.
      Current literature supports the use of antibiotics locks in patients with repeated CRBSI.
      There is a growing concern about the increased risk of microbial resistance with the long
      term use antibiotic locks. Ethanol lock therapy (ELT) has broad spectrum coverage and
      includes gram negative bacteria, gram positive bacteria, atypical bacteria, and fungi.
      Compared with antibiotic and other solution locks, which have limitations, ELT has excellent
      broad-spectrum bactericidal and fungicidal killing action and poses no problems with
      development of resistance over time. There is a lack of a randomized controlled study to
      characterize the role of ELT in adult patients on HPN.
