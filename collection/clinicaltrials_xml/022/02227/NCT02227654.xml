    <textblock>
      The present investigation will prospectively evaluate whether serial transvaginal
      ultrasonography with Morphology Index (MI) can further reduce false positive results by more
      accurately distinguishing benign from malignant ovarian tumors. If there is no change in the
      detection of true positive cases, the result will be an increase in the positive predictive
      value of ovarian cancer screening.
