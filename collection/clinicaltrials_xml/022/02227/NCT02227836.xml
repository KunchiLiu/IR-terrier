    <description>As a pilot, 20 patients will be studied to determine the reliability of the allergy patch test (APT) to predict dietary therapy. Reliability of the patch test and dietary therapy will be defined by the endoscopy biopsies.</description>

    <description>Patients referred to Mayo Clinic Rochester with an establish diagnosis of EoE who are nonresponsive to proton pump inhibitor (PPI) medical therapy. Eligible patients will then meet with one of three investigators complete the Mayo Dysphagia Questionaire-30 Day (MDQ-30) following which a standardized Allergy Patch testing (APT) will be conducted. Thereafter, a standard clinically indicated Six Food Elimination Diet treatment completed. Patients will follow up with one of three investigators following the elimination diet who will be blinded to the results of the APT. During this visit responders and nonresponders will be identified and nonresponders will complete a directed elimination diet based on APT results.</description>

    <description>Patient will undergo APT testing per the following protocol:
2g of dry foods will be placed in 2ml of isotonic saline solution. The mixtures will then be placed in aluminum cups (ie Finn chambers) measuring 6 or 12 mm in diameter and adhered to the patient's back.
Foods to be included will be milk, wheat, egg, soy, peanut, tree nut, fish, shellfish, beef, corn, chicken, potato, pork, legumes, barley, rye, tomato, rice, fruits
The patches will be removed at 48 hours, and results read at 72 hours after application.
Reactions will be classified as negative, + (erythema and scattered papules), ++ (erythema and papules), and +++ (erythema and vesicles).</description>
