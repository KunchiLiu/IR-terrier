    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if infusions of a particular type of
      patients' own white blood cells called natural killer (NK) cells can reliably and safely be
      given to patients with brain tumors after the cells have been through a procedure to expand
      (increase) their numbers.

      Researchers also want to learn if NK cells infused through the ommaya reservoir can help to
      control the disease in patients with advanced brain tumors. The ommaya reservoir is a
      catheter system through which NK cells will be infused directly into areas of the brain
      called the fourth ventricle or the lateral.

      This is the first study of NK cells infused into the fourth ventricle of the brain in
      humans.

      Study Groups:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a dose
      level of NK cells based on when you join this study. Up to 4 dose levels of NK cells will be
      tested. Up to 6 participants will be enrolled at each dose level. The first group of
      participants will receive the lowest dose level. Each new group will receive a higher dose
      than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen. This will continue until
      the highest tolerable dose of NK cells is found.

      NK Cell Collection, Expansion, and Infusion:

      Blood (up to 10 tablespoons) will be drawn through your central venous catheter if you have
      one, or through a needle stick.

      Your NK cells will then be processed in The Cell Therapy Laboratory GMP facility at MD
      Anderson to make increased numbers of NK cells. Leftover blood from this process and/or
      extra NK cells beyond what is needed for the study will be used to study the appearance and
      function of your NK cells.

      Your NK cells will be destroyed if the cells show some form of abnormal cell growth during
      the process and are unsafe for infusion, if you are found to not be eligible to receive the
      infusions, or if you leave the study early.

      If you do not already have an Ommaya catheter that has been placed in the lateral or fourth
      ventricle of your brain, you will have one placed before receiving the NK cells. You will
      sign a separate surgical consent form that will describe the procedure in more detail.

      You will receive the NK cells 1 time a week (at least 3 days apart) for the first 3 weeks in
      each 4-week cycle. These infusions will be given to you over about 3 minutes through the
      ommaya reservoir catheter.

      On the days of the NK cell infusions, you will take the following drugs to lower the risk of
      side effects:

      °You will take Tylenol (acetaminophen) by mouth before the infusion. If the doctor thinks it
      is needed, you will take it again 4-6 hours later.

      Study Visits:

      The screening tests may be repeated if your NK cell infusion is delayed more than 30 days.

      If more than 4 weeks have passed since you had an MRI at screening, it will need to be
      repeated before receiving the NK cells in Cycle 1.

      Before receiving the first NK cell infusion in Cycle 1, you will have a spinal tap to
      withdraw a small amount of CSF from around your spinal cord to check for tumor cells, if
      more than 4 weeks have passed since you this procedure was last performed. A spinal tap
      (also called a lumbar puncture) is when fluid surrounding the spinal cord is removed by
      inserting a needle into the lower back. The affected area is numbed with local anesthetic
      during the procedure. If tumor cells are not found, the procedure will be repeated after you
      receive the NK cells in Cycle 3.

      Within 3 days before receiving the first NK cell infusion in Cycle 1:

      °You will have an MRI of the brain.

      Before receiving the first NK cell infusion in Cycles 1 and 3:

      °You will have a physical exam.

      Within 7 days before receiving the first NK cell infusion in Cycles 1-3, blood (about 1
      tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests.

      On the days of the NK cell infusions in Cycles 1-3:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Right before the NK cell infusion, CSF will be withdrawn from the ommaya reservoir and
           used for routine tests. The CSF will also be used to study any tumor cells or NK cells
           in the CSF.

      After you finish Cycle 1 and within 30 days after finishing Cycle 3, you will have an MRI of
      the brain to check the status of the disease. You will also have an MRI of the spine if the
      doctor thinks it is needed.

      Length of NK Cell Dosing:

      You may receive up to 3 cycles of the NK cells. You will no longer be able to receive the NK
      cells if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to
      follow study directions.

      Your participation on the study will be over after the follow-up visit.

      End-of-Dosing Visit:

      Within 30 days after completing Cycle 3:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  You will have an MRI of the brain and spine to check the status of the disease.

        -  You will have a spinal tap to withdraw a small amount of CSF from around your spinal
           cord to check for tumor cells.

      This is an investigational study. The expanded NK cells are not commercially available or
      FDA approved. They are currently being used for research purposes only. The study doctor can
      explain how the NK cells are designed to work. Up to 24 participants will be enrolled in
      this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.
