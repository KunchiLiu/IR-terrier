    <textblock>
      This is a phase I, open-label, randomized, 5 period, crossover, single-center trial. The
      purpose of this trial is to assess the relative bio-availability of L-praziquantel (L-PZQ
      [MSC2499550A]) oral dispersible tablet (ODT) formulation (150 mg) versus the current
      marketed praziquantel (PZQ) (cysticideÂ® 500 mg) formulation in healthy male volunteers.
