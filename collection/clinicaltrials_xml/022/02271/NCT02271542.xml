      Identification of Polymorphisms Involved in the Metabolism of Propofol

    <textblock>
      Propofol inside and outside the operating room during anesthesia is a drug widely used. In
      terms of efficacy and side effect profile of propofol knows if properties are insufficient
      data on the metabolism. Propofol typically undergoes biotransformation by microsomal enzymes
      in the liver. For most of the administered dose, takes place glucuronidation by UGT1A9
      enzyme, while the remaining portion is oxidized with CYP2B6 hydroxylation reactions.
      However, these enzymes are involved in the metabolism of propofol are enzymes highly
      polymorphic. Polymorphisms occurring in these enzymes; the effects of propofol, side effects
      and drug needs to show individual differences in terms of causes. Determination of the
      genetic background of individuals and personal anesthetic regimen improved. Thus, useful
      person drug resistance, increased incidence of side effects can be reduced. In particular,
      be aware of some mutations, such as propofol infusion syndrome mortal side effects can be
      prevented. The main purpose of this study, these individual differences are thought to be
      the cause of polymorphic variation in UGT1A9 and CYP2B6 gene to determine. Especially in the
      UGT1A9 gene mutations that may be associated with ethnic structure can be observed. In
      Caucasian, African-American communities and polymorphisms of this gene has been shown in
      Japanese. So all of them as a result of the genetic structure of any society can be
      considered as its own. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the genetic polymorphism of
      Turkish society has.Physiological factors such as age and sex between persons of different
      answers to the causes of propofol. Another object of this study was the identification of
      these factors can lead to different answers which is to present the relationship between
      polymorphisms.

    <description>EDTA blood samples from patients for the study of polymorphisms, DNA will be obtained with the help of DNA isolation kit. DNA isolation from blood samples taken after the sample is stored at -80 Â° C until the operating phase.
Research priorities included in the appropriate primers for each polymorphism will be created.
Using appropriate PCR program, will be determined the genotype of each polymorphism.</description>
