    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1b/2 open-label study to evaluate the safety/efficacy of MEDI-551 + MEDI0680
      (AMP-514) in participants with relapsed or refractory aggressive B-cell lymphomas who have
      failed 1-2 prior lines of therapy.

      The primary objectives are to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or highest
      protocol-defined dose (HPDD); in the absence of exceeding the MTD of MEDI-551 in combination
      with MEDI0680 (AMP-514); and to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and clinical activity of
      MEDI-551 in combination with MEDI0680 (AMP-514).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      MEDI-551 is an IgG1k antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) enhanced anti-CD19
      monoclonal antibody (mAb). MEDI0680 (AMP-514) a humanized IgG4κ mAb against programmed
      death-1 (PD-1) , blocks inhibitory PD-1 receptors (PD-L1) on T cells to augment immune
      responses. This study explores this novel combination regimen in patients with multiply
      relapsed or refractory aggressive B-cell lymphomas who have limited opportunities for cure,
      and may offer a regimen with less toxicity but equal or better efficacy versus traditional
      chemotherapy.

      The primary objectives are to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or highest
      protocol-defined dose (HPDD; in the absence of exceeding the MTD) of MEDI-551 in combination
      with MEDI0680 (AMP-514); and to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and clinical activity of
      MEDI-551 in combination with MEDI0680 (AMP-514). Secondary objective: to evaluate the
      pharmacokinetics and antidrug antibodies of MEDI-551 in combination with MEDI0680 (AMP-514)
      in patients with multiply relapsed or refractory aggressive B-cell lymphomas. Exploratory
      objectives will determine the impact of tumor programmed death-1 ligand (PD-L1) expression
      on clinical activity of the combination treatment and will follow soluble PD-1 and PD-L1
      expression as biomarkers of activity.

      This study will determine the MTD or HPDD, safety, and activity of MEDI-551 in combination
      with MEDI0680 (AMP-514) in patients with multiply relapsed or refractory aggressive B-cell
      lymphomas who have failed 1-2 prior lines of therapy. Using a standard 3+3 design, 3 to 6
      participants with relapsed or refractory aggressive B-cell lymphomas will be enrolled per
      cohort in the dose-escalation portion to determine the MTD of the combination of MEDI-551
      with MEDI0680 (AMP-514). A maximum of 18 participants will be enrolled in the escalation
      portion of the study. Patients will receive MEDI-551 12 mg/kg once monthly with 1 of 3
      possible doses of MEDI0680 (AMP-514) administered bimonthly for 1 year. If a patient
      experiences progressive disease after completing first year therapy, combination treatment
      may be resumed for up to 12 additional months. After MTD identification, additional patients
      will be enrolled in the dose expansion portion to ensure a total sample size of 26
      efficacy-evaluable patients. Participants in the dose expansion portion will be adults with
      confirmed aggressive B-cell DLBCL only. Thirteen of 26 efficacy-evaluable patients receiving
      the MTD will be required to have PD-L1 expression. Patients will be stratified by
      refractoriness to chemotherapy, and CD20 therapy and PD-L1 status. Results will inform
      additional studies to find a chemotherapy-free regimen for frail participants with multiply
      relapsed or refractory Aggressive B-cell Lymphomas.

    <description>3 to 6 subjects with relapsed or refractory aggressive B-cell lymphomas will be enrolled per cohort in the dose-escalation portion, starting with a MEDI0680 (AMP-514) medium dose every 2 weeks for 12 months of therapy (thirteen 28-day cycles). If a patient experiences PD after completing first year therapy, combination treatment may be resumed for up to 12 additional months.
Provided the MTD is not exceeded at the starting dose level, MEDI0680 (AMP-514) dosing will also be explored at a higher dose level. Subjects will receive MEDI0680 (AMP-514) on Days 2 and 15 of Cycle 1 and Days 1 and 15 of each subsequent 28-day cycle. Subjects will receive medium dose of MEDI-551 on Days 1 and 8 of Cycle 1 and on Day 1 of all subsequent 28-day cycles. Once an MTD is identified is reached, 20 additional subjects with DLBCL will be enrolled and treated at the selected dose of MEDI-551 in combination with MEDI0680 (AMP-514)</description>
