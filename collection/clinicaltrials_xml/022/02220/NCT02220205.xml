  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intrauterine devices (IUDs) are a very effective, long-acting method of contraception. In
      order to make them accessible to women, health care providers must be trained to insert
      them. Physicians, physician assistant, and nurse practitioners often learn how to do so by
      first learning about IUDs, then practicing on a model that the IUD manufacturer provides.

      Educators have recently been using more sophisticated models to teach clinical skills such
      as surgical procedures. We are investigating whether these models may be more useful in
      teaching IUD insertion.

    <time_frame>Before and immediately after initial practice on assigned simulator (same day)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants are filmed performing 3 IUD insertions each, for each of the three IUDs currently available in the US. They then practice on an assigned simulator for 30 minutes, and are re-recorded immediately afterwards. Both sets of insertions are scored using a standardized checklist. We are looking for a change in this score before and immediately after practice on the simulator.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Comfort/competency</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Participants are given questionnaires at the initial study visit and at a three-month follow-up visit that assess their comfort and self-perceived competency with IUD insertion. We will compare the difference in scores over three months.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>IUD insertion score</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be videotaped three months after the initial study visit performing three IUD insertions each for the three devices currently available in the US. We will compare the scores from the initial study visit with those from the three month follow-up study visit.</description>
