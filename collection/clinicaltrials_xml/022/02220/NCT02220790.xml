      The purpose of the study is to 1) define the operating characteristics of fungal biomarker
      assays in pediatric patients at high-risk for developing invasive candidiasis, 2) determine
      the change in fungal biomarker assay results in children who develop invasive candidiasis,
      and 3) create a biobank of blood samples from pediatric patients at high-risk for invasive
      candidiasis and those with invasive candidiasis for future testing of fungal biomarker
      assays and development of new fungal biomarker assays. The study will assemble a prospective
      cohort of pediatric patients at high-risk for developing invasive candidiasis. Blood samples
      for biomarker testing will be obtained at the time a patient has a clinical indication for
      blood culture attainment. Additional blood sampling will be performed on the sub-set of
      patients that are found to have invasive candidiasis. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and
      NPV of biomarker assays will be determined for each biomarker assay. No PHI will be stored
      in the database and limits on blood draws (3 ml/kg in an 8 week period) will be adhered to.

      This study will create an international multi-center cohort of children with new clinical
      concern for infection while in the ICU. The study will be collected at 23 US sites and 18
      International sites; other sites may be added in the future. Sites used are part of the
      International Pediatric Fungal Network (PFN; www.ipfn.org). We plan to enroll a total of 500
      high-risk inpatients over the course of four years. The study plans to prospectively enroll
      pediatric ICU patients at high-risk of developing invasive candidiasis over a four year
      period. The study duration per subject will be up to 14 days for blood collection and 30
      days for data collection from the medical record. Additionally, inpatient clinical data up
      to 14 days prior to the first blood draw will be collected. The subject will be
      participating in the study up to 30 days from the day the first blood draw is collected.

      For the first aim, this study will assemble a prospective cohort of pediatric patients at
      high-risk for developing invasive candidiasis. Blood samples for biomarker testing will be
      obtained at the time a patient has a clinical indication for blood culture attainment. To
      accomplish the second aim, additional blood sampling will be performed in the sub-set of
      patients that are found to have invasive candidiasis. For the third aim, leftover blood
      samples following biomarker testing from all consenting participants will be stored in a
      biobank. This biobank will be used to examine future, currently undeveloped, biomarker
      assays in an effort to further reduce the time to diagnosis of invasive candidiasis.
