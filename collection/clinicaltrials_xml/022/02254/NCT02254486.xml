    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the efficacy, safety and tolerability of NER1006 with Trisulfate
      solution in patients requiring bowel cleansing prior to any procedure which requires a clean
      bowel. Half the participants will receive NER1006 and while the other half will receive
      Trisulfate solution.

             use of diuretics or angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors.

          -  Patients with any other clinically significant hematological parameters including
             coagulation profile at screening.
