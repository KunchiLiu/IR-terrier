  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of ipilimumab in combination
      with toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) agonist SD-101 and radiation therapy in treating patients
      with low-grade B-cell lymphoma that has returned. Monoclonal antibodies, such as ipilimumab,
      may block cancer growth in different ways by targeting certain cells. Biological therapies,
      such as TLR9 agonist SD-101, use substances made from living organisms that may stimulate or
      suppress the immune system in different ways and stop cancer cells from growing. Radiation
      therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors. Giving ipilimumab in
      combination with TLR9 agonist SD-101 and radiation therapy may be a better treatment for
      B-cell lymphoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety and tolerability of increasing dose levels of intratumoral
      injections of ipilimumab and a fixed dose of intratumoral injection of SD-101 (TLR9 agonist
      SD-101) combined with local radiation in patients with low-grade B-cell lymphoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the local and systemic anti-tumor effects of intratumoral injection of
      ipilimumab and intratumoral injections of SD-101 combined with local radiation in patients
      with low-grade B-cell lymphoma.

      II. To evaluate tumor-specific humoral and cellular immune responses.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of ipilimumab followed by a phase II
      study.

      Patients receive TLR9 agonist SD-101 via intratumoral injection on days 1, 2, 8, 15, and 22;
      ipilimumab via intratumoral injection on day 1; and undergo radiation therapy on days 1 and
      2.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at weeks 6, 8, 10, 12, and 24,
      and then every 3-6 months.
