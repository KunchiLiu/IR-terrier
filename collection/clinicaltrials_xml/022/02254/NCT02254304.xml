    <description>A relapse is defined as the appearance of a new symptom or worsening of an old symptom, attributable to multiple sclerosis (MS), accompanied by an appropriate new neurological abnormality or focal neurological dysfunction lasting at least 24 hours in the absence of fever, and preceded by stability or improvement for at least 30 days.</description>

    <description>Absence of disability progression is defined as non-deterioration of Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings. The EDSS is a scale for assessing disability in 8 functional systems (visual, brain stem, pyramidal, cerebellar, sensory, bowel &amp; bladder, cerebral, and other functions). An overall score ranges from 0 (normal) to 10 (death due to MS).</description>
