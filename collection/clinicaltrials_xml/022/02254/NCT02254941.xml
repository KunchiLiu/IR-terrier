      The purpose of this study is to evaluate, in terms of overall survival, the benefit of
      monoclonal antibodies in the start time of the diagnosis of advanced disease or administer a
      deferred basis after progression to treatment with chemotherapy alone.

    <measure>Validate prognostic score GEMCAD</measure>
    <time_frame>From August 2014, up to 36 months</time_frame>
    <description>The two main prognostic scores for metastatic colorectal cancer (Kohne and GERCOR) do not account for resectability of liver-only metastasis (LiM) and thus are limited as treatment guidance. We propose a classification of patients based on LiM resectability, performance status (PS) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels and compare its discrimination capacity against Kohne and GERCOR scores.
GEMCAD score: patients are classified as stage 1 if LiM are considered resectable (&lt;4 nodules and &lt;5 cm diameter) or potentially resectable (&gt;4 and &lt;10 nodules or &gt;5 cm diameter), PS 0-1 and LDH &lt; 1.5 ULN; stage 2 if LiM are not resectable or with extrahepatic spread, PS 0-1 and LDH &lt; 1.5 ULN; stage3 if PS 2 or LDH &gt; 1.5 ULN.
This score, Kohne, and GERCOR scores will be tested for discrimination using Harrel's C index (HCI, higher is better) and calibration using Akaike information criterion (AIC, smaller is better) of progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).</description>
