      The primary objective is to assess the effect of daily subcutaneous injections of LY2605541
      on sleep respiratory quotient, measured during the post-absorptive period (0000 to 0600
      hours), compared to daily subcutaneous injections of insulin glargine, in patients with Type
      1 diabetes mellitus.
