    <textblock>
      This trials of cognitive stimulation therapy (CST) in Tanzania is part of the larger
      Identification and Intervention for Dementia in Elderly Africans (IDEA) study.

      The overall aim of the IDEA study is to set up and evaluate sustainable programmes to
      facilitate diagnosis of, and therapy for, people with dementia led by local communities in
      sub-Saharan Africa. We aim seek to improve quality of life for people with dementia and
      their caregivers.

      Within this trial of CST, we hypothesise that CST can significantly improve the quality of
      people with dementia and their carers living in Africa

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Our project will address three specific challenges: 1) Integrate screening and core packages
      of services into routine primary health care. 2) Provide effective and affordable
      community-based care and rehabilitation. 3) Develop effective treatment for use by
      non-specialists, including lay healthcare workers with minimal training.

      Dementia is under-diagnosed in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and treatment is rarely accessed or
      available. The burden of dementia on caregivers is high, with loss of income, and
      psychosocial stress common. However, large scale screening for dementia in such a setting is
      neither affordable nor sustainable. The purpose of this 3 year project is to provide a
      sustainable mechanism for diagnosis and therapeutic intervention for people with dementia.
      We will use 2 complimentary, rural study sites, 1 in Nigeria, West Africa and 2 in Tanzania,
      East Africa. As a consequence our results should be generalizable to all SSA. Our approach
      is inexpensive and will have applicability to other low- and middle-income countries.

      During Phase I we will validate a screening tool, previously developed by members of our
      study team from data collected in Tanzania, and carry out a pilot study of the benefits of
      cognitive stimulation therapy (CST) when used in SSA for those already identified with
      dementia. During both of these activities we will initiate training of local healthcare
      workers in diagnosis and management of people with dementia. In Phase II we will engage with
      local communities to raise awareness of dementia. Building on previous work at both study
      sites, we will initiate poster, newspaper and radio advertising and use mobile phone text
      messaging services (for relevant healthcare personnel) to increase awareness of the need to
      diagnose and intervene at an early stage. We will empower local private pharmacies to help
      identify people with dementia, a relationship which will ultimately be mutually beneficial
      through the supply of medicines to treat risk factors for dementia, such as hypertension. We
      will engage with local community leaders and government officials to assist us in this
      awareness raising, an approach that has proven successful in previous studies by our team in
      SSA. One of our study team (Dr Mushi (DM)) is a social scientist based in Tanzania and
      during Phase II we will conduct qualitative research into attitudes and beliefs surrounding
      dementia and identify any barriers to diagnosis in both sites. The results of this research
      will be fed back to inform other phases of the study. Finally, in phase III we will initiate
      a program of community based CST led by local occupational therapists (OTs) and nurse
      specialists. OTs and nurses will train caregivers in CST techniques and we hope that the
      training will ultimately be led by caregivers allowing such therapy to become sustainable
      within communities in the longer term. We will evaluate changes in cognition in people with
      dementia, and quality of life (QOL) in both people with dementia and their caregivers,
      post-intervention. We will carry out a full economic evaluation of the effect of our
      program, to be led by a heath economist based at Newcastle University, United Kingdom.

      This protocol cover the CST trial (Phase III of the study) in Tanzania

    <description>We will use a two-group stepped-wedge design. Group 1 will receive the intervention immediately and group 2 will have their intervention delayed until after the end of the group 1 intervention. This will also allow group 2 to act as controls for group 1 and allow further analysis as a controlled trial, during secondary analysis.
In accordance with the CST manual protocol, patients will be allocated to groups to ensure a spread of abilities and ensure inclusivity. No group contains only one individual of a particular religion or gender, such that they may feel left out. We will allocate patients to groups to avoid excessive travel to the group meeting place, participants may be allocated to a group based on their geographical location. Individuals will be allocated to groups based on religion, gender and geographical location. Once the above requirements are met, individuals will be randomly assigned to either an immediate or delayed start CST group.</description>

    <description>The CST intervention comprises 14 sessions lasting 1-2 hours across 7 weeks. The CST manual has been adapted for use in this setting by members of our study team. Each session has a theme. Activities include tasks aimed at engaging participants in cognitive and physical tasks designed to improve quality of life. Sessions will be led and facilitated by a study nurse or occupational therapist. The sessions will be held at a local health centre of village hall.</description>
