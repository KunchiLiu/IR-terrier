      The investigators are conducting sequential Phase 1 and IIa trials to identify the maximum
      tolerated dose and to evaluate safety, tolerability, toxicity, pharmacokinetics and
      pharmacodynamics of the oral anti-cancer agent ABC294640 specifically in patients with
      diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, including patients with virus-induced (e.g., KSHV- or
      EBV-associated) lymphoma.

          -  Unwillingness or inability to comply with procedures required in this protocol.

          -  Serious nonmalignant disease (e.g., hydronephrosis, liver failure, or other

             Investigator and/or the Sponsor

          -  Patients who are currently receiving any other investigational agent

          -  Patients who are receiving drugs other than highly active antiretroviral therapy
             (HAART) or trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole that are sensitive substrates of CYP450 1A2,
             3A4, 2C9, 2D6, or 2C19, or strong inhibitors or inducers of these isozymes that
             cannot be stopped at least 7 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) before
             starting treatment with ABC294640 and either replaced with another appropriate
             medication or not given for the duration of the clinical study. Patients on HAART
             will be restricted to preferred, potent agents with no demonstrated interactions with
             CYP450 isoforms for which significant interactions are predicted with ABC294640 (1A2,
             2C9, or 2C19 for which ABC294640 IC50 &lt; 1uM). These include tenofovir, FTC, 3TC,
             abacavir, darunavir, atazanavir, norvir, raltegravir, dolutegravir, elvitegravir,
             cobicistat, and maraviroc. Switching of ART prior to study entry is permitted given
             significant data for improvement/maintenance of HIV suppression when switching
             regimens in other contexts.

          -  Patients who are currently taking coumadin or coumadin derivatives.

          -  Patients who have received any antineoplastic therapy within 1 month of starting
             treatment with ABC294640 or who have not adequately recovered from side effects and
             toxicities of previous antineoplastic therapy

          -  Patients who are currently participating in any other clinical trial of an
             investigational product

          -  Allergy to radiographic contrast.
