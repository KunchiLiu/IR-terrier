        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Presence of aortic aneurysm involving the aortic arch deemed to warrant surgical
             repair which requires proximal graft placement in Zone 0 or Zone 1:

               1. Fusiform (≥ 55 mm), or

               2. Fusiform (&gt;2 times native aortic diameter), or

               3. Saccular (no diameter criteria)

          6. Must have appropriate proximal aortic landing zone, defined as:

               1. Must require placement of the proximal extent of the Aortic Component in Zone 0
                  or Zone 1 for exclusion of the lesion

               2. Acceptable proximal landing zone outer curvature length for the required device

               3. Landing zone inner diameters between 16-48 mm in Zone 1 Subjects and 24-48mm in
                  Zone 0 Subjects

               4. Landing zone, which must include either the brachiocephalic or left common
                  carotid native ostium, cannot be aneurysmal, heavily calcified, or heavily
                  thrombosed

          7. Must have appropriate distal aortic landing zone, defined as:

               1. Outer curvature length must be ≥2cm proximal to the celiac artery

               2. Aortic inner diameters between 16-48 mm (diameter must be between 16-42mm if
                  using distal TAG® Device extension)

               3. Landing zone cannot be aneurysmal, heavily calcified, or heavily thrombosed

               4. Landing zone in native aorta or previously implanted GORE® TAG® Device

          8. Must have appropriate target branch vessel landing zone, defined as:

               1. Length of ≥3 cm proximal to first major branch vessel if using Aortic Component
                  with 8 mm portal diameter, or length of ≥2.5 cm proximal to first major branch
                  vessel if using Aortic Component with 12 mm portal diameter (required for Zone 0
                  Subjects)

               2. Target branch vessel inner diameters of 6-15 mm if using Aortic Component with
                  8mm portal diameter, or inner diameters of 11-18 mm if using Aortic Component
                  with 12mm portal diameter (required for Zone 0 Subjects)

               3. Target branch vessel landing zone must be in native aorta that cannot be
                  aneurysmal, heavily calcified, or heavily thrombosed

          9. Myocardial infarction or stroke within 6 weeks prior to treatment

         10. Patient has a systemic infection and may be at increased risk of endovascular graft
             infection

         11. Pregnant female at time of informed consent signature

         12. Degenerative connective tissue disease, e.g. Marfan's or Ehler-Danlos Syndrome
