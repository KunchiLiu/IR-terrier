  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PreView is a novel tool that functions within the system in a busy clinic setting,
      integrates information obtained from a particular patient with provider alerts, is
      efficient, relieves the burden of time constraints and is tailored to the individual
      patient. The goal of PreView is to support and simplify the physician's role in promoting
      cancer screening.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PreView is a multimedia interactive Video Doctor Plus Provider Alert intervention that
      assesses stage of change for cancer screening, uses an interactive Video Doctor who gives
      messages targeted to individual stage of change and individual barriers in a feasible and
      efficient manner, and generates individualized Provider Alerts. This innovative tool 1)
      focuses on all recommended cancer screening for a particular individual, 2) is tailored to
      an individual's stage of change and an individual's barriers to screening, and 3) has been
      pilot tested for feasibility but has not been tested in a primary care clinic setting and is
      thus a novel approach to increasing rates of cancer screening and discussions about cancer
      screening.

      UCSF research staff will contact potential participants directly to confirm eligibility and
      request optional and voluntary participation.

      PreView will remain at participating practices for a second year during the Maintenance
      Phase of the study. PreView will be placed in a conspicuous place, most likely in the
      waiting room. Eligible patients arriving for appointments will be encouraged by office staff
      and by signs to use it, but whether or not to use it will be completely optional. An
      information sheet about PreView will be available next to the PreView iPad for participants
      to review. A postcard with contact information for PreView staff will be placed next to the
      iPad for participants to provide feedback about PreView if they so desire. Their feedback is
      completely voluntary.

      At each site there will be a designated 'office champion' who will ensure that the iPad is
      charged and functioning, will ensure that the printer is working and will be an on-site
      resource person.

    <description>PRE-VIEW is a multimedia program utilizing laptop computers to assess whether or not primary care patients are up to date with cancer screening, assess their stage of change and personal barriers to screening. The Video Doctor, portrayed by an actor, delivers brief, individually tailored stage and barrier specific messages that simulate the ideal physician-patient cancer screening conversation, using a library of digital video clips and complex branching logic. The program then provides the individualized information to the patient's physician in the form of a cue sheet or &quot;Provider Alert.&quot;</description>
