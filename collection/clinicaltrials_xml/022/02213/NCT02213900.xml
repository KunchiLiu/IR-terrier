  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of a preventative low-dose of
      Haloperidol to prevent delirium in patients undergoing a esophagectomy, pneumonectomy or
      thoracotomy.

      Delirium is state of severe confusion and some symptoms include:

        -  Cannot think clearly

        -  Have trouble paying attention

        -  Have a hard time understanding what is going on around them

        -  May see or hear things that are not there. These things seem very real to them.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      50% of patients who undergo esophageal and/or lung resection suffer from acute brain
      dysfunction or delirium postoperatively. Delirium is a state of brain failure characterized
      by disturbance of consciousness with reduced ability to focus, sustain, or shift attention
      that occurs over a short period of time and tends to fluctuate over the course of the day.
      Presence of delirium in the post-operative phase is associated with a longer length of both
      intensive care unit and hospital stay, increased health-care costs, long-term functional and
      cognitive decline, and an increased risk of in-hospital and post-discharge mortality.

      Haloperidol primarily acts by blocking dopamine (D2) receptors. This dopamine blockade in
      the cerebral cortex improves cognition and reduces delirium. Along with the dopamine
      blockade, haloperidol has anti-inflammatory properties. It inhibits production of
      lipopolysaccharide induced pro-inflammatory cytokines, interleukin (IL-1) and tumor necrosis
      factor alpha (TNF-α). Haloperidol also increases levels of Interleukin -1 receptor
      antagonist (IL-1RA), an anti-inflammatory cytokine that blocks the action of other
      pro-inflammatory cytokines. If unchecked, the inflammatory cytokines cause impaired
      concentration, sleep disturbances, and agitation the cardinal symptoms of delirium; and
      induce a reduction in cholinergic activity. Given the inhibitory effect of acetylcholine on
      certain cytokines such as interleukin-6, a repetitive cycle of inadequate regulation of
      inflammation due to cholinergic depletion ensues. Haloperidol with its anti-inflammatory
      properties seeks to mitigate this repetitive vicious cycle.
