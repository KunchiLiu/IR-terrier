  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The presence of intracardiac thrombi and their propensity for systemic embolism is a major
      concern in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and atrial flutter (AFL) undergoing
      cardioversion and ablation procedures. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is the
      clinical gold standard imaging modality for visualization of the right atrial appendage
      (RAA) and left atrial appendage (LAA) for detection of thrombi as well as risk factors
      associated with thrombus formation, including spontaneous echo contrast and low LAA
      velocity. However, TEE is a moderately invasive procedure that incurs additional risk, cost,
      and patient discomfort. In addition, thrombus detection via TEE may be ambiguous, and
      another tool capable of confirming uncertain TEE findings is desirable. This is particularly
      crucial in cases when adequate LAA imaging cannot be acquired or if TEE is clinically
      contraindicated, requiring alternative imaging modalities that can visualize these
      structures.

      Phased-array intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) provides high-imaging resolution and is
      routinely used during atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation procedures for transseptal puncture
      and periprocedural catheter visualization. A majority of imaging acquired during AF ablation
      is performed with the ICE catheter in the right atrium (RA). However, these standard views
      are often unable to provide sufficient visualization of the LAA structure due to the
      relatively long distance between the ICE catheter and LAA.

      Placement of the ICE catheter in the pulmonary artery (PA) provides improved visualization
      of the LAA over other locations by reducing the anatomic distance between the imaging
      catheter and structure of interest. Recent retrospective studies have confirmed improved
      assessment of the LAA with ICE imaging from the PA and equivocal sensitivity and specificity
      when compared with TEE for evaluation of LAA thrombus. However, these studies did not
      systematically evaluate the presence of SEC, flow velocity, the LAA dimensions, or the RAA.

      Although these studies support the use of ICE imaging from the PA to clarify or confirm TEE
      findings, a prospective and blinded study evaluating both the LAA and RAA in its entirety is
      required. We hypothesize that this prospective and blinded study will confirm ICE as
      non-inferior to TEE in the assessment of LAA and RAA structure and for the detection of
      thrombi.

    <description>The right atrial appendage (RAA) and left atrial appendage (LAA) will be assessed for the presence or absence of intracardiac thrombi with the Siemens AcuNav Ultrasound catheter. This is also performed with the standard of care modality, transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) with both operators blinded to the opposing imaging modality. The presence of LAA thrombi requires cancellation of the clinical procedure. After a determination has been made by both operators regarding the presence or absence of thrombi will investigators be unblinded to the opposing imaging modality result. If intracardiac thrombi was detected, the procedure was cancelled according to standard clinical guidelines and practice. There is no follow-up data collected.</description>

    <time_frame>Time of Clinical Procedure Only (Enrollment)</time_frame>
    <description>Doppler flow velocity of the right atrial appendage (RAA) and left atrial appendage (LAA) will be measured with the Siemens AcuNav Ultrasound catheter. This is then recorded for offline assessment and comparison to standard of care measurements obtained with Transesophageal Echocardiogram (TEE). This is obtained at the time of the clinical procedure and analyzed offline. There is no follow-up data collected.</description>

    <description>The anatomical width (centimeters) length (centimeters), and area (centimeters squared) of the right atrial appendage (RAA) and left atrial appendage (LAA) will be measured with the Siemens AcuNav Ultrasound catheter offline and compared to measurements obtained with Transesophageal Echocardiogram (TEE).
