  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this small, pilot study is to evaluate a novel device that uses neuromuscular
      electrical stimulation to assist quadriceps muscles as a user walks. This study will involve
      use of this device on individuals with patellofemoral pain, a relatively common injury among
      active people, to see if quadriceps stimulation could mitigate disparities in quadriceps
      activation timing that may indirectly lead to knee pain.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The interventional device will be tested with 20 women aged 18-40 with evidence of
      patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS) and without any co-morbidities that would confound data
      or contraindications for NMES use. All participants will be enrolled at a single site
      (Developmental Motor Lab at the University of Texas), and all of a single participant's
      testing will be complete within a single day with no requirement for follow-up or long-term
      participation. Participants will have their gait and quadriceps muscle activation patterns
      evaluated through four six-minute walk tests (6MWT). The first 6MWT will be without a
      device, second with a device worn but not activated, third with a device activated and
      stimulating quadriceps musculature, and the fourth without a device.

      Primary Objective: The purpose of this study is to investigate whether electrical
      stimulation of the vastus medalis (VM) and/or vastus lateralis (VL) to establish
      coactivation of these muscles during terminal swing phase impacts severity of PFPS symptoms

      Secondary Objectives: Secondary purposes for this study include evaluating KneeStim and
      seeing if there is any evidence of proof of concept in two main areas:

      KneeStim as a therapeutic device that may assist individuals with joint rehabilitation
      KneeStim's on-board operating system and motion tracking system as an effective way to
      monitor joint kinematics.

      This pilot study has a prospective, controlled, single-center design. Participants and
      investigators will not be blinded to the treatment. Individuals who evaluate the
      motion-tracking data between VICON and KneeStim will not be informed which data set aligns
      with which treatment.

6MWT #1: Without interventional device being worn; 6MWT #2: With interventional device being worn, but unpowered; 6MWT #3: With interventional device being worn and operational; 6MWT #4: Without interventional device being worn

    <description>The interventional device uses an on-board operating system that determines stimulation timing and location based on modeled joint kinematics. Movement data will be taken from the device and evaluated against movement data measured by a VICON motion-tracking system during each six-minute walk test to evaluate the accuracy of the device's modeled joint kinematics.</description>

    <description>KneeStim is a neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) device that integrates motion-tracking hardware like three-axis accelerometers and a real-time operating system to enable quadriceps muscle stimulation in time with user gait. It is a completely non-invasive device that looks like a light brace and fastens to the user's quadriceps and gastrocnemius muscles. The end goal of this device is to assist with muscle re-strengthening and re-education during a user's everyday activities.</description>
