      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial, which evaluates a combination of drugs,
      FOLFIRINOX and Gemcitabine/Nab-Paclitaxel, in the management of participants with resectable
      pancreatic cancer prior to surgery.

      Patients who fulfill eligibility criteria will be randomized to Arm A or Arm B

        -  Treatment will be administered on an outpatient basis.

        -  Upon registration participants will be randomized to Arm A (FOLFIRINOX) or Arm B
           (Gemcitabine/nab-Paclitaxel).

        -  After completion of FOLFIRINOX or Gemcitabine/Nab-paclitaxel, all participants without
           progressive disease will proceed to radiation therapy with capecitabine .

        -  Between 2 and 4 weeks after radiation is complete, participants will proceed for
           surgical resection of pancreatic cancer

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Cytologic or histologic proof of pancreatic ductal carcinoma is required prior to
             study entry.

          -  No evidence of metastatic disease as determined by chest CT scan, and abdominal CT
             scan (or MRI with gadolinium and/or manganese) and laparoscopy. All patients must be
             staged with a physical exam, chest CT, abdominal CT with intravenous contrast (or
             abdominal MRI with gadolinium and/or manganese). Only potentially resectable patients
             are eligible. Potentially resectable is defined as a) no extrapancreatic disease, b)
             no evidence (on CT) of involvement of the celiac axis or SMA, c) no evidence (CT or
             MRI) of occlusion of the SMV or SMPV confluence, and d) no evidence of gross
             peritoneal or distant metastases by laparoscopy.

               -  Total Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal if no biliary stenting was done

               -  Serum Creatinine ≤1.5mg/dl OR

               -  Creatinine Clearance greater than or equal to 30ml/min (as estimated by Cockroft
                  Gault Equation) (140 - age [yrs]) (body wt [kg])

                    -  Creatinine clearance for males = ———————————— (72) (serum creatinine
                       [mg/dL])

             congestive heart failure, symptomatic coronary artery disease and cardiac arrhythmias
             not well controlled with medication) or myocardial infarction within the last 12
             months, ongoing infection as manifested by fever.

          -  Pregnant or lactating women. Women of childbearing potential with either a positive
             or no pregnancy test (serum or urine) at baseline. (Postmenopausal woman must have

          -  Any prior chemotherapy or radiation for treatment of the patient's pancreatic tumor.

          -  Diagnosis for other invasive carcinomas (except basal cell carcinoma/squamous cell
             carcinoma of the skin) within the last five years. Carcinoma in-situ is allowed.

          -  Other serious uncontrolled medical conditions that the investigator feels might
             compromise study participation.

          -  Unwillingness to participate or inability to comply with the protocol for the
             duration of the study.

          -  Participation in any investigational drug study within 4 weeks preceding the start of
             study treatment.

          -  History of uncontrolled seizures, central nervous system disorders or psychiatric
             disability judged by the investigator to be clinically significant, precluding
             informed consent, or interfering with compliance or oral drug intake.

          -  Major surgery, excluding laparoscopy, within 4 weeks of the start of study treatment,
