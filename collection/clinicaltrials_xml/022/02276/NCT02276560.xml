    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine whether giving cisplatin and
      nab-paclitaxel before surgery will reduce the presence of disease in certain areas of the
      lung at the time of surgery.

      Objectives

      To estimate the rate of N2 nodal clearance at time of surgery in patients with NSCLC
      undergoing treatment with neoadjuvant nab-paclitaxel plus cisplatin and surgery.

      Estimate response rate and complete response rate in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
      after 3 cycles of neoadjuvant nab-paclitaxel plus cisplatin

      Estimate complete pathological response of primary tumor and lymph nodes at the time of
      surgery in patients with NSCLC undergoing treatment with neoadjuvant nab-paclitaxel plus
      cisplatin

      Estimate disease free survival for all patients who undergo surgery and also stratified by
      nodal clearance

      Patients will be assigned to receive three (3) cycles of cisplatin (mg/m2) and
      nab-paclitaxel (125 mg/m2). Surgery will then be conducted per standard of care.

      Approximately 4-12 weeks after the surgical resection, patients will receive one of three
      available treatment regimens based on the results of the surgical reports, which include:
      Two four week cycles of therapy of Cisplatin and Nab-paclitaxel; Four three-week cycles of
      Cisplatin and Pemetrexed, or four three-week cycles of Cisplatin and Gemcitabine

      Thirty (30) days after treatment ends, subjects will be followed for any ongoing serious
      adverse events, if necessary, and every 3-6 months thereafter for two years.

      After the two years of follow-up, subjects will be followed for survival and disease status

      Estimate overall survival for entire group and stratified by nodal clearance

      To estimate event free survival (EFS)

      Estimate time to distant recurrence and time to local recurrence following total study
      procedures

             contraception prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation and for
             three months after completing treatment. Adequate contraception is defined as any
             medically recommended method (or combination of methods) per standard of care

          -  Negative serum or urine Human Chorionic Gonadotropin(b-hCG) pregnancy test within 14
             days of D1 of neoadjuvant chemotherapy for women of childbearing potential

          -  Informed consent obtained and signed

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Forced expiratory volume (FEV) ≤ 1.2 L/s

             institutional standards regarding which patients are best served by operative and
             nonoperative approaches vary. Therefore, consistent with the American College of
             Chest Physicians (ACCP) guidelines, the protocol recommends multidisciplinary
             discussion of each patient and enrollment only of patients felt best serviced by the
             approach described herein

          -  ≥ Grade 2 pre-existing peripheral neuropathy (per CTCAEv4)

          -  Prior history of hypersensitivity to taxane or platinum therapy. If either agent was

          -  Recurrent disease or second primary lung cancer (only de novo IIIA disease allowed)

          -  Other active, invasive malignancy requiring ongoing therapy or expected to require
             systemic therapy within two years; localized squamous cell carcinoma of the skin,
             basal-cell carcinoma of the skin, carcinoma in-situ of the cervix, or other
             malignancies requiring locally ablative therapy only will not result in exclusion.
