      The purpose of this study is to quantify the total blood serum levels of bupivacaine in
      OrthoPAT® collected blood 2 hours and 5 hours postoperatively.

      Hypothesis: Filtered blood from the OrthoPAT® autotransfusion system contains low or
      undetectable levels of bupivacaine HCL. Reinfusion of collected blood from the OrthoPAT®
      device when used in conjunction with periarticular bupivicaine injections will not pose a
      bupivocaine toxicity risk to patients undergoing a total joint arthroplasty.

    <textblock>
      Total joint arthroplasty (TJA) is a commonly performed surgical procedure that can result in
      considerable postoperative pain which can limit social and functional recovery and a return
      to quality of life. Traditionally, pain control following TJA has been conducted with
      parenteral and oral narcotics. Recently, a number of studies have demonstrated the efficacy
      of multimodal analgesia following a variety of surgical procedures.1-2 These multimodal
      regimens vary and consist of any number of medications including narcotics, non-steroidal
      anti-inflammatories, anti-epileptics, and peripheral nerve blocks among others. These
      multimodal regimens have been associated with a reduction in the use of opioid analgesics,
      leading to fewer opioid-associated adverse events.3-5 One of the newest modalities
      introduced on the market is liposomal bupivacaine, trade name Exparel. The advertised
      advantage of liposomal bupivacaine compared with bupivacaine HCl is a longer duration of
      analgesia owing to gradual release from the liposomes. Liposomal bupivacaine is employed in
      a periarticular injection at the conclusion of TJAs to aid in post-operative pain control.

      Patients receive a periarticular injection of liposomal bupivacaine intra-operatively during
      TJA. At the conclusion of the procedure, a specialized intra-articular drain (OrthoPAT®) is
      placed. The OrthoPAT® perioperative autotransfusion system collects the patient's blood in
      the immediate postoperative period and then allows for it to be transfused to the patient
      while on the floor.

      A potential risk, although low, is the concern for bupivicaine toxicity. Toxicity from
      bupivicaine is associated with central nervous system issues (seizures) and cardiac
      toxicity. Toxicity is dose dependent and recommended levels should not exceed 400mg/24 hr
      period. With autotransfusion, there is a theoretical concern that blood, potentially with
      increased levels of bupivicaine, could be reinfused into the vascular system and create
      toxicity.

    <description>Participants will receive Exparel (liposomal bupivacaine). Exparel is a FDA approved product. Exparel is an extended-release formulation of bupivacaine consisting of microscopic lipid-based particles that diffuse over an extended period. The result is pain relief that can last up to 96 hours after surgery. Extended-release liposomal bupivacaine-based analgesics were shown to provide extended pain relief and decrease opioid (pain medication) use. At the conclusion of the total joint arthroplasty procedure, Exparel is administered via injection into the joint (periarticular bupivicaine and liposomal bupivicaine).</description>
