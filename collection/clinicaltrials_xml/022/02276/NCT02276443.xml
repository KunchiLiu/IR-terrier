    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if the use of molecular testing on
      tumors can improve response to treatment in patients with TNBC by guiding patients with
      chemotherapy-sensitive tumors to receive standard chemotherapy and chemotherapy-insensitive
      tumors to consider a clinical trial. Researchers want to compare the outcome of a study
      group which receive results of these tests with a group of patients who do not receive the
      results.

      Study Groups:

      If you are eligible to take part in this study and agree, you will be randomly assigned (as
      in a roll of dice) to 1 of 2 study groups (called &quot;arms&quot;).

        -  If you are in Arm A, you will not receive the results of the molecular testing of the
           tumor described below.

        -  If you are in Arm B, you will receive the results of the molecular testing of the tumor
           described below.

      You will have a 1 in 3 chance of being in Arm A and a 2 in 3 chance of being in Arm B.

      Study Visits:

      At Baseline (your first visit):

        -  You will have a biopsy for biomarker and molecular testing. Biomarkers are found in the
           tissue and may be related to the tumor's response to therapy. To perform a biopsy, the
           affected area is numbed with anesthetic and a sample of tissue is removed using a
           hollow core needle that has a cutting edge. The biopsy may be an image-guided core
           biopsy. To perform an image-guided core biopsy, a needle is inserted into the affected
           area in the breast using imaging such as mammogram, ultrasound, or magnetic resonance
           imaging (MRI) to collect a small piece of tumor tissue. The doctor will use the imaging
           to guide the needle into the area.

        -  If an ultrasound has not been performed within 4 weeks, you will also have an
           ultrasound.

      You will receive standard-of-care chemotherapy for 4 cycles. A cycle of treatment may be
      given once every 2 or 3 weeks depending upon your doctor's decision.

      After Cycle 2, you will have a standard-of-care ultrasound to check the status of the
      disease. You will receive the results of the ultrasound. If you are receiving your
      standard-of-care treatment closer to home, then the ultrasound is optional.

      After Cycle 3 or 4, if you are in Arm B, you will receive the molecular testing results if
      they are available.

      After Cycle 4, you will have a standard-of-care ultrasound and will receive the results of
      that test.

      Together, you and your doctor will decide if you should go forward with additional standard
      chemotherapy treatments or consider a clinical trial. If you are in Arm A of this study, you
      will not have molecular testing to guide your decision to have standard chemotherapy or for
      selection of a clinical trial.

      The choice of standard chemotherapy is made by your doctor and the cost will not be covered
      by the study.

      The study team will continue to collect information from your medical record throughout the
      study and for up to 5 years.

      Length of Study Participation:

      At the end of 4 cycles of chemotherapy your study doctor will discuss further treatment
      options with you.

      Taking part in this study will not affect your treatment. If you are scheduled to have
      surgery for the disease, you will still have surgery as scheduled.

      This is an investigational study.

      Up to 360 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.
