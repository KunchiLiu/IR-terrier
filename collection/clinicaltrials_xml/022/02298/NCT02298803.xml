      Hypoglycaemia is the most common acute complication of diabetes and can limit therapeutic
      efforts to improve glycaemic control. It is a potential side effect of drugs used to treat
      diabetes, particularly with the use of sulfonylurea (SU) treatment. It has been demonstrated
      that hypoglycaemia causes the prolongation of corrected QT (QTc) interval, which is
      associated with ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death. Hypoglycaemia in T2DM has recently
      come into focus with the results of the ACCORD, ADVANCE and VADT trials.

      In this study, the investigators aim to examine the association of hypoglycaemia and glucose
      fluctuations on QT-interval and QT variability in patients with type 2 diabetes treated with
      SU. Patients will be studied using simultaneous Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) and
      ambulatory ECG monitoring (Holter).

      Study participants will be recruited from the Diabetes Centre, RPAH or from specialist
      consulting rooms. They will be required to attend the Diabetes Centre on two occasions.

      At the first visit, blood will be collected and CGM and Holter monitoring commenced. At
      Visit 2, i.e. two days later, the patient will return to the Diabetes Centre to have the
      equipment removed. The data obtained from the CGM and Holter monitor will then be downloaded
      for review and analysis.

      Background/Scientific Basis:

      Hypoglycaemia is the most common acute complication of diabetes and can limit therapeutic
      efforts to improve glycaemic control. It is a potential side effect of the drugs used to
      treat diabetes, particularly with the use of exogenous insulin or insulin secretagogues,
      such as sulfonylurea (SU) treatment. As many people are prescribed these agents,
      hypoglycaemia is frequent in clinical practice, particularly as treatment targets have
      become more stringent. Several studies have demonstrated that insulin-induced hypoglycaemia
      causes prolongation of corrected QT (QTc) interal (Chugh et al), which is associated with
      ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death, perhaps as a result of hypokalaemia and an
      increase in serum catecholamines. Cardiac effects of hypoglycaemia are usually associated
      with type 1 diabetes and insulin therapy. Hypoglycaemia in type 2 diabetes (T2DM) on oral
      agents has not, until recently, been considered to be as serious. Recently, hypoglycaemia in
      T2Dm has come in into focus since the salutary results of the ACCORD, ADVANCE and VADT
      trails, each of which implicated hypoglycaemia as a cause for increased death. The majority
      of excess deaths in the intensive treatment group of ACCORD were classified as sudden
      cardiac death. There is now a growing body of evidence that hypoglycaemia is a
      pro-arrhythmic event via QT prolongation and particularly in the context of myocardial
      ischemia which reduces the tolerance of myocardial tissue for the further pro-arrhythmic
      action of hypoglycaemia.

      It is notable that hypoglycaemia occurs commonly in those using SU. For example in the UK
      Hypoglycaemia Study (UK Hypoglycaemia Study Group) , 7% of individuals treated with SUs had
      at least one episode of severe (requiring external assistance) hypoglycaemia and the
      proportion reporting at least one mild (symptomatic, self-treated) episode was 39%, a rate
      comparable to insulin treatment. Furthermore, the SU receptor functions as the regulatory
      subunit of the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-sensitive potassium (KATP) channel. KATP
      channels are widely expressed in the heart and vascular smooth muscle cells. There have been
      long-held concerns that SU effects on these channels may affect ischaemic preconditioning
      (Cleveland et al), a protective mechanism in the myocardium. This may represent an additive
      deleterious impact specific to SUs in a hypoglycaemic setting.

      Despite these theoretical concerns associated with SU treatment the pro-arrhythmic effects
      of SU induced hypoglycaemia have not previously been easy to study in ambulatory patients.
      Now the dual ambulatory technologies of CGMS (Maia et al) and ambulatory ECG (Holter)
      monitoring provide an opportunity to examine this potential association under real life
      conditions. Even in the absence of absolute QT prolongation, there is evidence that
      beat-to-beat QT variability is also a risk marker for sudden death and ventricular
      arrhythmia (Piccirillo et al). Additionally, glucose variability may also have an impact on
      cardiac tissue. Habituation to chronic hyperglycaemia could lead to a situation where a
      sudden decrease to plasma glucose leads to changes in QT interval, even when the glucose
      falls within the normal range (&quot;relative hypoglycaemia&quot;).

      A pilot study in our institution of 14 individuals on insulin (3 with T1DM and 11 with T2DM)
      showed statistically significant prolongation of QTc during periods of hypoglycaemia. The
      mean difference in QTc during hypos was 7.8ms (p&lt;0.05). An inverse relationship between the
      magnitude of increase in QTs during hypoglycaemia and baseline QTc was found. The
      limitations of the pilot study are that it was restricted to those subjects treated with
      insulin and that relative hypoglycaemia and QT variability were not analysed.

      Hypothesis:

      Sulfonylurea induced hypoglycaemia and/or fluctuations in glucose are pro-arrhythmic by
      prolonging the QTc interval and/or increasing beat-to-beat QTc variability. It is expected
      that the QT interval will be significantly longer during the hypoglycemic periods compared
      to the non-hypoglycemic periods in patients in T2DM treated with SU.

      Aims:

      To examine the association of hypoglycaemia and glucose fluctuations on QT-interval and QT
      variability in patients with type 2 diabetes treated with SU. Patients will be studied using
      simultaneous Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) and ambulatory ECG monitoring (Holter).

      Potential Significance:

      The information gained from this study has the potential to improve our understanding of the
      relationship between hypoglycaemia and cardiac arrhythmia in patients with diabetes.

      Recruitment Process:

      Patients with type 2 diabetes attending the Diabetes Centre, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital
      who fulfils the entry criteria will be approached to participate in this study. They will be
      approached either when they attend the Diabetes Centre for treatment, or by means of a
      telephone call. The requirements of the study will be discussed with each potential
      participant and they will be given a copy of the Participant Information Sheet and Consent
      Form to take home and read. The proposed number of participants for this study is
      approximately 30 individuals.

      Research Interventions:

        1. Blood Collection

        2. Continuous Glucose Monitoring

        3. Home Blood Glucose Monitoring

        4. Holter Monitor

      Risk and Side Effects:

      We do not anticipate any adverse events associated with study participation. However, there
      may be some mild discomfort and/or bruising at the site of blood collection, or insertion of
      the glucose sensor for CGM, or skin irritation from the ECG adhesive tapes required for
      Holter monitoring.
