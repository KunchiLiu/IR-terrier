      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical performance of SERI® Surgical Scaffold
      to maintain the size of the areola by providing additional soft tissue support after
      circumferential periareolar mastopexy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Female, age 18 years or older desiring a reduction in size of nipple areola complex

          -  Be in good health and suited to general anesthesia and planned treatments

          -  Non smokers

          -  If the subject is of childbearing potential, have a urine pregnancy test evaluated as
             negative (assessed at baseline examination (Visit 1), agree to use contraception as
             prevention to avoid pregnancy during the study period

          -  Previous augmentation with silicone-filled or saline-filled breast implants or
             patients desiring periareolar mastopexy

          -  Requiring surgery for ptotic breasts

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  BMI (Body Mass Index) that is ≥ 30 kg/m2

          -  Active smoker or have smoked within 6 weeks prior to screening/qualification visit
             (Visit 1)

          -  Pregnant or nursing

          -  Advanced fibrocystic disease considered to be premalignant without accompanying
             subcutaneous mastectomy

          -  Previous mastectomy or lumpectomy

          -  Abscess or infection in the body at the time of enrollment

          -  Had any disease, including uncontrolled diabetes (e.g., HbAIc &gt; 8%), that is
             clinically known to impact wound healing ability. For example: collagen-vascular,
             connective tissue or autoimmune disorders (e.g., Systemic Lupus, Rheumatoid
             Arthritis, Scleroderma)

          -  Subjects with diagnosed diabetes must have HbAIc ≤ 8% within 3 months of enrollment

          -  Is taking medications known to impair wound healing (e.g. corticosteroids,
             chemotherapeutic agents etc.,)

          -  Bleeding disorders (e.g., Hemophilia, von Willebrand Disease) including the following
             medications &amp; supplements: Warfarin, platelet inhibitors (e.g. NSAIDs or Clopidogrel)
             not stopped within 2 weeks of the operation and herbal supplements known to
             predispose to bleeding (e.g. Gingko and Ginseng)

          -  Showed tissue characteristics that were clinically incompatible with mammaplasty,
             such as tissue damage resulting from radiation, inadequate tissue, compromised
             vascularity or ulceration

          -  Had, or was under treatment for, any condition that may have constituted an
             unwarranted surgical risk (e.g., unstable cardiac or pulmonary problems)

          -  History of prior implantation of any surgical scaffold (e.g., synthetic mesh,
             acellular dermal matrix, or biologic mesh) in the breast

          -  Implantation of any non-SERI® surgical scaffold (e.g., synthetic mesh, acellular
             dermal matrix, or biologic mesh) during the study period

          -  Be currently enrolled in another clinical study of an implanted device in the breast
             or plan to enroll in another clinical study within the study period, which could
             affect wound healing in the breast repair site and/or would not allow the patient to
             attend all study visits as outlined within this protocol

          -  Product contraindications for use of SERI® Surgical Scaffold per the supplied package
             insert (e.g., hypersensitivity to silk)

          -  Show psychological characteristics that may have been incompatible with the surgical
             procedure and the prosthesis, such as inappropriate attitude or motivation (e.g.,
             body dysmorphic disorder)

          -  Active alcohol/substance abuse problem or have had a relapse within 1 year prior to
             screening/qualification visit (Visit 1)

          -  Was not willing to undergo further surgery for revision, if medically required
