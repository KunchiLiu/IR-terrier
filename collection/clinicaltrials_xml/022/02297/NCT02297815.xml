    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify and use patient centered outcomes to compare rates
      of treatment failure and the rate of adverse drug effects between narrow-spectrum and
      broad-spectrum antibiotics for the treatment of common acute respiratory tract infections
      (ARTIs) in children.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Outpatient, ARTIs account for the vast majority of antibiotic exposure to children, and
      roughly half of these antibiotic prescriptions are inappropriate. Although unnecessary
      antibiotic prescribing for viral infections has significantly decreased, there has been a
      substantial increase in prescribing of broad-spectrum antibiotics to treat ARTIs when
      narrow-spectrum antibiotics are indicated. Primary care providers, patients, and caregivers
      would benefit from studies assessing the implications of alternate antibiotic regimens for
      these common infections. Specifically, it remains unclear if treating common ARTIs with
      broad-spectrum antibiotics leads to an improvement in patient outcomes compared to treatment
      with narrow-spectrum antibiotics, particularly considering the increasing threat posed by
      antimicrobial resistance. Because of the lack of large comparative effectiveness studies
      with patient-centered outcomes addressing this issue, professional guidelines and expert
      recommendations are conflicting, and, as a result, practice patterns vary considerably.
      Furthermore, the adverse effects of antibiotic use have not been clearly defined or
      quantified in children. Therefore, using patient-centered outcomes, we aim to: 1) compare
      treatment failure rates and 2) compare the rate of adverse drug effects between
      narrow-spectrum and broad-spectrum antibiotics for the treatment of common ARTIs in
      children. To accomplish this, we will perform a prospective cohort study of children
      receiving antibiotics for ARTI across a comprehensive pediatric healthcare network. Outcomes
      will include clinical treatment failure and adverse drug effects as identified by 1) return
      to primary care, emergency department visits, and hospitalizations for new antibiotic
      prescription and/or ARTI complication and 2) parent/caregiver assessment of clinical
      improvement and adverse drug effects. Comparing the patient-specific outcomes between these
      different antibiotic regimens for ARTIs will help inform treating clinicians and parents of
      the risks and benefits associated with the management of these common conditions.

        Visits of all patients who are seen at the CHOP Primary Care Network practices will be
        identified to estimate the effectiveness and safety of antibiotics for acute respiratory
        tract infections (ARTIs), while a stratified sample will be used to study additional
        patient-oriented outcomes.
