    <textblock>
      This study aims to show that the addition of carboplatin and paclitaxel chemotherapy to a
      palliative course of external beam radiation treatment improves both dysphagia relief and
      patient quality of life in patients with unresectable esophageal cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with carcinoma of the esophagus not suitable for definitive radical treatment who
      have symptomatic dysphagia requiring locoregional palliation, and who have no
      contra-indications to chemo-radiotherapy will be offered Carboplatin (AUC 2) and paclitaxel
      (50 mg/m2) intravenously on days 1, 8 concurrent with external beam radiation therapy of
      30Gy/10 fractions over two weeks where the primary goal is relief of dysphagia and other
      outcomes include toxicity, quality of life and metabolomics.

    <measure>The proportion of patients who achieve relief of dysphagia, defined as improvement of at least one point on the Mellow dysphagia scale, at nine weeks after the start of radiotherapy, maintained for at least 4 weeks.</measure>

    <description>Will be measured from enrollment to the time of first progression of dysphagia. Progression of dysphagia will be defined as:
A drop of at least 1 point on the 5 point Mellow dysphagia scale, Stricture requiring intervention, Death, Time to achieving any response in dysphagia after treatment as measured by an improvement of at least 1 point on the 5 point dysphagia scale, Number of patients receiving secondary treatment (radiation, chemotherapy or stenting), Utility assessments pre to post treatment and at 3 and 6 months, Quality of life differences post treatment and at 3 and 6 months. Measures of biological/serological correlates of response, Acute and late toxicity.</description>

    <description>Patients will receive external beam radiation therapy of 30Gy/10 fractions over two weeks and receive carboplatin (AUC 2) and paclitaxel (50 mg/m2) intravenously on days 1, 8. Treatment will be delivered using 3D radiotherapy planning to encompass the primary tumor and surrounding clinical target volume. Preparation and administration of chemotherapy will be according to local site standard operating procedures. Patients are seen weekly during concurrent chemoradiation then every 4 weeks until 6 months after enrollment.</description>
