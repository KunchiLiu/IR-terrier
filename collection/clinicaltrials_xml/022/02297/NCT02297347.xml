  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Newborn screening and early treatment prevent the most severe manifestations of
      phenylketonuria (PKU). However, executive functioning deficits, attention deficit disorder,
      slow processing speed, and visual-motor problems commonly occur. Many adults with this
      disorder also suffer depression and anxiety. In this study the investigators will examine
      adults with PKU on sapropterin dihydrochloride (Kuvan) treatment for PKU and compare their
      results to those of subjects with PKU not on Kuvan. Using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
      techniques, including novel MR spectroscopy (MRS) the investigators hope to discover why
      this distinct constellation of deficits occurs in PKU. Adult subjects with PKU will undergo
      a comprehensive MRI evaluations, including a novel method of MR spectroscopy to determine
      brain phenylalanine levels. In addition, participants will receive neurological and
      neuropsychological examinations and dietary evaluation.
