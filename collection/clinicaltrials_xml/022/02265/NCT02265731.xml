        Inclusion Criteria:

        Participants must have histologically documented diagnosis of NHL (and exhausted options
        considered standard of care) as defined in the World Health Organization classification
        scheme and relapsed following or be refractory to standard treatments such as R-CHOP,
        R-CVP, or fludarabine based regimens. Participants with other lymphoproliferative diseases
        can be considered in consultation with the AbbVie medical monitor

        Relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma participants must have been previously treated
        with at least one prior line of therapy and have measurable disease

        Chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma participants must have relapsed or
        be refractory to standard treatments such as fludarabine based regimens or alkylator based
        regimens

        Untreated AML subjects or Relapsed or refractory AML subjects must have been previously
        treated with at least one prior line of therapy

        Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance score less than or equal to 1;
        adequate bone marrow independent of growth factor support per local laboratory reference
        range; and adequate coagulation, renal, and hepatic function, per laboratory reference
        range at Screening

        Participants with a history of autologous or allogenic stem cell transplantation must have
        adequate blood counts independent of growth factor support and have recovered from any
        transplant-related toxicity(s) and be at least 100 days post-autologous transplant
        (multiple myeloma) or 6 month post-autologous transplant (NHL) prior to first dose of
        study drug or at least 6 months post-allogenic transplant (multiple myeloma) prior to
        first dose of study drug and not have active graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), i.e.,
        requiring treatment

        Exclusion Criteria:

        NHL participants who have undergone an allogeneic stem cell transplant or were diagnosed
        with Post-Transplant Lymphoproliferative Disease, Burkitt's lymphoma, Burkitt-like
        lymphoma, or lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukemia

        Participant tested positive for HIV

        Participant has a cardiovascular disability status of New York Heart Association Class
        greater or equal to 2

        Participant has a significant history of renal, neurologic, psychiatric, pulmonary,
        endocrinologic, metabolic, immunologic, cardiovascular, or hepatic disease that in the
        opinion of the Investigator would adversely affect his/her participating in this study.

        Participant received a monoclonal antibody for anti-neoplastic intent within 8 weeks prior
        to the first dose of study drug.
