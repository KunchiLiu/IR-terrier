        Subjects will be recruited from the available Covidien Boulder Clinical Lab subject data
        base.

        Adults 18 and over will be recruited for testing of any of the devices described within
        this protocol. The goal is to have an equitable distribution of female and male subjects
        to eliminate the possibility of gender bias and ensure a broad range of finger sizes.
        Subjects of all racial and ethnic backgrounds may be included in the studies.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female subjects 18 or older (inclusive)

          -  Subject is able to participate for the duration of the study

          -  Subject is willing to sign an informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previous injury or trauma to fingers or hands that may change blood flow or vascular
             supply and affect our ability to test sensors

          -  Physiologic abnormalities that prevent proper application of pulse oximetry sensor

          -  Severe contact allergies that cause a reaction to standard adhesive materials such as
             those found in medical sensors and electrodes
