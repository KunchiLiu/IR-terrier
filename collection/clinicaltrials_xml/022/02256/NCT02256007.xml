  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study designs and develops an evidence-based game approach that will enhance the
      investigators understanding and usability of electronic tools to measure cognitive and
      sensorimotor abilities in an inpatient rehabilitation stroke population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The rehabilitation industry is the incipient stages of developing and using electronic based
      assessment and intervention tools. With the growing understanding of cognitive recovery
      following stroke, rehabilitation specialists are optimistic that appropriate rehabilitation
      interventions may optimize and enhance functional outcomes. The use of technology based
      assessments via video games may assist in a patient's cognitive recovery. Design and
      development of an evidence-based game approach will enhance the investigators understanding
      and usability of electronic tools to measure cognitive and sensorimotor abilities.
