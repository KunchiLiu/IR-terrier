  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants with metastatic or locally advanced/unresectable urothelial cancer that has
      recurred or progressed following platinum-based chemotherapy will be randomly assigned to
      receive pembrolizumab or Investigator's choice of paclitaxel, docetaxel, or vinflunine. The
      primary study hypotheses are that pembrolizumab will prolong Overall Survival (OS) and
      Progression-free Survival (PFS) compared to paclitaxel, docetaxel, or vinflunine.

      The study's interim analysis results demonstrated superior OS in the Pembrolizumab arm
      compared to the Active Comparator arm (investigator's choice: paclitaxel, docetaxel or
      vinflunine). Based on the positive outcome of the OS interim analysis, effective with
      Amendment 15, eligible participants who were allocated to the Active Comparator arm and
      experienced disease progression will be provided with the opportunity to crossover to
      receive pembrolizumab 200 mg one time every three weeks (Q3W) for up to two years of
      treatment in the Crossover Phase of the study.
