    <textblock>
      VRC01 is an experimental monoclonal antibody, which is a substance that may have the
      potential to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV. The purpose of this study is to
      assess the safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) (which is how the body interacts with a drug) of
      VRC01 in HIV-exposed infants who are at increased risk of mother-to-child HIV transmission.

      VRC01 is a potent anti-HIV neutralizing monoclonal antibody, which is a substance that may
      have the potential to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV. This study will enroll
      HIV-infected mothers who are at increased risk of passing HIV on to their children. The
      purpose of this study is to assess the safety and PK of VRC01 in HIV-exposed infants.

      This study will enroll 39 mother-infant pairs in three groups. Infants enrolled in Dose
      Group 1 will receive a single VRC01 20 mg/kg injection in the thigh less than 72 hours after
      birth. After 13 mother-infant pairs have been enrolled in Dose Group 1 and study staff have
      reviewed their safety data, staff will enroll 13 mother-infant pairs into Dose Group 2.
      Infants in Dose Group 2 will receive a single VRC01 40 mg/kg injection in the thigh less
      than 72 hours after birth. Study staff will review safety data from 6 participants in Dose
      Group 2 before enrolling 13 mother-infant pairs into Dose Group 3. Infants in Dose Group 3
      will receive a VRC01 40 mg/kg injection in the thigh less than 5 days after birth. They will
      then receive a VRC01 20 mg/kg injection in the thigh monthly for at least 6 months (24
      weeks) and no more than 18 months (72 weeks) while breastfeeding.

      The mothers in Groups 1, 2, and 3 will not receive any VRC01 injections. At study entry, all
      mothers will undergo a medical history review and a blood collection. Infants in Dose Groups
      1 and 2 will attend several study visits through Week 48. Infants in Dose Group 3 will
      attend several study visits through Week 96. Visits will include a medical history review,
      physical examination, blood collection, and oral fluid collection.

        Maternal Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Documentation of HIV infection. Documentation of HIV-1 infection is defined as
             positive results from two samples collected at different time points. All samples
             tested must be whole blood, serum, or plasma. For this protocol, the results for
             sample #2 may be pending at the time of enrollment. Results documented in the
             clinical record from past testing may be used to satisfy the criteria for
             documentation of HIV-1 infection. More information on this criterion can be found in
             the protocol.

          -  Greater than or equal to 18 years of age

          -  Able and willing to provide signed informed consent for herself and her infant

          -  Documented or suspected serious medical illness or immediate life threatening
             condition (other than HIV infection) in the mother that may interfere with the
             ability to complete study requirements, as judged by the examining clinician

        Infant Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Born to an HIV-1-infected woman who meets all maternal inclusion/exclusion criteria
             listed above

               -  Dose Group 3: Less than or equal to 5 days of age, and anticipated availability
                  to receive VRC01 immunization no more than 5 days after birth.

          -  At increased risk of HIV acquisition defined as documentation of one or more of the
             following risk factors:

          -  Dose Group 2, only:

               -  Mother received no ART during pregnancy; or

               -  Mother began or reinitiated ART (after an interruption of greater than 14 days),
                  during the third trimester of pregnancy; or

               -  Mother with any detectable viral replication (HIV RNA above the limit of
                  detection) at last measurement prior to delivery determined within 30 days of

                  historical documentation of lack of response

               -  Women who have a documented history of virologic failure while on NNRTIs but who
                  had no resistance testing at the time of viral failure will be considered to
                  have NNRTI documented resistance.

             investigational.)

          -  Receipt of or anticipated need for blood products, immunoglobulin, or
             immunosuppressive therapy. This includes infants who require hepatitis B
             immunoglobulin (HBIG) but does not require exclusion of infants who receive hepatitis
             B vaccine in the newborn period.

          -  Documented or suspected serious medical illness, serious congenital anomaly, or
             immediate life threatening condition in the infant that may interfere with the
             ability to complete study requirements, as judged by the examining clinician

          -  Any requirement for supplemental oxygen beyond 24 hours of life or requiring

                  greater than or equal to 1.25 times upper limit of age adjusted normal

          -  Dose Group 2, only: Infant is breastfeeding at time of enrollment or mother has
             indicated an intention to initiate breastfeeding. Note: if a child is breastfed prior
             to known maternal diagnosis (in the case of a woman diagnosed in the intrapartum
             period), the child is still eligible as long as breastfeeding is stopped by the time
