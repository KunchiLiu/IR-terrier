  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this research study, the investigators are looking at the effects of Meibomian Gland
      Probing (MGP) versus a sham (fake) procedure in patients with refractory MGD who have
      already tried traditional management with no success in resolving their clinical signs (as
      seen by their ophthalmologist) or their symptoms.

      The investigators are also evaluating the effects of using two (2) post-procedural
      medication treatments: Blephamide or GenTeal PM Night-Time to determine if treatment after
      the MGP procedure has an effect on its outcome.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dry eye disease is one of the most common conditions seen in ophthalmic practice and is
      associated with significant patient distress. Meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) is among the
      most prevalent causes of dry eye disease. This condition, which is often due to obstruction
      of the meibomian gland orifices, may result in significant ocular irritation. Traditionally,
      management of MGD includes warm compress, lid hygiene, and anti-inflammatory medications.
      This randomized clinical trial is designed to evaluate the effects of meibomian gland
      probing versus sham procedure in cases with refractory MGD that do not respond to
      traditional treatments. Moreover, the effects of postoperative regimen will also be
      investigated using two different regimens. In addition to symptoms, the changes will also be
      evaluated in terms of clinical signs as well as in vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM) which
      allows study at the cellular level.

    <description>Meibomian Gland Probing: After obtaining adequate anesthesia using 3.5% topical lidocaine hydrochloride jelly and if necessary 2% injected lidocaine (Akron), the solid stainless steel probes (Maskin® Meibomian Gland Intraductal Probes, Rhein Medical Inc.) will be used to probe all the meibomian glands of upper lids of both eyes at the slit lamp. All patients will initially be probed with a 1-mm probe followed by a 2-mm probe for all glands.
Placebo: GenTeal PM Night-Time Ointment (Alcon) is a sterile ophthalmic lubricant that is commonly used to relieve symptoms in patients with dry eye disease. Its active ingredients are mineral oil (3%) and white petrolatum (94%). The ointment will be applied topically to both eyes for 4 weeks with the following regimen: twice daily for 2 weeks and then once daily for 2 weeks.</description>

Sham Meibomian Gland Probing: After obtaining adequate anesthesia using 3.5% topical lidocaine hydrochloride jelly and if necessary 2% injected lidocaine (Akron), the patient's lid margin will be touched with the probes without actual probing of the meibomian gland orifices.

Blephamide: (sulfacetamide sodium 10%/ prednisolone acetate 0.2% ophthalmic ointment, Allergan) is an FDA approved combination of an antibiotic (sulfacetamide) and an anti-inflammatory agent (prednisolone acetate) commonly used for the treatment of various ocular conditions in which both infection and inflammation play a role. It is preserved with phenylmercuric acetate (0.008%) and contains inactive ingredients of mineral oil, petrolatum and lanolin alcohol and white petrolatum. It will be applied topically to both eyes for 4 weeks with a regimen of: twice daily for 2 weeks and then once daily for 2 weeks.</description>
