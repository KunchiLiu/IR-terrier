    <textblock>
      This pivotal trial of the Obalon Balloon System is intended to generate safety and
      effectiveness data required to support a future marketing application. The trial has been
      designed to evaluate a 6-month use of the Obalon Balloon System as an adjunct to a nutrition
      and lifestyle behavior modification program.

      Weight loss will be evaluated after the 6-month course to determine if a specific predefined
      superiority margin can be achieved in the device group compared to a sham-control group.

    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The difference in mean percent Total Body Loss (%TBL) between the treatment and control arms will be evaluated as the first portion of the co-primary endpoint. %TBL is calculated as the ratio of a subject's weight loss to their starting weight as measured on the date of their first course, first administration procedure.</description>

    <measure>Evaluate of Clinical Events</measure>
    <time_frame>After 6-month device period</time_frame>
    <description>Safety will be closely evaluated throughout the entire study period in both study arms. All clinical events will be recorded using the applicable case report form. The rate of clinical events associated with the device and procedure will be evaluated and compared with the rates of clinical events observed in the control arm. Characterization of the incremental risks associated with the device will serve to assess if the benefits of the device outweigh the risks.</description>
