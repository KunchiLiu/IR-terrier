    <textblock>
      In facial rejuvenating surgery, the current trend calls for fewer and less noticeable scars
      with desired results. Especially to improve the jowls and nasolabial folds, the thread lift
      is a simple and inexpensive technique for patients who do not wish to undergo the typical
      facelift surgery, but the weak points of it are less effective and shorter duration than the
      conventional facelift.The investigators propose the new method of the thread lifting the
      subdermal and subcutaneous layer with a fiberoptic needle by use of the retaining ligaments
      with two fixation points on both temporal fascia and retaining ligaments.

      is a simple and inexpensive technique for patients who do not wish to undergo the typical

      subdermal and subcutaneous layer with a fiberoptic needle by use of the retaining ligaments.

      This technique was performed in 97 patients, of whom 77 patients had primary procedures, and
      20 patients underwent secondary procedures. All of 95 patients were highly satisfied with
      the results. There are no infection, no nerve injury, and no hematoma, but two reoperation
      cases due to suboptimal results.The thread lift by use of the retaining ligaments with
      V-lock barbed sutures is an alternative technique in the facelift.
