  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to investigate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of DG3173 in
      untreated acromegaly patients. Twenty patients received ascending single doses of DG3173 and
      one dose of octreotide, the current gold standard of medical therapy for acromegaly, with
      each patient receiving all doses of DG3173 as well as octreotide.

    <description>Interventions: saline, octreotide and DG3173. Eligible patients are to receive saline as placebo comparator, followed by 300 µg octreotide as active comparator, followed by four ascending doses of 100 µg, 300 µg, 900 µg and 1800 µg DG3173. All treatments will be administered consecutively to all patients as single subcutaneous bolus injections.</description>
