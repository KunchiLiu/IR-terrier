  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Troponins are sensitive and specific markers of cardiac injury. Critically ill patients
      frequently have elevated troponins. In this population, distinguishing patients with
      elevated troponins from those with myocardial infarction is difficult. However, troponin
      elevations on their own seem to be associated with an increased risk of death. The optimal
      treatment of patients with type 2 myocardial infarction or non ischemia related troponin
      elevations during critical illness is unclear. There are no trials in the ICU setting to
      guide management.

      This study is a 1-month pilot cohort study of troponin screening in 4 Ontario intensive care
      units. The objective of this pilot study is to evaluate the ability to perform a larger
      study, which will determine the prevalence, incidence and risk factors for elevated troponin
      values, how patients with elevated troponin values are treated as a baseline, and the
      incidence of myocardial infarction in critically ill patients. Knowing the prognostic impact
      of these conditions and understanding current management will thereafter guide researchers
      and clinicians on the importance of carefully evaluating potential risk-modifying therapies.
