  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine whether the consumption of a beef-rich lunch improves appetite control,
      satiety, and energy intake regulation while reducing food reward and food cravings compared
      to the consumption of a soy-rich lunch when matched for macronutrients and fiber content or
      when match for serving size. The mechanisms of action surrounding the differential responses
      of beef versus soy proteins were also explored.

    <textblock>
      A randomized, crossover design, acute study was completed in 21 healthy adults (age 23 ±1 y;
      BMI: 23.8 ± 0.6 kg/m2) to compare 400 kcal lunch meals varying in protein quality. Two
      separate comparisons were performed. The first comparison consisted of macronutrient and
      fiber-matched lunches which varied in protein quality: 24 g beef protein vs. 24 g soy
      protein. The second comparison matched serving size only: 1 serving of beef (24 g protein
      with 0 g fiber) vs. 1 serving of soy (14 g protein; 5 g fiber). For each treatment, the
      participants completed 2 testing days per lunch treatment. During the &quot;Appetite Assessment
      Days,&quot; each participant reported to the lab to consume one of the lunch meals. Pre and 7-h
      post-lunch appetite and cravings questionnaires were completed throughout each testing day
      along with plasma, hormonal responses, and plasma amino acid concentrations through repeated
      blood sampling. Ad libitum dinner energy intake was also measured. During the &quot;Reward
      Assessment Days,&quot; the participants reported to our facility to again consume one of the
      lunch meals. Pre and post-lunch neural responses to food stimuli, through functional
      magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), occurred followed by ad libitum consumption of a lunch
      dessert.

    <description>Computerized questionnaires, assessing perceived sensations of hunger and fullness were completed throughout the testing days. A post-lunch palatability questionnaire was also completed to identify 'overall liking' of the meal. The questionnaires contained a visual analog scale incorporating a 100 mm horizontal line rating scale for each response. The questions are worded as &quot;how strong is your feeling of&quot; with anchors of &quot;not at all&quot; to &quot;extremely.&quot; The Adaptive Visual Analog Scale Software (Neurobehavioral Research Laboratory ad Clinic; San Antonio, TX) was used for these assessments.</description>

    <measure>Hormonal Responses</measure>
    <time_frame>1 Day</time_frame>
    <description>Blood samples (4 ml/sample; 64 ml/testing day) were collected every 30 min throughout the 8-h testing day. The samples were collected in test tubes containing ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid). Protease inhibitors (pefabloc SC and dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP-IV) were added to some of the tubes to reduce protein degradation (for the hormonal analyses). Within 10 min of collection, the samples were centrifuged at -4°C for 10 min. The plasma was separated and stored in microcentrifuge tubes at -80°C for future analysis.
Plasma total glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1) and total peptide YY (PYY) were measured for all time points using the Milliplex multi-analyte profiling (MAP) magnetic bead-based multi-analyte, metabolic panel,2-plex assay (Millipore, St. Charles, MO) and Magpix Luminex technologies (Luminex Corporation, Austin, TX).</description>

    <measure>Food-cue Stimulated Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Brain Scans</measure>
    <time_frame>1 Day</time_frame>
    <description>A structural scan, lasting 10 min, was performed to identify anatomical structures. During the fMRI phase, the participants viewed photographs projected onto a screen. The fMRI paradigm incorporated 3 categories of pictures including food, animals, and blurred images. The pictures from each category were presented in blocks of images. Ten photographs (of the same type of stimuli) were presented per block. There were 3 repetitions of each block of stimulus-producing images(i.e., food, animal), alternated with blocks of randomized blurred images. Each photograph was projected for 2.5 sec, with an interstimulus interval of 0.5 sec. There was a total of 13 blocks of stimuli presented. The functional scan lasted approximately 7 min and was performed in duplicate. Scanning was performed at the University of Missouri Brain Imaging Center on a 3 Tesla Siemens Trio scanner (Siemens Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany).</description>
