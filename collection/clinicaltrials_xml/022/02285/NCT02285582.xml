      The rare histiocytic disorders (RHDs) are characterized by the infiltration of one or more
      organs by non-LCH histiocytes. They can range from localized disease that resolves
      spontaneously, to progressive disseminated forms that can be sometimes life-threatening.
      Since they are extremely rare, there is limited understanding of their causes and best
      treatment options. Physicians, patients and parents of children with RHDs frequently consult
      members of the Histiocyte Society regarding the best management of these disorders. Very
      often, no specific recommendation can be made due to the lack of prospective outcome data,
      or even large retrospective case series. The creation of an international rare histiocytic
      disorders registry (IRHDR) could facilitate a uniform diagnosis of the RHDs, as well as the
      collection and analysis of the clinical, epidemiological, treatment and survival data of
      patients with RHD. The registry may also lead to future therapeutic recommendations, provide
      a framework for future clinical trials and create excellent research opportunities.

      Histiocytoses are rare diseases caused by an excess of cells called Histiocytes, which can
      infiltrate the skin, bones, lungs, liver, spleen and the central nervous system. These
      disorders can range from localized involvement that resolves spontaneously, to progressive
      disseminated forms that can be debilitating and sometimes life-threatening. The rare
      histiocytic disorders (RHD), or non-Langerhans cell disorders, are a diverse group of
      disorders defined by the accumulation of histiocytes that do not meet the criteria for
      Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) or hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). They
      include: Juvenile xanthogranuloma family, Erdheim-Chester disease, Multifocal
      Reticulohistiocytosis, Rosai-Dorfman disease and the Malignant Histiocytoses. Since they are
      so rare, there is limited understanding of their causes and treatments. Physicians, patients
      and parents of children with rare histiocytoses frequently consult members of the Histiocyte
      Society on the management of these disorders. Very often, no specific recommendation about
      treatment can be made due to the lack of prospective outcome data for these rare entities.
      The creation of an International Rare Histiocytic Disorders Rregistry (IRHDR) will
      facilitate a uniform diagnosis of the RHD's, as well as the collection and analysis of the
      clinical, epidemiological, treatment and survival data of patients with RHD. The registry
      will also provide expert pathology reviews and may lead to future therapeutic
      recommendations. Furthermore, the IRHDR can provide a framework for future clinical trials,
      thus, creating excellent research opportunities. Lastly, a de-identified link between
      clinical data and companion biology studies can potentially be accomplished in the future
      through the IRHDR. This may further help in understanding the etiology of these rare
      diseases, as well as identifying potential therapeutic targets.
