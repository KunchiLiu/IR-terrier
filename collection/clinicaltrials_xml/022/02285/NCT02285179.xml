    <textblock>
      This study is designed as a phase 1 dose escalation study followed by a randomised phase II
      study. The study will be performed in three different centres: Addenbrooke &amp; Cambridge
      university (Cambridge, UK), Netherlands Cancer Institute Amsterdam), and Vall d'Hebron
      Hospital (Barcelona, Spain).

      Three to six patients will be followed for one completed cycle of therapy (28 days) and
      subsequent enrolment of new cohorts will be based on the safety assessment in that first
      cycle and the documentation of dose limiting toxicities. To determine the safety and
      efficacy of tamoxifen in combination with the isoform selective Pi3K inhibitor GDC-0032
      compared with tamoxifen alone.

      To determine the recommended phase II dose (RPTD) of GDC-0032 in combination with tamoxifen
      in hormone receptor positive, HER2 negative metastatic breast cancer patients who have
      progressed after prior endocrine treatment .Description of toxicity profile, severity and
      frequency of adverse events (observed with the combination of GDC-0032 and tamoxifen To
      evaluate the safety and tolerability of GDC-0032 in combination with tamoxifen, recording
      adverse events using CTCAE v. 4.0 criteria To describe the pharmacokinetics of GDC-0032 in
      combination with tamoxifen To investigate the possibility of major drug-drug interactions
      (PK) To obtain proof of target inhibition by selected pharmacodynamic measurements To look
      for preliminary evidence of anti-tumour activity To assess the status of potential
      biomarkers for drug response like PIK3CA gene mutations, relevant proteins and
      phospho-proteins in the PI3K pathway, circulating tumour DNA (ct-DNA) To assess germline DNA
      sequence for pharmacogenetics studies
