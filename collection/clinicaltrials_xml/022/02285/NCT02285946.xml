  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During mechanical ventilation, the alveolar recruitment maneuver (ARM) is to apply a
      positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) (generally 30 cm H2O) for a period of at least 30
      seconds. The realization of MRA is one of three main elements of mechanical ventilation
      called &quot;protective&quot;. This ventilatory strategy, originally described for the ventilation of
      acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and pulmonary and during abdominal surgery is
      based on a decrease tidal volumes, optimization of PEEP and the realization of MRA.
      Protective ventilation limit the occurrence of atelectasis, the surdistentions and,
      ultimately, significantly decreases postoperative complications.

      The MRA is currently recommended in the &quot;major&quot; surgery. Most spine surgery (eg
      transpedicular fixation) used in this definition, the MRA are indicated and now commonly
      used. This type of surgery requires further positioning the patient in the prone position
      (DV). The DV modifies the compliance of the chest respiratory characteristics and changes
      (increase in insufflation pressure) and hemodynamic (decreased venous return) of the
      patient.

      Respiratory and haemodynamic effects of MRA made VIS at major spine surgery are not known.
      The aim of this observational study, non-interventional, is to compare the hemodynamic and
      respiratory effects of MRA performed in DV to those of MRA performed in the prone position
      (DD).

      The investigators hypothesis is that the respiratory and hemodynamic consequences of MRA
      performed in DV is different from those conducted in DD. A better understanding of
      hemodynamic and respiratory characteristics of MRA performed in DV would provide a more
      tailored to this type of surgery respiratory optimization strategy and reduce respiratory
      complications of this surgery.
