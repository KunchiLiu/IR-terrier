    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety, and efficacy of
      emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (F/TAF) in HIV-1 infected children and adolescents
      virologically suppressed (defined as having &lt; 50 copies/mL of HIV-1 RNA for a period of at
      least 6 months) while on a stable 2-nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor
      (NRTI) containing regimen.

      There will be 2 Cohorts in this study. Cohort 1 (adolescents 12 to &lt; 18 years) will be
      non-randomized and participants will switch their current 2-NRTI containing regimen to F/TAF
      while continuing on their 3rd antiretroviral (ARV) agent through 96 weeks. Upon review of
      safety and PK data in Cohort 1, screening into Part A of Cohort 2 will be initiated. Cohort
      2 (children 6 to &lt; 12 years) will be randomized and will consist of Parts A and B.
      Participants in Cohort 2 Part A will be randomized to receive either F/TAF or
      emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (FTC/TDF) while continuing on their 3rd ARV
      agent through 96 weeks. Upon review of safety and intensive PK data in Cohort 2 Part A,
      screening into Cohort 2 Part B will be initiated. Participants in Cohort 2 Part B will be
      randomized to receive either F/TAF or FTC/TDF while continuing their 3rd ARV agent through
      96 weeks.
