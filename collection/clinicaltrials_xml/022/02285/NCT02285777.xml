      This is extension of the V102_16 study (NCT02140762). V102_16E1 is designed to assess the
      effectiveness of a 3-dose vaccination series of MenABCWY, administered according to 0, 2, 6
      month schedule, against the same panel of endemic US N. meningitidis serogroup B strains, as
      measured by enc-hSBA assay. The subjects who completed the parent V102_16 study will be
      invited at the time of their last study visit to participate in this extension study.
