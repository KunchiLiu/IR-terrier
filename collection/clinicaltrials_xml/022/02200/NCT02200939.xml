      The purpose of this study is to evaluate bioinduction of new tissue and tendon healing after
      implantation of the Rotation Medical Bioinductive Implant used as either a standalone device
      or adjunct to surgical repair in the treatment of supraspinatus tendon tears.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Rotator cuff tear requiring surgery that meets either criterion A or B: (A) Medium or
             large partial-thickness tear or very small full-thickness tear of the supraspinatus
             tendon planned for standalone treatment (no surgical repair with sutures/suture
             anchors) with the bioinductive implant; (B) Medium or large full-thickness tear
             primarily of the supraspinatus tendon planned for treatment with the bioinductive
             implant adjunctive to surgical repair

          -  Chronic shoulder pain lasting longer than 3 months unresponsive to conservative
             therapy including, but not limited to, pain medication, physical therapy and
             injections

          -  MRI of the shoulder within 60 days prior to the study procedure

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Massive rotator cuff tears (≥ 5 cm)

          -  Acute rotator cuff tears less than 12 months from injury
