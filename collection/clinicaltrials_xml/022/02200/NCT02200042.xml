    <textblock>
      This randomized phase III trial studies how well gemcitabine hydrochloride and cisplatin
      with or without radiation therapy work in treating patients with localized liver cancer that
      cannot be removed by surgery. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine hydrochloride
      and cisplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing
      the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Radiation
      therapy uses high energy x rays to kill tumor cells. It is not yet known whether giving
      gemcitabine hydrochloride and cisplatin is more effective with or without radiation therapy
      in treating patients with localized liver cancer that cannot be removed by surgery.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the addition of liver-directed radiation therapy to chemotherapy with respect
      to overall survival (OS) for patients with unresectable, localized intrahepatic
      cholangiocarcinoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the addition of liver-directed radiation therapy to chemotherapy with respect
      to local control for patients with unresectable, localized intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.

      II. To evaluate the addition of liver-directed radiation therapy to chemotherapy with
      respect to adverse events for patients with unresectable, localized intrahepatic
      cholangiocarcinoma.

      III. To evaluate the addition of liver-directed radiation therapy to chemotherapy with
      respect to regional control for patients with unresectable, localized intrahepatic
      cholangiocarcinoma.

      IV. To evaluate the addition of liver-directed radiation therapy to chemotherapy with
      respect to distant metastases for patients with unresectable, localized intrahepatic
      cholangiocarcinoma.

      V. To evaluate the addition of liver-directed radiation therapy to chemotherapy with respect
      to progression-free survival for patients with unresectable, localized intrahepatic
      cholangiocarcinoma.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over at least 30 minutes and
      cisplatin IV over 60 minutes on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 3 courses
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients without disease
      progression are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes and cisplatin IV over
      60 minutes on days 1 and 8 for 1 course. Beginning 7-21 days from the last dose of
      chemotherapy, patients undergo 15 fractions of image-guided radiation therapy delivered over
      19-26 or 27-34 days. Beginning 7 days after completion of radiation therapy, patients
      continue treatment with gemcitabine hydrochloride and cisplatin. Treatment repeats every 21
      days for up to 5 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV and cisplatin IV as in Arm I.
      Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 5 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients may continue gemcitabine hydrochloride at the discretion of
      the treating physician.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 3 years
      then every 6 months for 5 years.
