  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the administration of flu vaccine using
      Needle-Free is equivalent to Needle and Syringe administration as measured by laboratory
      tests of immune response.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary:

      To evaluate the non-inferiority of flu vaccine administered by needle-free intramuscular
      (IM) injection versus needle and syringe IM injection as determined with serum
      hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) reciprocal titers in healthy adults between 18-64 years.

      Secondary:

      To compare tolerability and safety of the vaccine in the same population based on
      specifically solicited local and systemic reactions occurring through 7 days
      post-immunization and adverse events spontaneously reported through approximately 28 days
      post immunization.

    <measure>Anti Influenza Hemagglutination Inhibition (HAI) Antibody Geometric Mean Titers (GMT)</measure>
    <time_frame>28 Days</time_frame>
    <description>The GMT criterion for non-inferiority for the upper limit of the 95% CIs of the GMT ratio (GMT with Needle-Free / GMT with Needle and Syringe) antigen will not exceed 1.5 fold.</description>

    <measure>The Percentage of Evaluable Participants Achieving Seroconversion or Significant Increase in Antibody Titer.</measure>
    <time_frame>28 Days</time_frame>
    <description>Seroconversion is defined as a 4-fold rise in HAI titer in post-immunization serum relative to pre-immunization serum, or if pre-immunization serum had an undetectable titer (&lt;1:10), attainment of a post-immunization titer of ≥1:40.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of subjects with immediate complaints</measure>
    <time_frame>30 Minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The following possible immediate complaints will be solicited following the 30 minute safety observation period post-vaccination: local pain, redness, induration/swelling, itching where the injection was given. The data will be reported as &quot;immediate complaints&quot; and presumed to be related to the test article. Any other symptom experienced at 30 minutes will be recorded as an adverse event.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of subjects with reactogenicity events</measure>
    <time_frame>7 Days</time_frame>
    <description>vaccine reactogenicity will be collected on a patient-completed diary card daily for seven days post-vaccination. The following adverse events will be solicited on the diary card: injection site pain, injection site tenderness, injection site itching, injection site swelling, injection site redness, injection site bruising, fever, fatigue, headache, decreased appetite, muscle ache.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of subjects with spontaneously reported adverse events</measure>
    <time_frame>28 days</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will be asked to report any other symptoms experienced in addition to the solicited &quot;immediate&quot; and &quot;vaccine reactogenicity&quot; events. Any other events reported will be tabulated as spontaneously reported adverse events.</description>
