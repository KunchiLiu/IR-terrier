      Clinical trial phase I/II, of test of concept, blind double, controlled with placebo,
      randomized, in which a total of 15 patients will be included In an initial phase, there will
      be included 5 patients of sequential form, with a minimum of 15 days of safety period
      between the first infusion of a patient and the first one of the following patient. These
      first 5 patients will not be randomized, being all of them treated with the medicine in
      investigation. When the last one of these 5 patients has received the first three foreseen
      doses, the safety information will be evaluated by an Independent Data Monitoring Committee.
      If this evaluation is positive, it will be continued by the trial being recruited the rest
      of patients (n = 10). After randomization, 5 of these patients will receive cellular therapy
      and the other 5 will receive an infusion of the placebo product.
