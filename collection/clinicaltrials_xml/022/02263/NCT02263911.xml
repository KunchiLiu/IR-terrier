    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to understand the relationship of 3 different dosage forms of
      baricitinib. This study will also explore the effect of food on how the body absorbs
      baricitinib. This study will last about 5 weeks, not including screening. Screening is
      required within 28 days prior to the date of first dosing.
