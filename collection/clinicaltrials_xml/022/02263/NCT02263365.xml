  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dehydration post creation of a diverting ileostomy is a common and debilitating problem
      faced by patients undergoing ileal-anal pouch anastomoses for both inflammatory bowel
      disease and familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) syndrome. Those patients with low rectal
      cancers or other polyposis syndromes e.g. HNPCC hereditary non polyposis colorectal cancers,
      may potentially have a delay in the adjuvant therapy when faced with this complication.

      Studies performed in this groups of patients report a readmission rate of 17-21% for
      dehydration.

      Loperamide has been shown to significantly decrease the daily volume of weight of stool in
      these patients.

      The purpose of this study is to establish whether loperamide given at 4mg three times daily
      for 14 days from day of discharge empirically decreases 30 days readmission rate for
      dehydration.

      The investigators hypothesize that there will be a 15% decrease from 25% to 10% in the
      readmission rates, that severity of dehydration will be decreased.
