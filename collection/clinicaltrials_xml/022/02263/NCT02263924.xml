      Phase III, single-centre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial
      to evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral Vitamin E (Mixed Tocotrienol) for 6 months in
      patients with moderate ischemic stroke.

      150 patients will be recruited. Half will receive mixed tocotrienol 200mg twice a day for 6
      months while the other half will receive placebo capsules.

          -  Time of ischemic stroke onset not exactly known
