  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A recombinant AAV vector has been generated to carry the codon-optimized acid
      alpha-glucosidase (coGAA) gene expressed from a human desmin enhancer/promoter (DES). The
      proposed clinical trial is a within-participant, double-blind, randomized, phase I
      controlled study evaluating the toxicology, biodistribution and potential activity of
      re-administration of rAAV9-DES-hGAA injected intramuscularly into the TA. Nine participants
      (18 years old or older) Late-Onset Pompe Disease (LOPD) will be included. The goal of the
      immune modulation strategy is to ablate B-cells (Rituximab and Sirolimus) prior to the
      initial exposure to the study agent in one leg and the subsequent exposure of the same
      vector to the contralateral leg after four months. At each study agent dosing, the
      contralateral leg will receive excipient. Patients will act as their own controls. Repeated
      measures, at baseline and during the following 3 months after each injection, will assess
      the safety, biochemical and functional impact of the vector.

      Enrolling in this study will entail participating in 8 months of study-related visits.
      Patients will be asked to come to the Clinical and Translational Research Building at the
      University of Florida for a series of onsite study visits, including a baseline visit, two
      injections of the gene transfer and two post-injection visits. All the visits, including the
      injections, will last two days and will be performed as outpatient procedures at the
      Clinical Research Center (CRC) and at other facilities at the University of Florida.
      Overnight observation will not be needed, however, patients will be asked to stay overnight
      in a hotel near the University of Florida. During the first 4 months after each injection,
      patients will be asked to perform outpatient laboratory work at a laboratory facility
      convenient for them.

      In addition, during this study patients will be asked to take medications that will modulate
      the ability of their immune system to react against foreign agents including the gene
      transfer agent. The purpose of these medications is to improve the activity of the GAA
      within the body. Patients will need to take one medication (Rituximab) 15 days prior the
      first injection of the study agent and the day before each injection. Rituximab will be
      repeated at 2nd injection only if his/her body is producing antibody (B cells counts).
      Rituximab will be delivered by infusion that may last 2-6 hours. Patients will need to take
      another medication (Sirolimus) every day starting 3 days before the first injection of the
      study agent until one month after the second injection of the study agent.

      The following discusses what will occur at each visit:

      Baseline Baseline Evaluation and first Rituximab infusion - Day -15/-14

        -  Medical history:Patients will be asked to complete a questionnaire about his/her
           medical history.

        -  Blood and urine tests: These tests will be used for evaluating the safety of the gene
           transfer agent.

        -  Quantitative Muscle Testing (QMT): This test finds out how strong the patient's leg
           muscles are.

        -  Balance test: Balance will be tested by Nintendo Wii-fit board, which will acquire the
           oscillation of the patient's body in the standing position.

        -  Gait analysis: Gait will be tested with Gait Mat II, which will record the spatial and
           temporal parameters of his/her walk such as cadence, speed and distance between your
           feet.

        -  Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Spectroscopy (MRS): MRI and MRS testing will be
           done inside a large magnet that lets the study doctors measure the size and health of
           the patient's muscles. These tests are done at the same time. MRI and MRS testing will
           require the patient to stay very still for up to an hour.

        -  Muscle Biopsy: Tissue samples obtained will be used for evaluation of muscle glycogen
           and GAA activity in the injected muscle.

        -  Magnetic stimulation of the common fibular nerve: The common fibular nerve, which is
           the nerve that controls the injected muscle, will be stimulated with a magnetic field
           to test the impact of the gene transfer agent to the nervous system.

        -  Single-fiber Electromyography (EMG): Single-fiber EMG test consists of introducing a
           small recording needle in the muscle to record the activity of the muscle fiber during
           stimulation or voluntary contraction.

        -  The patient will receive the first Rituximab infusion. It might last between 2 and 6
           hours.

      Rituximab infusion and 1st Injection - Day 0/1

        -  The patient will receive the 2nd Rituximab infusion the day before the gene transfer
           agent. It might last between 2 and 6 hours. He/she will receive the gene transfer agent
           in 1 injection (a total of about 1 teaspoon) into the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle of
           one leg. The other leg will receive a pharmacologically inactive solution. An
           ultrasound will be used to detect the proper location of injection. A photograph of the
           injection at the injection site may be taken. If the patient agrees to this, he/she
           will be asked to sign a consent form for this procedure.

      Outpatient lab work - Day 5/15/30/60

        -  Blood and urine tests

      Onsite visit - Day 89/90

        -  Medical history

        -  Blood and urine tests

        -  Quantitative Muscle Testing (QMT)

        -  Balance test

        -  Gait analysis

        -  Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Spectroscopy (MRS)

        -  Muscle Biopsy

        -  Magnetic stimulation of the common fibular nerve

        -  Single-fiber EMG

      Rituximab infusion and 2nd Injection - Day 120/121

        -  The patient will receive the 3nd Rituximab infusion the day before the gene transfer
           agent only if his/her body is producing antibody (B cells counts). It might last
           between 2 and 6 hours. The patient will receive the second gene transfer agent
           injection in the leg that previously received the inactive solution. The leg that
           previously received the study agent will receive the inactive solution. The injection
           procedure and the amount of study agent injected will be the same as the first
           injection.

      Outpatient lab work - Day 125/ 135/ 150/ 180

        -  Blood and urine tests

      Onsite visit - Day 209/210
