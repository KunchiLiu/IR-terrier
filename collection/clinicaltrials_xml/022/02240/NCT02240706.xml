          2. Patient has the evidence of symptomatic anemia according to the following criteria:

               -  Phase I only: Patients must have mean hemoglobin concentration &lt; 10.0 g/dL of 2

                  to be relevant by the Investigator.

                  this trial.

         18. Chronic use, as defined by &gt; 2 weeks of a corticosteroid agent that is &gt;= 20 mg/day
             of prednisone or its equivalent, within 4 weeks prior to first administration of BI
             836858.

         19. Treatment with an immunomodulatory agent within 4 weeks prior to first administration
             of BI 836858.

         20. Patient received prior treatment with a CD33 antibody.

         21. In the opinion of the Investigator patient is unable or unwilling to comply with the
