  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adolescent suicide is the 3rd leading cause of death in this age group. There are no
      validated treatments to decrease the risk of adolescent suicidal behavior, and there are
      especially no interventions to target the highest risk period for adolescent suicide and
      suicidal behavior, namely during the time of transition from inpatient to outpatient care.
      This project aims to develop a novel, brief intervention that can be delivered on an
      inpatient unit prior to the transition to outpatient care, will augment known factors to
      protect adolescents from suicidal behavior, and will extend the impact of treatment by
      liaison with the outpatient therapist and the development of a personalized safety plan
      phone application. This treatment, ASAP, focuses on augmenting Adherence to the components
      of ASAP and outpatient aftercare, development of a personalized Safety Plan, and Affect
      Protection, through helping the teen and family promote a positive mood, achieve healthy
      sleep habits, maintain sobriety, and access social support.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A 2-site R34 is in progress to develop a brief, flexible, manualized intervention with
      supporting phone app to reduce the risk of suicidal behavior in adolescents with high
      suicidal ideation or a recent suicide attempt, during the transition from inpatient to
      outpatient care. This transition period is the highest risk period for attempted and
      completed suicide. Suicide is the 3rd leading cause of adolescent mortality, and there are
      currently no established interventions for suicidal teens. By developing a treatment that
      can be delivered on an inpatient unit prior to the transition to outpatient treatment, we
      anticipate being able to lower suicidal risk and increase the likelihood that participants
      will attend subsequent outpatient treatment. In keeping with the priorities of NIMH, this
      intervention aimed at reducing the risk of suicide and suicidal behavior will be
      trans-diagnostic. We term the intervention ASAP, with anticipated components: (1)
      Adherence—promoting engagement and adherence to treatment through motivational interviewing;
      (2) Safety planning; and (3) Affect Protection- selecting from a menu of techniques for
      maintaining positive affect (e.g. savoring and switching strategies, mobilizing social
      support, maintaining sobriety, and improving sleep). Each of these components will be
      delivered within a Motivational Interviewing framework for enhancing intrinsic motivation
      for change. Treatment is brief (6-8 hours), and flexibly delivered on inpatient units or in
      home visits prior to initiation of outpatient treatment. ASAP augments protective factors
      against recurrent suicidal behavior and includes the family in the treatment. A safety plan
      phone app to extend the impact of treatment will also be developed. Innovative features
      include: (1) delivery of an intervention at a time and place when suicidal risk is highest;
      (2) augmentation of protective factors against recurrent suicidal behavior, specifically by
      promoting development of positive affect, healthy sleep and social support; (3) a Safety
      plan phone app to extend the impact of treatment; and (4) liaison with the outpatient
      therapist to ensure continuity of care. Following development, this project will conduct an
      RCT of ASAP followed by Aftercare (AC) vs. AC alone in 80 suicidal teens (across both sites)
      to determine ASAP's feasibility, acceptability, impact on proximal targets (e.g., adherence
      to outpatient care, sleep, positive affect, substance use), suicidal ideation and behavior.
      ASAP, developed with and intended for community clinicians, has the potential to be a
      sustainable intervention to reduce the burden of adolescent suicidality.

    <description>Information about past and current suicidal behavior and non-suicidal self-injury will be obtained using the Columbia Suicide History Form, with ideation and behavior classified using the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS). Self-reported ideation will be assessed using the Suicidal Ideation Questionnaire - Junior (SIQ-Jr). The two main outcomes, assessing recurrent suicidal behavior and change in suicidal ideation, to be assessed at weeks 4, 12, and 24.</description>

    <description>Attendance to treatment and type of treatment will be documented by the Adolescent Longitudinal Interval Follow-up Evaluation (A-LIFE) and Child and Adolescent Services Assessment (CASA). The A-LIFE will also be used to document the course of ongoing psychiatric disorders. The CASA is commonly used for assessing service use for health economic evaluations.</description>

    <measure>Client Satisfaction</measure>

    <description>Client Satisfaction about ASAP will be obtained from the patient and a caretaking parent using the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire-8 (CSQ-8), which has been used in other adolescent treatment studies and has high internal consistency (coefficient α = .93). We also adapt the Post-Study Satisfaction and Usability Questionnaire (PSSUQ) to assess satisfaction with the phone app. The PSSUQ will be filled out by the participant, and is based on earlier measures designed to predict the adoption of technology, based on two main factors: ease of use (easy to learn, access, flexibility, quality of sound, quality of visual display) and usefulness (able to access when needed, helpful when used), scored along 7-point Likert Scales.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Qualitative Interviews</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 4, 12, and 24</time_frame>
    <description>With Dr. Lee's guidance, we will conduct brief semi-structured exit interviews following the intervention with both the parent and teen, which will be developed and coded on the basis of our original qualitative interviews, to assess the acceptability of treatment. In these interviews, we will obtain feedback about perceived effectiveness of the components of treatment, the appropriateness of treatment targets, identification of other targets or approaches that would have been more helpful, barriers to participation, and utility of the phone apps. The phone app will be designed to track how often they were used. We will obtain similar feedback from the ASAP clinicians and from the outpatient aftercare therapists. Based on exit interviews, participant satisfaction, and outcome data from the open trial, the manual and app can be modified.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Child participants will be adolescents (aged 12-17.11 years) admitted to an inpatient
             unit for a recent suicide attempt or significant suicidal ideation with a plan or
             intent. We define a suicide attempt, as per the Columbia Clinical Algorithm for
             Suicide Assessment (C-CASA), as &quot;self-destructive behavior with inferred or stated
             intent to die.&quot;

          -  Participants must be English-speaking.

          -  Participants can have unipolar or bipolar disorder, conduct or oppositional disorder,
             eating disorder, or alcohol or substance use or abuse or dependence.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Child participants to be excluded will be those with current psychosis, mania, &lt;90%
             of ideal body weight, or IQ&lt;70 (based on the age-appropriate Wechsler Intelligence
             Scale if concerns about intellectual capabilities are evident at assessment), as
             these conditions may require more intensive interventions or limit comprehension of
             the intervention components.
