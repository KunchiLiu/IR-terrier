    <textblock>
      This is a phase II study of AZD1775 plus chemotherapy in patients with platinum-resistant
      epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer. Patients will receive
      AZD1775 plus carboplatin or AZD1775 plus pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD). The primary
      endpoint for the study is overall response rate (ORR) defined as the proportion of patients
      achieving a complete or partial tumour response according to Response Evaluation Criteria in
      Solid Tumours (RECIST) v1.1. Secondary endpoints include assessment of the duration of
      response (DoR), overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), disease control rate
      (DCR), Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup (GCIG) cancer antigen-125 response, safety and
      tolerability, clinically significant changes in safety-related laboratory parameters,
      pharmacokinetics (PK) and drug-drug interactions of AZD1775 plus carboplatin and AZD1775
      plus PLD.

      Six (6) patients will be enrolled in the AZD1775 plus carboplatin arm (designated Arm C) in
      a dose escalation scheme as a safety lead-in cohort. When a safe and tolerable dose of
      AZD1775 in combination with carboplatin is determined, 17 additional patients will be
      enrolled to be treated at that dose level. Patients may continue on study as long as they
      are benefitting, have no evidence of disease progression, and do not meet any criteria for
      discontinuation or withdrawal.

      Up to 12 patients will be enrolled in the AZD1775 plus PLD arm (designated Arm D) in a dose
      escalation scheme as a safety lead-in cohort. Dose expansion will not be conducted in Arm D.
      Patients may continue on study as long as they are benefitting, have no evidence of disease
      progression, and do not meet any criteria for discontinuation or withdrawal.

      A Safety Review Team (SRT) will assess the safety and tolerability of the first 6 patients
      in each arm by incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs) after a minimum of 1 treatment
      cycle as determined by NCI CTCAE v4.03 and the occurrence of pre-defined dose-limiting
      toxicities (DLTs). Patients must complete Cycle 1 safety evaluations, and return to the
      study centre for Cycle 2 Day 1 evaluations to be considered evaluable for the safety
      lead-in.

      Following a positive safety assessment for the AZD1775 plus carboplatin arm (Arm C) by the
      SRT, Arm C will continue enrolling until 23 patients have been evaluated for efficacy (i.e.,
      tumour response). Enrollment will not continue in Arm D.

    <description>AZD1775 is a highly selective, adenosine-triphosphate (ATP) competitive, small-molecule inhibitor of the WEE1 kinase that sensitizes tumour cells to cytotoxic agents and is being developed for the treatment of advanced solid tumours and p53 pathway deficient malignancies. Carboplatin is a chemotherapy drug used against some forms of cancer (mainly ovarian carcinoma, lung, head and neck cancers as well as endometrial, esophageal, bladder, breast and cervical; central nervous system or germ cell tumors; osteogenic sarcoma, and as preparation for a stem cell or bone marrow transplant.).</description>
