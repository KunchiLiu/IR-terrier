      Non-myeloablative regimens (as the investigators use herein) are designed to maximally
      suppress the immune system without destruction of the bone marrow stem cell compartment.

      When using a non-myeloablative regimen recovery occurs without infusion of stem cells and
      the stem cells are autologous. While not necessary for recovery, stem cell infusion may
      shorten the interval of neutropenia and attendant complications. Thus in reality there is no
      transplant only an autologous supportive blood product.

      Based on our encouraging results of non-myeloablative hematopoietic stem cell
      transplantation, for patients with multiple sclerosis and chronic inflammatory demyelinating
      polyneuropathy, the investigators will investigate the role of non-myeloablative
      hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for patients with SPS who require assistance to
      ambulate.

      Study Treatment

      Stem Cell Collection-Cyclophosphamide 2.0 gm/m2 will be given on day 0, G-CSF 5-10
      mcg/kg/day SQwill start on day +5 and will continue until apheresis is discontinued.
      Apheresis will begin when the ANC &gt; 1.0 x 109/L and continue until &gt;2.0 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg
      patient weight are cryopreserved. A 10-15 liter apheresis will be performed unless stopped
      earlier for clinical judgment of toxicity (e.g., numbness, tetany). A maximum of four
      apheresis will be performed.

      Conditioning regimen Cyclophosphamide 50 mg/kg/day will be given IV over 1 hour in 250 cc of
      normal saline on day -5, -4, -3, and -2. If actual weight is &lt; ideal weight,
      cyclophosphamide will be given based on actual weight. If actual weight is &gt; ideal weight,
      cyclophosphamide will be given as adjusted ideal weight. Adjusted ideal weight = ideal
      weight + 40% x actual weight minus ideal weight.

      Mesna 50mg/kg/day will be given IV over 24 hours in 250 cc of normal saline or D5W. Weight
      base is calculated same as cyclophosphamide as above.

      ATG (rabbit) 0.5 mg/kg on day -5; 1mg/kg on day -4 and -3; 1.5 mg/kg on day -2 and -1 (total
      5.5mg/kg, no dose adjustment) will be given IV over 10 hours in 250 cc of normal saline
      beginning at least 1 hour after infusion of cyclophosphamide. Premedicate with acetaminophen
      650 mg po and diphenhydramine 25 mg po/IV 30 minutes before the infusion. An in-line 0.22 µm
      filter should be used for ATG administration.

      Methylprednisolone A suggested dose of 250mg IV should be administered 30 minutes before
      each ATG infusion.

      Hydration A suggested rate of 125 cc/hr NS should be given starting 6 hours before
      cyclophosphamide and continue until 24 hours after the last cyclophosphamide dose.The rate
      of hydration will be aggressively adjusted in order to avoid fluid overload. BID weights
      will be obtained. Amount of fluid can be modified based on patient's fluid status. Minimum
      target urine output is 2 liters/m2/day

      G-CSF 5 mcg/kg/day SQ will be continued until the absolute neutrophil counts reach at least
      500/µl.

      Rituxan 500 mg will be given IV on the day before the first dose of ATG and the day after
      stem cell infusion.
