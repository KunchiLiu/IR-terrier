      Comparison of olaparib vs. physician's choice of single agent standard of care non-platinum
      based chemotherapy in patients with germline Breast Cancer susceptibility gene (gBRCA)
      mutated ovarian cancer who have progressed at least 6 months after the last platinum based
      chemotherapy. Patient should have received at least 2 prior lines of platinum based
      chemotherapy. The aim of the study is to assess the efficacy and safety of olaparib tablets.

      This open label, randomised, controlled, multi-centre study will assess the efficacy and
      safety of single agent olaparib vs. standard of care, based on physician's choice of single
      agent chemotherapy ( i.e paclitaxel, or topotecan, or pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, or
      gemcitabine) in platinum sensitive or partially platinum sensitive relapsed ovarian cancer
      patients who carry germline deleterious or suspected deleterious BRCA mutation and who have
      received at least 2 prior lines of platinum based chemotherapy. Patients are eligible to
      undergo BRCA testing even if they have not yet had recurrence or progression of disease &gt;6
      months (&gt;/=183 days) after completion of their last platinum therapy.
