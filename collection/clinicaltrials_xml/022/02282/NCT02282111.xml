  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-blinded randomized control trial trying to compare the effectiveness of
      diagnosis between two techniques employed in tissue sampling for subepithelial tumors (SETs)
      of the gastrointestinal tract. Over 2 years, patients having SET will be randomized to
      either get the EUS-guided core needle biopsy (EUS-CNB) or EUS-guided single-incision with
      needle knife (SINK) technique. This is of grave importance because the diagnosis of the
      myriad types of SETs is made histologically requiring a good sample.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Upper gastrointestinal (GI) subepithelial tumors (SETs) are tumors arising from
      subepithelial layers of esophageal, gastric or duodenal wall, mostly from the submucosa and
      muscular layer. The incidence of SETs on routine endoscopy is 0.36% The differential
      diagnosis of SETs include, though are not limited to: lipoma, leiomyoma, aberrant pancreas,
      varices, carcinoid, gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), and lymphomas . Therefore, a
      correct diagnosis of these tumors is important to guide subsequent management. These lesions
      are often not accurately diagnosed on cross-sectional imaging . Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)
      aids in narrowing the differential diagnosis of the lesion as it is often able to establish
      the layer of origin . However, an accurate diagnosis and targeted therapy is not made solely
      on the morphological features but on histologic type and at times mitotic index. Thus the
      need for techniques to obtain histology is beneficial in guiding management.

      Since standard endoscopy with pinch biopsies of the overlying mucosa often fails to provide
      an adequate sample for analysis, multiple other modalities to sample the lesion have been
      utilized: EUS-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA), EUS-guided core needle biopsy
      (EUS-CNB), bite-on-bite forceps biopsies, EUS-guided single-incision with needle knife
      (SINK) and endoscopic resection.

      EUS-FNA is now considered to be the usual method of sampling; however, the diagnostic yield
      is low: 38% to 82% . Moreover, EUS-FNA often provides insufficient specimens which may not
      allow for immunohistochemistry that is often essential for diagnosis . Thus EUS-CNB has been
      assessed for the purpose of obtaining a core sample which allows for histological
      assessment. Published data reveals a diagnostic (though not histologic) yield using EUS-CNB
      of 75% In 2011, the SINK technique for sampling was presented with a reported diagnostic
      accuracy of 92.8% [8]. The technique utilizes a conventional needle-knife connected to an
      electrosurgical unit. A 6 to 12-mm mucosal incision is made over the lesion. Then
      conventional biopsy forceps are introduced to obtain 3-5 samples. Subsequently, the incision
      is closed with 2 to 3 endoclips.

      The purpose of this study is to prospectively compare the efficacy and safety of EUS-CNB
      with SINK in patients with upper GI SETs. The investigators hypothesis is that the SINK
      technique will be superior to the EUS-CNB in obtaining a histological specimen. The results
      of the study would provide data which may improve the diagnostic ability for SETs. This in
      turn will guide appropriate surveillance or management (surgical or endoscopic) for patients
      with these lesions.
