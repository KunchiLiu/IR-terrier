  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed pilot study will provide needed data to establish the feasibility of a
      conducting a large randomized controlled trial as to the effectiveness of the use of
      oseltamivir early in the course of influenza in outpatients with chronic pulmonary disease.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The pilot study will be a multi-centre, randomized, placebo controlled, pilot trial. If
      outpatients with chronic pulmonary disease at the Firestone Institute for Respiratory Health
      in Hamilton and at the respirology clinics of the Foothills Medical Centre in Calgary
      develop influenza-like illness when influenza is known to be continuously circulating, they
      will be assessed at the clinics and if they meet eligibility criteria will be randomized to
      oseltamivir or placebo and followed prospectively. We will test for influenza by RT-PCR
      however acute detection of influenza will not be a criterion for entry into the trial.

      The primary outcome for the eventual trial that we will also measure in this pilot is
      hospitalization Specifically, we will assess if ≥75% of participants can be randomized
      within 72 hours, if ≥ 90% of participants receive all doses of study medication, and if
      there is complete follow up in ≥95% of participants. If the pilot study meets our
      feasibility criteria, it will be deemed appropriate to plan for the larger trial, which we
      anticipate will require ~ 1,590 participants. If it appears that any of these will not met
      as we are conducting the trial, we will modify the protocol accordingly to ensure that they
      are.

    <time_frame>up to 28 days following randomization</time_frame>
    <description>A non-elective admission to hospital, in contrast to visits to the emergency department where admission does not take place. However, a prolonged stay in the emergency department (&gt; 24 hours) will also be considered to be hospitalization. Events that occur beyond this time period are deemed unlikely to be directly related to influenza,except functional status which will be assessed up to three months following acute respiratory infection. Secondly, the hospitalization must also be considered to be due to acute respiratory illness. An adjudication committee (comprised of two infectious diseases physicians who also practice general internal medicine) blinded to study group allocation will review data for hospitalization. They will be asked to judge whether the hospitalization was definitely or probably related to the acute respiratory illness. Those judged to be definitely or probably related will be considered as our primary outcome.</description>
