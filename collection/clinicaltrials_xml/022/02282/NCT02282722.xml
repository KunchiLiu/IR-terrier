      Patients are routinely asked to sign an &quot;informed consent&quot; document prior to starting
      chemotherapy, indicating they understand the risks and benefits of treatment. Although this
      could be a strategic moment to equip patients with information they need to make truly
      informed medical decisions, many patients and caregivers note that these conversations are
      less useful than they could be. The informed consent process and its associated documents
      suffer several limitations: 1) risks are emphasized over benefits; 2) educational materials
      focus on individual drugs instead of regimens; 3) information is presented in written
      instead of alternative written/audiovisual format; and 4) the patient perspective is
      lacking.

      The overarching objective of this project is to develop a library of communication tools for
      the most common chemotherapy regimens used to treat metastatic colorectal cancer. Tools will
      include video clips and written documents that can be readily distributed, modified, and
      customized. This toolkit will be crafted in collaboration with oncologists and patients
      living with gastrointestinal cancer and improves upon existing resources in several ways: 1)
      balanced discussion of benefits as well as risks, 2) focus on regimens rather than drugs, 3)
      use of both written and video format, and 4) inclusion of the patient perspective (e.g.
      video clips of patients describing their experience). A panel of oncologist and patient
      stakeholders will evaluate the acceptability of the tools. The investigators will then
      conduct a randomized clinical trial to demonstrate if the informed consent toolkit improves
      the quality of informed consent for palliative chemotherapy. If effective, the tools will be
      amenable to broad dissemination via patient accessible cancer education websites and
      oncology clinics.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A substantial body of research indicates that many patients with incurable cancer harbor
      significant misconceptions about the benefits of palliative chemotherapy. This
      misunderstanding indicates pervasive deficiencies in how cancer patients are informed about
      fundamentals of their disease and treatment options.

      The root of this problem is undoubtedly complex, but likely relates to deficiencies in
      patient-doctor communication about incurable cancer. At the outset of treatment, it is
      important for oncologists to establish trust, a strong rapport, and convey hope even when
      prognosis is poor. As a result, oncologists may describe difficult information about
      prognosis and the limitations of chemotherapy in a telescopic or vague manner that makes it
      difficult for patients to understand what lies ahead. While this approach may initially
      provide solace, downstream it can impede patients' ability to make truly informed choices
      about how to allocate their limited time and energy.
