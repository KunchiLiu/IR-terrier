      This study is designed to answer whether patients with progressive IgA nephropathy, who
      receive Acthar (ACTH) gel injection at a dose of 80 units subcutaneously twice weekly for 6
      months is effective in inducing improvement in proteinuria and renal function.

             interpretation of the results or render the patient at high risk from treatment
             complication.
