    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine how the brain and environment interact to influence
      children's ability to suppress tics using a medical technology called Transcranial Magnetic
      Stimulation (TMS).

      Objectives: This study will recruit youth with chronic tics. Chronic tics are the most
      common movement disorder in children. The goal of the study is to learn how the brain and
      environment influence children's ability to suppress tics. Specifically, we want to learn
      how tics are influenced by a certain part of the brain called the supplementary motor area
      (SMA). This part of the brain is thought to be more active in people with tics. This will be
      the first study to look at the relationship between SMA, tic suppression, and urges to tic.

      Research Procedures: The study will take place over the course of three days within a week
      (about 5 hours total). The study visits will occur at Butler Hospital (visits 1 and 3) and
      the Brown MRI Facility (visit 2). The study will examine the relationship between the SMA
      and tic suppression using a non-invasive (i.e., no injections, drugs, surgical procedures)
      medical technology called Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS). Participants will have a
      diagnostic interview, MRI brain scan (used to find the location of the SMA), and TMS.
      Participants will be asked to try to suppress tics before and after TMS. The information
      that will be collected from participation includes information about tic symptoms, emotional
      and behavioral functioning, and brain activity (from MRI brain images and TMS results).
