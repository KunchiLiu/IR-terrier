    <textblock>
      Among existing surgical techniques, spinal fusion is considered as the gold standard to
      treat a broad spectrum of degenerative spine disorders, including spondylolisthesis and
      scoliosis, with regard to pain reduction and functional improvement. However, pseudarthrosis
      and failure to relieve low back pain are unfortunately still frequent, irrespective of the
      type of procedures and grafts used by the surgeon.

      The present Phase 2a study aims at demonstrating the safety and efficacy of ALLOB®, a
      proprietary population of allogeneic osteoblastic cells, in lumbar spinal fusion.
