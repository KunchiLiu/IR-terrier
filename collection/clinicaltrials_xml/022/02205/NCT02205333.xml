    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to determine the best dose of MEDI6469 that is safe and
      tolerable when given as monotherapy and in combination with tremelimumab, MEDI4736, or
      rituximab in subjects with either advanced solid tumors or diffuse large B-cell lymphoma
      (DLBCL). Tremelimumab and MEDI4736 will be tested with MEDI6469 in a set of subjects with
      advanced solid tumors while rituximab will be tested with MEDI6469 in subjects with DLBCL.
      MEDI6469 will be tested as monotherapy in subjects with advanced solid tumors.

    <measure>Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD)</measure>
    <time_frame>From Day 1 up to 28 days at each dose level.</time_frame>
    <description>The primary endpoint is the MTD, defined as the highest dose within a cohort where no more than 1 out of 6 subjects experience dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), or the highest protocol-defined dose for each agent in the absence of exceeding the MTD.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Safety</measure>
    <time_frame>From the signing of an informed consent form (Day -28) until 90 days after the last dose of investigational products.</time_frame>
    <description>The primary endpoints for safety assessment include the number of participants experiencing adverse events (AEs) and the number of participants experiencing serious adverse events (SAEs).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Antitumor Activity</measure>
    <time_frame>Participant's disease status will be assessed from date of randomization until documentation of disease progression, death, end of study or withdrawal of consent. Assessments will be performed between study days 57-59 and then every 28 days.</time_frame>
    <description>The endpoints for assessment of antitumor activity include objective response and disease control based on revised Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria Version 1.1 for solid tumors or based on Cheson Criteria for DLBCL (Cheson et al, 2007), duration of response, progression-free survival, and overall survival.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pharmacokinetics (PK)</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessments will be performed between Day 1 and end of treatment visit. Specifically assessments will be performed at certain timepoints (dependent upon cohort) on Days 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 15, 29, 31, 59 and then every 28 days until end of treatment visit.</time_frame>
    <description>MEDI6469 concentrations in serum and peak plasma concentrations (Cmax).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pharmacokinetics (PK)</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessments will be performed between Day 1 and end of treatment visit. Specifically assessments will be performed at certain timepoints (dependent upon cohort) on Days 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 15, 29, 31, 59 and then every 28 days until end of treatment visit.</time_frame>
    <description>Area under the the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) of MEDI6469.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pharmacokinetics (PK)</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessments will be performed between Day 1 and end of treatment visit. Specifically assessments will be performed at certain timepoints (dependent upon cohort) on Days 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 15, 29, 31, 59 and then every 28 days until end of treatment visit.</time_frame>
    <description>Clearance and half-life of MEDI6469.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Immunogenicity</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessments will be performed between Day 1 and the end of treatment visit. Specifically assessments will be performed at certain timepoints (dependent upon cohort) on Days 1, 3, 8, 15, 29, 31, 59 and then every 28 days until the end of treatment visit.</time_frame>
    <description>The endpoints for assessment of immunogenicity of MEDI6469 include the number and percentage of subjects who develop detectable anti-drug antibodies.</description>
