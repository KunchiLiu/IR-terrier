  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Some breast cancer cells make a protein called Human Epidermal Growth factor receptor 2
      (HER2). Patients with HER2 positive (HER2+) breast cancer receive medicine that attacks
      HER2, which helps these patients live longer. Some HER2 negative (HER2-) breast cancer
      patients also benefit from medicines that attack HER2, but we do not know why or which
      patients will benefit. This study uses a new imaging method, 89Zr-trastuzumab PET/CT, to
      identify patients that may benefit from medicines that attack HER2. This is experimental.

    <description>Both SUVmax and SUVpeak will be recorded for lesions, and SUVmax and SUVaverage will be recorded for background measurements. Only those foci qualitatively scored conspicuously positive by both readers (scores of 4 or 5) will be considered as 89Zr-trastuzumab &quot;positive&quot;.</description>

    <description>Patients with confirmed HER2- breast cancer will then undergo 89Zr-trastuzumab PET/CT. 89Zr-trastuzumab is a novel radiotracer which allows excellent visualization of HER2+ lesions.19 PET/CT imaging with this novel radiotracer will allow evaluation of all identifiable malignant lesions, rather than evaluation of only single lesions by biopsy. 89Zr-trastuzumab avid lesions will be considered suspicious for HER2+ malignancy. Patients with at least one 89Zr-trastuzumab avid lesion will be biopsied to confirm HER2+ pathology. From these 50 patients, we will determine the proportion of HER2- primary breast cancer patients that express HER2+ malignancy imagable by 89Zr-trastuzumab PET/CT. Patients who are recruited to the protocol, but then drop out prior to 89Zr-trastuzumab PET/CT due HER2+ disease being identified on retesting of the patient's archived tissue samples, will be replaced with newly recruited patients.</description>
