  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The examination of the ability of the OrthoPATÂ® blood collection device to decrease the
      transfusion rate and volume of adults undergoing posterior spine surgery for deformity
      correction of 6 levels or more.

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the use of postoperative drains with blood
      salvage capabilities to determine if they decrease both the volume and rate of allogenic
      blood transfusion in adult patients undergoing multilevel spine surgery for deformity. In
      addition, the ability of these drains to decrease the complications that are associated with
      allogenic blood exposure (postoperative infection, volume overload and transfusion
      reactions) will also be evaluated.
