  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to explore safety and tolerability of eteplirsen in
      patients with advanced stage Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) who are amenable to exon 51
      skipping. The exploratory objectives are to evaluate the effect of eteplirsen on pulmonary
      function tests (PFTs) and other functional clinical measures.

      This is an open-label, multi-center study to explore the safety and tolerability of
      eteplirsen injection in patients with advanced stage DMD with confirmed genetic mutations
      amenable to treatment by exon 51 skipping.

      Patients will be evaluated for inclusion during a Screening/Baseline period of up to 4
      weeks. Eligible patients will receive once weekly intravenous (IV) infusions of 30 mg/kg
      eteplirsen for 96 weeks, followed by a safety extension (not to exceed 48 weeks).

      Safety will be regularly assessed throughout the study via the collection of adverse events
      (AEs), laboratory tests, electrocardiograms (ECGs), echocardiograms (ECHOs), vital signs,
      and physical examinations. Exploratory efficacy assessments, including PFTs, upper extremity
      testing, and other measurements of functional status, will occur at functional assessment
      visits every 12 weeks over the first year of treatment and approximately every 24 weeks over
      the second year of treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male 7 - 21 years of age

          -  Diagnosis of DMD with a mutation that is amenable to exon 51 skipping, confirmed by a
             genetic report

          -  Stable dose of oral corticosteroids for at least 24 weeks or has not received
             corticosteroids for at least 24 weeks

          -  Non-ambulatory, or incapable of walking ≥300 meters on the 6-Minute Walk Test (6MWT).

          -  Score of ≤4 on the Brooke Score for Arms and Shoulders.

          -  Use of contraceptives for sexually active males throughout the study

          -  Willing to provide consent and comply with the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Use of any pharmacologic treatment (other than corticosteroids) within 12 weeks that
             may have an effect on muscle strength or function (e.g., growth hormone, anabolic
             steroids).

          -  Previous treatment with SMT C1100/BMN 195 at any time.

          -  Previous treatment with drisapersen (PRO051) within the last 6 months.

          -  Participation in any other DMD interventional clinical study within 12 weeks

          -  Major change in physiotherapy regimen within the past 3 months

          -  Major surgery within 3 months

          -  Presence of other clinically significant illness

          -  Use of an aminoglycoside antibiotic within 12 weeks or the need for this antibiotic
             or statin during study

          -  Forced vital capacity % predicted [FVC % predicted] &lt;40%, or requiring daytime
             ventilation.
