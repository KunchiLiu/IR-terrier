      The investigational device studied is an MR Scanner for neonates and infants with a small
      size profile that makes it capable of being sited in a NICU or other neonatal and infant
      care units.

      The study hypothesis is to demonstrate feasibility of attaining diagnostic quality images
      and data using the MR scanner for neonates and infants with various hardware and software
      configurations.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subjects will be included that are:

          1. Currently admitted for treatment or observation at the investigational site at the
             time of enrollment;

          2. In the weight range less than 5.0 kg (&lt;5.0 kg ) and more than 0.5 kg (&gt;0.5 kg );

          3. Viable neonates (birth to 1 month of age) or infants (&gt;1 month to two years of age);

          4. Able to safely undergo an MRI scan, as determined by the site's co-investigator
             neonatologist or medically qualified delegate;

          5. Have parent(s), guardian(s), or legally authorized representative(s) willing and able
             to provide written informed consent for the subject's participation;

          6. Are of appropriate size and shape to fit into the bore of the magnet, inclusive of
             all monitoring equipment, if any, necessary for the subject's routine clinical care:

               1. Maximum width (shoulder-to-shoulder measurement) less than eighteen (18 cm).

               2. Maximum length (head-to-foot measurement) less than sixty (60) cm. -

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects will be excluded that:

               1. Have parent(s), guardian(s), or legally authorized representative(s) that
                  require that they accompany the subject into the MR environment that have
                  contraindications to the MR environment or would otherwise be put at undue risk
                  or discomfort, as determined by the investigators;

               2. Require any non-removable medical devices that are not compatible with MR
                  scanning (labeled as MR Unsafe, MR condition for which the scanning conditions
                  are not met, or no MR safety labeling) that may pose hazards in the MR scanning
                  or MR environment, in the opinion of the neonatologist co-investigator or
                  medically qualified delegate;

               3. Have other contraindications or could otherwise be expected to experience
                  detrimental effects to safety, well-being, or medical care, as determined by the
                  neonatologist co-investigator;

               4. Require any scheduled standard of care procedures that are expected to be
                  adversely impacted by participation in this study, in the opinion of the
                  principal investigator, neonatologist co-investigator, or medically qualified
                  delegate; and

               5. Have been previously enrolled AND undergone any study procedures under the
                  current study protocol (i.e. the same subject cannot undergo study procedures,
                  including swaddling and/or MR scanning, more than once).
