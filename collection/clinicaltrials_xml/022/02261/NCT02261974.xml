      Outside United States (OUS) Post-Market Parallel Group Exploratory Study Design

      The objective of this study is to determine the safety and effectiveness of the Viveve
      System to treat the vaginal introitus in women following vaginal birth(s) and in so doing
      improving vaginal laxity.

    <textblock>
      A prospective, longitudinal, randomized, single-blind, sham controlled clinical study is
      planned. This study is designed to demonstrate that the active treatment (i.e., Viveve
      Procedure) is superior to the sham treatment for the primary effectiveness and safety
      endpoints.

      Approximately 145 evaluable subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to either the active
      treatment group or sham group. The active treatment group will receive a treatment dose of
      90 J/cm2 and the sham group will receive a sub-treatment dose of 1 J/cm2.

      Subjects will be followed up at 72 hrs, 10 days, one, two, three, and six months post
      treatment.

      Final data will be reported at 6 months for active and sham treatments.
