    <textblock>
      The main purpose of follow-up in asymptomatic breast cancer patients during and after
      adjuvant treatment is to detect breast cancer recurrence and metastatic disease.The aim of
      this trial is to verify if, in asymptomatic patients, the serial measurement of serum CEA
      and CA 15.3, with diagnostic imaging procedures (18FDG-PET) performed only in case of a
      critical increase of serum CEA and CA 15.3 level, can anticipate the diagnosis of breast
      cancer local and distant recurrence compared to the usual follow-up practice.

    <description>Primary objective of the study is to verify if the experimental arm (serial measurement of serum CEA and CA 15.3 with diagnostic imaging procedures - i.e. 18FDG-PET- performed only in case of critical increase of serum markers level) can anticipate by at least 6 months the diagnosis of breast cancer metastases compared to the control arm (usual follow-up practice).</description>

    <description>Secondary objective is to evaluate the Positive Predictive Value (PPV) and the Negative Predictive Value (NPV) of CEA and CA15.3 dynamic changes in the diagnosis of breast cancer metastases.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female ≥18 years.

          -  Histologically confirmed stage I-III epithelial breast cancer.

          -  Adequate surgery of breast and axilla:

               1. patients must have undergone either a total mastectomy or breast conserving
                  surgery

               2. surgical margins of the resected specimen must be histologically free of
                  invasive tumor.

          -  Signed informed consent obtained prior to any study-specific procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically confirmed stage 0 epithelial breast cancer (carcinoma in situ).

          -  Special histologies with a high or low risk of relapse (i.e. sarcoma and tubular
             carcinoma)

          -  T1a and T1b tumors with all the following characteristics: G1-2 and N0 and RE &gt; 10%,
             RPg &gt; 10% and HER2 negative and Ki67≤14%

          -  Evidence of distant metastases

          -  Patients participating to other clinical trials requiring follow-up not equal to
             standard

          -  Previous history of cancer within 5 years from randomization (except for
             appropriately treated carcinoma in situ of the cervix, non-melanoma skin carcinoma,
             stage I uterine cancer, or other non-breast malignancies with an outcome similar to
             those mentioned above)
