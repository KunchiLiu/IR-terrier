    <textblock>
      ACS patients treated with antiplatelet drugs who require CABG surgery have to wait 5-7 days
      for the effects of the drugs to wean off. This treatment-devoid period leaves the patient
      vulnerable, therefore any means to shorten this period could be useful. The present study
      aims to investigate the possibility of reversing the antiplatelet effects of ticagrelor with
      the help of fresh donor platelets. Fresh platelets will be added to blood samples of treated
      patients in varying concentrations at specific timepoints to determine the time and amount
      of fresh platelets needed to normalize platelet reactivity in the treated samples.

    <textblock>
      The current ACC/AHA guidelines for ACS patients requiring CABG surgery after treatment with
      dual antiplatelet therapy recommend delaying surgery for 5-7 days after discontinuation of
      therapy, to allow for the dissipation of its antiplatelet effects. This treatment-devoid
      waiting period puts the ACS patients at risk for further cardiovascular events. Any means to
      shorten this vulnerable period would be of critical value. One possibility to speed up the
      recovery of the inhibited platelets is to administer infusions of fresh platelets. In fact,
      platelet transfusions are frequently administered to patients during surgery who had
      received prior antiplatelet therapy. However, the degree to which these transfusions restore
      platelet function in the recipient subjects' blood and the time from dosing when they are
      most effective are unknown. The timing is critical in scenarios where urgent surgery is
      required because infusion of platelets too soon after antiplatelet dosing could render them
      useless by the residual drug in circulation.

      The aim of the present study is to investigate the restoration of platelet function of
      ticagrelor-treated subjects by adding donor platelets to their blood. The study would have 2
      arms mimicking different clinical scenarios:

        1. Clinical Scenario 1 - Patient given a loading dose (LD) of ticagrelor in the emergency
           room, requires surgery: A single (180 mg) LD of ticagrelor with aspirin 325 mg will be
           given to study subjects and platelet testing will be performed after addition of fresh
           platelets to their blood ex vivo. Donor platelets will be added at 4-, 6-, 24- and
           48-hours post-dose, to assess the time required for normalizing subject's platelet
           function after a LD of ticagrelor.

        2. Clinical Scenario 2 - Patient on maintenance dosing (MD) of ticagrelor, requires
           surgery: Subjects will receive 3-7 days of ticagrelor (90 mg BID) with aspirin (81 mg
           OD). After the last dose, platelet testing will be performed after addition of fresh
           platelets to their blood ex vivo, at 4-, 6-, 24- and 48-hours post-dose to assess the
           time required for normalizing subject's platelet function after a LD of ticagrelor

      Platelet testing will be carried out using the following methodologies:

        1. Platelet Aggregation - VerifyNow P2Y12 assay.

        2. Platelet Aggregation - Multiplate Analyzer.
