             pressure greater than 90 mm Hg National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria

             randomization, or myocardial infarction within 6 months before randomization.

          -  Evidence or history of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy.

          -  Any hemorrhage or bleeding event greater than or equal to National Cancer Institute
             Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Grade 3 within 4 weeks prior to start
             of study medication.

          -  Subjects with thrombotic, embolic, venous, or arterial events, such as
             cerebrovascular accident (including transient ischemic attacks) deep vein thrombosis
             or pulmonary embolism within 6 months of start of study treatment

          -  Subjects with any previously untreated or concurrent cancer that is distinct in

             carcinoma, or superficial bladder tumor. Subjects surviving a cancer that was
             curatively treated and without evidence of disease for more than 3 years before
             randomization are allowed. All cancer treatments must be completed at least 3 years
             prior to start of study treatment.

          -  Patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C)

             hepatitis B or C infection requiring treatment with antiviral therapy.

             evaluation of the study results.

          -  Concurrent anti-cancer therapy (chemotherapy, radiation therapy, surgery,
             immunotherapy, biologic therapy, or tumor embolization) within 28 days of starting
             study treatment. Palliative radiation is allowed.
