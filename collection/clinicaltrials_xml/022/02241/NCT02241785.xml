  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to determine the efficacy of natalizumab (Tysabri,
      BG00002) in participants with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS) who have failed
      Gilenya or BRACET (Betaseron, Rebif, Avonex, Copaxone, Extavia, Tecfidera) as measured by
      the proportion of participants with no evidence of disease activity (NEDA) at Year 1. The
      secondary objectives in this study population are: Change in total T1 hypointense and total
      T2 hyperintense lesion volume; Proportion of participants with NEDA at Year 2; Evaluation of
      the impact of natalizumab on annualized relapse rate (ARR); and Change in Multiple Sclerosis
      Impact Scale-29 (MSIS-29) physical impact score.

    <measure>The proportion of participants who have NEDA as measured by the number of participants that do not experience Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) progression for a sustained period of 12 weeks.</measure>
    <time_frame>At 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The EDSS is a method of quantifying disability in MS. The EDSS quantifies disability in 8 functional systems and allows neurologists to assign a Functional System Score (FSS) in each of these. These ratings are then used in conjunction with observations and information concerning gait and use of assistive devices to rate the EDSS. Each of the FSS is an ordinal clinical rating scale ranging from 0 to 5 or 6. The final EDSS score is an ordinal clinical rating scale ranging from 0 (normal neurologic examination) to 10 (death due to MS) in half-point increments.</description>

    <description>The MSIS-29 is a brief self-administered MS-specific instrument measuring physical (20 items) and mental/psychological (9 items) impact of MS. The physical score is generated by summing individual items and then transforming to a scale with a range of 0 to 100, where high scores indicate worse health.</description>

        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects of childbearing potential must practice effective contraception from Day -1
             and be willing and able to continue contraception for duration of the study.

          -  Must have documented diagnosis of relapsing MS (McDonald 2010 Criteria [Polman 2011])
             at Screening.

          -  Must have been treated with Gilenya or BRACET for at least the 6 months prior to
             Screening with no interruption of treatment. Prior treatment with natalizumab is
             allowed; however, there must be a minimum 1 year since last natalizumab infusion and
             the Screening visit of this study, and if discontinuation of natalizumab in the past
             was not due to intolerance, anti-natalizumab antibodies, or efficacy loss.

          -  Must have had disease activity in the 12 months prior to Screening while on Gilenya
             or BRACET (as defined by at least 1 Gd+ lesion OR at least 2 new T2 lesions (compared
             with an MRI done within 12 months of screening) OR clinical relapse, or EDSS
             progression of 1 point)

          -  Must have an EDSS score from 0 to 5.5 inclusive at Screening.

          -  Must have lymphocyte count that is documented as at or above the lower limit of
             normal (LLN) by the day before the first Tysabri infusion. If lymphocytes have not
             returned to LLN or above the day before the first Tysabri infusion (day 0), the
             subject has screen failed. The subject who screen fails is eligible to undergo
             Rescreening once; if additional Rescreening is considered, please contact the study
             medical monitor.

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History or positive test result at Screening for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

          -  History or positive test result at Screening for hepatitis C virus antibody (HCV Ab)
             or current hepatitis B infection (defined as positive for hepatitis B surface antigen
             [HBsAg] and/or hepatitis core antibody [HBcAb]).

          -  Prior treatment with natalizumab (either commercially or through a clinical study)
             within 1 year of Day -1.

          -  Contraindications to treatment with natalizumab as described in the Prescribing
             Information for each of the participating countries.

          -  Known allergy to natalizumab or any of its ingredients, or known to be
             anti-natalizumab antibody positive.

             has not stabilized from a previous relapse prior to Day -1.

          -  Known active malignancies (subjects with cutaneous basal cell carcinoma that has been
             completely excised prior to study entry remain eligible).

          -  History of severe opportunistic infections (including PML) or any clinically
             significant cardiac, endocrinologic, hematologic, hepatic, immunologic, metabolic,
             urologic, pulmonary, neurologic, dermatologic, psychiatric, and renal, or other major
