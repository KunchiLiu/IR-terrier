  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is an advanced endoscopic technique
      utilized to diagnose and treat pathologic conditions involving the ducts draining the liver
      and pancreas. Post-ERCP pancreatitis (PEP) is the most common complication following ERCP
      and occurs in approximately 11% of children undergoing the procedure. By definition it leads
      to prolongation of hospital stay or delays in care and rarely can result in long-term
      morbidity or even death. Recent adult trials have demonstrated prevention of PEP with
      administration of rectal nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS). To date, no studies
      have been performed in children thus no &quot;gold standard&quot; or even commonly accepted method of
      preventing PEP in the pediatric population exist. Studying an IV NSAID such as ibuprofen has
      distinct advantages over rectally administered NSAIDs in the pediatric population in that it
      would allow for more consistent weight based dosing and would have more predictable
      absorption compared to suppository. Thus, this project proposes a pilot study evaluating the
      effectiveness of IV ibuprofen at preventing PEP in the pediatric population. The design of
      the proposed study is a prospective randomized double-blind trial comparing IV Ibuprofen to
      placebo controls (normal saline) at the time of procedure in patients undergoing ERCP at
      Children's Medical Center Dallas over a two-year period. The primary outcome measurement
      will be development of PEP. Post-ERCP bleeding and change in pre- and post- procedural pain
      scores will also be measured. The hypothesis is that IV Ibuprofen administered at the time
      of ERCP will decrease rates of post-ERCP pancreatitis in pediatric patients.
