      The purpose of this Phase II study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness (good and bad
      effects) of carfilzomib given as a 30-minute infusion and at a dose of 70 mg/m2 to treat
      patients with multiple myeloma (MM), who are currently showing progressive disease
      (worsening) and had progressed (did not respond to treatment) within 8 weeks of receiving
      treatment with 27mg/m2 of carfilzomib. Carfilzomib is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) to be used only in certain U.S. patients with relapsed and refractory
      multiple myeloma that have tried and failed other therapies. Carfilzomib is considered an
      investigational drug for this study because the dose and regimen included in this study are
      different from the FDA approved carfilzomib regimen. Carfilzomib is a type of drug called a
      proteasome inhibitor. Carfilzomib is thought to work by preventing breakdown of abnormal
      proteins in cells, causing the cells to die. Cancer cells are more sensitive to these
      effects than normal cells. Carfilzomib has been previously given to more than 1800 people in
      clinical trials.

      This is a Phase 2, multicenter, open label, non-randomized study to evaluate the safety and
      efficacy of a 30-minute infusion of 70 mg/m2 of carfilzomib among MM patients who are
      currently showing progressive disease (PD) and had failed their last treatment with 27mg/m2
      of carfilzomib alone or as part of a combination regimen.

      The study will consist of 1) a screening period; 2) up to eight 28-day, treatment cycles; 3)
      maintenance treatment; 4) a final assessment to occur 28 days after the end of the last
      treatment cycle; and 5) a follow-up period.The study will enroll a total of 45 patients who
      are currently showing PD and had progressed within 8 weeks of receiving their last treatment
      with 27mg/m2 of carfilzomib alone or as part of a combination regimen. Patients will be
      enrolled from 15 hematology/oncology sites across the United States.

      During the treatment period, all doses of carfilzomib will be given at 70 mg/m2 infused over
      30 minutes. Among patients who received steroids at the equivalent of &gt; 8 mg of
      dexamethasone weekly with carfilzomib, steroids will be administered using the same drug(s)
      at the same dose(s) and schedule(s) as they received during their previous carfilzomib
      treatment. Patients who did not receive steroids or received the equivalent of less than 8
      mg of dexamethasone weekly will be given 8 mg of dexamethasone prior to each carfilzomib
      administration. Carfilzomib will be administered at a facility capable of managing
      hypersensitivity reactions. Pre- and post-dose intravenous (IV) hydration (between 250 mL
      and 500 mL normal saline or other appropriate IV fluid formulation) may be given at the
      discretion of the treating physician. Subjects should be monitored periodically during this
      period for evidence of fluid overload. Subjects that complete 8 cycles without showing PD
      will be eligible to receive maintenance therapy on a 28-day cycle with carfilzomib and
      steroids as administered during the last cycle of the treatment period.During maintenance
      (cycle 9 and beyond) carfilzomib will be administered at the dose received during the last
      cycle of study treatment on Days 1, 8 and 15, and steroids will be administered using the
      same drug(s) at the same dose(s) and schedule(s) as given during the last cycle of study
      treatment. Patients will remain on maintenance therapy until documentation of PD as defined
      by the modified Blad√© criteria or until they develop toxicity. Patients with stable disease
      (SD) will remain on maintenance therapy. Dose reductions of carfilzomib and steroids will be
      permitted as per protocol guidelines.
