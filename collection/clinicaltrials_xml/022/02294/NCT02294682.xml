  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GSK2140944 has demonstrated in vitro activity against Neisseria (N.) gonorrhoeae, including
      ciprofloxacin resistant and susceptible strains. This study is a Phase II, randomized,
      multicenter, open-label, dose ranging study designed to inform the optimal oral dose of
      GSK2140944 by further characterizing the efficacy, safety, and tolerability in subjects with
      uncomplicated urogenital gonorrhea due to N. gonorrhoeae. Subjects will be randomly assigned
      to receive either a single 1500 milligrams (mg) or 3000 mg oral dose of GSK2140944.
      Appropriate safety and microbiological assessments will be conducted at the Baseline (Day 1)
      Visit and repeated at the Test-of-Cure (Day 4 to 8) Visit. The study duration will be
      approximately 1 week. Approximately 60 microbiologically evaluable subjects (30 subjects in
      each treatment arm) will complete the study if both arms remain active throughout the study.

               1. A non-pregnant, non-lactating female of childbearing potential who 1) is
                  sexually inactive by abstinence, 2) has a sole male partner who has been
                  sterilized, or 3) uses a contraceptive method with a failure rate of &lt;1% through
                  the Test-of-Cure Visit. Females of childbearing potential must not become
                  pregnant during the study.

               2. A female of non-childbearing potential, which includes the following: Females
                  who are surgically sterile with a documented hysterectomy and/or bilateral
                  oophorectomy; Females with documented tubal ligation. If the procedure was done
                  hysteroscopically, the effectiveness of tubal occlusion must have been
                  documented by hysterosalpingogram after the procedure (typically 3 months after
                  the procedure); Females who are post-menopausal, defined as amenorrhoeic for
                  greater than 1 year. For women whose menopausal status is in doubt, documented
                  previous confirmatory blood samples with follicle-stimulating hormone &gt;40 milli
                  international units (mIU)/millilitre (mL) and estradiol &lt;40 picograms (pg)/mL
                  (&lt;140 picomoles [pmol]/litre [L]) will need to be confirmed, or they will be
                  required to use one of the acceptable contraception methods. Note: For the
                  purposes of these criteria, &quot;documented&quot; includes information obtained via a
                  verbal interview with the subject or from the subject's medical records.

          -  There is clinical suspicion that the subject has a urogenital gonococcal infection
             (e.g., prior culture, nucleic acid amplification test [NAAT] or Gram stain
             presumptive or positive for the presence of N. gonorrhoeae, or sexual contact with a
             partner diagnosed with gonorrhea within the past 14 days, as reported by the
             subject). Note: All subjects will be tested for N. gonorrhoeae, but these results
             will not be used to determine subject eligibility for enrollment in the study.

          -  The subject has provided written, dated, informed consent and is willing and able to
             comply with the study protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject is pregnant or nursing.

          -  The subject is a hysterectomized female without a cervix.

          -  The subject is a male with a current diagnosis of epididymitis or orchitis at the
             time of the Baseline Visit.

          -  The subject has a body mass index &gt;=40.0 kilograms (kg)/square meter (m^2).

          -  The subject has a serious underlying disease that could be imminently life
             threatening, or the subject is unlikely to survive for the duration of the study
             period.

          -  The subject has a medical condition or requires medication that may be aggravated by
             inhibition of acetylcholinesterase, such as: Poorly controlled asthma or chronic
             obstructive pulmonary disease at baseline and, in the opinion of the investigator, is
             not stable on current therapy; Acute severe pain, uncontrolled with conventional
             medical management; Active peptic ulcer disease; Parkinson's disease; Myasthenia
             gravis; A history of seizure disorder requiring medications for control. This does
             not include a history of childhood febrile seizures; Any evidence of mechanical
             obstruction of the urinary or digestive tracks.

          -  The subject has had any past history or current diagnosis of Clostridium difficile
             infection at the time of the Baseline Visit.

          -  The subject has a corrected QT (QTc) &gt;450 msec or a QTc &gt;480 msec for subjects with
             bundle branch block. Note: The QTc is the QT interval corrected for heart rate
             according to either Bazett formula (QTcB), Fridericia formula (QTcF), machine, or
             manual overread.

             with GSK2140944.

          -  The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational
             product within 30 days or 5 half-lives, whichever is longer.

          -  The subject has the following gonococcal infections: Suspected or confirmed pelvic
             inflammatory disease; Suspected or confirmed gonococcal arthritis; Other evidence of
             disseminated gonococcal infection.

          -  The subject has received treatment with a systemic or intravaginal antibacterial
             within 14 days of study entry.

          -  Subject is taking a medication that has a known risk of torsades de pointes.
