      The purpose of this study is to evaluate long-term performance of the Attain Performa™ LV
      Leads. This evaluation is based on the number of lead-related complications occurring during
      the study compared to the number of leads enrolled in the study. The leads will be followed
      for 5 years after implant. This study is required by FDA as a condition of approval of the
      Attain Performa™ LV Leads. This study is conducted within Medtronic's post-market
      surveillance platform.

    <description>Survival analysis will be used to analyze the lead. Lead status will be reported as a function of time post-implant for all leads in the study.
Lead related complications include but are not limited to: failure to capture, abnormal sensing, threshold rise, abnormal impedance, insulation breach, conductor fracture, extracardiac stimulation, lead dislodgement, cardiac perforation, structural lead failure.</description>

    <description>Summary statistics will be used to report types and rates of lead related adverse device effects (ADE). Examples of ADEs include but are not limited to: failure to capture, abnormal sensing, threshold rise, abnormal impedance, insulation breach, conductor fracture, extracardiac stimulation, lead dislodgement, cardiac perforation, structural lead failure.</description>
