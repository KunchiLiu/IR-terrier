    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trial designed to confirm the
      symptomatic effects of camicinal treatment vs. placebo, on gastroparesis symptoms in type 1
      and 2 diabetic subjects with gastroparesis. The primary purpose of this study is to
      determine if a low-dose of camicinal (25 milligram[mg]) for 12 weeks of repeat
      administration improves gastroparesis symptoms as measured by the Gastrointestinal Cardinal
      Symptom Index - Daily Diary (GCSI-DD) in approximately 120 subjects with type 1 or 2
      diabetes mellitus (DM) who have documented abnormally slow gastric emptying and have
      symptoms consistent with gastroparesis.

      Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either camicinal or placebo. The study
      will consist of a screening/baseline period of up to 35 days, a 12 week treatment period, a
      2-week post-treatment assessment of symptoms and a 14 day (+/- 2 days) post treatment safety
      follow-up visit.

    <measure>Week 12 response rate in the fullness/early satiety gastroparesis symptoms as assessed by Gastrointestinal Cardinal Symptom Index - Daily Diary (GCSI-DD)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The GCSI-DD consists of nine symptom severity items covering the following domains: nausea/vomiting; fullness/early satiety, and bloating. In addition, the GCSI-DD contains two symptom severity items upper abdominal pain and overall rating of gastroparesis symptoms. Subjects will rate each symptom on a 6-point scale from 0 - 5 with lower scores representing less symptom severity. Fullness/early satiety response is defined as an improvement from baseline of at least one point in the weekly average for the subscale.</description>

             unsuitable for inclusion in this clinical study.

          -  Concurrent enrollment in any other interventional study/(ies) involving a novel (i.e.
             unapproved or experimental) chemical or biopharmaceutical entity.

             history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or
             GlaxoSmithKline Medical Monitor, contraindicates their participation.
