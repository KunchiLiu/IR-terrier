  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of the supplemental study is to provide POC testing of aprepitant as a
      treatment for comorbid alcohol and cannabis dependence. The data analysis plan specified in
      the parent grant will likewise be applied to the supplemental project to test for effects of
      aprepitant vs placebo on measures of alcohol and cannabis use and protracted withdrawal. The
      primary hypothesis is that subjects treated with aprepitant will have significantly less
      alcohol and marijuana use than subjects treated with placebo.

      Consistent with the scope and methods of the parent grant, this will be a randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel groups, Phase II, single-site, 8-week clinical
      trial of aprepitant 125 mg/d or placebo. Participants will be 40 outpatients seeking
      treatment for concurrent alcohol and cannabis dependence. All participants will receive
      weekly protocol-specific counseling. Research assessments will occur weekly through the
      treatment phase of the 8-week study. Post treatment follow-up assessments will occur at
      Weeks 9 and 12.
