  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      By 2030 an estimated 2 million people in the US will need dialysis or transplantation for
      advanced kidney failure. An even more disturbing statistic is that mortality in End Stage
      Renal Disease (ESRD) is six times higher than in the general Medicare population with
      adjustment for age, gender and ethnicity. Protein energy wasting is highly prevalent in
      these patients and is one of the most important determinants of their poor clinical outcome.

      Despite its well-recognized occurrence, the etiology and the mechanisms leading to protein
      energy wasting observed in chronic hemodialysis patients cannot be attributed to any single
      factor. However, irrespective of the specific etiologic mechanisms, it appears that the
      common pathway for all the metabolic derangements is related to exaggerated protein
      degradation relative to protein synthesis (47).

      Two well-recognized and presumably interrelated metabolic abnormalities, insulin resistance
      and chronic inflammation, may be the major determinants of protein catabolism in coronary
      heart disease (CHD) patients. There are no studies examining the effects of
      anti-inflammatory interventions and/or insulin sensitizers on protein homeostasis in CHD.
      Due to their established anti-inflammatory and other pleiotropic effects, Interleukin-1
      receptor antagonist Anakinra and insulin sensitizer peroxisome proliferator-activated
      receptors (PPAR) agonist Actos represent two such promising interventions. By modulating
      inflammatory response and insulin signaling through two pharmacological interventions, the
      investigators will have the unique opportunity to clarify mechanisms contributing of these
      two particular metabolic derangements in the development of protein energy wasting observed
      in chronic hemodialysis patients.

      The overall goal is to elucidate the mechanisms by which chronic inflammation and insulin
      resistance influence the development of protein energy wasting in hemodialysis patients.

      Specific Aim: To test the hypothesis that inhibiting inflammatory response by administration
      of an IL-1r antagonist (Anakinra) or increasing insulin sensitivity by administration of a
      PPAR agonist (Actos) will improve net protein metabolism.

      Hypothesis: The chronic inflammatory component of protein energy wasting (PEW) observed in
      hemodialysis patients is, at least in part, mediated by insulin resistance.

      Interim analysis may be performed (no specific plan at this time).
