  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify whether specific clinical practices—including,
      body-mass-index (BMI) screening, identifying weight-related conditions (such as high blood
      pressure), and scheduling follow-up visits to reassess progress—will improve the weight
      status of overweight school-age children at one-year follow-up.

      The aim of this study is to identify specific clinical practice elements in pediatric
      primary care that predict improvement in weight status among overweight school-age children.
      Pediatricians are well-suited to regularly assess and treat school-age children who are
      overweight. Well-child visits present an important opportunity to assess and treat
      overweight children. Strategies are needed to maximize the effectiveness of this
      opportunity. Although the American Academy of Pediatrics endorses recommendations by the
      United States Preventive Services Task Force that clinicians screen for overweight, assess
      medical/behavior risk, and use a staged treatment approach that includes frequent
      reassessment, it is unclear whether these practices, when used in primary care, impact
      whether children make lifestyle changes or improve their weight status. It is essential to
      identify specific clinical practice elements and communication strategies associated with
      weight-status improvement in overweight children, to maximize the effectiveness of
      primary-care weight-management interventions. The investigators hypothesize that conducting
      BMI screening, assessing weight-related comorbidities (including elevated blood pressure,
      acanthosis nigricans, and elevations in fasting blood glucose, lipids, and liver enzymes),
      and scheduling one or more interim visits to reassess progress (with a weight-related
      diagnosis among the top three diagnoses or by referring to a weight-management specialist or
      nutritionist) in overweight, 6-12 year-old primary care patients will predict improvement in
      weight status (assessed as decrease in BMI standard deviation score [BMI z-score]) at
      one-year follow-up.
