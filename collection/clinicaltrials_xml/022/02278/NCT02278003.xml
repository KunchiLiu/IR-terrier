      The goal of this study is to extend findings of propofol's effects on memory, as measured in
      volunteer research studies, to a clinical setting.

    <description>During the 10-minute infusion of propofol, children will be presented with pictures at 5-second intervals and asked to name the picture. They will be asked to name each picture (e.g., cat, tree, pencil, etc.). A valid response is naming of the picture within 5 seconds, either correctly or incorrectly.The important response measure is whether the child is awake enough to perform the naming task.</description>

    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>At the presentation of each picture, the child will be asked whether or not he/she remembers having seen it previously. Each response will be coded as correct (true positives and true negatives) or incorrect (false positives and false negatives)</description>

    <description>Children who will undergo sedation as part of their clinical management and give them a memory encoding task during propofol infusion to measure the effects of sedation. The mere task of naming a picture will encode that picture into memory. When the anesthesia has worn off (at approximately 1 hour later), children will be given a memory recognition task to measure the amnesic effects of propofol.
