  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether it is feasible to give a combination of
      Metformin and OMEGA-3 fatty acids for one year to women with a history of early stage breast
      cancer. We will also evaluate whether the metformin and OMEGA-3 fatty acids combination
      causes changes in breast tissue, blood, and mammograms.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Metformin is a medication used to treat and prevent diabetes and OMEGA-3 fatty acids has
      been shown to lower cholesterol and improve cardiovascular health. Research has shown that
      Metformin and OMEGA-3 fatty acids may also be effective in preventing cancer. In this study,
      we want to find out what effects, good and/or bad, the Metformin and OMEGA-3 fatty acids
      combination has on you and your risk of developing a new breast cancer.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  History of histologically-confirmed stage 0, I, II, or III breast carcinoma without

             eligible

          -  Minimum of 6 months since last chemotherapy, biologic therapy (i.e., trastuzumab),
             radiation therapy, and/or breast surgery and no evidence of recurrent disease

          -  Minimum of 6 months since completion of adjuvant tamoxifen (tamoxifen is known to
             lower mammographic density119-121). Current use of a third generation aromatase
             inhibitor [AI] (i.e., anastrozole, letrozole, exemestane) is permitted provided that

             percent based upon the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BIRADS) density
             score of 2, 3, or 4. Women with a baseline mammographic density of less than 25
             percent (BIRADS Score= 1) will not be eligible

          -  Any condition associated with increased risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis
             (e.g., congestive heart failure defined as New York Heart Association [NYHA] Class
             III or IV functional status, history of acidosis of any type, intake of 3 or more
             alcoholic beverages per day on average over the past 6 months)

          -  Currently taking metformin, sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones, or insulin for any
             reason

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to metformin or omega-3 fatty acids

          -  Receiving hormone replacement therapy, tamoxifen, or raloxifene within 6 months of
             trial entry

          -  Participants may not be receiving any other investigational agents for 30 days prior
             to baseline evaluation and during the study intervention

          -  Any omega-3 fatty acids should not be taken for 30 days prior to baseline evaluation
             and during the study intervention. If participants are consuming any of these items
             and would like to participate in this study, then a 30-day washout period will be
             required. - Uncontrolled or significant co-morbid illness patients receiving active
             chemotherapy or radiotherapy; or psychiatric illness/social situations that would
