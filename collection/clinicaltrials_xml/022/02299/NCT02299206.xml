  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, 1:1 randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, non-inferiority
      controlled trial to demonstrate non-inferiority of CeraVe Baby Diaper Rash Cream compared to
      Desitin Maximum Strength Original Paste when administered to children with diaper dermatitis
      who are between 3 months to 18 months of age. Parents/caregivers of subjects in both groups
      will administer the product with each diaper change throughout the course of the study
      period. Product can be applied liberally as needed. Diapers and skin cleansing interventions
      will stay constant throughout the treatment period. Subjects will be assessed by the study
      doctor, parent/caregiver will be asked about any adverse effects. Parent/caregivers will
      also be asked to complete a daily diary that asks about changes in their baby's diaper
      dermatitis, a Visual Analogue Scale severity assessment of their baby's diaper dermatitis,
      and observations related to product use and the baby's comfort level. Parents/caregivers
      will also be given a questionnaire rating the use of the study products.

      Visit 1 - Screening and Baseline Visit (Day 0) Subjects will be evaluated for study
      eligibility using inclusion and exclusion criteria. The study doctor will assess diaper
      dermatitis for inclusion and exclusion criteria and to verify mild to moderate severity.
      Once study eligibility has been confirmed, parental/guardian consent will be obtained. No
      washout period is necessary for this study.

      Location of clinically apparent involved area will be shaded by hand onto diagram by the
      research personnel. Study products will be dispensed to parent/caregiver, along with
      instructions for administration. Parent/caregivers will also be asked to complete a daily
      diary that asks about changes in their baby's diaper dermatitis, a Visual Analogue Scale
      severity assessment of their baby's diaper dermatitis, and observations related to product
      use and the baby's comfort level. Parents/caregivers will be asked to complete the daily
      diary for each day of the study.

      Visit 2 (Day 7) Subjects will again be assessed by the study doctor. Parent/caregiver will
      be asked about any adverse effects in last 7 days.

      Visit 3 - End of study (Day 14) Subjects will again be assessed by the study doctor. Daily
      diaries and product will be collected at this time. Parent/caregiver will be asked about any
      adverse effects in last 7 days. Parents/caregivers will also be given a questionnaire rating
      the use of the study products.
