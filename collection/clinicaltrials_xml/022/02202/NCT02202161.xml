  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and
      pharmacodynamics of GSK2330672 compared to sitagliptin when administered with metformin for
      14 days to subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Approximately 72 male and female
      subjects aged 30-64 years with T2DM and currently taking metformin will be recruited for
      this study. Eligible subjects will begin a run-in period of 13-15 days to stabilize on
      metformin 850 milligram (mg) twice a day (BID). Subjects will then be randomized to
      GSK2330672 10 mg, 20 mg, 30 mg, 90 mg, matching placebo or open-label sitagliptin 50 mg for
      14 days BID. Subjects will return for a follow-up visit 7-10 days after discharge.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female between 30 and 64 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the
             informed consent

          -  Subjects with a diagnosis of T2DM for at least 3 months prior to screening, taking
             metformin for at least 4 weeks prior to screening, taking a metformin daily dose of&gt;=
             1000 mg and having an Glycosolated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) value of 7-11% inclusive
             at screening. The investigator should make an effort to obtain documentation of
             medical history or prescription of metformin to substantiate the diagnosis of T2DM

          -  Fasting plasma glucose &lt;280 milligram per deciliter (mg/dl) at screening. A subject
             with a fasting plasma glucose at Day 1 that is more than 100 mg/dl lower than the
             screening value must not be randomized

          -  All T2DM subjects must meet the label recommendations for metformin and sitagliptin,
             including: Adequate renal function, as evidenced by an estimated glomerular
             filtration rate &gt;= 80 milliliter per minute (mL/min) using the modification of diet
             in renal disease (MDRD) equation or chronic kidney disease epidemiology collaboration
             (CKD-EPI) formula in the study procedures manual (SPM); No conditions which make
             hypoxia, dehydration, or sepsis likely; No cardiac disease (including no history of
             myocardial infarction, stroke, hospitalization for acute coronary syndrome, or heart
             failure)

          -  Body mass index (BMI) within the range 24 - 40 kilogram per meter square (kg/m^2)
             (inclusive)

          -  Other than T2DM, subjects should be in good general health with (in the opinion of
             the investigator) no clinically significant and relevant abnormalities of medical
             history or physical examination that would introduce additional risk factors or
             interfere with study procedures or objectives, based on a medical evaluation
             including medical history, physical examination, vital signs, and laboratory tests

          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of non-childbearing potential
             defined as: Pre-menopausal females with a documented tubal ligation, bilateral
             oophorectomy, or hysterectomy [for this definition, &quot;documented&quot; refers to the
             outcome of the investigator's/designee's review of the subject's medical history for
             study eligibility, as obtained via a verbal interview with the subject or from the
             subject's medical records]; OR Postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous
             amenorrhea. In questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous follicle
             stimulating hormone (FSH) &gt; 40 million international units (MlU)/mL and estradiol &lt;
             40 picogram (pg)/mL (&lt;147 picomol per liter) is confirmatory. Females on hormone
             replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to
             use one of the contraception methods as described by the Investigator/designee, if
             they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue
             HRT to allow confirmation of post-menopausal status prior to study enrollment. For
             most forms of HRT, at least 2-4 weeks will elapse between the cessation of therapy
             and the blood draw; this interval depends on the type and dosage of HRT. Following
             confirmation of their post-menopausal status, they can resume use of HRT during the
             study without use of a contraceptive method

          -  Male subjects with female partners of child-bearing potential must agree to use one
             of the contraception methods as described by the Investigator/designee. This

             the follow-up visit

          -  Subjects must be willing to discontinue their usual dose of metformin and take the
             study dose of 850 mg immediate release formulation metformin BID for the 13-15 day

             contraindicates their participation

          -  Current or relevant previous significant medical disorder that may require treatment
             or make the subject unlikely to fully complete the study, or any condition that, in

             &gt;100 beats per minute (bpm); PR Interval between &lt;120 and &gt;220 millisecond (msec);
             QRS duration between &lt;70 and &gt;120 msec

          -  Based on averaged QTcF of triplicate ECGs obtained at least 1 minute apart within
             approximately 15 minutes: QT duration corrected for heart rate by Fridericia's
             formula (QTcF) &gt;= 450 msec; OR QTcF &gt;= 480 msec in subjects with right Bundle Branch
             Block (subjects with left bundle branch block are excluded)

          -  A positive pre-study Hepatitis B surface antigen or positive Hepatitis C antibody
             result within 3 months of screening

          -  A positive test for HIV antibody

          -  A positive urine drug screen or alcohol breath test at screening or during the run-in
             or treatment periods

          -  A subject with a positive urine cotinine test result will be excluded from the study
             unless in the judgment of the investigator the subject will be able to abstain from
             using tobacco for the duration of the in-clinic treatment period of the study

          -  Where participation in the study would result in donation of blood or blood products
             in excess of 500 mL within a 56 day period

          -  The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational
             product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current
             study: 30 days, 5 half-lives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the
             investigational product (whichever is longer)

          -  Exposure to more than four new chemical entities within 12 months prior to the first
             dosing day

          -  Subjects who have participated in a previous study with GSK2330672 are excluded

          -  Because of the potential impact on bile acid synthesis and secretion in the liver,
             use of rifampicin and/or other pregnane X receptor (PXR) inducers, including but not
             limited to St. John's Wort, is cause for subject exclusion
