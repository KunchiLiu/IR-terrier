  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of MLN0264 in
      patients with recurrent or metastatic guanylyl cyclase C (GCC)-positive adenocarcinoma of
      the stomach or gastroesophageal junction.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called MLN0264. MLN0264 is being tested to treat
      tumors in people who have metastatic or recurrent gastric or gastroesophageal junction
      malignancies expressing guanylyl cyclase C (GCC). This study will assess tumor size
      reduction in patients who are administered MLN0264.

      The study will enroll 42 to 81 patients. All participants will be administered MLN0264 at
      1.8 mg/kg as a single, 30-minute, intravenous (IV) infusion on Day 1 of each 3-week
      treatment cycle, followed by a rest period of 20 days. Participants will continue to receive
      MLN0264 for up to 1 year or until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs.

      This multi-centre trial will be conducted worldwide. The overall time to participate in this
      study is approximately 19 months. Participants will make 3 to 6 visits to the clinic per
      treatment cycle, an end-of-treatment visit 30 days after the last dose of study medication,
      and follow-up assessments every 12 weeks until death or 6 months after the last patient
      completes treatment - whichever occurs first.
