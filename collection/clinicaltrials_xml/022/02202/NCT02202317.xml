  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective non-blinded case series involving the acquisition of a pair production
      PET/CT as soon as possible after an already performed Y-90 Sirspheres treatment of hepatic
      malignancy. It will be performed in addition to the standard Brehmsstralung SPECT scan. The
      sequence of the two scans in each case (PET/CT vs SPECT) will be determined by availability
      of the scanners at the time. However, it is intended that both be acquired on the day of the
      Y-90 treatment.

      The length of subject participation will be one year.

      The measures used will be mostly qualitative in nature, and will include:

        -  Degree of correlation with expected vs. achieved tumor coverage by the treatment

        -  Degree of correlation between treatment distribution depicted by Brehmsstrahlung scans
           vs. the Internal Pair Production PET/CT scans, to include an assessment/comparison of
           the precision of anatomic localization achieved by the two modalities.

        -  Determination of Tumor/Background ratios, and correlating with planned dose

        -  Detection of non-target embolization, where applicable, and qualitative comparison
           between the two modalities as to the conspicuity of the abnormality

      Qualitative methods will be used by the analysis of the obtained PET/CT images and comparing
      them to the Brehmsstralung SPECT images as previously described.

      Tumor to background ratios will be generated and used as a metric for correlation with
      planned/administered dose and also with CT and/or FDG PET scans pre or post treatment, if
      available. For CT, the RECIST criteria will be used to calculate volumes of necrosis, would
      be used for the correlation. For FDG PET scans, SUV would be used for correlation.
