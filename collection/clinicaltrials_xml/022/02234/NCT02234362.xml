      The broad goal of this study is to examine the efficacy and tolerability of vortioxetine
      (flexible dose) for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) in symptomatic women
      around the menopausal transition. We hypothesize that an eight-week treatment with
      vortioxetine will promote a significant improvement of depression symptoms and other
      menopause-related physical symptoms.

      Twenty-five peri- and postmenopausal women will be enrolled in this open-label study. This
      will be an 8-week intervention using open-label vortioxetine with flexible dose between 5-20
      mg, dependent on participant response and tolerability. In addition to assessment of
      depressive symptoms, improvement of menopause-related physical and emotional symptoms that
      occur with MDD, including vasomotor symptoms, cognition, fatigue, anxiety, sleep complaints,
      and quality of life, will also be examined.
