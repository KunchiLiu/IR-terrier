        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Signed Informed Consent Form

               -  Signed written informed consent must be obtained from the subjects in accordance
                  with requirements of the study center's IRB or IEC before the initiation of any

          2. Target Population

               -  Healthy subjects as determined by no clinically significant deviation from
                  normal in medical history, physical examination findings, vital sign
                  measurements, 12-lead ECG measurements, and clinical laboratory test results.
