    <textblock>
      Aim: To examine the efficacy of the combination of galantamine and memantine for the
      treatment of cognitive deficits in outpatients with schizophrenia.

      Hypothesis: A combination of galantamine and memantine will improve cognitive impairments in
      patients with schizophrenia.

      This is an open-label study to evaluate whether a six week course of galantamine ER and
      memantine XR is effective in improving the cognitive performance of patients with
      schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. The primary outcome measure will be the change in
      level of cognition as measured by the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB). The
      results of the MATRICS collaborative project recommended the need for standardized cognitive
      tests that better distinguish the different facets of cognitive dysfunction in
      schizophrenia. The MCCB will assess the following seven domains: attention/vigilance,
      reasoning and problem solving, processing speed, social cognition, verbal learning and
      memory, visual learning and memory, and working memory. The MCCB will be administered at
      baseline and at the end of the study. We will report total score and each domain score in
      the MCCB at baseline and six weeks.

          -  Be clinically stable for at least two months (i.e., has no more than a &quot;moderately
             severe&quot; severity rating on the following BPRS items: hallucination, unusual thought
             content and conceptual disorganization.

          -  Have not had a psychiatric hospitalization in the two months prior to screening.
