    <textblock>
      The proposed study will test the efficacy of a cognitive training program to improve working
      memory in a sample of HIV-infected persons. Investigators will assign 40 HIV-infected adults
      with poor medication adherence to one of two conditions (20/group): the experimental
      cognitive training intervention or a control training condition. Participants will complete
      12 training sessions across 10 weeks and will complete assessments at baseline and
      post-training. The specific aims are to:

        1. Investigate the effects of the cognitive training intervention on working memory and
           delay discounting in HIV-infected persons.

           Hypothesis 1: Participants assigned to active cognitive training, compared to those in
           the attention-matched control group, will have greater improvements in working memory
           and reductions in delay discounting.

        2. Characterize adherence to antiretroviral medications in this population and examine
           medication adherence after cognitive training.

      Hypothesis 2: Participants assigned to active cognitive training, compared to those in the
      attention-matched control group, will have greater improvements in medication adherence.

      This study tests the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a computerized cognitive
      training program to improve working memory and decrease impulsivity among HIV-infected
      individuals with poor medication adherence. The specific aims are to: (1) Investigate the
      effects of the cognitive training intervention on working memory and delay discounting in
      HIV-infected persons; and (2) Characterize adherence to antiretroviral medications in this
      population and examine medication adherence after cognitive training.

      The research design includes two parts: an eligibility screening and the Cognitive Training
      study. In Part 1, Eligibility Screening, participants will complete a 2-3 hour battery of
      standardized measures to assess for study eligibility. Eligible individuals will then be
      invited to enroll in Part 2, Cognitive Training Study. Part 1 of the study will involved
      screening approximately 60 participants, with an estimated eligibility rate of 67% for Part
      2. In Part 2, participants will be assigned to one of two groups (active cognitive training
      or control training; 20 participants per group) and will complete 12 training sessions over
      10 weeks. Participants assigned to the active cognitive training group will complete
      computerized modules designed to enhance working memory, while those assigned to the
      attention-matched control group will complete inactive modules that are not designed to
      enhance memory. All Part 2 participants will complete assessments at baseline and
      post-training to evaluate the impact of the training program.

    <description>The ACT group will complete 12 individual sessions across 6-10 weeks. Sessions will utilize four commercially available memory-training programs from PSSCogRehab 2012, published by Psychological Software Service. The four programs used will be: (1) Sequence recall of digits - auditory (SRD-A), (2) Sequenced Recall Reversed Digits - Auditory (SRRD-A), (3) Sequenced Recall of Words - Visual (SRW-V), and (4) Verbal memory - categorizing (VM-C). In each training session, participants will complete each of the four memory training programs twice.</description>

    <description>The CON group will also complete 12 total sessions across 6-10 weeks. The same four computer programs from PSSCogRehab 2012, published by Psychological Software Service, will be used in the control group sessions. However, the control program will identify the correct responses to participants, such that they do not need to engage their working memory to answer the questions correctly.</description>
