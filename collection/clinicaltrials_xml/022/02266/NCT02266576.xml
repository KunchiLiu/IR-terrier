    <textblock>
      The goal of the proposed research is to identify effective patient-centered strategies to
      prevent diabetes in high-risk populations in real world settings. The investigators will
      accomplish this by conducting a randomized controlled trial comparing an enhanced Diabetes
      Prevention Program addressing psychosocial stressors to a standard version in a high-risk
      population of urban American Indian and Alaskan Native peoples within a primary care
      setting.

      The goal of the proposed research is to identify effective patient-centered strategies to
      prevent diabetes in high-risk populations in real world settings. The investigators will
      accomplish this by conducting a randomized controlled trial comparing an enhanced Diabetes
      Prevention Program addressing psychosocial stressors to a standard version in a high-risk
      population of urban American Indian and Alaskan Native peoples within a primary care
      setting. Diabetes is disproportionately prevalent among low-socioeconomic status and
      racial/ethnic minority populations in the US. The high prevalence of psychosocial stressors
      such as depression, discrimination, and exposure to trauma among these populations
      contributes to the high prevalence of diabetes and interferes with successful completion of
      lifestyle interventions. The investigators hypothesize that a DPP that directly addresses
      these psychosocial stressors will be superior to the standard DPP in addressing this
      disparity in diabetes.

    <description>The Standard Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) delivered by the Indian Health Center is the Group Lifestyle Balance DPP, which has previously been tailored for the urban American Indian/Alaskan Natives (AIAN). The Standard DPP consists of 16 group classes, 4 visits with a lifestyle coach, and individual meetings with a registered dietician and fitness coordinator. The intervention will occur over the course of 20 weeks.</description>

    <description>The Enhanced Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) will include all components of the Standard DPP [16 group classes, 4 visits with a lifestyle coach, and individual meetings with a registered dietician and fitness coordinator] delivered by the Indian Health Center and additional components to address psychosocial issues. The Enhanced DPP components include 4 visits with a mental health counselor, active referrals to mental health services, and traditional healing workshops, such as the use of talking circles to address specific psychosocial issues that are a result of historical trauma, stress, and grief. The intervention will occur over the course of 20 weeks.</description>
