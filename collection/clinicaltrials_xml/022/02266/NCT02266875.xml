      A comparison of albuterol treatments using hypertonic saline (3%) versus standard saline
      (0.9%) in patients with admitted patients COPD in regard to Modified Borg Dyspnea scale
      scores after 4 treatments within 24 hours.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypothesis:

      A clinically significant difference exists between albuterol treatments with nebulized 3%
      saline versus standard saline, for improvements in the patient's modified Borg dyspnea score
      during an acute exacerbation of COPD.Study

      Population:

      This study will involve 146 patients admitted to Doctors Hospital in Columbus, Ohio from
      September 2014 through September 2015 with a clinical diagnosis of an acute exacerbation of
      COPD, defined as an increase in the patient's dyspnea, cough, or change in sputum
      consistency/volume/color from the patient's baseline during stable conditions.

      Study Design:

      Patients will be randomly assigned to 2.5 mg albuterol treatments with either normal saline,
      as is the standard, or hypertonic saline.

      Once the patient is enrolled, they will be randomly assigned to 2.5 mg albuterol treatments
      with either normal saline, as is the standard, or hypertonic saline. They will then receive
      the 2.5mg albuterol treatment, and saline solution as determined by the randomization plan
      (Group 1 will receive 0.9% saline and Group 2 will receive 3% saline), every six hours for
      at least the first 24 hours, with allowance for PRN (pro re nata= as needed) use every four
      hours by patient request.

      The patient's dyspnea will be evaluated prior to starting the treatment and after the
      intervention period is completed using the Modified Borg Dyspnea Scale.
