    <description>Patients are evaluated clinically at 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, 1 year and every six months for 10 years for disease recurrence. In addition to clinical exams, yearly mammograms and other imaging studies as deemed appropriate will be obtained to rule out recurrent disease. Recurrent disease will be defined as cancer recurrence within 2cm of site of original tumor bed (marked by surgical clips).</description>
