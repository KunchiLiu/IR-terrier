      Magnetic Resonance Elastography (MRE) for cardiac transplant patients.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patient will undergo MRE beginning 4-8 weeks post transplant, then with each scheduled
      cardiac biopsy through 7-8 months post transplant. Results of the MRE will be compared
      against results of the cardiac biopsy to determine if the non-invasive MRE can predict
      cardiac transplant rejection.

    <measure>Assess cardiac stiffness with Magnetic Resonance Elastography to determine cardiac transplant rejection</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>MRE scans will be performed within 24-48 hours of standard of care cardic biopsies for patients who have undergone cardiac transplant at The Ohio State University Ross Heart Hospital. Stiffness results from the MRE will be compared to histopathology from the cardiac biospy to determine if the completely non-invasive MRE can successfully predict transplant rejection.</description>

    <description>Patients who have received a cardiac transplant at The Ohio State University Ross Heart Hospital will undergo Magnetic Resonance Elastography (MRE) (using a Magnetic Resonance Elastography driver) within 24-48 hours of standard of care biopsy. Results of both will be compared to determine if MRE can successfully predict cardiac transplant rejection.</description>

    <intervention_name>Magnetic Resonance Elastography driver</intervention_name>
    <description>A driver is required for MRE. The driver utilizes sound waves to produce vibrations. Images of these vibrations are captured with Magnetic Resonance scanner to produce images that indicate stiffness in an organ.</description>
