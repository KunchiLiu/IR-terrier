      This study will establish the duration of excretion of rotavirus vaccine in stool following
      vaccination of premature babies hospitalised in a neonatal unit at the time of vaccination.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rotavirus is the commonest cause of severe gastroenteritis in young children, and premature
      babies are at high risk of serious disease. The RV1 rotavirus vaccine is an altered form of
      the virus and is given to all children at 8 weeks and 12 weeks of age in the UK. It is given
      by mouth and excreted in the stool following vaccination - the vaccine virus can therefore
      be transmitted between people in the same way as the normal virus. Premature babies often
      receive their initial vaccines while they are still hospitalised in neonatal units. There
      are no data regarding stool excretion of the RV1 rotavirus vaccine in premature babies -
      there is a theoretical risk of transmission of the vaccine virus to other babies in the unit
      (if there was inadequate staff hand washing). Some countries have therefore advised against
      immunisation of babies while in the neonatal unit. In the UK, however, the vaccine is being
      given in neonatal units, enabling evaluation of the vaccine in hospitalised premature
      babies.

      This is an observational study of babies admitted to the neonatal unit at the John Radcliffe
      Hospital, Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust who receive their first dose of rotavirus
      vaccine during their hospital stay.
