  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate post-op pain requirements in patients undergoing hip
      or knee replacement surgery who perioperatively receive either Oral acetaminophen or IV
      acetaminophen
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will be randomized to receive perioperative dosing of either:

        1. Oral acetaminophen (Tylenol) 1000mg with IV Placebo (100ml Normal Saline), OR,

        2. IV acetaminophen (Ofirmev) 1000mg/100ml with Oral Placebo (oral capsules).

      Subject pain levels and post-operative opioid use will be tracked for up to 24 hours after
      surgery.

    <description>Subjects randomized to the Oral acetaminophen arm will receive 2 Tylenol 500mg capsules. In this study, one arm receives an oral form of active medication and one arm receives an IV form of active medication. To keep the subject and study personnel blinded, subjects receiving Oral acetaminophen will also receive 100ml of IV Normal Saline similar to the delivery method of the IV acetaminophen arm. The Normal Saline IV placebo will be given not as an intervention but rather as a method to maintain study integrity.</description>
