    <textblock>
      This study is a 12-week open-label trial to assess the effectiveness of Omega-3 fatty acids
      for deficient emotional self-regulation (DESR) as a supplement to ADHD treatment in children
      and adolescents with Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder. Subjects will be between the
      ages of 6-17 and will currently be on medication for their Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity
      Disorder but still experience DESR traits.
