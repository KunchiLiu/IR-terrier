  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate whether pazopanib can reduce epistaxis and improve anaemia in
      subjects with hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) at a dose that is well tolerated.
      The study will have 2 parts. Part A will be an open label, dose-escalation study in which up
      to 4 cohorts of approximately 6 subjects each will receive increasing doses of pazopanib for
      a maximum of 12 weeks. The dose in the first cohort will be 50mg per day and the maximum
      dose in a cohort will be 400 mg per day. Dose escalation will not occur as planned if the
      predefined safety stopping criteria are met or at least 4 subjects in a cohort have
      demonstrated efficacy (as measured by epistaxis, haemoglobin, transfusion or iron infusion
      requirements). If efficacy is demonstrated in Part A with an acceptable safety profile, Part
      B will be initiated to further define the optimal dose(s) including dose duration/schedule
      and to provide further support for the proof of mechanism. Approximately 15 subjects will
      participate and will be randomised to active or placebo in a ratio of 3:2. This part of the
      study will be double-blind.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Males/females aged between 18 and 75 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing
             the informed consent.

          -  Diagnosis of definite or possible HHT by the Curaçao criteria. According to the
             Curaçao criteria, a definite diagnosis of HHT is defined as having at least 3 of the
             following criteria while a possible diagnosis is defined as 2 criteria: a)
             spontaneous and recurrent epistaxis; b) multiple telangiectasias at characteristic
             sites: lips, oral cavity, fingers, nose; c) visceral lesions: gastrointestinal (GI)
             telangiectasia, pulmonary, hepatic, cerebral or spinal arteriovenous malformations
             (AVMs); d) a first degree relative with HHT according to these criteria.

          -  Subject meets at least one of the following criteria: a) Severe epistaxis over
             previous 4 weeks defined as an average of at least 3 nose bleeds per week AND a total
             duration of greater than 15 min per week AND requiring iron therapy (oral and/or
             intravenous); b) Moderate or severe iron deficiency anaemia (Hgb &lt; 11gram

             in the quality of life according to the investigator (e.g. nose bleeds, lethargic,
             cannot maintain job, listless, fatigue). Anaemia must be HHT related in the opinion
             of the investigator, ie: due to HHT-defined bleeding (epistaxis and/or bleeding from
             the GI tract [presence of telangiectatic lesions, exclusion of active ulcer disease
             or other infection, inflammation]), and lack of other known etiologies such as blood
             dyscrasias.

          -  Epistaxis (if applicable) is considered to be clinically stable during the 4 weeks
             prior to Screening in the clinical judgment of the investigator (i.e. no major
             changes in frequency or duration of epistaxis).

             eligibility, as obtained via a verbal interview with the subject or from the
             subject's medical records]; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous
             amenorrhoea [in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous follicle

             confirmatory].

             therapies are acceptable as long as use is consistent). If subjects stop taking
             experimental therapies on entry to the study there should be a wash-out period of at
