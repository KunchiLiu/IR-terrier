    <textblock>
      The Integra® TITAN™ Reverse Shoulder System (TRS) is a semi-constrained total shoulder
      construct. When used under the conditions and purposes intended the TRS will relieve pain
      and restore some functional joint motion to the affected shoulder. The purpose of this study
      is to assess the short, mid and long term outcomes of the TITAN™ Reverse Shoulder System.

    <measure>Survival (lack of implant component removal or revision) and lack of unanticipated device related serious adverse events.</measure>
    <time_frame>2 Year</time_frame>
    <description>Any implant revisions or device related adverse events must be reported as soon as the event is discovered. Assessment of adverse events will occur at each clinic visit.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Efficacy will be assessed by comparing clinical results after surgery as measured with American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Score (ASES), EQ-5D score, Range of motion (ROM), Constant score, Visual Analog Scale for Pain (VAS) and Radiographs.</measure>
    <time_frame>2 Year</time_frame>
    <description>Outcome after surgery will be evaluated using the above mentioned scores performed by and independent investigator.</description>

          -  Subjects with a shoulder joint anatomically and structurally suited to receive the
             device

          -  Subjects at least 21 years of age and skeletally mature at the time of surgery

          -  Subject provided consent to participate in the clinical study (having signed the
