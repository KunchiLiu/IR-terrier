  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Smoking rates among individuals with psychiatric disorders are disproportionately higher
      than the general population. The majority of psychiatric hospitals ban smoking on hospital
      grounds, thus providing an opportunity for inpatients to experience abstinence. Yet smokers
      in inpatient psychiatric settings are infrequently provided with referrals for cessation
      treatment on discharge (&lt; 1 %) and most resume smoking upon discharge. Therefore, the
      integration of effective cessation interventions within the current mental health treatment
      system is a public health priority.

      The overall objective of this project is to adapt an Extended Care (ExC) model to smokers
      with severe mental illness (SMI) engaged in a psychiatric hospitalization and to conduct a
      randomized, pragmatic effectiveness trial designed to assess the benefit of this adapted ExC
      in real-world practice. We will test the hypothesis that, among smokers with SMI in
      inpatient psychiatric treatment (n = 422), ExC will result in significantly greater rates of
      cotinine-validated, 7-day point prevalence abstinence at 6- and 12-months compared to a
      group that receives Brief Education (BE) about smoking cessation. Furthermore, we
      hypothesize that a higher proportion of ExC vs. BE patients will use evidence-based smoking
      cessation treatment (counseling and pharmacotherapy) in the month after discharge. We will
      also explore the effect of ExC on health and health care utilization in the 12 months
      post-discharge (psychiatric symptoms, psychiatric and medical hospital readmissions and
      emergency room visits) and the effectiveness of ExC on smoking abstinence in patient
      diagnostic subgroups.

      The expected outcome of this project is a demonstration of the effectiveness of an Extended
      Care intervention for smoking cessation in individuals with severe mental illness (SMI)
      following psychiatric hospitalization. Future studies could extend these findings to
      individuals with SMI receiving outpatient psychiatric treatment or psychotherapy. Overall,
      this research would have a significant positive public health impact that will move us
      closer to the long-term goal of dissemination and integration of the Extended Care model to
      increase smoking cessation and decrease smoking related morbidity and mortality in people
      with severe mental illness.
