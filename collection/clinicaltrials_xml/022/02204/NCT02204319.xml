      The objectives of this pilot study are to demonstrate effectiveness of application of the
      Erchonia Laser (manufactured by Erchonia Corporation),a non-invasive, non-significant risk
      low level laser red diode light therapy device, in providing relief of pain symptoms in
      patients with provoked and non- provoked vulvar vestibulitis; to reduce the frequency of use
      of oral medications to manage pain symptoms; and to reduce the debilitating affect vulvar
      vestibulitis has on the patient's daily activities, relationships and emotional well-being.

    <textblock>
      In the current proposed pilot study, application of a low level laser light device,
      manufactured by Erchonia Corporation, to reduce the pain of vulvar vestibulitis will be
      evaluated. The Erchonia Laser device will emit three independent 7 mW, 635 nm red light
      diodes in a hand-held device and is a variable frequency pulsed wave device.

      Erchonia low level lasers have been determined safe and effective and non-significant risk
      (NSR) by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for application for numerous and various
      pain reduction indications, providing justification for the anticipated safety and
      effectiveness of application of the Erchonia Laser to reduce pain in patients with vulvar
      vestibulitis. The FDA has granted 510(k) clearances for Erchonia low level laser devices for
      five pain reduction indications, all cleared under Product Code 'NHN', defined as: &quot;A light
      based non-laser device that emits energy in infrared or other wavelengths, provides
      non-heating and non-thermal effect, and is indicated for adjunctive use in pain therapy or
      related indication. It does not provide therapeutic topical heating.&quot;

      The research will be conducted at ProHealth Care; Inc. across four campuses. Patients will
      be seen in private rooms in the therapy departments.

      All study staff are licensed in the field of either Occupational Therapy or Physical therapy
      (2 in each) with the advanced continuing education necessary to call them a &quot;specialist&quot; in
      the treatment of pelvic floor disorders. All investigators will complete CITI training for
      research.

      Subjects will be referred into the ProHealth Care system via a prescription for pelvic floor
      therapy signed by a licensed medical professional with the expertise to diagnose Vulvar
      vestibulitis. Written information regarding the study and proposed treatment will also be
      mailed to a larger group of pelvic floor therapists in the greater Milwaukee WI region
      through a &quot;Pelvic Floor Study Group&quot; list informing them of the need for subjects with this
      diagnosis so that they may inform their clients of the availability of such research. These
      clients may then request a referral from their private health care provider.

      The pilot study will be completed in twelve months following the commitment of ProHealth
      Care, Inc. IRB as well as procurement of initial funding through grants applied for during
      2013. There will be 10 patients enrolled in the pilot study.

      Patients will be screened after they are referred by their physician for physical therapy.

    <time_frame>Compared from baseline visit, at 6th visit, and at 8 week follow up</time_frame>
    <description>III. Q-tip testing:
Position-Supine with pillows supporting each thigh in a semi-lithotomy supported position of comfort.
A diagram of the vulva with sites numbered in a clock face arrangement will be presented to the patient for reference (shown in figure 1).
The therapist will describe the Q-tip test that will be used to determine pain location and intensity (Zolnoun 2012).
While the patient is viewing the picture, the therapist will use a warm, wet Q-tip to apply a light pressure at the numbered areas.
Q-tip pressure will be applied at the following areas, in the exact order listed: 2:00, 10:00, 5:00, 7:00, 12:00, and 6:00 .
The patient will be asked to rate their pain by marking an intensity point between 0-100 on the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). A separate rating is recorded for each of the 6 numbered areas (see box 1 for reference).</description>
