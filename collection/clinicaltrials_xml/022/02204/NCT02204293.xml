  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Interleukin-1 antagonists such as canakinumab have been used for the treatment of AOSD and
      have had a marked influence on the activity of the disease, including joint mobility.
      Results from controlled clinical studies are not, however, currently available.

          4. Disease activity based on DAS28 of ≥3.2 at screening

          5. At least 4 painful and 4 swollen joints at screening and baseline (of the 28 joints
             according to DAS28)

          6. If undergoing treatment with NSAIDs, stable dose for at least 4 weeks prior to
             randomisation

          7. If undergoing treatment with glucocorticoids, stable dose of ≤10 mg/day (prednisolone

             Tociluzumab 3 months, Rituximab 9 months, canakinumab 6 months) prior to
             randomisation

         10. In patients of reproductive age, use of an effective method of contraception as well

          4. Positive Hepatitis B antigen (HBsAg), Hepatitis C antibodies and/or HIV antibodies.
