      Study ALD 103 is a multi-site, global, data collection study that is designed to evaluate
      safety and efficacy of allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) in
      patients with CALD aged 17 or younger.

      Study ALD-103 is a multi-site, global, prospective and retrospective data collection study
      that is designed to evaluate outcomes of allo-HSCT in male subjects ≤17 years of age with
      CALD. Retrospective subjects will be ≤17 years of age at the time of treatment; prospective
      subjects will be ≤17 years of age at the time of consent. This is an observational study
      that does not involve the use of an investigational drug or medicinal product. It allows for
      collection of specific data points related to the allo-HSCT procedures and outcomes.
      Suitability for allo-HSCT and the choice of the treatment protocol utilized for these
      subjects will be determined by the subjects' treating physicians as per their institutional
      policies/protocols and other local treatment guidelines. Procedures to be performed will be
      those according to institutional protocols and the accepted management of CALD, including
      supportive care, choice of graft source, allo-HSCT protocol, prophylaxis, and management of
      graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).

      Subjects will be monitored from Screening before allo-HSC infusion, through their Month 48
      Visit after allo-HSC infusion. Follow-up will include monitoring of outcome measures at
      Months 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, and 48 after allo-HSC infusion (prospective analysis).

      In addition to the subjects in the prospective analysis, subjects who received an allo-HSCT
      on or after January 1, 2013 who will be available for at least the Month 24 visit (24 ± 1
      months after allo-HSC infusion) may also be enrolled and followed through their Month 48
      Visit after their most recent allo-HSC infusion (partial prospective analysis and
      retrospective analysis, as applicable).
