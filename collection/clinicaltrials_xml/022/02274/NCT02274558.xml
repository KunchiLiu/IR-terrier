    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel, fixed-dose study
      to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of two doses of NBI-98854 (40 mg and 80
      mg) compared to placebo, administered once daily. The study design includes a double-blind,
      placebo-controlled treatment period for 6 weeks and a double-blind NBI-98854 treatment
      period for an additional 42 weeks, for a total of 48 weeks of treatment. Final follow-up
      assessments will be conducted 4 weeks after the last dose of the study drug.
