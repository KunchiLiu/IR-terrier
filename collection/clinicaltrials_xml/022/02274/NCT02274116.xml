    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine how the nervous system controlling leg muscles is
      altered following spinal cord injury and how they may be affected by brief periods of low
      oxygen inhalation over time.

      The investigators hypothesize:

        -  Acute intermittent hypoxia (AIH) exposure will increase maximum voluntary leg strength
           in persons with incomplete cervical spinal cord injury (SCI)

        -  AIH exposure will increase multijoint reflex excitability of leg muscles in persons
           with incomplete cervical SCI

        -  AIH exposure will increase walking performance in persons with incomplete cervical SCI

      Accumulating evidence suggests that repeatedly breathing low oxygen levels for brief periods
      (termed intermittent hypoxia) is a safe and effective treatment strategy to promote
      meaningful functional recovery in persons with chronic spinal cord injury. Repetitive
      exposure to mild hypoxia triggers a cascade of events in the spinal cord, including new
      protein synthesis and increased sensitivity in the circuitry necessary for breathing and
      walking. Recently, the investigators demonstrated that daily (5 consecutive days) of
      intermittent hypoxia stimulated walking enhancement in persons with chronic spinal cord
      injury.

      Despite these exciting findings, important clinical questions remain. For example, the
      investigators do not know if prolonged, but less intense intermittent hypoxia induces
      longer-lasting motor recovery as has been shown in rat models. The investigators hypothesize
      that repetitive exposures (3 times per week for 4 weeks) to modest bouts of low oxygen will
      enhance and prolong walking recovery in persons with chronic spinal cord injury. The
      investigators anticipate intermittent hypoxia-induced improvements in overground walking
      ability, likely due to greater balance in excitatory and inhibitory neural transmission.
      Whereas excitatory inputs drive walking, inhibitory inputs sculpt and coordinate muscle
      activity; yet so often remain compromised after chronic injury. Thus, the investigators also
      predict that repetitive exposures to intermittent hypoxia will result in improved inhibition
      and subsequently enhance muscle coordination during walking. The investigators will use
      multiple experimental approaches, including muscle electromyography, measurements of walking
      dynamics and stretch reflexes. Finally, it is critical to assure that repetitive exposures
      to intermittent hypoxia do not elicit pathologies characteristic of more severe, chronic
      hypoxia experienced by individuals with obstructive sleep apnea. The investigators will
      confirm that repeat exposures to mild bouts of intermittent hypoxia is safe.
