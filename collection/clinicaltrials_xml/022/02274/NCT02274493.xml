    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn more about the safety and feasibility
      of using the Da Vinci Robotic Surgical system in procedures that harvest the latissimus
      dorsi muscle for reconstructive procedures.

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, and you agree, your screening,
      reconstructive surgery, and follow-up appointments will be scheduled over multiple visits,
      as listed in this consent form. All procedures will be performed on days in which standard
      of care procedures would already be performed.

      If it is determined that you are eligible, the following will be performed before the
      surgery:

        -  The study doctor or a member of the research team will review your medical information
           and ask you questions about your medical history and demographic information.

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  You will be evaluated by a Physical Therapist to test your range of motion and
           strength.

        -  You will complete a questionnaire about pain, as well as your shoulder, arm, and hand
           range of motion. This information will be used to compare with the results after the
           surgery. This will take about 5 minutes to complete.

        -  Photographs and/or videos of the surgical site will be taken.

        -  If you can become pregnant, you will have a urine pregnancy test. To take part in this
           study, you must not be pregnant.

      Surgery Study Visit (2):

      At this visit, your reconstructive surgery will be performed using a robot, called the Da
      Vinci® Robotic Surgical System. The reconstructive surgery is considered to be standard of
      care. You will be asked to sign a separate consent form that discusses the possible benefits
      and risks of the standard of care surgical procedure in more detail, including information
      about any anesthetic you will be given for the surgery.

      A standard muscle harvest procedure takes about 2 hours. A muscle harvest procedure with the
      robotic system is expected to take longer than the standard surgery. The total procedure
      time will vary for each patient depending on the type of muscle harvest procedure and other
      factors in the operating room. The total time to complete the muscle harvest and
      reconstruction will take about 4 hours. Photographs and/or videos of the surgical site will
      be taken.

      You will remain in the hospital for 3-4 days after the surgery is complete for observation.
      After you are discharged from the hospital, you will need to return within 2 weeks for your
      first follow-up examination.

      Follow-Up Study Visits (3-6):

      After you have been discharged from the hospital, you will have 4 follow-up visits.

      The first follow up visit will take place within two weeks after you are discharged . The
      second follow-up visit will be between 2-4 weeks, the third follow up visit will be between
      1-3 months and the fourth follow up will be between 3-6 months after you are discharged.

      The following tests and procedures will be performed at each follow-up visit:

        -  The study doctor will check the surgery site(s).

        -  Your overall health status will be checked.

        -  You will be evaluated by a Physical Therapist to test your range of motion and
           strength.

        -  Photographs and/or videos of the surgical site may be taken.

        -  You will complete the questionnaire about pain and your shoulder, arm, and hand range
           of motion. This information will be used to compare with the results from before the
           surgery.

      Length of Study Participation:

      Your participation on the study will be over after the follow-up visits.

      This is an investigational study. The use of the Da Vinci® Robotic Surgical System for
      surgery in the thorax (part of the upper body) is FDA approved and commercially available at
      this time. However, the system has not been FDA cleared specifically for use in latissimus
      dorsi muscle harvest procedures. The use of the DaVinci Robotic Surgical System for this
      type of reconstructive surgery has not been performed in live humans and is what researchers
      are investigating for this study.

      Up to 15 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.
