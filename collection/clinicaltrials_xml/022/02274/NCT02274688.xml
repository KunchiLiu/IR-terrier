  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The nation's trauma care system, which includes trauma center hospitals &amp; emergency
      departments, is where over 30 million Americans receive care after traumatic injuries each
      year. Injury victims are diverse patients who suffer from complications of the initial
      injury as well as from multiple complex medical &amp; mental health conditions. Currently,
      high-quality patient-centered care is not the standard of care throughout US trauma care
      systems. Injured trauma survivors treated in trauma care systems frequently receive
      fragmented care that is not coordinated across hospital, emergency department, outpatient, &amp;
      community settings. Post-injury care is frequently not individualized to integrate the
      patient's most pressing post-traumatic concerns &amp; preferences into medical decision making.
      The investigators, as a group of front-line trauma center providers, patients, researchers &amp;
      policy makers, have been working together for over a decade to integrate patient-centered
      care into US trauma care systems. The investigators began this work by asking groups of
      injured patients the key patient-centered question: &quot;Of everything that has happened to you
      since your injury, what concerns you the most?&quot; The investigators developed scientifically
      sound assessment tools that allowed us to follow patient concerns after injury
      hospitalization. In May of 2011, the investigators convened an American College of Surgeons'
      policy summit that addressed mental health &amp; patient-centered care integration across US
      trauma care systems. As part of this policy summit, patient members of our team presented
      their experiences of traumatic injury &amp; recovery. While giving injured patients a &quot;voice&quot; at
      the summit, these narratives did not move surgical policy makers to develop mandates or
      guidelines for patient-centered care. In contrast, presentations that included information
      from randomized comparative effectiveness trials &amp; standardized outcome assessments
      convinced surgical policy makers to develop US trauma care system policy mandates &amp; best
      practice guidelines for post-traumatic stress disorder &amp; alcohol use problems. Our team now
      realizes that in order to optimally integrate patient-centered care into US trauma care
      systems, the investigators must use the best scientific methods that capture the
      highest-quality data. This PCORI proposal aims to demonstrate that a patient-centered care
      management treatment that addresses patient's post-injury concerns &amp; integrates patient
      concerns &amp; preferences into medical decision making, while also coordinating care, can
      improve outcomes of great importance to patients &amp; their caregivers, front-line providers &amp;
      policy makers. This proposal directly addresses two PCORI patient-centered research
      questions: &quot;After a traumatic injury, what can I do to improve the outcomes that are most
      important to me?&quot; &amp; &quot;How can front-line providers working in trauma care systems help me
      make the best decisions about my post-injury health &amp; health care?&quot;
