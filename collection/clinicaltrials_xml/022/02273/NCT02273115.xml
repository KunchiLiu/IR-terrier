  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall purpose of this study is to determine if adding oxytocin to a Foley catheter for
      induction of labor will increase the rate of delivery within 24 hours stratified by parity.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, open-label, randomized study. Women with a singleton, vertex
      gestation between 24-42 weeks gestations presenting for labor induction will be offered
      participation in this study. Patients who receive prenatal care at Christiana Care may be
      approached if an induction of labor is scheduled and consented at their prenatal visit. All
      indications for induction will be included except those specifically mentioned as exclusion
      criteria. Any contraindication for vaginal delivery would exclude the subject. After
      informed consent is obtained, the Foley catheter will be placed and the subject will be
      randomized to receive oxytocin (study group) or not (control group). After Foley catheter
      removal or expulsion, the remainder of the induction course was left to the discretion of
      the primary provider. Prior to randomization, the subject will be placed into the
      nulliparous or multiparous group.

    <description>Nulliparous women randomized to receive Foley only treatment will have a 20 French latex or silicone Foley catheter placed by the provider in the method they are most comfortable (direct visualization or indirectly). Balloons will have the ability to accommodate up to 80 ml of fluid to avoid rupture. The Foley balloon with be instilled with 60 ml of saline. The end of the catheter is then taped to the medial aspect of the patient's thigh on tension. No additional ripening agents or oxytocin will be administered while the Foley is in place. If spontaneous expulsion has not occurred, the Foley will be removed after 12 hours. Oxytocin will be administered per Christiana Care protocol after Foley removal.</description>
