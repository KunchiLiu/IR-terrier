  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, single-arm, Phase 2 trial to evaluate the anti-tumor activity,
      safety, and tolerability of Pembrolizumab in combination with azacitidine in subjects with
      chemo-refractory mCRC without any further standard treatment options

      Dosage and regimen for all study periods

        -  Pembrolizumab will be given at 200 mg every 21 days.

        -  Azacitidine will be given at 100 mg daily subcutaneous injection on days 1-5 every 21
           days.

      The first assessment of tumor response will be performed after cycle 3 (9 weeks), and
      thereafter approximately every 9 weeks, every 3 cycles of therapy. The modified RECIST 1.1
      will be used to establish disease response or progression.

      All patients will be evaluated and graded for adverse events according to the NCI Common
      Terminology for Adverse Events, version 4.0 (NCI-CTCAE).

             therapies.

          5. Have measurable disease based on RECIST 1.1.

          6. At least 1 of the tumor sites must be amenable to core needle biopsy and this may not
             be the site of disease used to measure antitumor response. Patient must agree to this
             mandatory biopsy.

          7. Have a performance status of 0 or 1 on the ECOG Performance Scale.

          8. Demonstrate adequate organ function, all screening labs should be performed within 14
             days of treatment initiation.

          9. Female subject of childbearing potential should have a negative urine or serum
             pregnancy within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study medication. If
             the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test
             will be required.

         10. Female subjects of childbearing potential should be willing to use 2 methods of birth
             control or be surgically sterile, or abstain from heterosexual activity for the
             course of the study through 120 days after the last dose of study medication.
             Subjects of childbearing potential are those who have not been surgically sterilized
             or have not been free from menses for &gt; 1 year.

         11. Male subjects should agree to use an adequate method of contraception starting with
             the first dose of study therapy through 120 days after the last dose of study
             therapy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Is currently participating in or has participated in a study of an investigational
             agent or using an investigational device within 4 weeks of the first dose of
             treatment.

          2. Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving systemic steroid therapy or any
             other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of

             not recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events due to agents
             administered more than 4 weeks earlier.

          4. Has had prior chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy, or radiation therapy
             within 4 weeks prior to study Day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or at

             - Note: Subjects with ≤ Grade 2 neuropathy are an exception to this criterion and may
             qualify for the study.

          5. Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment.
             Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin, squamous cell carcinoma of the
             skin, or in situ cervical cancer that has undergone potentially curative therapy..

          9. Has known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous
             meningitis. Subjects with previously treated brain metastases may participate
             provided they are stable (without evidence of progression by imaging for at least
             four weeks prior to the first dose of trial treatment and any neurologic symptoms
             have returned to baseline), have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases,
             and are not using steroids for at least 7 days prior to trial treatment.

             or resolved childhood asthma/atopy would be an exception to this rule. Subjects that
             require intermittent use of bronchodilators or local steroid injections would not be

             interest of the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.

         14. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.
