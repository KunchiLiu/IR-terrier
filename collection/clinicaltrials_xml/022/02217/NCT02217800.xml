  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to assess the effect of the different continuous s.c. infusion
      treatments on the human growth hormone (hGH) levels in untreated acromegalic patients in
      comparison to a standard dose of octreotide. In addition, the pharmacokinetic profile and
      the safety and tolerability of DG3173 after continuous s.c. infusion will be evaluated.

    <description>Interventions: saline, DG3173 and octreotide. Eligible patients are to receive a constant 23 hour subcutaneous infusion of saline as placebo comparator and will be randomized in an equal ratio to one of three treatment sequences of doses of 920, 2760 and 5520 µg DG3173 by constant 23 hour subcutaneous infusions in a random sequence followed by three subcutaneous injections of 300 µg octreotide at approximately 8 hour intervals as an active comparator.</description>
