    <textblock>
      This study will analyze injectate dispersal patterns after standard-of-care cervical
      epidural steroid injections using gadolinium as a marker and magnetic resonance imaging
      (MRI) to characterize the pattern. Although these procedures are performed with high
      frequency under the assumption that injectate remains localized to injection site, no
      peer-reviewed studies have validated this assumption. Comprehensive characterization of
      injectate dispersal patterns will provide important data regarding safety, as well as
      diagnostic and therapeutic potential of cervical epidural steroid injections.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Epidural steroid injections have long had an impact in the treatment of various
      spine-related conditions, particularly radiculopathy. The efficacy of epidural spinal
      injections has been attributed to the anatomic location reached by the injectate. Cervical
      epidural steroid injections are also used as an injury location indicator. This application
      is based on documenting pain relief after injection into a specific location in the cervical
      spine. Both the diagnostic and therapeutic applications for epidurals assume that the
      injectate remains local to the injection site in order to have its effects. However, in a
      recently completed study, the investigators group documented substantial diffusion of
      injectate after lumbar epidurals used computerized tomography (CT) assessments.1 Based on
      the exposure to ionizing radiation associated with CT along with the superior imaging
      specificity and sensitivity of MRI, the investigators are shifting their imaging modality to
      MRI for future studies. The proposed study is designed to evaluate the use of gadolinium and
      MRI to assess nature and amount of diffusion of injectate in the cervical region after
      standard-of-care epidural injections. To the investigators knowledge, this will be the first
      study to critically assess this common procedure in order to evaluate safety and efficacy in
      a clinical setting.

    <description>Determine the relative efficacy (diagnostic and therapeutic) of cervical epidural injections based on injectate diffusion. We believe that the epidural injections will remain localized within the epidural space. We will measure (with post-injection MRI) how far cranial and caudal as well as anterior and posterior the injection is travelling in the epidural space.</description>
