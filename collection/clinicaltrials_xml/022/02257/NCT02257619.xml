  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if INCB039110, in combination with docetaxel, is
      safe and effective in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This population will consist of subjects with stage IIIB, IV or recurrent NSCLC who have
      been previously treated. The study consists of two parts, Part 1 and Part 2. Part 1 is an
      open label, safety run-in, which is designed to confirm the safety and tolerability of
      INCB039110 in combination with docetaxel and to select a dose to be evaluated in Part 2.
      During Part 1 subjects will receive open label INCB039110 and docetaxel.

      In Part 2 of the study, subjects will be randomized to receive either INCB039110 or placebo
      and docetaxel. The dose and frequency of INCB039110 and docetaxel administered will be
      determined from Part 1 of the study. INCB039110/placebo will be self-administered each day
      during the entire cycle. This part of the study will be conducted in a double-blind,
      randomized manner.
