      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of reduced doses (10 mg
      and 20 mg) of intra-coronary alteplase compared with placebo as an adjunct to PCI in
      reducing MVO and its consequences in high risk patients with STEMI.

      Despite numerous interventions, there remains a need to develop new ways to prevent
      microvascular obstruction (MVO). The investigators aim to select patients with persistent
      S-T-elevation on the ECG and an occluded artery and heavy thrombus burden at initial
      angiography. These characteristics are causally linked to MVO. Patients with a thrombotic
      culprit coronary artery have reduced myocardial perfusion compared to those without and the
      presence of coronary thrombus is an independent predictor of adverse ischaemic outcomes
      post-MI. Intra-luminal thrombus, as revealed by intra vascular imaging with optical
      coherence tomography (OCT) in STEMI patients, has shown that thrombus commonly persists in
      the culprit coronary artery, including within the stent post-implantation, even when the
      thrombus is invisible with conventional angiography. The amount of persistent thrombus
      predicted the likelihood of persistent S-T-segment elevation, a marker of microvascular
      injury, and impaired perfusion.Therefore, coronary thrombus represents a therapeutic target
      in primary PCI. The pathophysiology of MVO and microvascular thrombosis has elucidated in
      MRI studies of reperfused MI in swine. The investigators demonstrated that LATE MVO
      corresponds closely with infarct zone haemorrhage as revealed by T2-weighted MRI and
      pathology. The investigators observations were validated by Robbers et al who showed that in
      swine 7 days post-MI, when LATE MVO and haemorrhage correspond (which is usually the case),
      there is severe capillary loss and disruption coupled with thrombosis and inflammation. They
      concluded that following reperfusion, acute inflammation and microvessel thrombosis result
      in degradation of endothelial integrity and capillary breakdown. Very interestingly, their
      histology also demonstrated diffuse microvascular thrombosis within the area of late
      gadolinium enhancement surrounding the haemorrhagic core which explains reduced perfusion
      (or wash during first pass of gadolinium contrast MRI) within the ischaemic area-at-risk.
      This observation points to the therapeutic potential of local thrombolysis within the
      culprit artery circulation.The study addresses the question of whether a pharmacological
      strategy involving reduced dose alteplase given early during the primary PCI procedure will
      both prevent and treat distal microvascular thrombosis and MVO and, subsequently, reduce
      infarct size.Current evidence around the potential safety and efficacy of reduced dose
      fibrinolysis in primary PCI is limited. These limitations set-the-scene and support the
      rationale for the clinical trial: Full systemic dose intravenous fibrinolysis to facilitate
      primary PCI is potentially harmful and increases the risk of off-target bleeding
      complications; therefore, the investigators will use reduced-dose fibrinolysis. They will
      directly infuse alteplase into the culprit artery to achieve effective and sustained local
      plasma concentrations and much lower systemic concentrations of unbound drug. It is
      anticipated that bleeding rates may be low; therefore, the investigators will measure
      fibrinogen in all patients. Fibrinogen and other haemostasis parameters will serve as a
      surrogate measure of bleeding (and safety). In line with contemporary practice,
      investigators advise that patients have radial artery access whenever possible. Previous
      trials have used streptokinase (non-fibrin specific and immunogenic); this study will use
      the fibrin-specific non-immunogenic second generation thrombolytic, alteplase The only
      previous trial involved thrombolysis at the end of primary PCI (when microvascular
      thrombosis may already be established after reperfusion); the efficacy of thrombolysis may
      be greatest when thrombus is most abundant at the beginning of primary PCI; persistent
      residual fibrin strands adherent within the culprit territory will be selectively targeted
      by fibrinolytic therapy during primary PCI; thrombus which forms during the primary PCI
      procedure could be treated by the sustained 'deep tissue' thrombolytic effects of locally
      administered intra-coronary alteplase; in terms of ease-of-use and feasibility, there may be
      advantages to giving alteplase as a single dose.T-TIME is a Phase II evaluation of two
      reduced doses of alteplase, delivered locally, compared to placebo in STEMI patients
      receiving PCI in a double-blind, randomised, parallel group, placebo-controlled dose-ranging
      clinical trial. The investigators believe the strategy with intracoronary fibrinolysis
      complements other therapeutic approaches which are currently being tested. Should the trial
      demonstrate EFFICACY then a future trial might involve a factorial design with placebo,
      alteplase and any other intervention that might also be shown to be effective in the
      intervening time in order to test the comparative EFFICACY of each (alone or in combination)
      on surrogate and/or clinical outcomes.
