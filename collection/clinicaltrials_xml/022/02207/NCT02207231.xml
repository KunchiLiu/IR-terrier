  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of
      guselkumab (CNTO 1959) in the treatment of participants with moderate to severe plaque-type
      psoriasis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized (assignment of study drug by chance), double-blind (neither the
      participant or study staff will know the identity of study drugs), placebo- (inactive
      substance identical in appearance to study drug) and active-comparator-controlled (use of an
      approved drug to compare with study drug) study of guselkumab in participants with moderate
      to severe plaque-type psoriasis (scaly skin rash). The active comparator study drug is
      adalimumab, an approved drug for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.
      Participants who satisfy all inclusion and exclusion criteria will be randomly assigned in a
      2:1:2 ratio to one of three treatment groups (arms): Group I (guselkumab 100 mg dose
      regimen), Group II (placebo then crossover to guselkumab at Week 16), or Group III
      (adalimumab at standard psoriasis dosing). All participants will receive guselkumab every 8
      weeks (q8w) from Week 52 through Week 148 (open label treatment period). The end of the
      study is defined as the time the last participant completes the Week 160 visit. Participants
      will primarily be assessed for Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) Score of 0 or 1 and
      Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 90 Response at Week 16. The total duration of the
      study will be approximately 164 weeks (includes a 4-week screening period). Participants
      will be monitored for safety throughout the study.

    <measure>The percentage of participants with an Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) score of 0 or 1 comparing the guselkumab group and the placebo group</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The IGA documents the investigator's assessment of the participants psoriasis at a given time point. Overall lesions are graded for induration, erythema, and scaling. The participant's psoriasis is assessed as 5-point scale as follows: cleared (0), minimal (1), mild (2), moderate (3), or severe (4).</description>

    <measure>The percentage of participants with a Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 90 Response comparing the guselkumab group and the placebo group</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The PASI is a system used for assessing and grading the severity of psoriatic lesions and their response to therapy. In the PASI system, the body is divided into 4 regions: the head, trunk, upper extremities, and lower extremities. Each of these areas is assessed separately for erythema, induration, and scaling, which are each rated on a scale of 0 to 4. The PASI produces a numeric score that can range from 0 to 72. A higher score indicates more severe disease. A PASI 90 response represents an improvement of at least a 90% from baseline in the PASI score.</description>

    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The DLQI is a participant-reported outcome (PRO) consisting of a set of 10 questions regarding the degree to which the participant's skin has affected certain behaviors and quality of life over the last week. Responses to each are: very much (score of 3), a lot, a little, or not at all (score of 0). The DLQI score ranges from 0 (best) to 30 (worst); the higher the score, the more quality of life is impaired.</description>

    <description>The ss-IGA assesses the severity of the participant's scalp psoriasis using a 5-point scale that ranges from 0 (absence of disease) to 4 (severe disease). This analysis will compare the guselkumab group and the placebo group among randomized participants with scalp psoriasis and an ss-IGA score ≥2 at baseline.</description>

    <measure>The change from Baseline in Psoriasis Symptom and Sign Diary (PSSD) symptom score, comparing the guselkumab group and the placebo group</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The PSSD is a PRO questionnaire designed to measure the severity of psoriasis symptoms and signs for the assessment of treatment benefit. It consists of 11 items covering symptoms (itch, pain, stinging, burning and skin tightness) and participant-observable signs (skin dryness, cracking, scaling, shedding or flaking, redness and bleeding) using a 0 (absent) to 10 (worst imaginable) numerical rating scale for severity. A higher score indicates more severe disease. Two sub-scores are calculated: the psoriasis symptom score and the psoriasis sign score. For this endpoint, only participants with PSSD symptom score greater than or equal to 1 at Baseline will be analyzed.</description>

    <description>The NAPSI is a sum of 2 scores on the basis of a target nail representing the worst nail psoriasis. The nail is divided into 4 sections (quadrants) and is graded independently for both nail matrix psoriasis and nail bed psoriasis. Scores for nail matrix and nail bed psoriasis range from 0 (none) to 4 (present in all quadrants of the nail). The sum of these 2 scores is the total NAPSI score.
