        40 mmHg or maximal aortic valve velocity &gt; 4.0 m/sec by resting echocardiogram.

        Subjects with low-flow/low gradient severe aortic stenosis can be included, provided
        low-dose dobutamine or exercise stress echocardiography demonstrates a mean gradient of
        &gt;40 mmHg or a maximal aortic valve velocity of &gt;4.0 m/sec, AND aortic valve area of
        &lt;1.0cm2 (or aortic valve area index of &lt;0.6 cm2/m2).

          -  STS score of ≥ 8 OR documented heart team agreement of ≥ high risk for AVR due to
             frailty or co-morbidities.
