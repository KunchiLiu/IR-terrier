    <textblock>
      The investigators believe that ultrasound guided CSE technique will accurately place the
      epidural needle in the midline position compared to epidural needle placement via palpation
      of anatomical landmarks. This will result in positive CSF in the spinal needle, correct
      placement of the catheter, and adequate symmetrical labor analgesia/anesthesia.

    <textblock>
      Epidurals provide superior labor analgesia and anesthesia. Unfortunately, failure of
      epidural anesthesia and analgesia is a frequent clinical problem. In a heterogeneous cohort
      of 2,140 surgical patients, a failure rate of 27% for lumbar epidural was described.
      However, the definition of a failed epidural is broad. Different definitions include
      insufficient analgesia to catheter dislodgement to conversion to general anesthesia.
      Epidural analgesia failures may result from technical difficulties, insufficiencies or
      overdosing of local anesthetics, epidural septum or midline adhesions, and placement of the
      epidural catheter through an intervertebral foramen or into the anterior epidural space. In
      an imaging study of failed epidurals, incorrect catheter placement accounted for half of the
      failures, while the remaining patients experienced suboptimal analgesia through a correctly
      positioned catheter.

      The incidence of overall failure was lower in patients receiving combined spinal-epidural
      (CSE) catheters versus epidural analgesia. In one study, the CSE technique provided
      decreased failure rates for labor analgesia and comparable or decreased failure rates for
      surgical anesthesia, when compared with reported failure rates for epidural anesthesia. It
      is believed that positive CSF flow in the spinal needle confirms correct epidural needle
      placement in the epidural space and also confirms the epidural needle to be in the midline
      position. Placement of the epidural needle in the midline position will minimize the
      incorrect placement of the catheter to one side, providing a symmetrical analgesia versus
      unilateral analgesia.

      However, the practice of CSE and epidural catheter placement relies on the palpation of
      anatomical landmarks that are not always easy to feel. Therefore, the epidural needle maybe
      placed &quot;off midline&quot; despite positive loss of resistance (LOR) that causes negative CSF flow
      in the spinal needle and an incorrectly placed catheter. As a result, the incorrect catheter
      placement will result in a &quot;failed&quot; or suboptimal epidural analgesia.

      Ultrasound has recently been utilized to facilitate lumbar epidurals and spinals. The US
      imaging of the lumbar spine in different scanning planes facilitates the identification of
      the landmarks necessary for appropriate epidural space location in pregnant patients. There
      are two acoustic windows that are effective for lumbar spine sonographic assessment: one
      seen on the transverse approach, and the other seen on the longitudinal paramedian approach.
      The ultrasound single-screen method using the transverse approach of the lumbar spine
      provides reliable information regarding the landmarks required for labor epidurals. The
      correct interspace and midline position are identified for correct placement of the CSE
      analgesia.
