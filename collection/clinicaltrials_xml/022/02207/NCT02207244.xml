  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of
      guselkumab (CNTO 1959) in the treatment of participants with moderate to severe plaque-type
      psoriasis (scaly skin rash).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized (assignment of study drug by chance), double-blind (neither the
      participant or study staff will know the identity of study drugs), placebo- (inactive
      substance identical in appearance to study drug) and active-comparator-controlled (use of an
      approved drug to compare with study drug) study of guselkumab. The active comparator study
      drug is adalimumab, an approved drug for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque
      psoriasis. Participants who satisfy all inclusion and exclusion criteria will be randomly
      assigned in a 2:1:1 ratio to one of three treatment groups (arms): Group I (guselkumab 100
      mg dose regimen), Group II (placebo then crossover to guselkumab at Week 16), or Group III
      (adalimumab at standard psoriasis dosing). From Week 28 up to Week 76, treatment for all
      participants will be based on their level of response. All participants will receive
      guselkumab every 8 weeks from Week 76 through Week 148 (open label treatment period). The
      end of the study is defined as the time the last participant completes the Week 160 visit.
      Participants will primarily be assessed for Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) Score of
      0 or 1 and Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 90 Response at Week 16. The total
      duration of the study will be approximately 164 weeks (includes a 4-week screening period).
      Participants will be monitored for safety throughout the study.

    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The IGA documents the investigator's assessment of the participants psoriasis at a given time point. Overall lesions are graded for induration, erythema, and scaling. The participant's psoriasis is assessed as 5-point scale as follows: cleared (0), minimal (1), mild (2), moderate (3), or severe (4).</description>

    <measure>Percentage of participants with a Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 90 Response comparing the guselkumab group and the placebo group</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The PASI is a system used for assessing and grading the severity of psoriatic lesions and their response to therapy. In the PASI system, the body is divided into 4 regions: the head, trunk, upper extremities, and lower extremities. Each of these areas is assessed separately for erythema, induration, and scaling, which are each rated on a scale of 0 to 4. The PASI produces a numeric score that can range from 0 to 72. A higher score indicates more severe disease. A PASI 90 response represents improvement of at least 90% from baseline in the PASI score.</description>

    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The DLQI is a participant-reported outcome (PRO) consisting of a set of 10 questions regarding the degree to which the participant's skin has affected certain behaviors and quality of life over the last week. Responses to each are: very much (score of 3), a lot, a little, or not at all (score of 0). The DLQI score ranges from 0 (best) to 30 (worst); the higher the score, the more quality of life is impaired.</description>

    <description>The PSSD is a PRO questionnaire designed to measure the severity of psoriasis symptoms and signs for the assessment of treatment benefit. It consists of 11 items covering symptoms (itch, pain, stinging, burning and skin tightness) and participant-observable signs (skin dryness, cracking, scaling, shedding or flaking, redness and bleeding) using 0 (absent) to 10 (worst imaginable) numerical rating scale for severity. A higher score indicates more severe disease. Two sub-scores are calculated: the psoriasis symptom score and the psoriasis sign score.</description>
