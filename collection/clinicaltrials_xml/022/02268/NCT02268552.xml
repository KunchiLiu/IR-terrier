      An open-label, multi-part, first-in-human study of oral LMI070 in infants with Type 1 spinal
      muscular atrophy. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability,
      pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD) and efficacy after 13 weeks; and to estimate
      the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and optimal dosing regimen of orally administered LMI070 in
      patients with Type 1 SMA.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multi-part, first-in-human, proof of concept study in infants with
      Type 1 spinal muscular atrophy who have exactly 2 copies of SMN2, to evaluate safety,
      tolerability, PK, PD and efficacy of oral LMI070 after 13 weeks treatment.

      Parts 1 and 2 are intended to be non-confirmatory. In Part 1 of the study, patients will be
      dosed once weekly with LMI070. The LMI070 dose will be escalated in subsequent cohorts until
      MTD is determined or when sufficient PK results confirm that the MTD cannot be reached due
      to a potential pharmacokinetic plateau at higher doses. A decision to dose escalate the next
      cohort will be made after safety data have been collected for 14 days following the first
      dose (14-day DLT window). PK will be used to confirm that there is no accumulation of the
      compound. Part 2 of the study will enroll new patients into one of up to 3 dosing regimens
      (depending on the results of Part 1) for 12 weeks. Patients who complete the first 13 weeks
      of Part 1 and are, in the opinion of the Investigator and Sponsor benefiting and/or
      tolerating LMI070, may continue treatment with higher doses of LMI070 that have been shown
      to be well tolerated.
