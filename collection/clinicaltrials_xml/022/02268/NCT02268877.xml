  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this project is to compare the efficiency of pelvic ultrasounds performed by
      emergency medicine residents and attending physicians to the efficiency of pelvic
      ultrasounds performed by the department of radiology.

      This study is a randomized, prospective interventional study of pregnant patients presenting
      to the emergency department with complaints of pelvic pain and/or vaginal bleeding. This
      study will be conducted at 4 sites across the United States. Patients who are eligible and
      consent to participate will be randomized to one of two conditions; 1) a pelvic ultrasound
      that is performed by a certified emergency department attending or physician, or 2) a pelvic
      ultrasound that is performed by a certified radiology technician (standard-of-care). The
      time to diagnosis and emergency department length of stay between the two groups will be
      compared.
