      a 24-week phase 3, multi-center clinical trial, comprised of a 16-week, randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled period (&quot;Randomized Period&quot;), followed by an 8-week
      open-label safety extension period, where all subjects receive KRX-0502 (ferric citrate)
      (&quot;Extension Period&quot;). The study will consist of 14 clinic visits over a period of 24 weeks.
      There will be a screening period of up to 14 days; Approximately 230 subjects will be
      randomized into the Randomized Period in a 1:1 ratio to receive either KRX-0502 or matching
      placebo, at baseline
