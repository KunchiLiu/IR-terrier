    <textblock>
      This study consists of three portions: The first portion- Phase 1, or dose-escalation
      portion, that will evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetic profile of venetoclax in
      combination with low-dose cytarabine (LDC), define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and
      generate data to support a recommended Phase 2 dose (RPTD) in treatment-naïve subjects with
      Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML). Second portion, initial Phase 2 that will evaluate if the
      RPTD has sufficient efficacy and acceptable toxicity to warrant further development of the
      combination therapy. Subsequently, Phase 2 Cohort C, will evaluate the overall response rate
      (ORR) for subjects allowed additional supportive medications (strong CYP3A inhibitors) if
      medically indicated.
