    <textblock>
      Randomized trial to evaluate impact of healthcare provider( clinician and nursing staff)
      support and education on treatment discontinuation rates in the absence of progression in
      patients with metastatic colorectal cancer treated with regorafenib. Intensified education
      and support will be provided through an application for iPad which has automatic links to
      grading, dose reduction and side effect management ,as well as, references for additional
      articles.
