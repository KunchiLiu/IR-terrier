    <textblock>
      As part of the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA) commitment, the objectives of the study
      are to characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile and to determine the safety and
      tolerability of diclofenac potassium oral solution in pediatric subjects experiencing mild
      to moderate acute pain.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label study with pediatric subjects, ages 2-12 years, who will be dosed with
      diclofenac potassium oral solution, based on weight, every 6 hours as needed for the
      treatment of mild to moderate acute pain for up to 4 days. PK samples will be collected
      through 6 hours after the first dose. Safety data will be collected throughout the study.

    <measure>To characterize the PK profile of diclofenac potassium oral solution, with weight-based dosing, in pediatric subjects, ages 2-12 years experiencing mild to moderate acute pain.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 hours</time_frame>
    <description>PK parameters to be estimated are:
Cmax
tmax
λz: elimination rate constant associated with the terminal (log linear) portion of the curve
t1/2
AUC0 t: AUC from time of dose to last quantifiable sample collected before the second dose is given
AUC0 ∞: AUC from time of dosing (Time 0) extrapolated to infinity (∞)
CL/F: apparent clearance determined using Dose/AUC0 ∞
Vz/F: apparent volume of distribution calculated using apparent CLdivided by λz</description>
