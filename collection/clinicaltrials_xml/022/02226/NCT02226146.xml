    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, proof-of-concept, single group study in adult patients with newly
      diagnosed, moderate to extensive BP.

      The study will consist of three periods: a screening period of up to 2 weeks, an open-label
      treatment period lasting 4 weeks consisting of IV infusion of bertilimumab on Days 0 and 14
      and 28, and a safety and efficacy follow-up period of approximately 13 weeks.

      Patients will receive concomitant oral steroids during the treatment and follow-up period.

      This is an open-label, proof-of-concept, single group study in adult patients with newly
      diagnosed, moderate to extensive BP.

      The study will consist of three periods: a screening period of up to 2 weeks, an open-label
      treatment period lasting 4 weeks consisting of IV infusion of bertilimumab on Days 0 and 14
      and Day 28, and a safety and efficacy follow-up period of approximately 13 weeks.

      Patients will receive concomitant oral steroids during the treatment and follow-up period.
      They will start on 30 mg prednisone daily (or equivalent). The initial dose will be
      maintained for at least 1 week, commencing on Day 0, until blister formation has ceased,
      crusts and erosions have disappeared and reepithelialization of lesions has started. The
      corticosteroid dose will then be reduced to 20 mg daily for 5 to 14 days. According to
      clinical response, this will be followed by corticosteroid dose reduction in 5 mg steps
      every 5 to 14 days until a dose of 10 mg daily is reached and then corticosteroid dose
      reduction in 2.5 mg steps every 5 to 14 days until the end of the study.

             opinion of the investigator, has not been adequately treated or controlled and that
             represents a reactivation risk. If in the investigator's opinion the patient is at
             risk for latent TB, the patient should be evaluated for active/latent TB as
             applicable (e.g. PPD, QFT, and/or chest x-ray).
