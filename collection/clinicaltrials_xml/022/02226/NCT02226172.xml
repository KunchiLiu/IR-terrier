    <textblock>
      A lead-in cohort of ~20 patients with primary or secondary myelofibrosis previously treated
      with 1 or more Janus kinase inhibitors enrolled to single-agent glasdegib to evaluate safety
      and tolerability. Following the lead-in, a phase 2, double blind, 2-arm study, randomized
      2:1 to oral single-agent glasdegib versus placebo in 201 patients resistant or intolerant to
      ruxolitinib.

             requiring a severity score of at least 5 on one symptom, or a severity score of ≥ 3
             on at least two of the symptoms (on a 0 to 10 scale).

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0, 1, 2, or 3.

                  platelet transfusions;

               3. Serum creatinine &lt;1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) or estimated creatinine
                  clearance 60 mL/min (as calculated using the standard method of the
                  institution);

                  hematopoiesis, as manifested by any degree of hepatomegaly).

               6. Total bilirubin values &lt;1.5 x ULN unless the bilirubin is principally
                  unconjugated (in the context of hemolysis) or there is documented Gilbert's
                  disease.
