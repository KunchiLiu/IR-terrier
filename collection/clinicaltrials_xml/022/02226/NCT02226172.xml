    <textblock>
      A lead-in cohort of ~20 patients with primary or secondary myelofibrosis previously treated
      with 1 or more Janus kinase inhibitors enrolled to single-agent glasdegib to evaluate safety
      and tolerability. Following the lead-in, a phase 2, double blind, 2-arm study, randomized
      2:1 to oral single-agent glasdegib versus placebo in 201 patients resistant or intolerant to
      ruxolitinib.

             on at least two of the symptoms (on a 0 to 10 scale).

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0, 1, 2, or 3.
