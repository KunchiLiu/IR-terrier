    <textblock>
      This research study tests whether GLYX-13 - an experimental drug that acts on a brain
      receptor called NMDA - can decrease symptoms of OCD within hours. This is not a treatment
      study. Results from this study will allow doctors and researchers to better understand if
      you and others with OCD may respond to a class of medications that target the NMDA brain
      receptor.
