  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall clinical assessment of the haemostatic efficacy of Octafibrin in treating the first documented bleeding episode of each patient</measure>
    <time_frame>24 hrs after last infusion for each bleeding episode</time_frame>
    <description>The first bleeding episode covers the time period from the first Octafibrin infusion until 24 hours (i.e., 1 day) after the last infusion.
The investigator's overall clinical assessment of haemostatic efficacy for bleeding will be based on a 4 point haemostatic efficacy scale. The final efficacy assessment of each patient will be adjudicated by the Independent Data Monitoring &amp; Endpoint Adjudication Committee (IDMEAC). The number of subjects per outcome category will be assessed in the final analysis.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall clinical assessment of the haemostatic efficacy of Octafibrin used during and after surgery</measure>
    <time_frame>end of surgery and 1 hour after last post-op infusion</time_frame>
    <description>An overall efficacy assessment taking both the intra- and post-operative assessment into account will be adjudicated by the IDMEAC. The location, severity and type of surgery will be documented. Expected and actual duration of surgical procedure and details of administered dose(s) of Octafibrin (pre-, intra- and/or post-operatively) will be recorded. Fibrinogen plasma levels (pre-, intra-, and post-operatively) will be measured. Details of concomitantly administered products (except standard anaesthesia) along with a brief narrative describing the outcome of the intervention will be recorded.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Aged ≥12 years

          -  Documented diagnosis of congenital fibrinogen deficiency, expected to require
             on-demand treatment for bleeding or surgical prophylaxis:

          -  Fibrinogen deficiency manifested as afibrinogenaemia or severe hypofibrinogenaemia.

          -  Historical plasma fibrinogen activity of &lt;50 mg/dL or levels below the limit of
             detection of the local assay method.

          -  Having an acute bleeding episode (spontaneous or after trauma) or planning to undergo
             elective surgery.

          -  Informed consent signed by the subject or legal guardian.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Life expectancy &lt;6 months.

          -  Bleeding disorder other than congenital fibrinogen deficiency, including
             dysfibrinogenaemia.

          -  Prophylactic treatment with a fibrinogen concentrate.

        Treatment with:

          -  Any fibrinogen concentrate or other fibrinogen-containing blood product within 2
             weeks prior to start of treatment for the bleeding episode or surgery.

          -  Any coagulation-active drug (i.e., non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, warfarin,
             coumarin derivatives, platelet aggregation inhibitors) within 1 week prior to start
             of treatment for the bleeding episode or surgery, or as a planned or expected
             medication during the time period from Day 1 until 24 hours (i.e., 1 day) after the
             last Octafibrin infusion.

        Presence or history of:

          -  Hypersensitivity to study medication.

          -  Deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism within 1 year prior to start of treatment
             for the bleeding episode or surgery.

          -  Arterial thrombosis within 1 year prior to start of treatment for the bleeding
             episode or surgery

          -  Hypersensitivity to human plasma proteins.

          -  Oesophageal varicose bleeding.

          -  Polytrauma 1 year prior to start of treatment for the bleeding episode or surgery.

          -  Diagnosis or suspicion of a neutralizing anti-fibrinogen inhibitor currently or any
             time in the past.

          -  Acute or chronic medical condition which may, in the opinion of investigator, affect
             the conduct of the study, including

          -  Subjects receiving immune-modulating drugs (other than anti-retroviral chemotherapy)
             such as alpha-interferon, prednisone (equivalent to &gt;10 mg/day), or similar drugs at
             study start.

          -  Subjects having evidence or a history (within the previous 12 months) of abuse of any
             licit or illicit drug substance.
