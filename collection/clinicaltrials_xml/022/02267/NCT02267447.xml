      The purpose of this study is to develop, evaluate, and apply a predictive algorithm for
      assessing CVD risk in the community setting: the Cardiovascular Disease Population Risk Tool
      (CVDPoRT).

    <textblock>
      This observational study will use the Ontario sample of the Canadian Community Health Survey
      (2001, 2003, 2005; 77,251 respondents) to assess risk factors - focusing on health
      behaviours (physical activity, diet, smoking, and alcohol use). Incident CVD outcomes will
      be assessed through linkage to administrative healthcare databases (619,886 person-years of
      follow-up until 31 December 2011). Socio-demographic factors (age, sex, immigrant status,
      education) and mediating factors such as presence of diabetes and hypertension will be
      included as predictors. Risk prediction models will be developed using competing risks
      survival analysis. The analysis plan adheres to published recommendations for the
      development of valid risk prediction models to limit the risk of over-fitting and improve
      the quality of predictions. Key considerations are fully pre-specifying the predictor
      variables; appropriate handling of missing data; use of flexible functions for continuous
      predictors; and avoiding data-driven variable selection procedures that increase the risk of
      type I error. The 2007 and 2009 surveys (approximately 50,000 respondents) will be used for
      validation. Calibration will be assessed overall and in predefined subgroups of importance
      to clinicians and policymakers.
