      weeks in the treatment of patients with soft tissue sarcoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single arm study of GPX-150 in patients with soft tissue sarcoma.
      Approximately 22 patients will be treated in this study. The population for this study is
      adult patients with histologically proven advanced and/or metastatic malignant soft tissue
      sarcoma of intermediate or high histologic grade.

      All patients who meet all entry criteria will receive GPX-150 at a starting dose of 265
      mg/m2 every 21 days for 16 cycles or until death, disease progression, or unacceptable
      toxicity or subject withdrawal.

      Prior to initiation of treatment, subjects will undergo screening and baseline evaluations.
      During all study visits, subjects will be evaluated for safety. The dose of GPX-150 may be
      reduced when subjects meet specified dose reduction safety criteria. Subjects will be
      evaluated regularly for safety and tolerability. Tumor measurements will be calculated at
      baseline (within 28 days prior to treatment initiation), then at regular intervals while
      receiving treatment for up to 1 year. After discontinuing the treatment phase of the study,
      safety assessments and tumor measurements will be performed 3 weeks after the last dose of
      study drug.
