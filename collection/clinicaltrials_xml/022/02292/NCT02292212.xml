    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to obtain performance data on the Asahi ViE-21 dialyzer (ViE-21)
      .
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to evaluate specific parameters related to ViE-21 performance
      including (A) Performance evaluated by uremic solute removal rates of urea, creatinine, ALB
      and B2-MG, (B) Determination of KUF, (C) Biocompatibility evaluated by WBC, PLT and C3a
      measurements, (D) Type and number of AEs, (E) Type and number of device malfunctions.

      Prospective, open-label, non-randomized, single-armed, controlled study. Each patient shall
      have data collected for six dialysis sessions each on a control dialyzer prior to and after
      36 sessions with the ViE-21. These data shall be the basis of comparison for the ViE-21
      performance.

      These data will be utilized in support of a US Regulatory Submission.

      Note:

      ALB: albumin, B2-MG: beta-2-microglobulin, KUF: coefficient of ultrafiltration, WBC: white
      blood cell, PLT: platelet, C3a: activated complement 3, AE: adverse event
