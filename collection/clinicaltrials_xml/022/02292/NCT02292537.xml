      The primary objective of this study is to examine the clinical efficacy of nusinersen (ISIS
      396443) administered intrathecally to participants with later-onset Spinal Muscular Atrophy
      (SMA). The secondary objective is to examine the safety and tolerability of nusinersen
      administered intrathecally to participants with later-onset SMA.

        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Parent or guardian has signed informed consent and, if indicated per participant's
             age and institutional guidelines, participant has signed informed assent

          -  Be medically diagnosed with Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA)

          -  Have onset of clinical signs and symptoms consistent with SMA at greater than 6
             months of age

          -  Be able to sit independently, but has never had the ability to walk independently

          -  Have Motor Function Score (Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale - Expanded) greater
             than or equal to 10 and less than or equal to 54 at Screening

          -  Be able to complete all study procedures, measurements and visits and parent or
             guardian and subject has adequately supportive psychosocial circumstances, in the
             opinion of the Investigator

          -  Have an estimated life expectancy of greater than 2 years from Screening, in the
             opinion of the Investigator

          -  Meet age-appropriate institutional criteria for use of anesthesia and sedation, if
             use is planned for study procedures

          -  For subjects who have reached reproductive maturity, satisfy study contraceptive
             requirements

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Respiratory insufficiency, defined by the medical necessity for invasive or
             non-invasive ventilation for greater than 6 hours during a 24 hour period, at
             Screening

          -  Medical necessity for a gastric feeding tube, where the majority of feeds are given
             by this route, as assessed by the Site Investigator

          -  Severe contractures or severe scoliosis evident on X-ray examination at Screening

          -  Hospitalization for surgery (i.e., scoliosis surgery, other surgery), pulmonary
             event, or nutritional support within 2 months of Screening or planned during the
             duration of the study

          -  Presence of an untreated or inadequately treated active infection requiring systemic
             antiviral or antimicrobial therapy at any time during the screening period

          -  History of brain or spinal cord disease, including tumors, or abnormalities by MRI or
             CT that would interfere with the LP procedures or CSF circulation

          -  Presence of an implanted shunt for the drainage of CSF or an implanted CNS catheter

          -  History of bacterial meningitis

          -  Dosing with IONIS-SMN Rx in any previous clinical study

          -  Prior injury (e.g., upper or lower limb fracture) or surgical procedure which impacts
             the subject's ability to perform any of the outcome measure testing required in the
             protocol and from which the subject has not fully recovered or achieved a stable
             baseline

          -  Clinically significant abnormalities in hematology or clinical chemistry parameters
             or ECG, as assessed by the Site Investigator, at the Screening visit that would
             render the subject unsuitable for inclusion

          -  Treatment with another investigational drug (e.g., oral albuterol or salbutamol,
             riluzole, carnitine, creatine, sodium phenylbutyrate, et.c), biological agent, or
             device within 1-month of Screening or 5 half-lives of study agent, whichever is
             longer. Treatment with valproate or hydroxyurea within 3-months of Screening. Any
             history of gene therapy, antisense oligonucleotide therapy, or cell transplantation.

          -  Ongoing medical condition that according to the Site Investigator would interfere
             with the conduct and assessments of the study. Examples are medical disability (e.g.,
             wasting or cachexia, severe anemia, etc.) that would interfere with the assessment of
             safety or would compromise the ability of the subject to undergo study procedures.

        NOTE: Other protocol defined Inclusion/Exclusion criteria may apply.
