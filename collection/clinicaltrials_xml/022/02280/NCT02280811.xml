      Background:

      The NCI Surgery Branch has developed an experimental therapy for treating patients with
      cancer that involves taking white blood cells from the patient, growing them in the
      laboratory in large numbers, genetically modifying these specific cells with a type of virus
      (retrovirus) to attack only the tumor cells, and then giving the cells back to the patient.
      This type of therapy is called gene transfer. Researchers want to test this on human
      papilloma virus (HPV)-associated cancers.

      Objective:

      - The purpose of this study is to determine a safe number of these cells to infuse and to
      see if these particular tumor-fighting cells (Anti-HPV E6) can shrink tumors associated with
      HPV and test the toxicity of this treatment.

      Eligibility:

      - Adults age 18-66 with an HPV-16-associated cancer.

      Design:

        -  Work up stage: Patients will be seen as an outpatient at the NIH clinical Center and
           undergo a history and physical examination, scans, x-rays, lab tests, and other tests
           as needed

        -  Leukapheresis: If the patients meet all of the requirements for the study they will
           undergo leukapheresis to obtain white blood cells to make the anti HPV E6 cells.
           {Leukapheresis is a common procedure, which removes only the white blood cells from the
           patient.}

        -  Treatment: Once their cells have grown, the patients will be admitted to the hospital
           for the conditioning chemotherapy, the anti HPV E6 cells and aldesleukin. They will
           stay in the hospital for about 4 weeks for the treatment.

      Follow up: Patients will return to the clinic for a physical exam, review of side effects,
      lab tests, and scans about every 1-3 months for the first year, and then every 6 months to 1
      year as long as their tumors are shrinking. Follow up visits take up to 2 days.

      BACKGROUND:

        -  Metastatic or refractory/recurrent human papillomavirus (HPV)-16+ cancers (cervical,
           vulvar, vaginal, penile, anal, and oropharyngeal cancers) are incurable and poorly
           palliated by standard therapies.

        -  HPV-16+ cancers constitutively express the HPV-16 E6 oncoprotein, which is absent from
           healthy human tissues.

        -  Administration of T cell receptor (TCR) gene engineered T cells can induce objective
           tumor responses in certain malignancies.

        -  T cells genetically engineered with a TCR targeting HPV-16 E6 (E6 TCR) display specific
           reactivity against HLA-A2+, HPV-16+ target cells.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary Objective

        -  To determine a safe dose of administration of autologous T cells transduced with an
           anti-HPV-16 E6 TCR and aldesleukin to patients following a nonmyeloablative but
           lymphodepleting preparative regimen.

        -  To determine the objective tumor response rate (Complete or Partial Response) and
           duration in patients with metastatic or recurrent/refractory HPV-16+ cancers treated
           with this regimen.

      ELIGIBILITY:

        -  Patients greater than or equal to 18 years old and less than or equal to 70 years old
           with metastatic or refractory/recurrent HPV-16+ cancer.

        -  Prior first line systemic therapy is required unless the patient declines standard
           treatment.

        -  Patients must be HLA-A 02:01-positive.

      DESIGN:

        -  Patients will receive a non-myeloablative lymphocyte-depleting preparative regimen of
           cyclophosphamide and fludarabine

        -  On day 0 patients will receive transduced lymphocytes and then begin high dose
           aldesleukin

        -  The study will begin with a phase I dose escalation. After the MTD cell dose has been
           determined, the patients will be enrolled into the phase II portion of the study.

        -  Clinical and immunologic response will be evaluated about 4 to 6 weeks after treatment
           and then about every 1-6 months until disease progression

        -  Following a dose escalation phase of 9 to 18 patients, initially 21 evaluable patients
           will be enrolled in the phase II portion of the study. If 0 to 1 of the 21 patients
           experiences a clinical response, then no further patients will be enrolled. If 2 or
           more of the first 21 evaluable patients enrolled have a clinical response, then accrual
           will continue until a total of 41 evaluable patients have been enrolled. The accrual
           ceiling will be set at 61 patients. Provided that about 1 patient every 6 weeks will be
           enrolled onto this trial, approximately 4 years may be needed to accrue the maximum
           number of patients.

        -INCLUSION CRITERIA

          1. Measurable metastatic or refractory/recurrent HPV-16+ cancer (determined by in situ
             hybridization (ISH) or a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based test).

          2. Patients must be HLA-A 02:01-positive.

          3. All patients must have received prior first line standard therapy or declined

          4. Patients with 3 or fewer brain metastases that are less than 1 cm in diameter and
             asymptomatic are eligible. Lesions that have been treated with stereotactic
             radiosurgery must be clinically stable for 1 month after treatment for the patient to
             be eligible. Patients with surgically resected brain metastases are eligible.

          5. Greater than or equal to 18 years of age and less than or equal to 70 years of age.

          6. Able to understand and sign the Informed Consent Document.

          7. Willing to sign durable power of attorney

          8. Clinical performance status of ECOG 0 or 1.

          9. Life expectancy of greater than 3 months.

         10. Patients of both genders must be willing to practice birth control from the time of
             enrollment on this study up to 4 months after treatment. Patients must be willing to
             undergo testing for HPV-16 prior to becoming pregnant.

         11. Women of child bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test because of the
             potentially dangerous effects of the treatment on the fetus.

         12. Serology:

               -  Seronegative for HIV antibody. (The experimental treatment being evaluated in
                  this protocol depends on an intact immune system. Patients who are HIV
                  seropositive can have decreased immune-competence and thus are less responsive
                  to the experimental treatment and more susceptible to its toxicities.)

               -  Seronegative for hepatitis B antigen, and seronegative for hepatitis C antibody.
                  If hepatitis C antibody test is positive, then the patient must be tested for
                  the presence of antigen by RT-PCR and be HCV RNA negative.

         13. Hematology:

               -  Absolute neutrophil count greater than 1000/mm3 without the support of
                  filgrastim.

               -  Total bilirubin less than or equal to to 1.5 mg/dL, except in patients with
                  Gilbert s Syndrome who must have a total bilirubin less than 3.0 mg/dL

         15. More than 4 weeks must have elapsed since any prior systemic therapy at the time the
             patient receives the preparative regimen.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. Women of childbearing potential who are pregnant or breastfeeding. There are
             potentially dangerous side effects of the treatment on the fetus or infant.

             coagulation disorders or other active major medical illnesses of the cardiovascular,
             respiratory or immune system, as evidenced by a positive stress thallium or
             comparable test, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrhythmias, obstructive or
             restrictive pulmonary disease.

          3. Any form of primary immunodeficiency (such as Severe Combined Immunodeficiency
             Disease).

          4. Concurrent opportunistic infections (The experimental treatment being evaluated in
             this protocol depends on an intact immune system. Patients who have decreased immune
             competence may be less responsive to the experimental treatment and more susceptible
             to its toxicities).

          5. Concurrent systemic steroid therapy.

          6. History of severe immediate hypersensitivity reaction to cyclophosphamide or
             fludarabine.

          7. History of coronary revascularization or ischemic symptoms.
