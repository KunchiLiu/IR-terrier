    <textblock>
      The goals of this study are to study MMFS-202-302 in a double blind, randomized,
      placebo-controlled 9-week study of its effect on ameliorating cognitive deficits in 60
      patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder with stable levels of positive
      symptoms. Secondary end points will include changes in positive and negative symptoms. One
      dose of MMFS-202-302 will be studied and compared with placebo as adjunctive treatment to
      atypical antipsychotic drug treatment.

  <detailed_description>

      One of the symptoms of schizophrenia is a problem with specific domains of cognition, even
      when the positive symptoms have been treated. The primary goal of this study is to determine
      the effectiveness of MMFS-202-302 as augmentation of atypical antipsychotic medication, to
      improve specific domains of cognitive function, e.g. attention, executive function,
      declarative memory, etc in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.

      The investigators will also examine the effect of MMFS-202-302 on negative symptoms of
      schizophrenia, positive symptoms of schizophrenia, and working memory as measured by a
      neuroimaging paradigm.

    <description>The primary outcome measure will be a time x group effect on one or more subscales of the MATRICS Cognitive Consensus Battery (MCCB). The MCCB consists of 9 cognitive tests covering seven domains. This will be augmented by additional neuropsychological measures of verbal fluency (FAS Phonemic Fluency), working memory (Brown-Peterson's Auditory Consonant Trigrams) and executive function (the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test).</description>

Specifically, investigation in whether improvement from baseline task performance occurs for the MMFS-202-302 + APD group, and if this improvement is associated with increases in WM-related brain region activation (DLPFC &amp; PPC).</description>
