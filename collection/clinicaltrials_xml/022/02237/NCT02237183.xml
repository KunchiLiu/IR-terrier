      This randomized phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of iloprost compared
      with a placebo in preventing lung cancer in former smokers. Chemoprevention is the use of
      drugs to keep cancer from forming or coming back. Inhaled iloprost may help prevent lung
      cancer from forming in patients who used to smoke and who have been found to have abnormal
      cells in their mucus.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the toxicity of inhalational iloprost or placebo administered to cohorts of
      patients daily for 2 months, given four time a day (QID) in Cohort A followed by twice daily
      (BID) in Cohort B.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the compliance with BID or QID dosing regimens. II. To evaluate the effect on
      endobronchial histology. III. To evaluate the effect on serum proteins, including
      adiponectin, C1Q and collagen domain containing (ADIPOQ), C9, adenosine triphosphate (ATP)
      synthase, hydrogen (H+) transporting, mitochondrial F1 complex, beta polypeptide (ATP5B),
      carbohydrate sulfotransferase 15 (CHST15), sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG),
      heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A2/B1 (HNRNPA2B1), quantitated by a highly
      multiplexed aptamer based analysis measuring approximately 1500 proteins.

      IV. To evaluate the effect on endobronchial brushing and biopsy gene expression of
      peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma), glutathione S-transferase mu
      (GSTmu), carboxylesterase 1 (Ces1), Fos-related antigen 1 (FosL1), cytochrome p4502e1,
      stearoyl coA desaturase 1, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily member 9, transforming
      growth factor beta (TGFbeta), Jun and a 46 gene panel associated with dysplasia persistence,
      using Affymetrix arrays.

      V. To evaluate the improvement in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) as measured
      by arterial blood gas (ABG) (improved ventilation perfusion matching), pulmonary function
      testing, 6 minute walk distance, quality of life (St. George's respiratory questionnaire,
      COPD assessment test [CAT]).

      OUTLINE: Patients are enrolled to Cohort A to completion prior to initiation of Cohort B.

      COHORT A: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive iloprost via inhalation using a nebulizer QID for 60 days.

      ARM II: Patients receive placebo via inhalation using a nebulizer QID for 60 days.

      COHORT B: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM III: Patients receive iloprost via inhalation using a nebulizer BID for 60 days.

      ARM IV: Patients receive placebo via inhalation using a nebulizer BID for 60 days.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30, 60, and 90 days and
      then annually for up to 5 years.

             curatively treated cancers during any time prior to screening is allowed:
             non-melanoma skin cancer, cervical carcinoma in situ, and bladder carcinoma in situ

          -  Participants must not have received either chemotherapy or radiotherapy within the
             previous 6 months; Note: participants receiving long-term adjuvant hormonal therapy
             (such as tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors for breast cancer) are allowed

          -  Women must not be pregnant or breastfeeding; breastfeeding should be discontinued if
             the mother is treated with iloprost

          -  As iloprost inhibits platelet function, patients must not be taking anticoagulants,
             with the exception of aspirin or other non-steroidal antiinflammatory medications
