      Open-label, phase IIa, non-randomized, multicentric study of single-agent OTX015 in
      recurrent GBM (glioblastoma Multiforme) patients after standard front-line therapy failure.

      The first study step (dose escalation) will determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) using
      standard 3+3 dose escalation enrolling 3 patients per OTX015 dose level (DL), with an
      additional 3 patients to be enrolled at the first occurrence of dose-limiting toxicity
      (DLT). MTD assessment will be based on the tolerability observed during the first 28 days of
      treatment.

      The second study step (expansion cohort) will assess OTX015 efficacy as measured by the
      progression-free survival rate at 6 months (PFS-6) in recurrent GBM patients as assessed by
      local investigators and confirmed by an independent central review committee. A two-stage
      design is used in this step to allow for the possibility of stopping the trial early for
      lack of efficacy.

    <description>OTX015 is to be administered per os daily in a fasted state just before breakfast (around 8 a.m. [±2h]), without a rest period. A treatment cycle will be 4-weeks (Day 1= Day 29). Dosing not performed at the same time (±2h) as on other days will be omitted. Patients are to be instructed that if they vomit or omit their dose in that time frame, it is not to be replaced.</description>

          1. Signed informed consent obtained prior to initiation of any study-specific procedures
