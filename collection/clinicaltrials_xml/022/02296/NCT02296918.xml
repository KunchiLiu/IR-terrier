    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients with a diagnosis of intermediate or high risk CLL (or variant immunophenotype),
        SLL, or B-PLL by IWCLL 2008 criteria (48) who have:

          -  Previously received at least one therapy for their disease.

          -  Previously untreated disease and 65 years old OR under 65 years old and or refuse or
             are ineligible for chemoimmunotherapy

        All patients must satisfy one of the following criteria for active disease requiring
        therapy:

          -  Evidence of marrow failure as manifested by the development or worsening of anemia or
             thrombocytopenia

          -  Massive (≥ 6 cm below the costal margin), progressive or symptomatic splenomegaly

          -  Massive nodes (≥ 10 cm) or progressive or symptomatic lymphadenopathy

          -  Constitutional symptoms, which include any of the following:

               -  Unintentional weight loss of 10% or more within 6 months

               -  Significant fatigue limiting activity

               -  Fevers ≥100.5 degrees F for 2 weeks or more without evidence of infection

               -  Night sweats &gt;1 month without evidence of infection

          -  Patients with a history of Richter's transformation are eligible if they now have
             evidence of CLL only, with &lt;10% large cells in the bone marrow.

          -  ECOG performance status ≤ 2

          -  Life expectancy of &lt; 2 years or that would confound assessment of toxicity in this
             study

          -  Must be ≥ 18 years of age

          -  Subject must have completed all CLL therapies ≥ 4 weeks prior to first study dose.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any life-threatening illness, medical condition, or organ dysfunction which, in the
             investigator's opinion, could compromise the patients' safety, interfere with the
             absorption or metabolism of acalabrutinib, or put the study outcomes at undue risk.

          -  Female subjects who are pregnant or breastfeeding.

          -  Subjects with active cardiovascular disease not medically controlled or those who
             have had myocardial infarction in the past 6 months.

          -  Malabsorption syndrome, disease significantly affecting gastrointestinal function, or
             resection of the stomach or small bowel or ulcerative colitis, symptomatic
             inflammatory bowel disease, or partial or complete bowel obstruction

          -  Major surgery within 4 weeks before first dose of study drug.

          -  History of stroke or intracranial hemorrhage within 6 months before the first dose of
             study drug.

          -  Subjects with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or active infection with hepatitis C
             virus (HCV) or hepatitis B virus (HBV) or any uncontrolled active systemic infection

          -  Requires treatment with long-acting proton pump inhibitors (eg, omeprazole,
             esomeprazole, lansoprazole, dexlansoprazole, rabeprazole, or pantoprazole)
