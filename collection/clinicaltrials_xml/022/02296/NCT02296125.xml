      This is a Phase III, double-blind, randomised study assessing the efficacy and safety of
      AZD9291 (80 mg orally, once daily) versus a standard of care (SoC) Epidermal Growth Factor
      Receptor (EGFR) Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (TKI) (either gefitinib [250 mg orally, once
      daily] or erlotinib [150 mg orally, once daily]) in patients with locally advanced or
      metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) that is known to be EGFR sensitising mutation
      (EGFRm) positive, treatment-naïve and eligible for first-line treatment with an EGFR-TKI.

          6. Any of the following cardiac criteria:

               -  Mean resting corrected QT interval (QTc) &gt;470 msec, obtained from 3 ECGs, using
                  the screening clinic ECG machine-derived QTcF value.

               -  Any clinically important abnormalities in rhythm, conduction, or morphology of
                  resting ECG.

               -  Any factors that increase the risk of QTc prolongation or risk of arrhythmic
                  events or unexplained sudden death under 40 years of age in first-degree
                  relatives or any concomitant medication known to prolong the QT interval.

          7. Past medical history of ILD, drug-induced ILD, radiation pneumonitis which required
             steroid treatment, or any evidence of clinically active ILD.
