      The purpose of the study is to determine if the administration of liposomal bupivacaine at
      the completion of a suburethral sling procedure will result in decreased postoperative pain
      compared to no injection. The hypothesis is that administration of liposomal bupivacaine at
      the completion of retropubic suburethral sling procedure will result in decreased
      postoperative pain compared to no injection. Although multiple routes for sling placement
      exist, no difference in pain has been found when comparing obturator verses retropubic
      suburethral sling. Previous trials have investigated varying formulations of injections
      along the sling pathway in order to reduce complications such as pain and voiding
      dysfunction. Local anesthesia along the trocar pathway has shown some improvements in pain.
      Other techniques, however, have varying results. In 2011, the FDA approved liposomal
      bupivacaine as a single dose wound infiltration for treatment of postoperative pain
      following hemorrhoidectomy and bunionectomy. Initial studies demonstrated decreased pain
      compared to placebo, prolonged release in a bimodal distribution, and greater sensory than
      motor blockade. Additionally, postoperative benefits such as decreased overall pain,
      decreased opioid use, and increased time to opioid need were observed. Liposomal bupivacaine
      may also have the advantage of reducing hospital stays and decreasing overall hospital
      costs. The side effect profile has similar or improved rates of adverse events compared to
      traditional bupivacaine, a favorable cardiac profile, and no increased risk of poor wound
      healing. With such promise, we aim to evaluate the use of liposomal bupivacaine to reduce
      postoperative pain for the placement of slings to treat stress urinary incontinence. The
      study will be a blinded randomized controlled trial. Patients randomized to receive
      liposomal bupivicaine, the standard 20ml vial will be diluted with 1 Oml of saline to a
      reconstituted volume of 30 ml. Those in the control group will receive 30ml of normal saline
      injected in the same fashion as the study arm.

    <description>The placement of the retropublic sling will be placed in routine fashion under general anesthesia. If randomized to liposomal bupivacaine, the standard 20 milliliter (ml) vial (266mg dose) will be diluted with 10ml of preservative-free, sterile normal saline (0.9%) for injection to a reconstituted volume of 30ml. At the completion of the procedure, and at least 20 minutes after the injection of 30ml lidocaine with epinephrine (routine for the surgical procedure), those subjects in the liposomal bupivacaine arm will have the 30ml dilutional volume injected. 10ml will be injected into the vaginal epithelium in the mid-urethral area and 10ml will be injected into each of the trocar paths through the suprapubic incisions bilaterally. An aspiration and moving needle technique will be employed.</description>
