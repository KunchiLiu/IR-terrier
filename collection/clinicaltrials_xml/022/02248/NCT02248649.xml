      This project is investigating whether a home-based exercise program will reduce cognitive
      decline in patients with Parkinson's disease.

      Background/Rationale:

      Progressive cognitive impairment leading to dementia is an important component of
      Parkinson's disease (PD), contributing to significant levels of disability. The number of
      Veterans who will develop PD and, in turn, the number of Veterans with PD who develop
      dementia is likely to increase substantially. Given the profound negative health and social
      consequences associated with the development of dementia, it is critical to identify
      interventions that effectively slow the decline of cognitive function to prolong the time to
      onset of dementia. Based on the results of prior studies, physical activity is one of the
      few nonpharmacological interventions that holds promise in slowing cognitive decline.

      Objective:

      The investigators hypothesize that a home-based physical activity intervention to promote
      walking will reduce cognitive decline in Veterans with mild cognitive impairment in PD
      (PD-MCI).

      Methods:

      The proposed study is a randomized, controlled trial of a home-based walking intervention,
      evaluating effects on cognitive function. Community-dwelling Veterans with PD-MCI will be
      randomized to a walking intervention or a health education control intervention. Subjects
      will be male and female Veterans with a physician diagnosis of idiopathic, typical PD, with
      at least 2 of 3 cardinal signs of PD, response to dopaminergic medication, and MCI. The
      interventions will last 18 months.
