  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      BioFire Diagnostics, LLC (BioFire) has developed the FilmArray Gastrointestinal (GI) Panel,
      a rapid, easy to use PCR-based in vitro diagnostic test for the identification of 22 common
      microorganisms responsible for infectious gastroenteritis (http://filmarray.com/the-panels/)
      from a stool specimen collected in Cary Blair enteric transport media. The test was made
      available for sale in the US and EU following FDA clearance and CE marking in May, 2014.

      The FilmArray GI Panel offers improvements over conventional laboratory testing which
      include: reduced turnaround time from specimen to result, reduced laboratory labor costs,
      increased sensitivity and specificity relative to current clinical reference methods, and
      larger breadth of organism identification than is available using standard methods. Because
      of these attributes, the results from this test have the potential to enable clinicians to
      more accurately diagnose and treat GI illness in a reduced time frame.

      Collaborators at the University of Utah, Brown University/Lifespan, and BioFire Diagnostics
      have designed a study to evaluate health outcomes of pediatric subjects presenting to
      emergency departments with GI illness before and after establishing the FilmArray GI Panel
      as the standard of care method for stool pathogen analysis. It is hypothesized that the
      rapid (~ 1 hour turnaround time), sensitive, specific, and comprehensive results provided by
      the FilmArray GI Panel will allow clinicians to more rapidly diagnose GI illness, initiate
      appropriate therapy and provide guidance when compared to the pre-implementation period.

    <description>BioFire Diagnostics, LLC (BioFire) has developed a polymerase chain reaction (PCR), high-resolution melting analysis instrument called the FilmArray™ and an associated reagent pouch that together are capable of simultaneously detecting multiple microorganisms in a single sample. The FilmArray™ Gastrointestinal (GI) Panel pouch contains freeze-dried reagents to perform nucleic acid purification and nested, multiplex PCR for the identification of common bacterial, viral, and parasite microorganisms responsible for infectious gastroenteritis. The test was made available for sale in the US and EU following FDA clearance and CE marking in May, 2014</description>
