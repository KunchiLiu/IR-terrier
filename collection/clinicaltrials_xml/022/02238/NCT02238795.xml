  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sepsis-associated Purpura fulminans (SAPF) is a rare life-threatening condition. It is
      characterized by multiple skin lesions which rapidly progress to necrosis and gangrene. SAPF
      is a manifestation of widespread clot formation in small blood vessels which emerges
      secondarily to severe bacterial and viral infections. The clinical presentation of SAPF is
      dominated by symptoms of severe sepsis and multiple organ failure which are further
      aggravated by the massive skin lesions.

      At present, there are no evidence-based guidelines for the medical management of SAPF. With
      numerous therapeutic approaches in use, there are no consistent comparisons of their
      efficacy. Altered role of causal pathogens following the introduction of meningococcal and
      pneumococcal prophylactic vaccines also remains to be investigated.

      The goal of the registry is comprehensive collection and evaluation of information
      concerning the epidemiology, morbidity, therapy and outcome of SAPF.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Purpura fulminans is the clinical manifestation of disseminated thrombosis in dermal and
      systemic microcirculation. This rare disease is frequently associated with multiple organ
      failure and represents a life-threatening condition with mortality exceeding 50 %. In the
      vast proportion of cases, the condition has been shown to emerge secondary to acquired
      Protein C deficiency associated with severe sepsis, mostly of meningococcal or pneumococcal
      origin.

      A consistent therapeutic approach to sepsis-associated Purpura fulminans (SAPF) has not been
      established yet. With exaggerated pro-coagulant activity being confirmed as the key
      pathogenic aspect, several treatment modalities aiming at the balance restoration in the
      coagulation cascade have been considered.

      SAPF causality might have been substantially altered in the wake of widespread meningococcal
      and pneumococcal vaccination. There are neither evidence-based treatment guidelines nor
      comparative evaluation of the efficacy of different therapeutic approaches.

      The present registry aims at a) large-scale data accumulation and comprehensive evaluation
      of the incidence, causality and current treatment strategies of SAPF, b) comparative
      assessment of treatment strategies including or not including protein C supplementation c)
      identification of patient subgroups of particular eligibility for Protein C treatment, as
      judged by established criteria of disease severity assessment, d) feedback of aggregated
      data to registry contributors, thus permitting quality management and standard updates, e)
      dissemination of data evaluation summaries and recommendations for the use of Protein C
      formulations in clinical routine, f) elaboration of a framework for SAPF treatment
      recommendations and guidelines.

      The registry comprises prospective, multicentric open-label data collection on the current
      state of incidence and management of SAPF, regardless of the etiopathogenic background. It
      will include comprehensive records on diagnosis, morbidity and management of SAPF, supplied
      in the form of eCRFs by the participating centers over a period of three years.
