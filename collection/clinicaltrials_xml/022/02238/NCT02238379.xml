  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to investigate the effects of oxytocin on social behavior and
      brain activity using EEG and the event-related potential (ERP) technique. The value of EEG
      is its high temporal specificity, enabling precision in the timing of social behavior to be
      addressed. In order to elicit social responses in the human brain, a variety of social and
      emotional visual stimuli will be presented during EEG recording, namely infant and adult
      faces and houses. Brain responses after intranasal oxytocin will then be compared with
      placebo, to examine the effect of intranasal oxytocin on central nervous system activity. We
      hypothesize that intranasal oxytocin will enhance the neural response to social stimuli
      (infant and adult faces) but not to non-social stimuli (houses).

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Amplitude Social</measure>
    <time_frame>Duration of 30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will analyze the amplitude (i.e., size) of visually elicited event-related potential (ERP) components to the social stimuli (infant and adult faces). This assessment will be completed after administration of the intervention (oxytocin) and the placebo to compare the neural response. The investigators hypothesize that the intervention will modulate the amplitude of the neural response to social stimuli given its previously identified role in social interactions, most likely increasing the size of the ERPs.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Amplitude Non-Social</measure>
    <time_frame>Duration of 30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators analyze the amplitude (i.e., size) of visually elicited event-related potential (ERP) components to the non-social stimuli (houses). This assessment will be completed after administration of the intervention (oxytocin) and the placebo to compare the neural response. The investigators hypothesize that there will be no difference between the intervention and placebo during the non-social condition on the amplitude of the ERPs.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Latency Social</measure>
    <time_frame>Duration of 30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators analyze the latency (i.e., efficiency of processing) of visually elicited ERP components to the social stimuli (infant and adult faces). This assessment will be completed after administration of the intervention (oxytocin) and the placebo to compare the neural response. The investigators hypothesize that there will be more efficient processing (i.e., earlier latency) of ERPs during the social condition following administration of the intervention relative to the placebo condition.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Latency Non-Social</measure>
    <time_frame>Duration of 30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will analyze the latency (i.e., efficiency of processing) of visually elicited ERP components to the non-social stimuli (houses). This assessment will be completed after administration of the intervention (oxytocin) and the placebo to compare the neural response. The investigators hypothesize that there will be no difference between the intervention and placebo on ERP latency measures in the non-social condition.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Depression</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 20 minutes of study visit commencing</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will assess depression by employing the Beck Depression Inventory (Beck et al., 1961). Specifically addressing whether the level of depression symptomatology in participants and whether this is associated with the neural correlates of social and non-social perception during both intervention and placebo visits. It is not yet known the extent to which variation in depression symptoms are associated with this methodology, although prior research has suggested depression modulates the neural response to social cues. This measure includes a question regarding suicidal ideation and therefore it is acknowledged there may be a safety issue in response to the questionnaire.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Smoking</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 30 minutes of study visit commencing</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will complete a CO breathalyzer and the Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence (Heatherton, Kozlowski, Frecker, &amp; Fagerstrom, 1991) to assess smoking behavior. These measures are included to characterize the sample in respect of substance use.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Anxiety</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 20 minutes of study visit commencing</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will assess anxiety using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (Spielberger et al., 1970). Specifically, it will be explored whether participant anxiety symptoms are associated with the neural correlates of social and non-social perception during both intervention and placebo visits. It is not yet known the extent to which variation in anxiety symptoms are associated with this methodology, although prior research has suggested anxiety modulates the neural response to social cues.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Stress</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 20 minutes of study visit commencing</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will measure current levels of stress by using the Perceived Stress Scale (Cohen et al., 1983). It is not yet known the extent to which variation in perceived stress is associated with this methodology, but it is anticipated stress will be associated with levels of depression and anxiety in the sample.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Early Experience</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 20 minutes of study visit commencing</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will employ the Parental Bonding Instrument (Parker, Tupling, &amp; Brown, 1979) to assess the early relationship experiences participants have with their caregivers. Existing research employing intranasal oxytocin suggests that the quality of early relationships may impact the strength of any modulation of brain or behavior by oxytocin administration and therefore this variable will be included in the analyses in support of this hypothesis.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Substance use</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 30 minutes of study visit commencing</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will employ the ASI Lite (McLellan, Luborsky, Woody, &amp; O'Brien, 1980) to assess for current substance use. This measure is included to characterize the sample in respect of substance use.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Alcohol Use</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 30 minutes of study visit commencing</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will complete an alcohol breathalyzer to characterize the substance use status of the sample.</description>
