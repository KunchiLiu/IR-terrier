      The purpose of this study is to assess the effects of CPX-351 on cardiac repolarization,
      assess plasma drug levels, asses serum copper levels, and assess drug levels in urine.

      Efficacy and Safety will be assessed in all patients enrolled to the study.

      This study is an open-label, single-arm, Phase II, PK and pharmacodynamic (PD) trial of
      CPX-351 in patients with documented acute leukemia (AML or ALL) or MDS (IPSS score ≥ 1.5)
      and suitable for treatment with intensive chemotherapy. Each patient will be screened for
      hepatic impairment. Hepatic impairment will be assessed using the Child-Pugh system and only
      patients with a Child-Pugh score &lt;7 points will be eligible for this study. Patients will
      receive up to two inductions and four consolidation courses. Patients will be monitored for
      safety (early deaths, adverse events, metabolic changes, etc.) and efficacy (response for
      AML, ALL, and MDS) while on the study.
