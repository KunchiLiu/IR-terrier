      In the SAD part of the study the investigational drug will be administered once in a dose
      escalation manner starting from 200 mg in Cohort 1 to 2000 mg in Cohort 6. The study drug
      will be orally taken as capsules. In the MAD part of the study the investigational drug will
      be administrated twice daily for 5 days depending on the half-life of FP-025, as determined
      in the SAD part of the study. Study subjects will be randomized in a 1:3 ratio to either
      placebo or FP-025 in every cohort of the SAD and MAD part of the study.

             assessment of medical history, physical examination, vital signs, electrocardiogram
             (ECG), and the results of the haematology, clinical chemistry, urinalysis, serology,
             and other laboratory tests.

          -  A history of psychiatric diseases, i.e depression and/or anxiety related illness.

          -  Serum creatinine, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT)
             above the upper limit of normal (ULN) at screening.

          -  Hemoglobin, white blood cells (WBC) or platelet count below the lower limit of normal
             (LLN) at screening.

          -  Other laboratory results which are clinically significant abnormal at screening.

          -  Legal incapacity or limited legal capacity at screening.

          -  Employees of the investigator or study centre, as well as first grade family members
