    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-period, complete
      block design cross-over study.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of UMEC/VI 62.5/25 microgram (mcg) on
      EET as measured by the Endurance Shuttle Walk Test (ESWT) compared to placebo. Additionally,
      the effect of UMEC/VI compared to placebo on lung function and lung volumes in COPD patients
      will be characterized.

      Approximately 298 participants will be screened and, assuming 35% of these will not be
      eligible for randomization; approximately 194 participants will be randomized.

      Eligible participants will be randomized 1:1 to one of 2 treatment sequences. In sequence 1
      participants will receive UMEC/VI 62.5/25 mcg in Treatment Period 1 and placebo in Treatment
      Period 2. In sequence 2 participants will receive placebo in Treatment Period 1 and UMEC/VI
      62.5/25 mcg in Treatment Period 2. Treatments will be delivered once-daily via a dry powder
      inhaler (DPI). Each treatment period will be for 12 weeks and will be separated by a wash
      out period of 12-17 days. The total duration of patient participation, including the
      Follow-Up will be approximately 30 weeks. All participants will be provided with albuterol
      for use on an &quot;as needed (prn)&quot; basis throughout the run-in, washout and study treatment
      periods while on investigational product.

             life-threatening illness (e.g. cancer). In addition, any participant who has any
             condition besides COPD that is likely to affect respiratory function or the ability

             glaucoma, urinary retention, prostatic hypertrophy, or bladder neck obstruction
             should only be included if, in the opinion of the study physician, the benefit
             outweighs the risk.

             conducted by a centralized independent cardiologist to assist in evaluation of
             participant eligibility. The Investigator will determine the clinical significance of
             each abnormal ECG finding in relation to the participant's medical history and
             exclude participants who would be at undue risk by participating in the trial.
             Participants with the following abnormalities are excluded from participation in the
             study: Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate &gt;120 beats per minute (bpm);
