  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Purpose:

      The objective of this study is to determine the effect different sources and forms of
      discretionary foods have on stress perception in healthy adults in a free living, real world
      setting.

      Rationale:

      The rationale for conducting this study is to test the effects of sugar-sweetened beverages
      and grain-based desserts have on perceived health and stress perception, since the evidence
      for this topic is limited.
