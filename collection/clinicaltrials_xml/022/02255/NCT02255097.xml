    <textblock>
      This is a study of single-agent pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in participants with recurrent
      and/or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) who have progressed on
      platinum-based and cetuximab therapy. The primary study hypothesis is that pembrolizumab
      will provide a clinically meaningful objective response rate (ORR).
