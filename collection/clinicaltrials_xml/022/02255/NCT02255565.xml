      The purpose of this study is to determine whether Quillivant XR is effective in the
      treatment of ADHD in children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the safety and tolerability of low to moderate dose effects of Quillivant XR
      (liquid methylphenidate) and to observe changes in ADHD symptoms and functional outcomes in
      children with ASD and ADHD. The investigators propose to investigate the low to moderate
      dose range of methylphenidate compared with a very low dose with a gradual dose escalation
      schedule because children with ASD have been found to be more sensitive to the adverse
      effects of methylphenidate (especially in medium to high doses) than children without ASD.
