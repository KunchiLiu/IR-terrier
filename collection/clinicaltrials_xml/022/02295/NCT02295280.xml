      To determine if the intravenous administration of Metoclopramide and diphenhydramine in
      combination can effectively treat headaches in pregnant patients in those refractory to
      acetaminophen when compared to codeine

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, controlled study based on prospective collection of data during the
      study subjects' hospital stays, questioning at 30 minutes and 1, 6, and 24 hours after
      administration, and a post-study questionnaire at 24 hours. Subjects who agree to
      participate in the study will have already tried a standard effective dose of acetaminophen
      (650 to 1000mg) without relief and are requesting further medication. Intravenous (IV)
      access will be obtained and administration of 10mg Metoclopramide IV and 25mg
      Diphenhydramine IV drawn up in the same syringe will be given to subjects randomized to
      Group A, while those randomized to Group B (control group) will receive standard treatment
      consisting of a codeine 30mg tablet. Each subject will be asked if they had relief or
      persistence/recurrence of symptoms at 30 minutes, 1 hour and 6 hours after initial receipt
      of study medications. An additional dose of 10 mg IV metoclopramide + 25 mg IV
      diphenhydramine or codeine 30 mg tablets would be given at one hour if the patient did not
      have adequate relief the first time. If headache does not subside or recurs after second
      dose, regular non protocol medicines may be administered upon doctor recommendation.
      Patients will again be asked about headache at 24 hours and asked to complete a
      questionnaire regarding tolerance of medication, any adverse reactions experienced,
      persistence/recurrence of headache after administration of study medication, timing of
      occurrence with regard to administration, requirements of a second dose of study medication
      or other use of headache or nausea medication not included in protocol, satisfaction or
      relief of headache on a Likert scale from 0 to 10 after administration of medication if
      given at 1 hr interval.

      Randomization Subjects will be randomized to GROUP A or GROUP B. An order will be placed to
      the SMHC pharmacy for the respective Group and will send up the medication assigned. The
      pharmacy will know which medications are in Group A and which are in Group B. On the
      pharmacy order sheet, the research team will indicate which group each subject is randomized
      to. The pharmacy will supply the medications and one of the nurses on the 5th floor will
      administer them.
