  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a pilot study designed to compare the safety and cardiovascular effects of 26
      weeks of combination hydralazine/isorsorbide dinitrate therapy with amlodipine therapy in
      patients receiving chronic hemodialysis.

      The investigators hypothesize that treatment of chronic hemodialysis (ESRD) patients with a
      combination of hydralazine/isosorbide dinitrate compared with amlopdipine is safe and that
      it will improve heart function as well blood flow/blood vessel supply.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sixteen patients receiving maintenance hemodialysis will be randomized to 26 weeks of
      therapy with combination hydralazine/isosorbide dinitrate or amlodipine. Study medications
      will be titrated to goal dose during the first 4 weeks and maintained at goal dose (as
      tolerated) between weeks 4-26. A final study visit to assess symptoms after drug
      discontinuation will occur 4 weeks after drug discontinuation.

      Study duration-Maximum of 32 weeks with 26 weeks of active therapy.

      Efficacy Measures -Tissue Doppler echocardiography and myocardial perfusion scanning using
      radioactive NH3 PET will be assessed at weeks 0 and 26.

      Safety Measures-Adverse events rates including inter- and intra-dialytic hypotension,
      hyperkalemia,cardiovascular death and gastrointestinal symptoms will be assessed throughout
      the duration of the study.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in mitral annular E' velocity</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in mitral annular E' velocity will be measured using Tissue Doppler Index (TDI) echocardiography of the left ventricular as a measure of diastolic function and as surrogate measure of left ventricular fibrosis.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in coronary flow reserve (CFR)</measure>
    <time_frame>0 to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in coronary flow reserve (CFR) between 0 and 6 months will be measured using 13NH3 myocardial PET scanning. CFR will be measured in the left ventricular as a surrogate measure of microvascular structure and function. CFR will be calculated as the ratio of absolute myocardial blood flow at stress divided by absolute flow at rest for the entire left ventricle. In the case of flow defects the primary measure of CFR used will be the CFR over flow defect-free portion of the LV.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hypotension</measure>
    <time_frame>0 to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The primary safety endpoint is the incidence of serious hypotension defined as hypotension requiring hospitalization or treatment in an emergency room and not attributable to overt sepsis, acute myocardial infarction, or other cardiovascular event (e.g. aortic dissection).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Tolerability</measure>
    <time_frame>0-6 months</time_frame>
