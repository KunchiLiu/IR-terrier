  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to investigate the impact of different nicotine levels
      in cigarettes among non-daily smokers. This research may help inform the Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) on how best to regulate tobacco products in the future, with the goal
      of improving public health.

      The overall goal of the study is to assess the effects of switching to
      Very-Low-Nicotine-Content cigarettes (VLNCCs) among non-daily, or intermittent smokers
      (ITS). This is a two-arm randomized study with an own-cigarette baseline control. After a
      2-week baseline period smoking their own cigarettes, 455 ITS will be randomized
      (double-blind) for 10 weeks to smoke experimental cigarettes, either: (a) normal nicotine
      content cigarettes (NNCCs; 0.8 mg) or (b) VLNCCs (0.07 mg), each matched to menthol status
      of subjects' preferred brand. ITS are more likely to be African-American (AA) smokers; thus
      AA smokers will be oversampled (to one third of the total sample). Change in cigarette
      consumption is the primary end-point, and biomarkers of smoke exposure and measures of
      smoking intensity are also assessed.
