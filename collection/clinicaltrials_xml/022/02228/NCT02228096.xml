      This is a single arm, open-label, multi-center, phase II study to determine the efficacy and
      safety of an experimental therapy called CTL019 T-cells in pediatric patients with B-cell
      acute lymphoblastic leukemia, who are chemo-refractory, relapsed after allogeneic SCT, or
      are otherwise ineligible for allogeneic stem cell transplant.

          -  Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of
             becoming pregnant and all male participants, unless they are using highly effective
             methods of contraception for a period of 1 year after the CTL019 infusion). Highly
             effective contraception methods include:

               1. Total abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of
                  the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,
                  post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are NOT acceptable methods of
                  contraception);

               2. Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without
                  hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking study
                  treatment. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of
                  the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment;

               3. Male sterilization (at least 6 months prior to screening). For female
                  participants on the study the vasectomized male partner should be the sole
                  partner for that patient;

               4. BOTH of the following forms of contraception must be utilized: i. Use of oral,
                  injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception or other forms of
                  hormonal contraception that have comparable efficacy (failure rate &lt;1%), for
                  example hormone vaginal ring or transdermal hormone contraception; ii. Barrier
                  methods of contraception: Condom or Occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault
                  caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal suppository;

               5. Use of intrauterine devices (IUDs) are excluded due to increased risks of
                  infection and bleeding in this population; f). In case of use of oral
                  contraception, women must be stable on the same pill for a minimum of 3 months
                  before taking study treatment.

               6. Women who are not of reproductive potential (defined as either &lt;11 years of age,
                  Tanner Stage 1, post-menopausal for at least 24 consecutive months (i.e. have
                  had no menses) or have undergone hysterectomy, salpingotomy, and/or bilateral
                  oophorectomy) are eligible without requiring the use of contraception.
                  Acceptable documentation includes written or oral documentation communicated by
                  clinician or clinician's staff of one of the following: a. Demographics show age
                  &lt;11; b. Physical examination indicates Tanner Stage 1; c. Physician
                  report/letter; d. Operative report or other source documentation in the patient
                  record; e. Discharge summary; f. Follicle stimulating hormone measurement
                  elevated into the menopausal range
