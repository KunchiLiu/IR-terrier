      The total duration of study per patient is 7 to 8 months for patients who will enter a
      planned extension study and approximately 13 to 14 months for patients who will not enter a
      planned extension study. A 2-year extension study is planned for eligible patients.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria:

          -  The patient has provided a signed informed consent.

          -  The patient had a confirmed diagnosis of Fabry disease as documented by leukocyte α-
             Galactosidase A (αGAL) activity of &lt;4 nmol/hr/mg leukocyte (preferred assay; results
             from a central laboratory) or plasma αGAL &lt;1.5 nmol/hr/mL (results from a central
             laboratory).

          -  The patient has a plasma globotriaosylsphingosine (lyso-GL3) greater than or equal to
             65 ng/mL.

          -  The patient has never been treated with a Fabry disease-specific treatment.

          -  If the patient is on renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) blockers and
             antidepressants, the dose should be stable (ie, prescribed dose and frequency) for at
             least the immediate 3 months prior to screening.

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  The patient has an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &lt;60 mL/min/1.73 m^2
             using (Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration) CKD-EPI.

          -  The patient has a median urine protein/creatinine ratio (PCR) ≥0.5 g/g (median of 3
             overnight urine collections. Collection of each of the 3 samples must occur between 4
             and 7 days of each other, and all samples must be collected within a 15 day period).
             All 3 samples must be collected regardless of the results and results available prior
             to Day 1.

          -  The patient had undergone a kidney transplant.

             significant cardiovascular, hepatic, pulmonary, hematologic, neurological or renal
             disease, or other medical condition, serious inter-current illness, or extenuating

             in the trial.

          -  The patient has abnormal liver function (serum total bilirubin &gt;the upper limit of
             normal, or serum alanine aminotransferase [ALT] and aspartate aminotransferase [AST]
             &gt;2.0 times the upper limit of normal).

             not excluded.

          -  The patient is currently receiving potentially cataractogenic medications.

          -  The patient has received strong or moderate inducers or inhibitors of Cytochrome P450
             3A4 (CYP3A4) per Food and Drug Administration (FDA) classification within 14 days
             prior to enrolment or within 5 times the elimination half-life or PD half-life of the
             medication, whichever is longer.

          -  The patient is scheduled for in-patient hospitalization, including elective surgery,
             during the study.

          -  The patient has a positive result on any of the following tests: hepatitis B surface
             antigen (HBsAg), anti-hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV) antibodies, anti-human
             immunodeficiency virus 1 and 2 antibodies (anti-HIV1 and anti-HIV2 Ab). Patients with
             a positive hepatitis B surface antibody (HBsAb) test with a history of prior
             hepatitis B immunization are eligible if other criteria are met (ie, negative tests
             for: HBsAg, hepatitis B core antibody [HBcAb], and hepatitis C virus antibody
             [HCVAb]).

          -  The patient has participated in a study involving an investigational drug within the
             past 30 days of the start of the trial.

          -  The patient is unwilling to comply with the requirements of the protocol.

          -  The patient is a sexually active man who is not willing to use 2 forms of birth
             control including a barrier method during the study until 6 weeks after the last
             treatment with IMP.

          -  The patient has history or ongoing clinically significant cardiac arrhythmia, defined
             as either atrial fibrillation, sustained or non-sustained ventricular tachycardia.

          -  The patient has any contraindication to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

          -  The patient has one of the following central nervous system exclusion criteria:

               -  Acute stroke, within 3 months of the screening visit.
