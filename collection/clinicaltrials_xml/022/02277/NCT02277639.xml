  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II trial to determine the ability of a reduced intensity conditioning
      regimen to allow successful engraftment with CD3+ /CD19+ depleted peripheral stem cell
      grafts from mismatched donors. There are two conditioning regimens depending upon patient
      diagnosis and age.

      This study will allow transplantation using a reduced intensity conditioning regimen for
      children with non-malignant diseases who lack a matched related or unrelated donor. Donors
      will be unrelated or partially matched related, depending upon urgency and availability. If
      each parent is haploidentical, the mother will be preferred, as there is evidence of reduced
      transplant related mortality and superior survival with a maternal donor. The risks of
      severe graft vs host disease (GVHD) and Epstein-Barr lymphoproliferative disorder will be
      reduced or eliminated by T and B cell depletion using the Miltenyi Clinimacs device.
      Patients with bone marrow failure syndromes, who are at high risk for rejection, will
      undergo pre-conditioning immune suppression with Thymoglobulin. It is recommended that
      patients with immunedysregulation syndromes receive pre-RIC alemtuzumab as this may reduce
      the risk on non-engraftment and hyperinflammatory states.

      Post-transplant immune suppression will be used to prevent GVHD, as CD3 depletion does not
      deplete as completely as CD34+ selection. It will be rapidly weaned if no GVHD by day 100 to
      allow immune reconstitution.
