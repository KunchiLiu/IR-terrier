      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of a new medicinal drug SYD985 at
      different dose levels in patients with cancer, to understand how SYD985 is handled by the
      body and to evaluate the effect of SYD985 on the cancer.

    <textblock>
      Cancer cells can have different kinds of proteins on their cell surface; one of these is the
      protein HER2. HER2 plays an important role in the development of cancer. High expression of
      HER2 is related to poor prognosis. Although several cancer drugs are available that work via
      the HER2 protein, a substantial portion of these patients still does not benefit from these
      treatments.

      The new cancer drug SYD985 is being developed by Synthon Biopharmaceuticals BV. SYD985 is an
      antibody-drug conjugate and consists of two parts: an antibody and a linker-drug moiety
      containing a toxin. The antibody part binds to HER2 on the surface of the cancer cell. When
      SYD985 binds to this cancer cell, it will be internalized by the cell. After proteolytic
      cleavage of the linker, the toxin will be split off in the cell and the cancer cell will be
      killed. Thus, SYD985 can be considered as a form of targeted chemotherapy.

      This is the first study in which SYD985 is administered to humans. The study consists of two
      parts:

      Part I is the dose-escalation part in which a low dose of SYD985 is given to three cancer
      patients. If it is well tolerated, a higher dose of SYD985 will be given to 3 other cancer
      patients. This will continue until a further dose increase is not safe anymore.

      In Part II of the study, several groups of patients with a specific type of cancer will
      receive the SYD985 dose which has been selected for further evaluation.

      All patients from both parts of the study will receive SYD985 infusions every three weeks
      until progression of the cancer or unacceptable toxicity develops.
