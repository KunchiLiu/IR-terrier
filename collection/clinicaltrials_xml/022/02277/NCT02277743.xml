          2. Chronic AD (according to American Academy of Dermatology Consensus Criteria
             Eichenfield 2014) that has been present for at least 3 years before the screening
             visit

          3. EASI score ≥16 at the screening and baseline visits

          4. IGA score ≥3 (on the 0 to 4 IGA scale, in which 3 is moderate and 4 is severe) at the
             screening and baseline visits

          5. ≥10% body surface area (BSA) of AD involvement at the screening and baseline visits

          6. Documented recent history (within 6 months before the screening visit) of inadequate
             response to treatment with topical medications or for whom topical treatments are
             otherwise medically inadvisable (eg, because of important side effects or safety
             risks

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Participation in a prior dupilumab clinical study

          2. Treatment with an investigational drug within 8 weeks or within 5 half-lives (if
             known), whichever is longer, before the baseline visit

          3. Having used any of the following treatments within 4 weeks before the baseline visit,
             or any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, is likely to require such
             treatment(s) during the first 4 weeks of study treatment:

               -  Immunosuppressive/ immunomodulating drugs (eg, systemic corticosteroids,
                  cyclosporine, mycophenolate-mofetil, IFN-γ, Janus kinase inhibitors,
                  azathioprine, methotrexate, etc.)

               -  Phototherapy for AD

          4. Treatment with topical corticosteroids (TCS) or topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCI)
             within 1 week before the baseline visit

          5. Treatment with biologics as follows:

               -  Any cell-depleting agents including but not limited to rituximab: within 6
                  months before the baseline visit, or until lymphocyte count returns to normal,
                  whichever is longer

               -  Other biologics: within 5 half-lives (if known) or 16 weeks prior to baseline
                  visit, whichever is longer

          6. Regular use (more than 2 visits per week) of a tanning booth/ parlor within 4 weeks
             of the screening visit

          7. Planned or anticipated use of any prohibited medications and procedures during study
             treatment

          9. Active chronic or acute infection requiring treatment with systemic antibiotics,
             antivirals, antiparasitics, antiprotozoals, or antifungals within 2 weeks before the
             baseline visit, or superficial skin infections within 1 week before the baseline
             visit. NOTE: patients may be rescreened after infection resolves

         10. Known or suspected history of immunosuppression, including history of invasive
             opportunistic infections (eg, tuberculosis [TB], histoplasmosis, listeriosis,
             coccidioidomycosis, pneumocystosis, aspergillosis) despite infection resolution: or
             unusually frequent, recurrent, or prolonged infections, per investigator judgment

         11. History of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or positive HIV serology at
             screening

         12. Positive with hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or hepatitis C antibody at the
             screening visit

         13. Patient is a member of the investigational team or his/her immediate family
