  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine communication content and strategies in primary
      care that predict improvement in weight status among overweight school-age children.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will test whether 1) pediatrician-patient communication regarding overweight status,
      behavior/risk-factor counseling, and the frequency and time to next follow-up visit,
      compared with either no communication or incomplete communication (communicating only high
      weight status without behavior/risk-factor counseling or a follow-up visit) will predict
      improvement in weight status at one year follow-up, and 2) during pediatrician-patient
      communication regarding weight and weight management, higher patient-centeredness will
      predict improvement in weight status at one year follow-up. The communication content
      identified will generate new information about the most effective content and style of
      pediatrician-patient communication that predict weight-status improvement. Because we
      prospectively will examine clinical practice elements in the one-year interval between
      well-child visits, acknowledging that communication regarding high weight status may
      initiate assessment of risk factors for heart disease (such as high cholesterol and blood
      sugar), more frequent follow-up visits, or prompt a nutrition referral, we will generate
      novel information about the most effective clinical practices and follow-up interval and
      frequency that predict weight-status improvement in overweight children. We also will
      examine if the content and style of communication are related to improvements in diet and
      lifestyle behaviors at one-year follow-up.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percent overweight</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The percent over the median BMI percentile for age and gender. This measure changes comparably for similar weight changes in overweight and severely-obese children. In contrast, an overweight child would have to lose substantially less weight than a severely-obese child for the same change in BMI z-score.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>BMI z-score</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in BMI z-score of 0.25-0.5 has been associated with reductions in cardiovascular-disease risk factors. Using both percent overweight and BMI z-score measures will allow examination of the relationship between relative weight changes and cardiovascular-disease risk-factor improvement.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the number of &quot;5-2-1-0&quot; behaviors</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The &quot;5-2-1-0&quot; behaviors are: eat five fruits and vegetables, watch &quot;screens&quot; (TV, computer, tablets, video games, cell phones, etcâ€¦) two hours per day or less, be physically active for one hour per day or more, and drink zero calorie-containing beverages per day.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Self-determined regulation of the 5-2-1-0 health behaviors</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Self-determined (versus controlled) regulation of performing the 5-2-1-0 health behaviors, will be determined using the treatment self-regulation questionnaire (Levesque CS, Williams GC, Elliot D, et al. Validating the theoretical structure of the treatment self-regulation questionnaire [TSRQ] across three different health behaviors. Health Education Research 2007;21:691-702 and Williams GC, Freedman ZR, Deci EL. Supporting autonomy to motivate patients with diabetes for glucose control.

  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Suboptimal health status</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Suboptimal health status, defined as poor/fair/good vs. excellent/very good health, will be determined using an item from the National Survey of Children's Health (National Survey of Children's Health. Data resource center for child and adolescent health. http://childhealthdata.org/browse/survey/results?q=219. Accessed October 28, 2014). The PI previously reported that childhood obesity is associated with suboptimal health status, and that suboptimal health status, defined using the survey item proposed here, is associated with greater total and out-of-pocket healthcare expenditures (Turer CB, Lin H, Flores G. Health status, emotional/behavioral problems, healthcare use, and expenditures in overweight/obese US children/adolescents. Academic Pediatrics. 2013;13:251-8).</description>

    <description>Overweight 6-12 year-old children. Weight status will be measured and parents complete surveys at baseline and one year later. Pediatricians will complete surveys at baseline, and after index visit. Visits will be directly video-recorded.
The impact of pediatrician clinical practices and communication strategies on child's weight status will be evaluated at one year. Clinical practices (such as risk-factor screening) that occur during the 1-year interval between well-child visits also will be assessed. Specific clinical practice elements and communication strategies that will be examined include:
Communication regarding child's high weight status
Counseling regarding cardiovascular risk factor screening and assessment
Behavioral counseling
Interval follow-up to readdress weight, and
Patient-centeredness, scored as the ratio of patient to doctor-centered communication regarding weight topics.</description>

    <intervention_name>Patient-centered communication</intervention_name>
    <description>Patient-centered communication will be scored as the ratio of patient to doctor-centered communication regarding weight topics. Means will be calculated for total and weight-communication-specific pediatrician, child, and parent-talk time, and patient, doctor, and the ratio of patient/doctor-centered communication scores. For the primary hypothesis, biomedical information-giving (for example, risk-factor communication) will be treated as patient-centered because the principal investigator's focus groups suggest that parents want this information, and prior research suggests that including biomedical-information giving improves the correlation of Roter's patient-centeredness measure with patient health status and satisfaction scores.</description>

        We will recruit pediatricians (from academic, community, and private practices), children,
        and a consenting parent. Pediatricians and children will be selected to reflect the
        proportions of minority pediatricians and children in the practices. Pediatricians at the
        community and private practices will be eligible to participate if they provide outpatient
        pediatric care â‰¥20 hours/week. At the academic clinic, only second and third-year
        residents will be eligible. Eighty-five children and a consenting parent will be
        recruited.
