      This is a Phase III, open-label, multicenter study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      long-term administration of TAK-536 20 mg, amlodipine (AML) 5 mg, and hydrochlorothiazide
      (HCTZ) 12.5 mg once daily for 52 weeks in patients with essential hypertension that is
      poorly controlled with TAK-536CCB.
