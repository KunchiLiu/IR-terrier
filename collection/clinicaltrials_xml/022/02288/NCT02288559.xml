    <textblock>
      This multicenter, randomized, single-masked, sham injection-controlled study will
      investigate the exposure-response and safety of lampalizumab administered intravitreally
      every 2 weeks (Q2W) or every 4 weeks (Q4W) for 24 weeks in participants with geographic
      atrophy (GA) secondary to age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The anticipated time on
      study treatment is 24 weeks. The target sample size is approximately 90 participants.
