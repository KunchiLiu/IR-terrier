  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to employ genomic detection methodologies to measure the relative
      amount of tumor nucleic acids in the blood of a cancer patient with diagnosed metastatic
      disease that is either commencing, currently undergoing or completed cytotoxic chemotherapy
      treatment. More generally, this approach will allow us to develop a quantitative measure of
      therapy efficacy via the counting of the relative changes in tumor molecules over the course
      of treatment.

        Patients who are (i) commencing (ii) currently undergoing, and /or (iii) have undergone
        cytotoxic chemotherapy or targeted drug therapies (i.e., Taxotere, Cytoxan, Herceptin,
        Leucovorin, Oxaliplatin, Carboplatin, Gemzar) for diagnosed metastatic disease whose
        primary lesion is one of the following solid tumor types: lung, breast, prostate, bladder,
        ovarian, skin and colon. Patients who are commencing or currently undergoing may be
        screened several time during the course of their therapy.
