  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Novartis Meningococcal quadrivalent CRM-197 conjugate vaccine pregnancy registry is
      stablished to meet a post marketing commitment agreed upon with CBER to prospectively
      collect data on pregnancy exposures to Novartis Meningococcal quadrivalent CRM-197 conjugate
      vaccine.

      It is an observational study of women inadvertently immunized with the Novartis
      Meningococcal quadrivalent CRM-197 conjugate vaccine within 28 days prior to conception or
      at any time during pregnancy as part of routine care.

      The objective of the pregnancy registry is to evaluate pregnancy outcomes among women
      immunized with the Meningococcal quadrivalent CRM-197 conjugate vaccine within 28 days prior
      to conception or at any time during pregnancy. The primary outcomes of interest include
      major congenital malformation, preterm birth, and low birth weight. Other pregnancy outcomes
      will be collected, including spontaneous abortions and stillbirths.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Sufficient evidence to confirm that Menveo exposure occurred within 28 days prior to
             conception or at any time during pregnancy

          -  Date the pregnancy exposure is registered

          -  Full reporter (ie, HCP) contact information to allow for follow-up (name, address,
