    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the hypothesis that the investigators current total
      joint regional anesthesia pathway of continuous femoral nerve block plus single-injection
      sciatic block with multimodal analgesia (MC1156-462rev0114) is more effective than two other
      pathways utilizing periarticular local anesthesia injections for numeric rating score (NRS)
      of pain with movement after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) on postoperative day 1 morning.
      The periarticular injections include one consisting of ropivacaine and the other consisting
      of liposomal bupivacaine (Exparel).

    <description>The regional group will receive a continuous femoral nerve block and a single injection sciatic nerve block consisting of the following: Femoral /Sciatic with Bupivacaine.</description>

    <description>The ropivacaine group will receive a total volume of 120 milliliters (mL) injected in the periarticular structures by the surgeon. Following the current, standardized practice for periarticular infiltration, approximately 30 - 40 mL of solution will be injected into the posterior capsule just prior to cementing the implants in place and 40 - 50 mL of solution injected into the medial and lateral retinaculum while the cement is hardening and prior to deflation of the tourniquet. The remaining volume of approximately 40 mL will be injected into the quadriceps tendon and subcutaneous tissue prior to skin closure.</description>
