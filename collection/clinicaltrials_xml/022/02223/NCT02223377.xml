  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently nearly 70% or more surgeries are being done as ambulatory (day care) procedures as
      they offer significant benefit to the patients as well as to the hospitals. Inadequate pain
      relief (30%-40%) and nausea-vomiting form the leading factors affecting the quality of care
      and hence its efficiency. Opioids form the primary modality to treat moderate to severe
      pain, but can also cause significant nausea-vomiting and other side effects. Although
      hydromorphone is five times more potent than morphine, in equianalgesic doses they both
      could provide similar pain relief. They both exert no ceiling effect for their analgesia,
      and hence incomplete or inadequate analgesia is related to the appearance of side effects.
      In this study the investigators shall assess the proportion of patients who satisfy the
      outcome of 'satisfactory analgesia with minimal nausea-vomiting' in ambulatory surgeries,
      assessed at 2 hours after surgery. Patients would be randomized to receive either morphine
      or hydromorphone in the surgical recovery area. All personnel involved with the study would
      be blinded. The investigators will also look to assess the time to discharge and other side
      effects. This will help to choose the better drug, thereby improving pain relief and side
      effects, and also the efficiency of health care delivery.

    <description>Our combined primary outcome will be proportion of patients with SAME, as compared between the 2 groups. Analgesia will be based on Numerical Analogue Scale for Pain 0-10 (appendix 3), and Post-operative nausea and vomiting will be based on Verbal Descriptive Scale 0-5 (appendix 3). These observations will be made at the end of 2 hrs or before (corresponding to the time of discharge from PACU), by the PACU nurse.</description>
