  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this project is to identify the genetic, hormonal, and neurobiological
      influences on paternal nurturing behavior and to determine if fathers' neural responses to
      infants can be modulated by neuropeptides known to play a role in parenting in experimental
      animal models.

      The aim is to determine if pharmacological manipulation of central oxytocin (OT) and
      vasopressin (AVP) levels influences the neural response to viewing pictures of one's own
      infant or to hearing cry stimuli. In a double-blind procedure, fathers with 1-3 year old
      children will be scanned on two separate occasions; once under the influence of OT/AVP and
      once under the influence of placebo. Fathers will be randomized to either OT or AVP, and
      order of administration of drug and placebo will counterbalanced across subjects. Fathers
      will be scanned while viewing pictures of their own and an unknown child and while listening
      to unknown infant cry stimuli.

      The investigators hypothesize:

        -  OT will augment the ventral tegmental area (VTA), ventral striatum and medial
           orbitofrontal cortex (mOFC) response to viewing pictures of one's own child, and will
           augment the primary auditory cortex (AI) response of fathers to infant cries.

        -  AVP will augment the lateral septum response to viewing own child pictures.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      30 fathers of children aged 1-3 will participate in two functional imaging sequence (fMRI)
      sessions, once under the influence of OT/AVP, and once under the influence of placebo.
      Fathers will be restricted to men who are living with their biological child and an adult
      partner (male or female) that they are in a committed relationship with. All fathers will
      receive two fMRI scans on two different occasions, separated by 2-10 days. 15 fathers will
      be randomized to intranasal OT, the other 15 will be randomized to intranasal AVP. Within
      each drug group, the order of administration of drug and placebo will counterbalanced across
      subjects, such that 15 will receive OT/AVP first, and 15 will receive OT/AVP second. During
      the fMRI scans, fathers will view pictures of their own and unknown children, as well as
      unknown adults. Afterwards, while still in the scanner, they will listen to infant cry and
      control stimuli. After exiting the scanner, fathers will again listen to the cry stimuli and
      will rate their emotional reaction to the cry stimuli on the following dimensions using a 7
      point likert scale: irritated, sympathetic, alarmed, angry, upset, compassionate,
      distressed, annoyed, and tender.
