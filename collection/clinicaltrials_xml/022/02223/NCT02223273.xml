      Phase 1: An observational study ( registry) will be conducted with the objective of
      documenting the practice of stroke treatment in brazilian and latin american hospitals.

      Phase 2: A cluster randomized trial aiming to evaluate the effect of a multifaceted strategy
      to increase evidence based treatments usage for stroke patients. The hospitals will be
      randomized into two groups: the multifaceted strategy group and the usual care group.

      Study Objective: The purpose of this study is to evaluate a multifaceted strategy to
      increase evidence based therapies for patients with acute ischemic stroke.

      Study Population; Patients with suspected stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) with
      symptoms lasting up to 24h hours.

      Quality Improvement Multifaceted Intervention: The strategy includes a simulation based team
      training, case manager, check lists, reminders and educational material.
