      This study is designed to:

        1. assess the signs and symptoms of rosacea, including erythema, without treatment and
           during treatment with Mirvaso® gel

        2. further characterize lifestyle impact and patient satisfaction with Mirvaso® treatment

        3. gain a better understanding of the real-world use ofMirvaso® on the pattern and
           management of facial erythema of rosacea.

             isolated rhinophyma, isolated pustulosis of the chin) or other concomitant facial
             dermatoses that are similar to rosacea such as peri-oral dermatitis, demodicidosis,
             facial keratosis pilaris, seborrheic dermatitis, acute lupus erythematosus, or

          7. Subjects with any uncontrolled chronic or serious disease or medical condition that
             would normally prevent participation in a clinical study, or, in the judgment of the
             investigator, would put the subjects at undue risk, or might confound the study
             assessments (e.g., other dermatological diseases), or might interfere with the
             subjects' participation in the study, (e.g., planned hospitalization during the
             study).

          8. Subjects who have received, applied, or taken treatments with drugs, cosmetics or

        to remove beard or facial hair for duration of the study.

        I4. Subjects with non-stable dose of current (last 60 days) use of prescription rosacea
        medications.

        I5. Subjects with uncontrolled rosacea associated with inflammatory pustules and papules.
