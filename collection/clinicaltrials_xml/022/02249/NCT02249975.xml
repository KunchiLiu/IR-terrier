      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and performance of the C2 Focal
      Cryoablation System in patients with BE. The study will involve up to 50 subjects with each
      subject receiving cryoablation therapy of all visible BE using the C2 System Focal Ablation
      System. Length of ablation will be 10 seconds. The ablations will be performed on Barrett's
      epithelium with a maximal length of 6 cm.

      At the time of endoscopic follow up, biopsies of the treated area will be taken and
      submitted for analysis according to Histopathology Protocol.

      This study is:

        -  Prospective

        -  Multi-center

        -  Non-randomized

    <description>The C2 Focal Cryoablation Device will be used for the treatment of islands of BE in real patient care. Ablation at 10 seconds will be tested and post-ablation symptoms related to the Cryoballoon Focal Ablation will be recorded. At 12 weeks, the patient will receive a follow-up endoscopy and biopsy samples will be taken.
Biopsy samples will be evaluated for the presence of residual Barrett's Esophagus. Through evaluation of the histological results, treatment parameters for the ablation of human esophageal epithelium will be better understood.
Evaluations include, but are not limited to the following:
Device malfunctions
Adverse events
Patient Pain
Histological evaluation of treatment zone at 12 weeks for presence of residual Barrett's Esophagus.</description>

        Criteria Inclusion Criteria

          -  Patients with known Barrett's esophagus, with an indication for ablation therapy
             during which the cryoablation may be performed.

          -  Patient is 18 to 80 years of age at the time of consent (inclusive).

          -  Patient has provided written Informed Consent (IC) using an Informed Consent Form
             (ICF) that has been approved by the Institution's reviewing IRB/EC.

          -  Patient is willing and able to comply with all Clinical Investigation Plan (CIP)
             requirements.

          -  Patient is deemed operable per standard institutional criteria.

          -  BE lesion length &lt;6cm excluding visible BE islands, and Prague Classification C ≥ 0 /
             M ≥ 0.

          -  One of the following: Flat LGD, Flat HGD, Residual BE after EMR for visible lesions
             (containing any degree of dysplasia or low-risk early adenocarcinoma (i.e.: not
             poorly differentiated, negative vertical (deep) resection margins, absence of
             (lympho)vascular invasion), Residual BE after a single circumferential RFA (performed
