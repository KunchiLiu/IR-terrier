      The main goal of this study is to determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and the
      Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D) as well as preliminary antitumor activity of PQR309
      administered orally, as once daily capsules continously in patients with relapsed or
      refractory lymphomas.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histologically confirmed diagnosis* of relapsed or refractory lymphoma, received at
             least two prior lines of therapy including immuno-chemotherapy. Patients with
             relapsed Chronic Lymphoid Leukemia (CLL) are eligible if they have received one or
             more prior lines of any approved standard therapy. * archival biopsies may be used if
             obtained up to a year prior to enrollment; re-biopsy is strongly recommended if last
             biopsy was obtained more than a year ago.

          2. Only for patients in the Phase 2 part: At least one measurable nodal or extra-nodal
             lesion defined as follows: Clearly measurable (i.e. well-defined boundaries) in at
             least two perpendicular dimensions on imaging scan with &gt; 1.5 cm in longest
             transverse diameter.

          3. Age ≥ 18 years

          4. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Score of 0-1 (See Appendix 2).

          5. Adequate organ system functions defined as:

               1. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1.0x109/l

               2. Platelets ≥ 75x109/l

               3. Haemoglobin ≥ 85g/L

               4. Adequate hepatic function, defined as Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 times the upper
                  limit of normal (ULN) and Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate
                  aminotransferase (AST) ≤ 2.5 times ULN (or ALT/AST ≤ 5 times ULN in patients
                  with liver involvement)

               5. Adequate renal function, defined as serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 times ULN

               6. Fasting glucose &lt; 7.0 mmol/L; Glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) &lt; 6.4%

          6. Ability and willingness to swallow and retain oral medication.

          7. Willingness and ability to comply with the trial procedures

             Patients with meningeal involvement can be included upon discussion between the
             sponsor and the investigator.

          9. Persisting toxicities NCI CTCAE ≥2 related to prior anticancer therapy

         10. Presence of gastrointestinal disease or any other condition that could interfere
             significantly with the absorption of the study drug.

         11. Severe/unstable angina, myocardial infarction or coronary artery bypass within the
             last 3 years prior to trial treatment start, symptomatic congestive heart failure New

         12. A serious active infection at the time of treatment, or another serious underlying
             medical condition that could impair the ability of the patient to receive treatment.

         13. Lack of appropriate contraceptive measures (male and female)

         14. Pregnant or lactating women
