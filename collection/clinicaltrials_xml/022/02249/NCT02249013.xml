      This is a phase II open label, single arm clinical trial on safety and efficacy exploring an
      short-course regimen of intra-operative Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy (HIPEC) as
      upfront therapy for patients with advanced Epithelial Ovarian Cancer (EOC) undergoing
      Cytoreductive Surgery (CRS).

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of our protocol under the
      hypothesis that it may improve patient survival with low rates of morbidity and mortality.
      In these settings, CRS will be followed by an short-course regimen of intra-operative HIPEC
      as upfront therapy for patients with stage III-IV EOC. Advanced CRS will be performed with
      standard peritonectomy procedures and visceral resections directed towards complete
      elimination of tumors from the abdominopelvic cavity. HIPEC will be performed according to
      the closed-abdomen technique using cisplatin (25 mg/L of perfusate/m2, total limit of 240mg)
      for 30 minutes, with an intra-abdominal target temperature of 41-43°C. Perfusate (2L/m2,
      ranging from 4L to 6L) will be circulated using an extracorporeal circulation device
      (Performer HT; RAND, Medolla, Italy) at a flow rate of 700 ml/min. Systemic chemotherapy
      will include the standard combination of carboplatin and paclitaxel as adjuvant or
      neo-adjuvant plus adjuvant regimens.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients with no previous treatment and candidates for elective surgery with histological
        diagnosis of epithelial ovarian carcinoma; clinical stage IIIB to IV, without suspicion of
        extra-abdominal metastasis; aged between 18 and 70 years; performance status 0-2 (ECOG,
        Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) and / or greater than 70 points by the Karnofsky
        scale; appropriated cardio-respiratory, hepato-renal and hematological reserves; and
        signing of the Consent Form.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Evidence of extensive retroperitoneal lymph node disease; limiting obesity; apparent or
        confirmed uncontrolled infections; limiting comorbidities; other malignancies in activity;
        previous radiation or chemotherapy treatment (except neoadjuvant chemotherapy in the study
        protocol) or major abdominal surgery; neuro-psychiatric disorders; history of drug
        allergies; and pregnancy or breast feeding. Still, it will not be considered for the HIPEC
        protocol those patients with unresectable disease (presence of invasive peritoneal

        hilum, the mesenteric root, trunk celiac, mesentery, and several small implants the serosa
        of the small intestine) and / or with residual disease after cytoreduction greater than or
        equal to 2.5 mm (CC-2 and CC-3).
