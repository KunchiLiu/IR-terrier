  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether liposomal bupivacaine is effective in the
      management of pain following total knee arthroplasty, as compared to standard of care
      analgesia.

    <textblock>
      Liposomal bupivacaine (Exparel®) is a local anesthetic made up of liposomal encapsulated
      bupivacaine. It is designed to be injected at the time of surgery into the local soft
      tissues. Because of its unique liposomal delivery system, Liposomal bupivacaine (Exparel®)
      has been shown to provide up to 96 hours of pain relief following surgeries. This makes it
      an attractive option in total knee arthroplasty patients. Combined with the proven efficacy
      of regional anesthesia, intraoperative liposomal bupivacaine (Exparel®) may provide extended
      pain relief following total knee arthroplasty. This has the potential to avoid the need for
      opioid medications. With better pain control, medication side effects can be avoided and
      patient's length of stay in the hospital can be shortened.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  At least 18 years of age

          -  Scheduled to undergo total knee arthroplasty (TKA) performed by the principal
             investigator

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Age &lt;18 years

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding

          -  Non-English-speaking

          -  Unable to give informed consent

          -  Patients admitted from or discharged to a medical facility (due to likelihood of
             limited mobility and/or required minimum lengths of stay, confounding primary
             outcome), including other hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, long-term acute care
             hospitals, etc.

          -  Patients unable to complete a device-assisted 140 foot walk at baseline

          -  Patients with contraindication(s) to any bupivacaine or ropivacaine formulation, to
             nerve blocks or any of the local agents used (IV morphine, ketorolac, or
             methylprednisolone).

          -  Patients on a long-acting maintenance opioid prior to admission for surgery (e.g.,
             methadone, oxycontin)

          -  Patients undergoing simultaneous bilateral TKAs, as this would increase the dose of
             Exparel per patient (we are limited to one dose per patient)
