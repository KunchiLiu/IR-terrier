      The purpose of the present study is to assess and compare in healthy non-pregnant women 18
      to 40 years of age the safety and immunogenicity of a liquid formulation of Group B
      Streptococcus (GBS) Trivalent Vaccine (not requiring reconstitution prior to
      administration), and of the lyophilized formulation of GBS Trivalent Vaccine, administered
      in non-pregnant and pregnant women in the clinical development program to date.
