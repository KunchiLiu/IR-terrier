      The study will be conducted as a two-arm cluster randomized controlled trial, which will
      compare the efficacy of a PU prevention programme versus usual PU prevention for older
      people in eight for-profit private nursing homes in Hong Kong. For-profit private NHs
      recruited will be stratified by districts before randomisation.Two private NHs from each of
      the four selected districts will be recruited. Groups of individuals in selected NHs will be
      randomly assigned to the experimental group and the control group. The subjects in the
      experimental group will received a 16 weeks PU prevention programme. It includes a training
      course tailor-made to health workers(HWs) and persona care works(PCWs) and a prevention
      protocol designed according to the roles and responsibilities of HWs and PCWs. The outcome
      measures are risk,prevalence and incidence rate of PUs as well as knowledge and skill level
      of care staff.Descriptive statistics will be used to analyze personal data of care staff,
      demographics and clinical characteristics of residents, PU knowledge and skills, and PU
      risk, prevalence and incidence rate.Chi-square test will be perform to compare the
      proportions of residents developing pressure ulcer between the two groups. Mixed
      between-within subjects analysis variance(ANOVA) or non-parametric tests will be performed
      to compare performance in knowledge and skills tests and PU risk between the two groups and
      over time and to examine the group by time interaction effect.

    <description>The two research assistants will go to each nursing home to inspect each nursing home resident's skin to detect pressure ulcers and then record the stages and locations of the pressure ulcers detected in the prevalence form. The assessment time will be one day before the commencement of the training course (T0); immediately before the commencement of the protocol implementation (T1), an expected average of 3 weeks after T0; eighth week after the commencement of the protocol implementation (T2) and at the end of the protocol implementation (T3).</description>

    <time_frame>The PUs incidence will be summed up for three periods of time, from T0 to T1, T1 to T2 and T2 to T3.</time_frame>
    <description>The two RAs will inspect the skin of each residents three times a week to detect the first PUs ( those detected on residents without PUs) and the new PUs (those detected on residents already suffering from PUs), starting from one day before the staff training to the end of the protocol implementation. The numbers, locations, and stages of the PUs detected will be recorded in the PU incidence form. The PU incidence will be then summed up for three periods of time as following. T0 to T1: one day before the commencement of the training course (T0) to the day immediately before the commencement of the protocol implementation (T1) .T1 to T2: the day immediately before the commencement of the protocol implementation (T1) to the eighth week after the commencement of the protocol implementation (T2).T2 to T3: the eighth week after the commencement of the protocol implementation (T2) to the sixteenth week of protocol implementation (T3).</description>
