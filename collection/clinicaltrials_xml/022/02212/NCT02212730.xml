    <textblock>
      This study will examine the effect of treatment with the neoadjuvant antibody pembrolizumab
      (MK-3475) on tumors of participants with renal cell cancer (RCC). The primary hypotheses are
      that pembrolizumab is well tolerated in participants undergoing RCC tumor resection; and
      that pembrolizumab will stimulate a 2-fold or greater increase in intratumoral lymphocytic
      infiltration in at least 30% of participants with RCC.
