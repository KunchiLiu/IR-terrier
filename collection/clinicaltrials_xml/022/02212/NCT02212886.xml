  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      -  This is a phase IIa study in which GA Depot 80 or 40mg is administered as an IM
           injection to subjects with RRMS at 4 week intervals for 52 weeks of treatment.

        -  The purpose of the study is to assess safety, tolerability, and efficacy of a monthly
           long-acting IM injection of 80 or 40mg GA Depot in subjects with RRMS. The study will
           include subjects switching from daily or thrice weekly administration of 20 mg or 40mg
           respectively of glatiramer acetate (GA, i.e., Copaxone) injection

      -  24 Subjects with a diagnosis of relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) who are
           treated with daily or thrice weekly subcutaneous injections of 20 mg or 40 mg
           respectively of GA (Copaxone) during the previous 12 months

        -  Study product is GA long-acting injection (GA Depot) which is a combination of
           extended-release microspheres for injection and diluent (water for injection) for
           parenteral use. GA Depot will be administered intramuscularly (IM).

        -  The study duration for an individual subject will be 60 weeks, consisting of 4 weeks of
           screening evaluation (weeks -4 to 0), followed by a 52-week open-label treatment
           period, and a 4 weeks follow up period: through a total of 17 visits

        -  Physical, vital signs and safety assessment - at each visit

        -  MRI at visit 1 (screenings), at week 24, and week 52 (end of treatment visit)

        -  Neurological and safety laboratory tests at screening visit and on visits in weeks 4,
           12, 24, 36, and 52 (end of treatment)

             of 2010).

          -  Treatment with 20 mg or 40 mg of GA (Copaxone) during the previous 12 months with
             ongoing treatment at the Screening Visit.

          -  Known or suspected history of drug or alcohol abuse.

          -  Positive test for HIV, hepatitis, venereal disease research laboratory test (VDRL),
             or tuberculosis. Participation in an investigational drug study within 30 days prior
             to start of this study.

          -  Treatment with any kind of steroids during the last 30 days.

          -  Confirmed relapse during the last 30 days.
