  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this research study is to compare the level of effectiveness of two massage
      treatment schedules for chronic CIPN in people treated with Oxaliplatin or taxanes
      (docetaxel, paclitaxel) for their cancer (breast and gastrointestinal) . Researchers also
      want to study how participants may respond to massage treatments, and how the treatments may
      affect quality of life and physical performance.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral neuropathy is one of the most common chemotherapy side effects affecting the
      nerves. Each year, thousands of patients receive oxaliplatin-based and taxane-based
      chemotherapy and more than 50% of these patients will have Chemotherapy Induced Peripheral
      Neuropathy (CIPN). CIPN can cause painful or abnormal skin sensation (such as pins and
      needles), numbness, and/or nerve damage that may affect movement.

      Study Groups:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be randomly assigned
      (as in the roll of a dice) to 1 of 4 groups. The location of the massage and the massage
      schedule will vary by group. You will either have massages 3 times a week for 4 weeks or 2
      times a week for 6 weeks.

      Massage Treatments (All Participants):

      Your massage treatments will be given on an outpatient basis in private rooms. For your
      massage, you will either lie on a table or sit in a reclined chair. The total time will be
      about 30 minutes, which includes positioning you on the chair or table.

      Study Visits:

      One (1) time every week:

        -  Your vital signs will be measured.

        -  You will be asked about any drugs you may be taking and any side effects you may be
           having.

      At Weeks 4, 6, 8 and 10:

        -  You will complete the same 5 questionnaires.

        -  You will perform leg function and balance tests.

      Length of Study:

      You may continue your participation on this study for up to 10 weeks, as long as the study
      doctor thinks it is your best interest. Your active participation in this study will be over
      after you have completed the follow-up visit.

      Follow-Up Visit:

      After you complete your final massage treatment, the following tests and/or procedures will
      be performed:

        -  Your vital signs will be measured.

        -  Your medical history will be recorded.

        -  You will be asked about any drugs you may be taking and any side effects you may be
           having.

        -  You will complete the same 5 questionnaires.

        -  You will perform leg function and balance tests.

        -  You will complete a brief exit interview that will ask about questions such as if you
           think you benefitted from the massage. This interview should take about 10 minutes to
           complete.

      This is an investigational study. The use of massage treatments for chronic CIPN is
      investigational.

      Up to 90 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

    <description>Completion rate defined as the average number of treatments completed of a possible 12 for patients in each protocol. Mean and standard deviation, along with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of the mean of the number of massages completed for each of the two massage schedules computed. Two-sample t-test used to compare the number of massages completed between the two schedules using a two-sided 0.05 significance level.</description>
