  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The results of the present RCT study will add to the growing body of literature
      investigating the potential role of exercise as a supportive therapeutic intervention for
      patient with glioma.

    <textblock>
      Gliomas are the most frequent primary neoplasm in the CNS and according to the World Health
      Organization histologically categorized into low-grade glioma (LGG) (WHO grades I/II) or
      high-grade glioma (HGG) (WHO grades III/IV). Gliomas are among the biggest challenges within
      the field of neuro-rehabilitation and oncology, and optimising treatment by improving QoL,
      function and cognition is of major clinical importance in this population. Because the
      majority of patients cannot be cured, clinical cancer research traditionally have focused on
      prolonging survival, exposing relapse or optimising the response to the medical treatment.
      Today there is a general consensus that health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is important
      in the evaluation of new treatments. However, research in HRQoL among patients with gliomas
      is scarce compared to the other categories of patients with tumors. In recent years have
      exercise become an important part of cancer treatment. The effects is well documented in
      studies among other cancer patients than gliomas and includes improvements of quality of
      life, physical function, reduce fatigue and thereby supports daily activities among cancer
      patients'. Inpatient rehabilitation studies among glioma patients have also indicated
      improved HRQoL and functional measurements such as activity of daily life, mobility and
      cognition. Despite of this rehabilitation efforts is still not emphasized in this population
      and recent literature concludes that there are no well-designed clinical studies examining
      the effect of multidisciplinary rehabilitation among Glioma patients. This study is the
      first to investigate the effect of an intensive specialised interdisciplinary outpatient
      rehabilitation program among gliomas patients.

    <description>The intervention consists of 6 weeks intensive outpatient physiotherapy in conjunction with 0-6 weeks of occupational therapy if need is indicated. The physical intervention contains supervised group exercise of 90 minutes three times a week in groups up to four patients included continuously.
The occupational therapy intervention consists of individual training 60 minutes twice a week for patients having deficits in activity or participation levels measured by the Assessment of Motor and Process Skills (AMPS).</description>
