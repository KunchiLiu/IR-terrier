  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label (all people involved know the identity of the
      intervention), single dose trial to evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile (how drugs are
      absorbed in the body, how are they distributed within the body and how are they removed from
      the body over time) in children aged from birth to less than 2 years after a scheduled
      surgical procedure that routinely produces moderate to severe acute post-surgical pain.

      The trial will also evaluate the safety and tolerability of tapentadol oral solution in the
      population studied and the effect of tapentadol oral solution on pain.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial has 3 phases: enrollment, treatment (15 hours) and follow up.

      During the enrolment phase consent and eligibility will be determined. After surgery, the
      participant will be given routine pain medication as per standard of care in the hospital.

      Treatment phase: When the participant has a functioning gastrointestinal tract after
      surgery, can tolerate medication administered orally or via a feeding tube, meets the
      inclusion criteria, and does not meet any exclusion criterion, the participant will be
      allocated to IMP. Evaluations will be performed over the next 15 hours, including the
      assessment of the amount of pain. During this time, 2 blood samples will be taken for
      testing of the amount of tapentadol and its main metabolites in the participant's blood.

      A final follow-up visit is planned to take place up to 2 weeks after taking the trial
      medication.

             Medicinal Product.
