      Purpose: Test whether oxytocin treatment decreases symptoms of withdrawal from alcohol and
      decreases drinking in people who have been consuming alcohol heavily for long periods and
      are physically and psychologically dependent on (addicted to) alcohol.

      Participants: 50 adults with alcohol dependence

      Procedures (methods): Oxytocin or placebo will be administered three times a day for the
      first 2 days of the 12 week period, followed by twice daily intranasal sprays for the rest
      of the 12 weeks. Before, during and at the end of the trial, each subject will undergo
      evaluations including breathalyzer readings, rating withdrawal symptoms, interviews about
      amount of alcohol consumed since last clinic visit, subject self-ratings of anxiety, alcohol
      craving and, at some visits, laboratory measures (blood and urine) to monitor safety and
      alcohol/drug use. Following the active phase of the trial, subjects will be followed up at 4
      weeks and 12 weeks to evaluate for post-medication safety and efficacy

      The purpose of this research study is to learn whether oxytocin treatment decreases drinking
      in people who have been consuming alcohol heavily for long periods and are unable to stop
      drinking on their own. Oxytocin is made naturally and is released in parts of the brain
      where it acts like a chemical signal from one cell to another. Oxytocin is approved by the
      Food and Drug Administration for stimulating labor in pregnant women but is not approved as
      a treatment to decrease alcohol drinking.

      People who drink large amounts of alcohol every day or many days per week for weeks or
      months undergo chemical changes in their brains. Patients continue to drink frequently and
      heavily because, even though patients may know drinking is not good for their health,
      patients have unpleasant experiences if they stop or decrease drinking. Those experiences
      can include increased anxiety, difficulty sleeping, difficulty tolerating stress, mild to
      moderate withdrawal symptoms such as tremors, nausea, feeling sweaty and/or headaches, and
      cravings to drink. Studies have shown that giving oxytocin to alcohol-addicted animals
      diminished drinking after they had been denied access to alcohol for a while and reduced
      symptoms when they were put into alcohol withdrawal. A pilot study conducted at UNC found
      that oxytocin treatment decreased withdrawal symptoms in heavy drinkers who were admitted to
      a hospital for medical treatment to come off alcohol.

      This study will test whether oxytocin treatment for 12 weeks starting shortly after
      subjects' discharge from Freedom House or UNC Hospitals or after patients are evaluated
      during an outpatient clinic visit will decrease how much patients drink as well as patients
      desire to drink and patients anxiety. After study medications are stopped, the amount of
      drinking, desire to drink and anxiety will be assessed over an additional 12-week period.

      Patients are being asked to participate in this study because they have been drinking large
      amounts of alcohol frequently and want help to stop or cut back on their drinking. Patients
      may receive oxytocin or placebo in this study as an intranasal spray. The placebo contains
      all of the ingredients of the oxytocin spray EXCEPT oxytocin, the active ingredient.
      Patients' assignment to oxytocin or placebo treatment will be random (like a flip of a
      coin).

      Patients must sign this consent form to take part in this study. Patients participation in
      the study will last up to 25-26 weeks. If Patients are recruited while they are an inpatient
      at Freedom House or UNC Hospitals, the duration of their participation will extend over the
      remaining days they are an inpatient, an initial clinic visit shortly after they are
      discharged when they will start taking the intranasal test treatment, a 12-week period
      during which they will take the intranasal study medication each day at home and attend 8
      clinic visits and a final 12-week period after stopping medication during which they will
      attend clinic visits at the 4 and 12-week time points. If patients are not an inpatient and
      are recruited during an initial outpatient clinic visit, they will attend another clinic
      visit to start the intranasal study medication and then take the intranasal test treatment
      each day at home and attend 8 additional clinic visits over a 12 week period and then attend
      2 additional clinic visits at 4 and 12 weeks after stopping the intranasal medication. Each
      clinic visit will last 1-2 hours.

      If patients are an inpatient at Freedom House or UNC Hospitals, they will undergo an
      evaluation toward the end of their admission to determine if they are eligible to
      participate in the study. If patients are not an inpatient, they will undergo an evaluation
      during an initial outpatient clinic visit. Patients must have no alcohol in their blood
      (Breathalyzer reading of zero) when they read the consent form and when they undergo the
      initial evaluation. Patients' Breathalyzer readings must be less than 0.08 at each
      subsequent clinic visit for evaluations to be conducted. If patients' Breathalyzer readings
      are equal to or greater than 0.08, patients will not drive themselves home and they will
      accept assistance from a friend, relative or cab driver in getting back home in a safe
      manner. Patients will sign the Breath Alcohol Policy agreeing to abide by these rules when
      they are first evaluated as an inpatient or at an initial outpatient clinic visit.

      Procedures if patients are evaluated toward the end of an admission to Freedom House or UNC
      Hospitals

        -  Patients will be interviewed about their medical and psychiatric history, whether they
           have ever had alcohol withdrawal, especially bad withdrawal (delirium tremens,
           seizures, hallucination), as well as about how much patients drank during the 90 days
           before they were admitted and their use of other drugs.

        -  Patients will complete questionnaires about drinking by members of their family, how
           much of a problem patients think their drinking has been for patients, and their
           understanding of the consequences of their drinking.

      Procedures (in addition to those above) if patients are evaluated during an initial
      outpatient clinic visit

        -  Patients will take a Breathalyzer test to determine the concentration of alcohol in
           their blood.

        -  The severity of withdrawal symptoms that patients may be experiencing will be measured
           based on their vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate) and ratings of symptoms using
           the CIWA scale.

        -  Patients urine will be tested to see if they take street or illegal drugs. If patients
           test positive, investigators will keep this data confidential unless investigators are
           required by law to disclose the data.

        -  Patients will have blood (15 ml or about 1 tablespoon) and urine samples taken for
           laboratory tests and, if patients are women, to determine if they are pregnant.

        -  Patients will have a physical examination by a study doctor. If the results of the
           evaluation show patients are eligible to participate, patients will be randomly
           assigned (like the flip of a coin) to receive either oxytocin or placebo intranasal
           spray. Members of the researcher staff will instruct patients in how to self-administer
           intranasal spray doses from a spray bottle. If patients are an inpatient at Freedom
           House or UNC Hospitals, they will take their first intranasal test dose during a clinic
           visit scheduled a few days after they are discharged. If patients are not an inpatient,
           patients will take their first intranasal test dose during a clinic visit scheduled
           shortly after this screening visit. Patients will then take an intranasal spray bottle
           home with them and continue to self-administer intranasal test doses three time each
           day (at approximately breakfast, lunch and dinner time) for two days and thereafter
           will take intranasal test doses twice each day (at approximately breakfast and dinner
           time). Each dose will be 6 sprays into their nose (3 per nostril). Neither patients nor
           the research staff or nurses will know whether patients are taking oxytocin or placebo
           nasal spray.

      During the clinic visit when patients take their first intranasal test dose and at each of
      the following clinic visits while taking study medication, patients will have a Medical
      Management session (special talk therapy for alcohol dependence) with the study doctor
      before patients are discharged.

      Follow-up outpatient clinic visits after the visit when patients take their first intranasal
      test dose will take place at UNC Hospitals or at the Alcohol and Substance Abuse Program
      Clinic at Timberlyne Mall. Patients will come in weekly for the first four weeks, then every
      other week for the next eight weeks (8 total visits) while taking study medications.
      Patients will also come to an outpatient clinic visit 4 and 8 weeks after stopping the study
      medications.

      Procedures at outpatient clinic visits (each 1-2 hours long)

        -  Patients will undergo a Breathalyzer test to measure the concentration of alcohol in
           their blood.

        -  Study staff will interview patients about how much they have been drinking since the
           last clinic visit.

        -  Patients will complete questionnaires about their alcohol cravings, anxiety and
           depression.

        -  Vital signs and CIWA (alcohol withdrawal symptom) scores will be measured.

        -  At the week 4, 8, and 12 clinic visits while patients are taking intranasal study
           medications, patients will give blood (15 ml or about 1 tablespoon) and urine samples
           for laboratory tests, pregnancy tests (for women participants), and to see if they are
           taking street or illegal drugs.

        -  At the final clinic visit while taking study medication (week 12), patients will again
           complete a questionnaire about their understanding of the consequences of their
           drinking.

      Other procedures throughout the 12-week test treatment portion of the study During the
      12-week test treatment part of the study, patients will take the intranasal study medication
      three times per day for the first two days (at approximately breakfast, lunch and dinner
      time) and then twice daily (at approximately breakfast and dinner time). Patients will
      receive a new bottle of intranasal spray every 2 weeks. Patients must bring the intranasal
      spray bottle they have been using to clinic appointments.
