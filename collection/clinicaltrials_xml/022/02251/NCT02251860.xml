      ARATA is a prospective, non-interventional, multi-center, observational study in Germany to
      evaluate the long-term effectiveness and tolerability of subcutaneously administered
      RoActemra/Actemra (tocilizumab) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis in daily clinical
      practice. Participants will be followed over an observation period of up to 2 years after
      the initial injection.
