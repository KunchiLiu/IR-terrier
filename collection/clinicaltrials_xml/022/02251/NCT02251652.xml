  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sequential therapy with cryosurgery and ingenol mebutate may optimize the treatment of
      hypertrophic AKs and also treat non-hypertrophic AKs in this anatomic location. Furthermore,
      use of ingenol mebutate will also be evaluated for potential treatment of subclinical
      lesions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators plan to treat 30 subjects. Each qualifying subject will have at least 3
      hypertrophic AKs, defined as more than 3mm in thickness, on each dorsal hand. Cryotherapy
      will be standardized in all patients and for all treated lesions: 1-2 sprays, 5 seconds
      each, with a 5 second interval. All subjects will be treated with the same cryo-spray.
      Following cryotherapy, subjects will be randomized to treat either their right or left
      dorsal hand with ingenol mebutate gel. The decision to treat the right vs. the left hand
      will be chosen by chance, like flipping a coin. Neither the subject nor the study doctor
      will choose what arm receives the ingenol mebutate gel. The study doctor will not know which
      arm is treated with ingenol mebutate, so the subject should not reveal that information to
      him or her at any time during the study. Subjects will treat the randomized dorsal hand with
      ingenol mebutate 0.05% gel starting on the same day as the cryotherapy (Day 0). Subjects
      will utilize the once daily for two days regimen. Subjects will be followed on day 4 after
      their initial visit, day 8, day 15, day 29, and day 57, with a two day window period.
