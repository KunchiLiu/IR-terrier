  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to observe patient response to current clinical practice
      utilizing TRUVADA (emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate) for Pre-Exposure
      Prophylaxis (PrEP) amongst HIV serodiscordant couples desiring to conceive across four U.S.
      cities that are currently offering this method as standard of care. This study is an
      observational cohort study, which will test the feasibility and acceptability of PrEP for
      conception, while examining the challenges and generalizability of this current medical
      practice. The CDC recently released formal clinical practice guidelines for the use of PrEP
      in the United States. For high-risk serodiscordant heterosexual couples using PrEP during
      conception, the guidelines state, &quot;PrEP use periconception and during pregnancy by the
      uninfected partner may offer an additional tool to reduce the risk of sexual HIV
      acquisition. Both the FDA labeling information and the perinatal antiretroviral treatment
      guidelines permit this use&quot; (CDC 2014).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Based on CDC's guidance on PrEP as well as results of randomized controlled trials, the U.S.
      Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved this daily medication (comprised of one pill) to
      reduce the risk of sexually acquired HIV in adults at high risk. Other medical practices to
      avoid transmission within this population include assisted reproductive technologies such as
      sperm washing (or donated sperm) coupled with in vitro fertilization, intracytoplasmic sperm
      injection (an in vitro procedure where a single sperm is injected directly into an egg), and
      intrauterine insemination (placing the sperm directly into the uterus). However, these
      methods are costly and often regionally scarce. PrEP is more accessible and a less expensive
      option for couples. When used consistently and as prescribed, PrEP has shown to
      significantly reduce the risk of HIV infection among adult men and women. However, risk
      reduction counseling and clinical monitoring are necessary for its effective implementation.
      Therefore, beyond efficacy trials, it is important to conduct additional studies of
      pre-exposure prophylaxis to observe what factors make PrEP feasible and acceptable to
      couples, as well as identify other factors that impact level of adherence. The study will
      take place in four U.S. cities: Boston, Baltimore, Philadelphia, and San Francisco and will
      involve couples who have chosen to begin PrEP for conception as part of their clinical care
      after receiving preconception counseling and reviewing their options with their health care
      provider.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in PrEP adherence levels throughout regimen</measure>
    <time_frame>Monthly; participants will be followed for the duration of trying to conceive, an expected average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Adherence will be measured in two ways: (1) Dried blood spots (DBS) to measure drug level two times, once after the woman has been taking the drug for one month and once when pregnancy is confirmed. We will perform unadjusted, bivariate analyses comparing participants below and equal to the drug level threshold for daily dosing using a one sample t-test for normally distributed continuous or ordinal variables on adherence. We will also perform a paired t-test for measuring the difference, if any, between the two adherence tests at the different time points for each individual. Adherence will also be measured through (2) participant self-report via a continuous variable of number of doses missed in the past month. We will perform unadjusted, bivariate analyses comparing the observed participant self-reported adherence levels to the gold standard of â‰¥95% self-reported adherence using a one-sample t test of means for normally distributed continuous or ordinal variables.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in condom use and sexual practice over time</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will be followed for the duration of trying to conceive, an expected average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Condom use will be measured through participant self-report on number of times a condom was used during the past month compared to the number of times the participant had sexual intercourse with his/her partner or other individuals in the past month. We will perform unadjusted bivariate analyses comparing the observed participants in a one-sample student's t-test for normally distributed variables on condom use or a paired t-test for measuring the difference between two variables at different time points for the same subject (i.e. at baseline and at end-line evaluation). For a non-normal distribution, we will use the non-parametric equivalent such as Sign or Wilcoxon Signed rank test for a symmetric distribution.</description>

    <measure>Change in number of couples who complete a clinical protocol for PrEP compared to the total number of couples that initiate PrEP</measure>
    <time_frame>Monthly; participants will be followed for the duration of trying to conceive, an expected average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>We will quantify this outcome measure by examining the number of couples who complete a clinical protocol for PrEP compared to the total number of couples that initiate PrEP, while examining other variables that could make the two groups statistically different. We will perform unadjusted bivariate analyses comparing the number of couples that complete the clinical protocol and those who withdraw or become ineligible throughout the duration of the study. We will use a one-way ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric test for continuous variables with two or more categories such as those that complete the protocol versus those that withdraw from PrEP versus those that become ineligible. We will perform a two-sample test of means to compare the overall categories of those that complete the protocol versus those that do not complete the protocol and create cross-tabulations with chi-square and Fisher's exact tests.</description>

    <measure>Change in beliefs and sexual behavior at different time points for the same subject</measure>
    <time_frame>Monthly; participants will be followed for the duration of trying to conceive, an expected average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>For this outcome measure, we will perform unadjusted bivariate analyses in a paired t-test for measuring the difference in beliefs and sexual behavior at different time points for the same subject. For a non-normal distribution, we will use the non-parametric equivalent such as Sign or Wilcoxon Signed rank test for a symmetric distribution.</description>

    <measure>Changes in creatinine clearance from the baseline compared to creatinine clearance at the conclusion of PrEP for the same subject</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will be followed for the duration of trying to conceive, an expected average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>To assess renal toxicities, we will perform unadjusted bivariate analyses in a paired t-test for measuring the difference of creatinine clearance from the baseline compared to creatinine clearance at the conclusion of PrEP for the same subject. For a non-normal distribution, we will use the non-parametric equivalent such as Sign or Wilcoxon Signed rank test for a symmetric distribution. We will also report on basic drug side effects, while summarizing other self-reported effects of PrEP.</description>

    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>We will perform unadjusted bivariate analyses in a two-sample test of means to compare rates of teratogenicity of newborns with HIV-negative females using PrEP as compared to rates of birth defects within the general population in similar age group women.</description>

      To measure levels of PrEP to assess medication adherence, approximately 4ml of blood will be
      drawn on female participants (2 tests total for the study period). One dried blood spot will
      be collected after steady state tenofovir (approximately one month after beginning PrEP) is
      reached and one at the time a pregnancy is confirmed.
