    <textblock>
      This Phase IV study is an a multi-centre, randomised open label, two way cross-over design
      to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of NEUMOTEROL 400 in subjects with
      asthma. The study will be used to demonstrate the non-inferiority of Budesonide/Formoterol
      Fumarate combination (BFF) 400/12 micrograms (mcg) single capsule inhaler (NEUMOTEROL 400)
      compared with BFF 320/9 mcg SYMBICORT Forte TURBUHALER® inhaler.

      The population for this study will be adult subjects (&gt;=18 and &lt;=80 years) with a diagnosis
      of asthma who have a pre-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) of 40%
      to 85% of the predicted normal value, and are receiving a stable dose of inhaled
      corticosteroid inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) with or without long-acting beta-adrenergic
      agonist (LABA) prior to screening.

      The study will consist of six phases: Prescreening, Screening/Run-in (4 weeks), Treatment
      Period 1 (4 weeks), Washout (minimum 4 weeks), Treatment Period 2 (4 weeks) and Follow-up (1
      week). The total duration of the study for each subject will be at least 17 weeks. There
      will be up to 6 study visits and a follow-up telephone call.

      Pre-screening Visit will allow subjects who had recent asthma medication changes to be
      stabilized prior to Screening. During the run-in and wash-out periods, all the subjects will
      receive budesonide dry powder inhaler (DPI) 400 mcg twice daily (BID) (NEUMOTEX™ 400) and
      salbutamol 100mcg pressurized metered dose inhaler (pMDI) on demand, as rescue medication.
      The dose of NEUMOTEROL 400 (400/12 mcg) and SYMBICORT Forte (320/9 mcg) will be one
      inhalation BID, and each treatment will be given to all subjects for 4 weeks (with a 4-week
      Washout Period between treatments).

      The study will include 300 subjects for screening so that at least 210 will be randomised
      and a minimum of 168 subjects complete the study/are evaluable. Half the subjects will be on
      Regimen A in Treatment Period 1and will then be crossed over to Regimen B in Treatment
      Period 2, and vice versa. Regimen A: BFF (400/12 mcg) by single capsule inhaler. Regimen B:
      BFF (320/9 mcg) TURBUHALER inhaler. The treatment periods will be separated by a washout
      Period of 4 weeks.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in trough morning FEV1 at Day 29</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 29</time_frame>
    <description>FEV1 is the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second. The trough FEV1 is defined as morning pre-bronchodilator and pre-dose: 12 hours after the last evening dose (Day 28) at the end of each Treatment Period.</description>

    <measure>FEV1 area under the curve (AUC) (0-10 hours) at Day 1 of each treatment period</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-dose, 5 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 1, 2, 5, and 10 hours post morning dose on Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>FEV1 AUC (0 to 10 hours) will be measured at the beginning of each Treatment Period. The AUC will be derived using the 0 minute (pre-morning dosing), 5 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 1, 2, 5, and 10 hours post the morning dosing FEV1 values on Day 1. The AUC will be analysed using mixed-effects analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with treatment group and period as fixed effects and subject as a random effect.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Asthma Control Test (ACT) over 4 weeks for each treatment period</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The ACT is a 5-item questionnaire with a score of 1 to 5. The questions are designed to be self-completed by the subject. The scores from each question are added to give an overall score. The change from Baseline in overall score will be analysed as per the primary analysis, comparing BFF (400/12 mcg) administered BID by single capsule inhaler versus BFF (320/12 mcg) administered BID by TURBUHALER inhaler using a mixed effects ANCOVA model, with Baseline overall ACT score, treatment group and period as fixed effects and subject as a random coefficient</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female &gt;=18 and &lt;=80 years of age with a diagnosis of asthma at the time of
             signing the informed consent

          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of: Non-child bearing potential
             defined as premenopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy; or
             postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea (in questionable cases
             a blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone &gt;40 milli-international
             unit/milliliter (mIU/mL) and oestradiol &lt;40 picogram/millilitre (pg/mL) [&lt;147
             picomol/litre] is confirmatory) ; Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and
             whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the contraception
             methods (i.e., in accordance with the approved product label and the instructions of
             the physician for the duration of the study from Screening to follow-up contact) if
             they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue
             HRT to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status before study enrolment. For most
             forms of HRT, at least 2 to 4 weeks should elapse between the cessation of therapy
             and the blood draw; this interval depends on the type and dosage of HRT. After
             confirmation of their postmenopausal status, they can resume use of HRT during the
             study without use of a contraceptive method; Child-bearing potential and is abstinent
             or agrees to use one of the contraception methods for an appropriate period of time
             (as determined by the product label or investigator) before the start of dosing to
             sufficiently minimise the risk of pregnancy at that point. Female subjects must agree
             to use contraception until at least 2 days post the last dose of study treatment ;
             Abstinence from penile-vaginal intercourse must be consistent with the preferred and
             usual lifestyle of the subject

          -  Severity of disease: A best pre-bronchodilator FEV1 of &gt;=40% to &lt;=85% of the
             predicted normal value at Visit 1 (Screening and Run-in Visit). . Percent predicted
             will be calculated using the European Respiratory Society Global Lung Function
             Initiative reference equations.

          -  Reversibility of disease: Demonstrated &gt;=12% and &gt;=200 mL reversibility of FEV1
             within 10 to 40 minutes after 2 to 4 inhalations of salbutamol inhalation aerosol (or
             equivalent nebulised treatment with salbutamol solution) at Visit 1 (Screening and
             Run-in Visit)

          -  Current anti-asthma therapy: All subjects must be using an ICS with or without LABA
             for at least 8 weeks and a stable dose for at least 4 weeks before Visit 1 (Screening
             and Run-in Visit). Two populations are eligible for enrolment: Subjects maintained on
             ICS monotherapy (Budesonide 400 mcg to 800 mcg BID or equivalent) for at least 8
             weeks and a stable dose for at least 4 weeks before Visit 1 (Screening and Run-in
             Visit) or Subjects maintained on an ICS/LABA combination product (e.g., NEUMOTEROL
             200/6 BID or 400/12 mcg BID or equivalent by other combination products or by
             separate inhalers) for at least 8 weeks and a stable dose for at least 4 weeks before
             Visit 1 (Screening and Run-in Visit). Subjects taking budesonide/formoterol as needed
             must switch to maintenance dosing (excluding the highest dose) with use of a SABA for
             symptom relief at least 8 weeks and a stable dose for at least 4 weeks before Visit 1
             (Screening and Run-in Visit). NOTE: Subjects on low dose ICS monotherapy should only
             be enrolled, if, in the opinion of the investigator, after review of their medical
             history and clinical examination, they will be able to benefit from both an increase
             in ICS dose and the addition of LABA therapy arising from and ICS/LABA combination

          -  Ability to withhold LABA therapy : Other than what is provided during the study, LABA
             therapy is not permitted on the day of Visit 1(Screening and Run-in Visit) and
             throughout the entire study. The last dose of pre-study LABA and LABA/ICS
             combinations are to be taken on the day before Visit 1. According to investigators
             judgement, patients should be able to withhold LABA therapy during the run-in and
             wash-out period.

          -  SABA: All subjects must be able to replace their current SABA treatment with rescue
             salbutamol at Visit 1 (Screening and Run-in Visit) for use as needed for the duration
             of the study. Subjects must be able to withhold salbutamol for at least 6 hours
             before each study visit

          -  Liver safety criteria: Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &lt;=2×the upper limit of normal
             (ULN), Alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin &lt;=1.5×ULN (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5×ULN is
             acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin is &lt;35%) at Visit 1
             (Screening and Run-in Visit)

          -  Electrocardiography (ECG) safety criteria : The subject must have no ECG
             abnormalities that would, in the opinion of investigator, compromise subject safety,
             or significantly affect subject's ability to complete the trial. As such, the
             investigator will determine the clinical significance of any ECG abnormality and
             determine if a subject is precluded from entering the study. At Visit 1 (Screening
             and Run-in Visit), ECG safety criteria must be: QT interval corrected for heart rate
             (QTc) &lt;450 microseconds (msec) or QTc &lt;480 msec for patients with bundle branch
             block. The QTc is the QT interval corrected for heart rate according to either
             Bazett's formula (QTcB), Fridericia's formula (QTcF), or another method, machine or
             manual overread. The QTc should be based on single or averaged QTc values of
             triplicate ECGs obtained over a brief recording period. Investigators will be
             responsible for ensuring appropriate clinical interpretation of ECGs.

          -  The subject and/or the subject's legal guardian (if applicable) must be capable of
             giving informed consent/assent, which includes compliance with the study requirements
             and restrictions listed in the consent/assent form
