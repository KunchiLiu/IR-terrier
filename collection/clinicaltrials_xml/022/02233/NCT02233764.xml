  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, iron- and zinc-biofortified pearl millet will be fed to young children in
      Mumbai, Maharashtra, India over a period of nine months to measure growth, cognitive
      changes, and immune function in comparison to children receiving non-biofortified pearl
      millet.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Iron and zinc deficiency remain a major worldwide public health problem, especially in
      developing countries such as India. In this randomized study, 700 children aged 12-18 months
      from Mumbai, Maharashtra, India will be fed either iron and zinc biofortified pearl millet
      or control pearl millet three times per day, six days per week, for nine months. The goal of
      this study is to examine the effects of iron and zinc biofortified millet on immune
      function, growth, and cognitive function in this age group. The key outcome measures are
      biomarkers of iron and zinc status, growth, and immune and cognitive function. Serum
      concentrations of hemoglobin, ferritin, serum transferrin receptor, and zinc will be
      assessed at enrollment (baseline), at an intermediate time point (midline; random serial
      sampling) and after 9 months of follow-up (endline). Additionally, we will measure
      concentrations of C-reactive protein (CRP) and alpha 1-acid glycoprotein (AGP), as iron and
      zinc biomarkers can be influenced by inflammation. To assess cognitive function, multiple
      specific aspects of memory, attention, and processing speed will be assessed. Higher-level,
      integrative cognitive abilities that require the coordination of multiple specific
      functions, such as problem-solving and exploratory behavior and global aspects of attention
      during free play with toys, will also be assessed. In addition, a Bayley III test will be
      conducted at the baseline, intermediate, and endline assessments to obtain a broad measure
      of attainment of developmental milestones that can be used to compare the characteristics of
      this cohort with those reported in the literature.
