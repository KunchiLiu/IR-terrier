      The study will test whether a pharmacist-run cardiovascular risk service (CVRS) at the
      University of Iowa can increase use of national standards of care in clinics
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This project will conduct a multicenter, cluster-randomized study utilizing a centralized
      CVRS for medical offices with large geographic, racial and ethnic diversity to determine the
      extent to which the CVRS model will be implemented. Twenty primary care offices (see
      Appendix I) were randomized to either the CVRS arm or a usual care arm, and 18 continue in
      the study. Each clinic will enroll 20-25 patients per office for a total of 400 subjects, of
      which 240 will be from racial minorities.

      Subjects in the intervention arm clinic will have regular contact by phone, email or text
      with a CVRS clinical pharmacist housed at the University of Iowa. The pharmacist will
      communicate with the subject, with the site clinical pharmacist and, as need, with the site
      provider to optimize both the subject's pharmaceutical regimen and lifestyle behaviors. The
      CVRS intervention will last for 12 months.

      A complex algorithm will be used to calculate the degree to which the subject's care and
      medical regimen follows national guidelines for reducing the risk of developing
      cardiovascular risk.

    <ipd_description>IPD sets will be created without direct or indirect identifiers and reviewed to make sure that elements cannot be used to potentially identify individual subjects. We will create SAS datasets in transport format and package them along with a copy of the protocol, data dictionaries, and a manual that shows the user how to import the data into their own system. Investigators requesting access to the data will be asked to complete a data sharing agreement that provides for: 1) a commitment to using the data only for research purposes and not to identify any individual participant; 2) a commitment to securing the data using appropriate computer technology; and 3) a commitment to destroying or returning the data after analyses are completed.</ipd_description>
