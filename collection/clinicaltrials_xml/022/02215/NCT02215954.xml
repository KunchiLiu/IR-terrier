        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Japanese patients, age 20 to 80 years inclusive, requiring colonoscopy

          -  Female patients should be post-menopausal (women ≥45 years with no menstrual period
             for at least 12 months without an alternative medical cause), or be surgically
             sterile, or be using medically approved contraception, throughout the trial period.

          -  Fertile female patients must have a confirmed negative pregnancy test at screening
             and randomization

          -  Patients must have had more than or equal to 3 spontaneous bowel movements per week
             prior to the colonoscopy

          -  Written informed consent obtained prior to any study-related procedure

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Acute surgical abdominal conditions, such as acute intestinal obstruction or
             intestinal perforation, diverticulitis, appendicitis. If intestinal obstruction and
             perforation are suspected, perform appropriate diagnostic studies to rule out these
             conditions

          -  Active (acute/exacerbation of/severe/uncontrolled) Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)

          -  Any prior colorectal surgery, excluding appendectomy, haemorrhoid surgery or prior
             endoscopic procedures

          -  Colon disease (history of colonic cancer, toxic megacolon, idiopathic
             pseudo-obstruction, hypomotility syndrome)

          -  Gastrointestinal disorder (active ulcer, outlet obstruction, retention,
             gastroparesis, ileus)

          -  Upper gastrointestinal surgery (gastric resection, gastric banding, gastric by-pass)

          -  Uncontrolled angina and/or Myocardial Infarction (MI) within last 3 months,
             Congestive Heart Failure (CHF), or uncontrolled hypertension

          -  Renal insufficiency (any of the serum creatinine, or serum potassium value exceeding
             the upper limits of the normal range at screening) or a history of this event

          -  Participation in any other clinical trial during the past 3 months

          -  Any clinically significant laboratory value at screening, including pre-existing
             electrolyte abnormality, based on clinical history that the investigators feel may
             affect the study evaluation

          -  Hypersensitivity to active ingredients

          -  Subject who cannot suspend the prohibited medications

          -  Subjects not appropriate to participate in the study as deemed by the investigator
