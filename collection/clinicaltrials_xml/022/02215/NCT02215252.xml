  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Daily Pain Rating Scale (DPRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Average of the last 7 days' pain numerical rating scores in week 4 of the treatment period.</time_frame>
    <description>DPRS: participant rated 11-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain) during past 24-hour period. Higher score indicates greater level of pain.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory (NPSI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day -7, Day 1, 15, 29 and 36</time_frame>
    <description>NPSI: participant rated questionnaire to evaluate different symptoms of neuropathic pain (dimensions: burning [superficial] spontaneous pain, pressing [deep] spontaneous pain, paroxysmal pain, evoked pain, and paresthesia/dyesthesia [P/D]). Includes 10 descriptors quantified on a 0 (no symptoms) to 10 (worst symptoms imaginable) and 2 temporal items assessing duration of spontaneous ongoing and paroxysmal pain. Questionnaire generates a score in each of the relevant dimensions and a total score of 0-100. Higher score indicates a greater intensity of pain.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Global Impression of Change (PGI-C)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1, 15, 29 and 36</time_frame>
    <description>PGI-C: participant rated instrument to measure participant's change in overall status on a 7-point scale; range from 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Daily Sleep Interference Scale (DSIS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day-7, daily through to Day 36</time_frame>
    <description>DSIS: participant rated 11-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (pain does not interfere with sleep) to 10 (pain completely interferes with sleep) during past 24-hour period. Higher score indicates a greater level of sleep disturbance. Self-assessment performed daily on awakening prior to taking study medication.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Responder rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1, Day 29</time_frame>
    <description>Based on a 30% and 50% improvement in mean pain response using the daily pain NRS score.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Rescue Medication use</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1, Day 29</time_frame>
    <description>Number of days subjects take rescue medication and amount of rescue medication used.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Low Density Lipoprotein (LDL) and Total Cholesterol values</measure>
