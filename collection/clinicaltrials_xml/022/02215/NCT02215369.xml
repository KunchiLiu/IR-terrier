  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The VenaCure EVLT 400 µm Fiber Kit is currently marketed for the treatment of varicose
      veins. AngioDynamics, Inc., the company that manufacturers the VenaCure device, is
      sponsoring this study to assess the safety and effectiveness of the VenaCure EndoVenous
      Laser Treatment (EVLT) 400 µm Fiber Kit for treatment of incompetent perforator veins
      (IPVs). The VenaCure EVLT 400 µm Fiber Kit has not been previously studied by AngioDynamics
      for the ablation of IPVs.

      This is a single-arm, prospective, multicenter, non-blinded clinical trial. Study data will
      be summarized and submitted to the FDA in a premarket notification once all treated subjects
      have completed the 3 month visit. Longer term followup is being performed for publication
      purposes.

      Patients diagnosed with incompetent Perforator Veins (IPV's) and meet all inclusion and none
      of the exclusion criteria will be eligible for this study.

    <time_frame>10 day</time_frame>
    <description>The primary effectiveness endpoint is &quot;Acute Primary Ablation Success&quot; defined as complete lack of flow or IPV disappearance in the entire treated segment. Success will be measured via Duplex Ultrasound imaging performed 10 days (± 3 days) post procedure. Primary ablation success must be measured by a physician other than the physician that performed the study procedure.</description>

    <description>Technical Success, defined as successful access and entry into the IPV to be ablated and the ability to deliver the intended laser energy, will be evaluated as a secondary endpoint for inclusion in device labeling.</description>

    <description>The study intervention will be conducted according to the DFU included with the VenaCure EVLT 400 µm fiber Procedure Kit. Only one limb can be treated and included in this study; however, multiple IPV's within the study limb may be treated. All IPV's treated will be followed according to this study schedule.</description>

        Patients diagnosed with Incompetent Perforator Veins (IPV's) and meeting all inclusion
        criteria will be eligible for the study. Diagnosis and definition of perforating vein
        insufficiancy will be consistent with the SVS/AVF Clinical Practice Guidelines for the
        Care of Patients with Vericose Veins and Associated Chronic Venous Disease.
