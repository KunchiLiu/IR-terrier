    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies Dakin's solution in preventing radiation dermatitis in
      patients with breast cancer undergoing radiation therapy. Radiation dermatitis is a skin
      condition in which the affected skin becomes painful, red, itchy, and blistered. Dakin's
      solution may help reduce dermatitis caused by radiation therapy.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the percent change in women who experience grade 3 or 4 radiation dermatitis
      as defined by the Stanford Radiation Dermatitis Scoring System during radiation treatment
      for breast cancer compared to historical experience using standard skin care.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the feasibility of daily application of the hypochlorite solution (Dakin's
      solution), and to assess levels of pain during radiotherapy treatment.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients apply Dakin's solution topically daily over 10 minutes within 60 minutes of
      radiation therapy for up to 6 weeks.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4-6 weeks.
