  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      BACKGROUND:

        -  Primary CNS lymphoma (PCNSL) is a rare subtype of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.

        -  The outcome for patients with this diagnosis is significantly worse than for that of
           systemic DLBCL. Most treatment approaches in the past have included high dose
           methotrexate and radiation treatment.

        -  Most PCNSLs appear to be of activated B-cell (ABC) origin.

        -  Ibrutinib is an inhibitor of Bruton s tyrosine kinase (BTK) and effective for systemic
           DLBCL of ABC origin.

        -  We propose doing a study in which ibrutinib is combined with a novel chemotherapy
           platform called dose adjusted temozolomide, etoposide, doxil, dexamethasone, ibrutinib,
           rituximab (DA-TEDDI-R).

      OBJECTIVE:

      - Identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of ibrutinib or the dose that achieves adequate
      CSF concentrations, whichever comes first, when ibrutinib is given with DA-TEDDI-R.

      ELIGIBILITY:

        -  Newly diagnosed or relapsed/refractory PCNSL.

        -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years.

        -  No pregnant or breast-feeding women.

        -  Adequate organ function (defined in protocol).

      STUDY DESIGN:

        -  This is a phase 1 study of 40 patients.

        -  The study will have two components.

             1. Phase 1: MTD of ibrutinib will be identified or the dose at which ibrutinib
                achieves a concentration of less than or equal to 100 nM in the CSF, when given in
                combination with DA-TEDDI-R immuno-chemotherapy, whichever comes first.

             2. Expansion cohort: Safety and tolerability of the regimen in relapsed/refractory or
                previously untreated PCNSL (DLBCL type) will be assessed at the final ibrutinib
                dose with DA-TEDDI-R in 10 patients. Secondary objectives will be PFS and OS.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        -  ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:

          -  Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed primary central nervous
             system diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Both newly diagnosed patients and patients with
             relapsed or refractory disease are eligible.

          -  At least 2 weeks have passed since prior chemotherapy, biological therapy, radiation
             therapy, major surgery, other investigational or anti-cancer therapy that is
             considered disease-directed.

          -  Ibrutinib must be discontinued 7 days before (when possible) until 7 days after major
             surgery, and 3 days before (when possible) until 3 days after minor surgery. Thus,
             patients to be enrolled on an ibrutinib trial must have completed major surgery &gt; 7
             days before initiating treatment, and/or must have completed minor surgery &gt; 3 days
             before initiating treatment.

          -  Recovered from prior toxicities to Grade 0-1 at least 2 weeks prior to
             investigational therapy.

          -  Men and women age greater than or equal to 18 years.

          -  ECOG performance status less than or equal to 2(Karnofsky greater than or equal to
             60%) unless due to CNS Lymphoma.

          -  Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below, independent of
             growth factor or transfusion support. Patients should not receive growth factors or
             transfusions for at least 7 days prior to first dose of study drug with the exception
             of pegylated G-CSF (pegfilgrastim) and darbopoeitin which require at least 14 days
             prior to screening and randomization..

               -  absolute neutrophil count greater than or equal to750 cells/mcL (0.75 x 10(9)/L)

               -  platelet count greater than or equal to 50,000 cells/mcL (50 X 10(9)/L)

               -  hemoglobin greater than 8.0 g/dL

               -  total bilirubin less than or equal to1.5 times ULN (unless Gilbert s syndrome or
                  disease infiltration of the liver is present)

               -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) less than or equal to 3.0 times institutional ULN

               -  Serum Creatinine less than or equal to 1.5 mg/dL or creatinine clearance &gt; 40
                  ml/min/1.73m2 unless lymphoma related.

          -  Prothrombin time/INR (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) must be
             less than or equal to 1.5 times the upper limit of the normal range (ULN); except if,
             in the opinion of the Investigator, the aPTT is elevated because of a positive Lupus
             Anticoagulant.

          -  Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &gt; 40% as assessed by echocardiogram or MUGA

          -  The effects of ibrutinib on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason
             and because tyrosine kinase inhibitors as well as other therapeutic agents used in
             this trial may be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to
             use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence)
             prior to study entry.

        Female patients who are of non-reproductive potential (i.e., post-menopausal by history -
        no menses for (Bullet)1 year; OR history of hysterectomy; OR history of bilateral tubal
        ligation; OR history of bilateral oophorectomy). Female patients of childbearing potential
        must have a negative serum pregnancy test upon study entry.

        Male and female patients who agree to use highly effective methods of birth control (e.g.,
        condoms, implants, injectables, combined oral contraceptives, some intrauterine devices
        [IUDs], complete sexual abstinence, or sterilized partner) during the period of therapy
        and for 90 days after the last dose of study drug.

        Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is
        participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.

        -Patient or appointed surrogate decision-maker or legally authorized representative must
        have ability to understand the purpose and risks of the study and willingness to provide a
        signed and dated informed consent form (ICF) and authorization to use protected health
        information (in accordance with national and local subject privacy regulations).

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Chemotherapy less than or equal to 21 days prior to first administration of study
             treatment and/or monoclonal antibody 6 weeks prior to first administration of study
             treatment.

          -  Prior exposure to a BTK inhibitor

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to ibrutinib or other agents used in study.

          -  Patients who received a strong cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A inhibitor within 7 days prior
             to the first dose of ibrutinib or patients who require continuous treatment with a
             strong CYP3A inhibitor.

        Because the lists of these agents are constantly changing, it is important to regularly
        consult a frequently-updated list such as; medical reference texts such as the Physicians
        Desk Reference may also provide this information. As part of the enrollment/informed
        consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of interactions with other
        agents, and what to do if new medications need to be prescribed or if the patient is
        considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal product.

          -  HIV positive patients will be excluded with the exception of patients without CD4
             depletion (i.e. above the institutional lower limit of normal) and who have no other
             AIDS related complications and who have EBV negative tumors. The number of patients
             in this category is expected to be very low and the PI will decide their eligibility
             on a case by case basis.

          -  Systemic cytotoxic therapy within 2 weeks of treatment.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection or an infection requiring systemic antibiotics, symptomatic congestive
             heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric
             illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements. Recent
             infections requiring systemic treatment need to have completed therapy greater than
             14 days before the first dose of study drug.

          -  Pregnant and breastfeeding women are excluded from this study. Pregnant women are
             excluded in this study because ibrutinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor with the
             potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but
             potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the
             mother with ibrutinib, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated
             with ibrutinib.

        Uncontrolled Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia or ITP resulting in (or as evidenced by)
        declining platelet or Hgb levels within the 4 weeks prior to first dose of study drug.

          -  Presence of transfusion-dependent thrombocytopenia.

          -  Patients requiring daily corticosteroids at a prednisone equivalent of greater than
             or equal to 20 mg daily should not be enrolled. If corticosteroids can be
             discontinued (or reduced to less than 20 mg per day of prednisone or equivalent), the
             discontinuation or dose reduction should be done at least 7 days prior to first dose
             (see Section 5.3.1 for instructions regarding on-study use of corticosteroids).

          -  History of prior malignancy, with the exception of the following:

          -  Malignancy treated with curative intent and with no evidence of active disease
             present for more than 3 years prior to Screening and felt to be at low risk for
             recurrence by treating physician

          -  Adequately treated non-melanomatous skin cancer or lentigo maligna melanoma without
             current evidence of disease

          -  Adequately treated cervical carcinoma in situ without current evidence of disease.

          -  Currently active clinically significant cardiovascular disease such as uncontrolled
             arrhythmia, congestive heart failure, or Class 3 or 4 congestive heart failure as
             defined by the New York Heart Association Functional Classification, or history of
             myocardial infarction unstable angina, or acute coronary syndrome within 6 months
             prior to enrollment in the study.

          -  Unable to swallow capsules, or disease significantly affecting gastrointestinal
             function or resection of the stomach or small bowel, or symptomatic inflammatory
             bowel disease or ulcerative colitis, or partial or complete bowel obstruction.

          -  Serologic status reflecting active hepatitis B or C infection. Patients that are
             positive for hepatitis B core antibody, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), or
             hepatitis C antibody must have a negative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) prior to
             enrollment. (PCR positive patients will be excluded.)

          -  History of stroke or intracranial hemorrhage within 6 months prior to enrollment.

          -  Any life-threatening illness, medical condition, or organ system dysfunction that, in
             the Investigator s opinion, could compromise the patient s safety, or put the study
             at undue risk.

          -  Concomitant use of warfarin or other vitamin K antagonists within the last 28 days.

          -  Concurrent systemic immunosuppressant therapy other than corticosteroids (e.g.,
             cyclosporine A, tacrolimus, etc.) within 28 days of the first dose of study drug.

             or equal to1, or to the levels dictated in the inclusion/exclusion criteria with the
             exception of alopecia.

          -  Known bleeding disorders (e.g., von Willebrand s disease) or hemophilia.

          -  Major surgery within 4 weeks of first dose of study drug.

          -  Unwilling or unable to participate in all required study evaluations and procedures.

          -  Currently active, clinically significant hepatic impairment ( (Bullet) moderate
             hepatic impairment according to the NCI/Child Pugh classification.
