    <textblock>
      This Phase I dose-escalation trial is designed to evaluate the safety of administering
      rapidly-generated multi-antigen-specific T lymphocytes, to HSCT recipients (group A) or
      future HSCT recipients (group B) for the treatment or relapsed or refractory hematopoietic
      malignancies.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with evidence of relapsed or persistent hematopoietic malignancies (e.g. acute
      leukemia, MDS, Hodgkins lymphoma, CML) will be eligible for this study. Patients will be
      enrolled at two time points (for differing indications) in two groups (Group A - post HSCT
      and Group B- pre HSCT). Because patients with persistent malignancy prior to transplantation
      have an extremely poor prognosis, these patients will be eligible to receive TAA-CTL before
      and/or after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Group B patients may
      receive autologous TAA-CTL following a cycle of conventional chemotherapy in an effort to
      decrease the burden of disease prior to HSCT. Additionally, patients with persistent disease
      or high risk for relapse will be eligible to receive planned infusion of TAA-CTL after HSCT
      (given the very high likelihood of relapse and poor outcome) on group A. These high
      risk/refractory patients and their donors will be enrolled prior to HSCT and TAA-CTL will be
      given any time after day 30 post HSCT

      In either population, we will utilize a rapid generation protocol for multi-antigen specific
      T lymphocytes. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells will be exposed to antigen presenting
      cells pulsed with peptides to tumor antigens (Prame, WT1, Survivin, and MAGE-A3) in a
      cytokine milieu favorable to T cell expansion/activation, inducing selective expansion of T
      cells targeted to kill tumor cells. Patients would be monitored for the development of
      toxicity. In patients with disease at the time of TAA-CTL infusion, efficacy would be
      evaluated as a secondary endpoint using standard criteria. Exploratory investigational
      analyses would include monitoring of cytokine and cellular milieu pre- and post- TAA-CTL
      infusion and in vitro characterization of the host tumor, donor lymphocyte product, and
      TAA-CTL product.

      For Group A Patients (post HSCT): T cells will be infused any time after neutrophil
      engraftment post-HSCT or day 30, whichever comes first.

      For Group B Patients (pre HSCT): T cells will be infused any time &gt;1 week after previous
      therapy for relapsed disease.

      Four different dosing schedules will be evaluated. Two to four patients will be evaluated on
      each dosing schedule (see below). This protocol is designed as a phase I dose-escalation
      study.

      Each patient will receive 1 injection per dose level, at least 14 days apart, according to
      the following dosing schedules. The expected volume of infusion will be 1 to 10 cc.

      Dose Level One: 5 x 106 cells/m2 Dose Level Two: 1 x 107 cells/m2 Dose Level Three: 2 x 107
      cells/m2 Dose Level Four: 4 x 107 cells/m2

      Patients will receive cells either because: of prior refractory disease and/or high risk for
      relapse and/or detectable disease at the time of infusion. Group A and Group B patients will
      use the dose escalation strategy described above. Ideally, patients should not receive other
      systemic antineoplastic agents for at least 6 weeks after infusion of TAA- specific T-cells
      (for purposes of evaluation), although such treatment may be added at the discretion of
      their attending physician.

      If patients with active disease have stable disease or a partial response by the
      International Working Group (IWG) criteria at their 8 week or subsequent evaluations they
      are eligible to receive up to 6 additional doses of CTLs at monthly intervals-each of which
      will consist of the same cell number as their second injection. Patients will not be able to
      receive additional doses until the initial safety profile is completed at 6 weeks following
      the second infusion.
