  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of guselkumab (CNTO 1959)
      in the treatment of participants with moderate to severe plaque-type psoriasis (scaly skin
      rash) who had inadequate response to ustekinumab.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized (assignment of study drug by chance), double-blind (participants nor
      study staff will know the identity of study drugs), multicenter study to evaluate efficacy
      and safety of guselkumab for the treatment of participants with moderate to severe
      plaque-type psoriasis who had an inadequate response to ustekinumab. The study will consist
      of a screening period, open-label and double-blind treatment periods, and a follow-up
      period. The treatment period will have 2 phases: an open-label treatment phase during which
      all participants will receive ustekinumab at Weeks 0 and 4 and a blinded treatment phase
      during which participants with an inadequate Investigator's Global Assessment response
      (IGA≥2) to ustekinumab at Week 16 will be randomized to receive either guselkumab or
      ustekinumab through Week 44. Participants with an IGA response of 0 or 1 (cleared or minimal
      disease) at Week 16 will continue to receive open-label treatment with ustekinumab every 12
      weeks through Week 40. All participants will complete a follow-up phase through Week 52 for
      efficacy and through Week 60 for safety evaluations. The total duration of the study will be
      approximately 64 weeks (includes a 4-week screening period). Participants' safety will be
      monitored throughout the study.

    <measure>The number of visits at which participants achieve an Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) response of 0 or 1 and at least a 2 grade improvement (from Week 16) among randomized participants with an inadequate (IGA≥2) response to ustekinumab at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 28 through Week 40</time_frame>
    <description>The IGA documents the investigator's assessment of the participants psoriasis at a given time point. Overall lesions are graded for induration, erythema, and scaling on a scale of 0 to 4 (higher score = more severe). The participant's psoriasis is assessed as cleared (0), minimal (1), mild (2), moderate (3), or severe (4).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The number of visits at which participants achieve a Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 90 response from Week 28 through Week 40 among randomized participants with an inadequate (IGA≥2) response to ustekinumab at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 28 through Week 40</time_frame>
    <description>The PASI is a system used for assessing and grading the severity of psoriatic lesions and their response to therapy. In the PASI system, the body is divided into 4 regions: the head, trunk, upper extremities, and lower extremities. Each of these areas is assessed separately for erythema, induration, and scaling, which are each rated on a scale of 0 to 4. The PASI produces a numeric score that can range from 0 to 72. A higher score indicates more severe disease. A PASI 90 response represents participants achieving at least a 90% improvement from baseline in the PASI score.</description>

    <measure>The number of visits at which participants with an inadequate IGA response (IGA≥2) to ustekinumab at Week 16 who achieve a Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) of 0 or 1 among randomized participants with DLQI &gt;1 at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 28 through Week 40</time_frame>
    <description>The DLQI is a dermatology-specific quality of life instrument designed to assess the impact of the disease on a participant's quality of life. It is a 10-item PRO questionnaire that, in addition to evaluating overall quality of life, can be used to assess 6 different aspects that may affect quality of life: symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, work or school performance, personal relationships, and treatment. The DLQI produces a numeric score that can range from 0 to 30. A higher score indicates more severe disease.</description>

    <measure>The number of visits at which participants with an inadequate IGA response (IGA≥2) to ustekinumab at Week 16 who achieve a Psoriasis Symptom and Sign Diary (PSSD) symptom score of 0 among randomized participants with a PSSD symptom score ≥1 at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 28 through Week 40</time_frame>
    <description>The PSSD is a questionnaire designed to measure the severity of psoriasis symptoms and signs over the previous 7 days for the assessment of treatment benefit. The PSSD questionnaire includes 11 items covering symptoms (itch, pain, stinging, burning, and skin tightness) and patient-observable signs (skin dryness, cracking, scaling, shedding or flaking, redness and bleeding) using 0 to 10 numerical rating scales for severity. Two subscores will be derived: the psoriasis symptom score and the psoriasis sign score. A higher score indicates more severe disease.</description>
