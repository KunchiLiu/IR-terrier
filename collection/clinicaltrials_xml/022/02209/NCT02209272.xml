  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Local anesthesia is commonly used to reduce pain during joint injections, particularly for
      deep joints like the hip. Lidocaine is the most commonly used local anesthetic in most
      medical practices. It is well known that lidocaine infiltration itself is painful. Many
      strategies have been studied to minimize pain associated with lidocaine administration,
      including buffering, warming, and slowing infiltration rate. Bacteriostatic saline (BS) is
      an alternative local anesthetic that has been shown to be less painful when injected into
      subcutaneous tissues compared with lidocaine. However, BS use has not been widely
      implemented for local anesthesia, and it has not been studied in the context of joint
      injections. The purpose of this study is to compare infiltration pain and anesthetic
      efficacy between lidocaine and BS for ultrasound (US) guided intraarticular hip injections.
