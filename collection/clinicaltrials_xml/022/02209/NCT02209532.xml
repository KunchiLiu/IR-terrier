      This is a randomized, prospective, open label, multicenter study to assess the safety and
      utility of PINPOINT® Near Infrared Fluorescence Imaging (PINPOINT) in identification of
      lymph nodes (LN) in patients with uterine and cervical malignancies who are undergoing LN
      mapping.

    <description>The cervix will be injected 4 times with a 1ml solution of 1% Isosulfan blue followed by injection 4 times of 1 ml of 1.25 mg/ml solution of ICG. LN mapping with Blue dye will be performed until the investigator identifies all blue nodes or determines that blue nodes cannot be identified. Once complete, the Investigator will begin mapping with PINPOINT until all 'ICG' nodes are identified or the investigator determines that 'ICG' nodes cannot be identified. Once mapping with both Blue dye and PINPOINT have been completed and documented, LNs identified with Blue dye or PINPOINT will be excised.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  18 years of age or older

          -  Subjects with FIGO Clinical Stage I endometrial cancer undergoing minimally invasive
             hysterectomy with lymph node mapping.

          -  Subjects with FIGO Clinical Stage IA cervical cancer ≤ 2 cm in size undergoing
             minimally invasive hysterectomy, trachelectomy, or conization with lymph node
             mapping. Subjects with clinical Stage IA1 cervical cancer without lympho vascular
             space involvement (LVSI) and negative margins on cone biopsy are not to be included.

          -  Subjects with negative nodal status (N0)

          -  Subjects with negative metastatic involvement (M0).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have had prior dissection and/or radiation in pelvis.

          -  Advanced cervical or endometrial cancer, T3/T4 lesions

          -  Diagnosis of cervical cancer with a tumor size greater than 2 cm.

          -  Locally advanced or inflammatory cervical or uterine cancer

          -  Metastatic cervical or uterine cancer.

          -  Known allergy or history of adverse reaction to ICG, iodine or iodine dyes.

          -  Known allergy or history of adverse reaction to Blue dye (Isosulfan blue) or
             triphenylmethane.

          -  Hepatic dysfunction defined as MELD Score &gt; 12.

          -  Renal dysfunction defined as serum creatinine ≥ 2.0 mg/dl.

          -  Subjects who have participated in another investigational study within 30 days prior
             to surgery.

          -  Pregnant or lactating subjects.

          -  Subjects who, in the Investigator's opinion, have any medical condition that makes
             the subject a poor candidate for the investigational procedure, or interferes with
             the interpretation of study results.
