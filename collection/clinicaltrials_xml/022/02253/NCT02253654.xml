    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare two different dosing methods of epoetin alfa and
      their effectiveness in maintaining a Hemoglobin level between 10.0 to 11.0 g/dL.

      Study Hypothesis: An alternative dosing method to the United States package insert specified
      method can increase the percent of time Hemoglobin is within a prespecified range of 10.0
      to11.0 g/dL.

      To evaluate if an alternative dosing algorithm using epoetin alfa is superior in maintaining
      hemoglobin (Hb) within10.0 to11.0 g/dL in subjects with chronic kidney disease (CKD)
      receiving hemodialysis (HD) when compared to dosing consistent with the United States
      package insert (USPI)
