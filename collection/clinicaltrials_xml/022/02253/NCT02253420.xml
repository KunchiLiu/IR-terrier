  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In summary, copanlisib is metabolized mainly by the CYP3A4 enzyme, thus a study to evaluate
      potential DDI (drug-drug interaction) of copanlisib with concomitant CYP3A4 modulators such
      as Itraconazole (CYP3A4 inhibitor) and Rifampin (CYP3A4 inducer) is necessary. With this
      regard this study aims to evaluate the effect of Itraconazole or Rifampin on the absorbtion,
      distribution, metabolization and elimination of Copanlisib (BAY80-6946) . In addition, as
      parameters of cardiovascular safety , the effect of copanlisib on the heart's ability to
      pump blood and to rule out copanlisib's potential for causing a specific type of
      life-threatening arrhythmia, QT/QTc intervals and left ventricular ejection fraction will be
      evaluated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The PI3K/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway is one of the prominent pathways
      that promote cellular survival and constitutively is activated in many types of cancer.
      Class I PI3K receptor is downstream of most cancer associated tyrosine kinase growth factor
      receptors. PI3K inhibitors are expected to be effective not only in PI3K pathway-driven
      tumors but also in combination with other chemotherapy agents. The management of metabolic
      effects is an issue that must be addressed in the development of anticancer agents targeting
      the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway. Copanlisib (BAY 80-6946) is a novel PI3K inhibitor being
      developed for the treatment of advanced and refractory malignancies.

    <description>To evaluate the effect of Itraconazole on the pharmacokinetics of Copanlisib (BAY80-6946) and safety in patients with advanced solid tumor. Cycle 1 of the study will be conducted in 2 parts: Part 1 and part 2:
Part 1 of Cycle 1: 6 patients will be enrolled and will receive 12 mg of copanlisib on Day 1 and Day 15. Itraconazole 200 mg will be administered twice a day on Day 12 and then once daily from Days 13 to 21.
Part 2 of Cycle 1: 20 patients will be enrolled and receive copanlisib doses of either 12 mg, 30 mg or 60 mg on Days 1 and 15 with the same dose administered on both days. Copanlisib dose for Part 2 will be based on safety and copanlisib pharmacokinetics in Part 1. Itraconazole 200 mg will be administered twice a day on Day 12 and then once daily from Days 13 to 21.
Cycle 2 and subsequent cycles: All patients will receive copanlisib doses of 60 mg on Days 1, 8 and 15.</description>

Approximately 30 subjects will receive 60mg of copanlisib on Cycle 1 Day 1 and Cycle 1 Day 15. Rifampin will be administered once a day from Cycle 1 Day 10 to Day 21. Holter monitoring will be performed on Cycle 1 Day -1 and Cycle 1 Day 1 to evaluate the effect of copanlisib on the QT/QTc assessment.
Cycle 2 and subsequent cycles, all patients will receive copanlisib dose of 60 mg on Days 1, 8 and 15. Holter monitoring will be performed on Cycle 3 Day 1 and Cycle 6 Day 1.</description>
