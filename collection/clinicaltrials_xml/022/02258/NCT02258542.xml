  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to characterize the safety profile of benralizumab
      administration in asthma patients who have completed one of the three predecessor studies:
      D3250C00017, D3250C00018 or D3250C00020.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After a minimum of 1200 patients have been enrolled in this study, subsequent patients (up
      to a maximum of 2200 total for the study), who complete a minimum of 16 weeks, and no more
      than 40 weeks, in this study, will be given the option to transition to an open-label safety
      extension study, Study D3250C00037 (MELTEMI).

      Adolescent patients, patients from Japan and South Korea, and any patient who chooses not to
      enter Study D3250C00037 will remain in this study through IPD or EOT and FU.

             predecessor study on benralizumab or matching placebo.

          3. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must agree to use an effective form of birth
             control throughout the study duration and for 16 weeks after last dose of

               -  Influence the findings of the studies or their interpretations

             electrocardiogram (ECG), haematology, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis during a
             predecessor study which in the opinion of the investigator may put the patient at
             risk because of his/her participation in the study, or may influence the results of
             the study, or interfere with the patient's ability to complete the entire duration of
             the study

          4. Current malignancy or malignancy that developed during a predecessor study (subjects
             that had basal cell carcinoma, localized squamous cell carcinoma of the skin which
             was resected for cure, or in situ carcinoma of the cervix that has been treated/cured
             will not be excluded).

          5. Receipt of live attenuated vaccines within 30 days prior to initiation of treatment
             in this study, during the treatment period, and for 16 weeks (5 half-lives) after the
             last dose of the investigational product

          6. Receipt of immunoglobulin or blood products within 30 days prior to Visit 1

          7. Planned major surgical procedures during the conduct of the study

          8. Previous participation in the present study

          9. Concurrent enrolment in another clinical trial
