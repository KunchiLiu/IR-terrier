  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the immediate antimicrobial efficacy and persistence of two hand
      hygiene products on ICU Health Care Worker's skin flora by measuring bacterial organisms on
      hands using the hand print method. It is hypothesized that the product containing
      Chlorhexidine gluconate will provide more persistence than the alcohol product, resulting in
      less bacterial growth on the hand print plates. In addition, environmental monitoring for
      cleanliness will be captured from high touch surfaces in ICU patient rooms and common areas
      using Rodac plates and adenosine triphosphate tests.

      Crossover study with 50 Health care workers using each product with a minimum of 3 days in
      between. Products will be applied twice as per manufacturer's instructions for a Healthcare
      Personnel Handwash followed by immediate hand print. Persistent hand prints will be
      collected after exposure to environmental contaminants in the common areas. Hand prints will
      also be collected from one hand of 60 patients cared for by a participating Health Care
      Worker and gloved hand of Health Care Worker. All media contain neutralizers to inactivate
      active ingredients in each product and on surfaces. Each hand print plate's area of growth
      will be measured for Colony Forming Units using computerized software.

    <description>HCWs will be randomized to use one product on one day and the other product on another day at least 3 days apart. Each product will be applied using 1 pump from its dispenser and rubbed over the hands until dry. Gloves will be worn while the HCW is in the patient room. Upon exit from the room, HCW will washoout with that same product. One imprint will be made of the non-dominant hand onto media containing neutralizers. That hand will be gloved with a white cotton glove. The HCW will work in the common areas with timing recorded. Upon leaving the common area, the dominant ungloved hand will be imprinted onto a fresh media plate containing neutralizers.</description>
