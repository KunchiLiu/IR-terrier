  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This proposal is a prospective, randomized, double-blinded study to evaluate the efficacy of
      hyaluronic acid (HA) injections for chronic lateral epicondylitis (LE). HA has traditionally
      been used to treat knee osteoarthritis. There are a small number of studies in the
      literature that suggest that HA injections can be very effective for tendinosis. Although LE
      has been studied with literally hundreds of articles published, very little treatment has
      proven to be efficacious. This study will investigate the effectiveness of hyaluronate in
      treatment of chronic LE. This will include a three arm study with two formulations of HA
      tested against saline injections as the control.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be randomized and blinded into one of the two active injections versus the
      control injection. Patients will receive 3 injections total spaced over a 4 week period.
      After the injections are completed, patients will return for evaluation at 3, 6 and 12
      months from the initial injection. A total of 120 patients will be divided into the 3
      groups. The questionnaires will be administered by a research assistant blinded to the
      randomization. Three different outcomes measures will be collected, all patient-oriented
      including the Patient Rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation (PRTEE), Visual Analog Score (VAS) for
      pain while at rest and with maximum grip, and the short form Disabilities of the Arm,
      Shoulder and Hand (quickDASH).

      The primary outcome measure will be the VAS for pain at 3 months from the initial injection.
      All measures will be evaluated at baseline then again at 12 months from the initial
      injection.

      HA formulations will be either Intragel (IBSA) or Arthrease (Ferring). Both will include 2cc
      for each injection with a concentration of 16mg per 2cc for Intragel and 20mg per 2cc for
      Arthrease. The formulations differ with regards to molecular weight with Intragel averaging
      800-1200 kiloDaltons (KDalton) and Arthrease averaging 3000 kDaltons.

      The syringes will be coded and the injections blinded. The injections will be given 1cm
      distal to the lateral epicondyle at the site of maximum tenderness. The needle will be
      introduced to the depth of the bone then withdrawn 1-2mm. The injection will be given in two
      locations in and around the point of maximum tenderness.

    <measure>Patient Rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation (PRTEE): Change from Baseline to value at 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline then 3,6 and 12 months from baseline.</time_frame>
    <description>This is a 15 question validated survey, specific to tennis elbow. It is composed of a pain and function measure. The best score of 0 represents no pain and maximum function.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual Analogue Score (VAS) for pain at rest.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline then 3, 6, and 12 months from baseline.</time_frame>
    <description>For this VAS pain score, patients will be asked to rate their pain using the following standard question: &quot;How much pain do you feel when doing an activity that involves gripping such as shaking hands, opening a jar or carrying something?&quot;. They will then score their level of pain using the VAS.</description>

    <description>The QuickDASH is a shortened version of the DASH Outcome Measure. Instead of 30 items, the QuickDASH uses 11 items to measure physical function and symptoms in people with any or multiple musculoskeletal disorders of the upper limb.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Included will be patients older than 18 years with lateral epicondylitis. The
             criteria for diagnosis will include pain and tenderness at the lateral epicondyle
             worse with resisted wrist or finger extension (with the elbow in the extended
             position).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Excluded will be patients with history of prior elbow surgery, history of fracture or
             dislocation, known inflammatory or autoimmune disorders, or known hypersensitivity to
             HA.

          -  Exclusion will also include a known allergy to birds, feathers or egg products. If
             the patient has complaints of pain or tenderness on exam in the area of the radial
             neck, then a component of radial tunnel syndrome will be assumed and these patients
             will be excluded from study.

          -  Patients that are pregnant will be excluded.
