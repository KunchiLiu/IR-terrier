    <textblock>
      The purpose of this Phase II dose-ranging study is to investigate pharmacokinetic (PK) and
      pharmacodynamic (PD) properties of various doses of ticagrelor followed by 4 weeks of
      twice-daily treatment in paediatric patients with sickle cell disease

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, dose-ranging study of ticagrelor followed by a double
      blind, placebo-controlled extension phase in paediatric patients with sickle cell disease
      (SCD).

      Part A: Patients will be randomised 1:1 to receive one of two dosing schedules consisting of
      two single weight-adjusted doses of ticagrelor. Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters and
      pharmacodynamic (PD) measurements will be determined following each dose. Platelet
      aggregation will be measured using the VerifyNow™ P2Y12 assay.

      Following these 2 single doses, all patients will receive open-label one-week treatment with
      ticagrelor twice daily to determine tolerability prior to randomisation into Part B.

      Part B: In this part patients will be randomised (2:1 ratio) to ticagrelor twice daily or
      placebo for a 4-week treatment phase.

      During the study, patients will be followed for the occurrence of vaso-occlusive crisis
      (VOC) and for other disease manifestations such as daily pain, analgesic use and
      complications of SCD.
