  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is designed to investigate brain response using fMRI scan, and
      behavioral responses, to treatment with the drug carbamazepine (CBZ) in patients with the
      painful sodium channelopathy inherited Erythromelalgia (IEM). This study is designed to
      identify the central nervous system (CNS) regions that are activated during ongoing or
      evoked pain attacks, and the altered CNS response to CBZ treatment. This will advance our
      understanding of how IEM affects the brain. We also hope to validate a pharmacogenic
      approach to the study of IEM by use of an FDA approved drug. We hope, but cannot be sure,
      that subjects will directly benefit from this study.
