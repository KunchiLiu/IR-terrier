  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label long-term safety and efficacy study will provide an opportunity for LC-FAOD
      patients to be treated with UX007 for up to 3 years or until market approval under a single
      standardized protocol. The subjects may have participated in other studies or treatment
      programs with UX007/triheptanoin but would be consolidated into one program for long-term
      maintenance and consistent safety monitoring. The study is designed to obtain long-term
      safety information and evaluate maintenance of efficacy in a diverse LC-FAOD population.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female, 6 months of age or older

          2. Prior participation in a clinical study assessing UX007/triheptanoin treatment for
             LC-FAOD. Patients who received UX007/triheptanoin treatment as part of other clinical
             studies, investigator sponsored trials (IST), or expanded access/compassionate use
             treatment programs; or patients who have failed conventional therapy and, in the
             opinion of the investigator and sponsor, have documented severe unmet need, may also
             be eligible at the discretion of the sponsor.

          3. Confirmed diagnosis of LC-FAOD including: carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT I or
             CPT II) deficiency, very long chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (VLCAD) deficiency, long
             chain 3-hydroxy-acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (LCHAD) deficiency, trifunctional protein
             (TFP) deficiency, or carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase (CACT) deficiency.
             Information on diagnosis will be obtained from medical records and should include
             confirmed diagnosis by results of acylcarnitine profiles, fatty acid oxidation probe
             studies in cultured fibroblasts, and/or mutation analysis.

          4. Willing and able to complete all aspects of the study through the end of the study,
             including visits and tests, documentation of symptoms and diet, and administration of
             study medications. If a minor, have a caregiver(s) willing and able to assist in all
             applicable study requirements.

          5. Provide written informed consent (subjects aged ≥ 18 years), or provide written
             assent (where appropriate) and have a legally authorized representative willing and
             able to provide written informed consent, after the nature of the study has been
             explained and prior to any research-related procedures.

          6. Females who have reached menarche must have a negative pregnancy test at Baseline and
             be willing to have additional pregnancy tests during the study.

          7. Participants of child‐bearing potential or with partners of child-bearing potential
             who have not undergone a bilateral salpingo‐oophorectomy and are sexually active must
             consent to use a highly effective method of contraception as determined by the site
             investigator (i.e. oral hormonal contraceptives, patch hormonal contraceptives,
             vaginal ring, intrauterine device, physical double barrier methods, surgical
             hysterectomy, vasectomy, tubal ligation or true abstinence [when this is in line with
             the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject], which means not having sex because
             the subject chooses not to), from the period following the signing of the informed
             consent through 30 days after last dose of study drug.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Diagnosis of medium-chain acyl coenzyme A dehydrogenase (MCAD) deficiency, short- or
             medium-chain FAOD, ketone body metabolism defect, propionic acidemia or methylmalonic
             acidemia

          2. Patient qualifies for any other clinical trial designed to progressively evaluate the
             safety and efficacy of triheptanoin in LC-FAOD

        2. History of serious adverse reactions or known hypersensitivity to triheptanoin 3.
        Pregnant and/or breastfeeding an infant at Screening or planning to become pregnant (self
        or partner) at any time during the study 4. Have any co-morbid conditions, including
        unstable major organ-system disease(s) that in the opinion of the Investigator, places the
        subject at increased risk of complications, interferes with study participation or
        compliance, or confounds study objectives, or unwilling to discontinue prohibited
        medications.
