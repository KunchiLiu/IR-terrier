      The Sentinel System will be a safe and effective method for capturing and removing embolic
      material (thrombus/debris) during transcatheter aortic valve replacement in order to reduce
      the ischemic burden in the cerebral anterior circulation.

      The Sentinel™ Cerebral Protection System is indicated for use as an embolic capture and
      retrieval system intended to reduce the ischemic burden in the cerebral anterior circulation
      while performing transcatheter aortic valve replacement.

      The objective of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of the Claret Medical
      Sentinel Cerebral Protection System used for embolic protection during Transcatheter Aortic
      Valve Replacement (TAVR) compared to TAVR standard of care (without embolic protection).

      The study population is comprised of subjects with severe symptomatic calcified native
      aortic valve stenosis who meet the commercially approved indications for TAVR with the
      Edwards SAPIEN THV or SAPIEN XT and comply with the inclusion/exclusion criteria.

    <description>Reduction in median total new lesion volume in protected territories between the Imaging Arms (Test and Control Group) as assessed by DW-MRI at Day 4-7 post-procedure.
Total new lesion volume is defined as the sum of all diffusion-positive new cerebral lesions in post-procedural DW-MRI relative to the pre-TAVR DW-MRI scans.
Protected territories are defined as brain territories uniquely perfused by the vessels protected by the Sentinel System, namely the left and right carotid arteries, and the right vertebral artery.</description>
