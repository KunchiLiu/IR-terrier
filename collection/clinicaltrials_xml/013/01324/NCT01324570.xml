    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria include:

          -  Male and female patients, 7 to 16 years of age, inclusive, with malignant and/or
             nonmalignant moderate to severe pain requiring or anticipated to require continuous,
             around-the-clock, opioid treatment for at least 2 weeks (based on the investigator's
             judgment);

          -  Patients must have written informed consent provided by the parent or legal guardian
             and assent provided by the patient, when appropriate;

          -  Patients on incoming opioids must be taking ≤ 80 mg morphine or equivalent if aged 12
             to 16 years or ≤ 40 mg morphine or equivalent if aged 7 to 11 years prior to
             initiation with BTDS treatment;

          -  Patients must be able to understand and complete the age appropriate scale to rate
             pain intensity, ie, patients must not have a cognitive developmental delay or any
             other condition that would preclude them from completing age appropriate pain scale;

          -  Patients with malignant and/or nonmalignant medical conditions causing moderate to
             severe pain requiring continuous, around-the-clock opioid analgesic therapy such as
             cancer, sickle-cell disease (eg, resulting in persistent body pain, persistent limb
             pain, avascular necrosis, persistent abdominal pain), persistent orthopedic pain (eg,
             spinal injury, spinal disc herniation, persistent limb/stump pain, major trauma),
             juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (pain not controlled by therapy treating the underlying
             disease), and cystic fibrosis resulting in persistent chest pain;

          -  Patients must have a parent/caregiver who is willing and able to be compliant with
             the protocol, capable of patient evaluation, able to read and understand
             questionnaires, willing and able to use a diary, and able to read, understand, and
             sign the written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria include:

          -  Patients who are allergic to buprenorphine or have a history of allergies to other
             opioids (this criterion does not include patients who have experienced common opioid
             side effects [eg, nausea, constipation]);

          -  Patients who have allergies or other contraindications to transdermal delivery
             systems or patch adhesives;

          -  Patients with a dermatological disorder at any relevant patch application site that
             would preclude proper placement and/or rotation of BTDS patches;

          -  Patients with evidence of impaired renal function;

          -  Patients with hepatic impairment;

          -  Patients with history of seizures;

          -  Patients who have a history of sleep apnea within the past year;

          -  Patients with unstable respiratory disease;

          -  Patients with structural heart disease or a pacemaker;

          -  Patients with clinically unstable cardiac disease;

          -  Patients who, in the opinion of the investigator, are unsuitable to participate in
             this study for any reason;

          -  Patients who receive or anticipate to receive investigational medication/therapy
             during study drug treatment period.

        Other protocol-specific inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.
