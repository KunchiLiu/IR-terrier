  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a medication called Vyvanse®
      (lisdexamfetamine; LDX) has an impact on cognitive functioning, specifically measures of
      sustained attention, verbal encoding and recall and working memory, in menopausal aged
      women. LDX is a medication used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
      The cognitive difficulties that menopausal women report experiencing are typical of adults
      who are diagnosed with ADHD. The investigators will assess whether or not LDX is effective
      in alleviating those cognitive disruptions when compared to a placebo.

    <description>The primary objective of this study is to reduce subjective symptoms of executive function impairment in peri and early postmenopausal women who are concerned about their &quot;memory&quot; and/or &quot;cognition.&quot; Subjective assessment of executive functioning such as a sustained attention, focus, organization, working memory and motivation for work/activities will be assessed with our primary outcome variable, the Brown Attention Deficit Disorder Scale (BADDS; Brown, 1996, Harcourt Brace &amp; Co.).</description>

    <description>The secondary objective of this study is to determine whether LDX improves performance on objective measures of sustained attention, verbal recall and working memory. This will be measured using a battery of cognitive tasks aimed at assessing sustained attention, verbal encoding and recall, and verbal working memory. These tasks include the STROOP test; NYU Paragraph Recall Test; Spatial Span Forward and Spatial Span Backward from the Wechsler Memory Scale; 3-Back Task; and Verbal Paired Associates II.</description>
