    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate change in heart muscle function from baseline to three months and
      twelve months in participants who present with a heart attack and a completely occluded
      coronary artery. These subjects will be randomized to receive standard Percutaneous
      transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA)/Stenting to open the artery or routine
      PTCA/Stenting plus post conditioning. Post conditioning commences immediately upon
      reperfusion using four cycles of thirty second inflations with a standard angioplasty
      balloon followed by a thirty seconds of reperfusion. The investigators hypothesize that
      Postconditioning reduces the size of the heart attack when utilized with successful primary
      Angioplasty/stent.

      Single center study involving 140 patients randomized to Post Conditioning + Percutaneous
      coronary intervention (PCI) versus routine PCI during their ST-Elevation Myocardial
      Infarction (STEMI, Heart Attack) presentation. The Post Conditioning protocol consists of
      performing four, 30-second PTCA (Angioplasty) balloon occlusions followed by 30-seconds of
      reperfusion over a total of 4 minutes. The first balloon inflation occurs immediately after
      an angioplasty guidewire is placed through the obstruction in the artery. Following this
      protocol the vessel is stented as part of the usual practice for treatment of STEMI. No
      other treatment differences will occur between the two groups and all patients will receive
      the usual post-STEMI care. Patients in both groups will receive a cardiac MRI 3-5 days
      following their STEMI for measurement of heart attack size and heart muscle function, among
      other measures. Patients will undergo collection of blood for CK MB and troponin I every 8
      hours for 24 hours following PCI. All patients will be followed by phone follow-up visits to
      review history and MACE (death, recurrent STEMI, repeat revascularization, arrhythmias, ICD
      placement and hospitalization for CHF). All patients will be required to take P2Y12
      inhibitors and aspirin for the duration of the trial. All patients will be treated with
      ACEI, beta blockers and statins.
