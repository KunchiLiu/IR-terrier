  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to compare the clinical and radiographic outcomes of
      multi-level laminectomy to multi-level laminoplasty in the treatment of patients with
      cervical myelopathy or myeloradiculopathy. The hypothesis for the study is that the
      laminoplasty group is not inferior to the laminectomy group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Historically, cervical laminectomy has been proven to be effective in the treatment of
      symptomatic patients with cervical myelopathy. This standard procedure is employed to
      accomplish posterior decompression of the cervical spinal cord in patients with multi-level
      cervical spinal stenosis who have normal or near normal cervical spinal curvature and
      alignment without associated instability. Laminoplasty was developed in Japan as an
      alternative to the laminectomy procedure with the intent to reduce post-operative morbidity
      after dorsal cervical spinal cord decompression, neck pain and to maintain the relative
      stability of the cervical spine after multi-level decompression.

      The goal of both the laminoplasty and laminectomy procedures is to provide spinal cord
      decompression by enlargement of the spinal canal. A potential benefit of laminoplasty
      compared to laminectomy is to preserve stability and range of motion of the cervical spine
      without complete disruption/removal of the posterior laminae, spinous processes and
      interspinous ligamentous structures. Various authors have described different laminoplasty
      techniques; all preserve the lamina and expand the size of the spinal canal by fixing the
      freed or partially freed lamina in a more posterior position.

      The primary study hypothesis is that, patients treated with laminoplasty with ARCH fixation
      (Treatment Group) have clinical and radiographic outcomes as assessed by valid outcomes
      measures, is not inferior to patients treated with laminectomy (Control Group)
