  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the trial is to determine the short-term effects of dose regimens of
      tolvaptan studied in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) at
      various levels of renal function.

      This trial will characterize the effects of tolvaptan at steady-state in subjects with
      eGFR(Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate

      ) &gt;60, 60-30 and &lt;30 mL/min*1.73 m2 and is designed to provide data to support the continued
      use or new introduction of tolvaptan in subjects with renal impairment due to ADPKD.

      Subjects titrated to the highest possible split-dose of tolvaptan used in studies with ADPKD
      patients will be assessed for the actions of the drug on renal hemodynamics, pharmacokinetic
      and pharmacodynamic parameters in subjects with various levels of renal function. The
      reversibility of changes after withdrawal of the drug will be determined. Acute transitory
      effects on kidney volume will also be explored.
