  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dabrafenib is a potent and selective inhibitor of BRAF kinase activity. This is a Phase II,
      non-randomized, open-label study to assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of
      dabrafenib administered as a single agent and in combination with trametinib in stage IV
      disease to subjects with BRAF mutant advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Subjects will
      receive dabrafenib 150 mg twice daily (BID) in monotherapy treatment and dabrafenib 150 mg
      bid and trametinib 2 mg once daily in combination therapy and continue on treatment until
      disease progression, death, or unacceptable adverse event.
