  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute pain management is challenging in patients after spinal fusions, particularly since
      most have taken analgesics for prolonged periods before choosing the surgical alternative.
      Many of these patients are either preoperatively or become after surgery narcotic dependent.
      In addition, the narcotic based anesthetic required for the procedure, may induce a
      postoperative hyper-analgesia which may be partially responsible for the acute postoperative
      pain which is refractory to traditional doses of narcotics. Both the persistent nociceptive
      and neuropathic pain which these patients experience and narcotic-induced hyper-analgesia is
      mediated via non-conventional neural pathways. It is for these reasons, that in these
      patients postoperative pain is refractory to narcotic treatment. Postoperative pain in this
      situation is best managed using a multimodal approach. This technique allows the application
      of a number of treatment modalities which maximize pain reduction and minimize treatment
      side effects.

      Pregabalin (Lyrica) has been shown to be effective in the treatment of neuropathic pain.
      Pregabalin has a similar mechanism of action as gabapentin. Notably it has a rapid
      consistent absorption, linear pharmacokinetics, and a low potential for pharmacokinetic drug
      interactions. Hence, pregabalin should be a beneficial addition to the multi-modal pain
      regimen after spinal surgery; particularly in narcotic tolerant patients who respond poorly
      to conventional narcotic analgesics after surgery.

      Hypothesis: Patients treated with Pregabalin after posterior-spinal fusions will have: 1)
      reduced pain at rest and with physical therapy, and 2) reduced narcotic requirements with
      fewer narcotic related side-effects than controls treated with Pregabalin. This may result
      in a shorter hospital stay (the mean length of stay for 1-2 level posterior lumbar-sacral
      fusions with instrumentation at our institution is 4.9±2 days).

    <description>We will record patients' pain scores (on scale of 0-10) while at rest, during activity (e.g. physical therapy) and with narcotic use for up to 14 days following the day of surgery. We anticipate that patients who receive pregabalin will have reduced pain scores.</description>

    <description>Patients in the control group will receive a placebo tablet with a sip of water one hour prior to surgery and a placebo tablet twice a day for a total of two weeks.
Postoperative pain will be assessed daily until discharge using a verbal Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) at rest and during physical therapy, by both physical therapists and blinded research assistants.
All narcotics (i.v. PCA, oral or IM/SQ rescue doses) will be tabulated during their hospital stay, and patients will be asked to document their oral narcotic use after discharge.
On the day of discharge, patients will be given a self report data sheet, in which they will be asked to record their daily pain level at rest, with movement, and whether their pain interfered with sleep.</description>
