  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate whether administration of two investigational malaria vaccines
      (257049 and Ad35.CS.01 vaccines) combined in one immunization schedule increases protection
      against malaria infection as compared to protection induced by the 257049 vaccine alone. The
      study will also evaluate the safety and the immune response to the new combination of the
      two experimental malaria vaccines.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 168 healthy, malaria-naïve volunteers aged 18 - 50 years, divided into 2
      groups (84 in each group), will receive either one dose of Ad35.CS.01 followed by two doses
      of 257049 at monthly intervals or 3 doses of 257049 vaccine at monthly intervals. Of these,
      a maximum of 138 vaccinated volunteers will be challenged with P. falciparum infected
      mosquitoes. The challenge will occur 2 weeks following the third immunization. A group of up
      to 18 infectivity controls will begin participation in the study at the challenge stage.
      These controls receive no vaccine and are enrolled for malaria-challenge only in order to
      provide comparison group for vaccinated individuals.
