      This is a single institution study of fludarabine and busulfan versus fludarabine, busulfan
      and low dose total body irradiation in patients undergoing allogeneic stem cell
      transplantation. A study population of 80 subjects will be enrolled from The John Theurer
      Cancer Center at Hackensack University Medical Center. Subjects who are eligible to receive
      allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation according to the eligibility criteria
      will be consented and enrolled. Subjects will be randomly assigned to receive one of 2
      conditioning regimen: fludarabine and busulfan, or fludarabine busulfan and low dose total
      body irradiation (TBI). Subjects will be followed until 1 year post transplantation to
      assess the relapse rate in each arm and transplant-related toxicity.

      The combination of fludarabine and busulfan is the current standard of care for patients
      with myeloid malignancies (AML, CML and other myeloproliferative disorders, or MDS)
      undergoing allogeneic transplantation at HUMC. In this study we will be comparing in a
      randomized fashion the standard regimen to a regimen of fludarabine, busulfan and TBI.

      assess the relapse rate in each arm and transplant-related toxicity.

      The combination of fludarabine and busulfan is the current standard of care for patients
      with myeloid malignancies (myelogenous leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, other
      myeloproliferative disorder, or myelodysplastic syndrome) undergoing allogeneic
      transplantation at HUMC. In this study we will be comparing in a randomized fashion the
      standard regimen to a regimen of fludarabine, busulfan and TBI.

      Primary Objective The primary objective is to compare the relapse rate at 1 year of patients
      with myeloid malignancies receiving each regimen.

      Secondary Objectives The secondary objective is to compare the toxicity of each regimen
