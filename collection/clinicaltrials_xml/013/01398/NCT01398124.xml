  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite recent advances in the treatment of patients with resected NSCLC, disease recurrence
      and mortality related to lung cancer are common among patients with early stage non-small
      cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Therefore novel approaches are necessary to improve the outcome
      for early stage NSCLC. The preclinical studies conducted with vaccine based approaches
      provide the rationale to evaluate this as an adjunct to surgery for patients with early
      stage NSCLC. Administration of the vaccine before surgery will also allow for the evaluation
      of the tumor specimen for immunological responses to the vaccine.

      In the currently proposed study, patients will receive the first dose of the vaccine
      approximately 2 weeks prior to surgery. The second dose will be administered about 3-4 weeks
      following surgery. A booster dose of the vaccine will be given 6 months after the 2nd
      vaccine. The tumor tissue and serum will be studied for immunological responses following
      therapy with the vaccine. Patients are allowed to receive adjuvant chemotherapy if
      indicated. The choice of the chemotherapy regimen will be at the discretion of the treating
      physician, preferably 3-4 cycles of platinum combination regimen. The vaccine should be
      administered at least 2 weeks before chemotherapy is initiated.

          -  Men and women of childbearing potential must be willing to use effective
             contraception while on treatment and for at least 3 months thereafter.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent
             document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents.

          -  Patients should not have received chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 3 months prior
             to entry to study.

          -  Patients with tumors involving the superior sulcus are not eligible.

          -  Patients must not have post-obstructive pneumonia or other serious infection at the
