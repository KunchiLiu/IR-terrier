  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to assess the effect of three formulations on the relative
      bioavailability of LY3009104. Subjects will receive single dose of LY3009104 on 4 separate
      occasions with and without food. Safety evaluation and serial Pharmacokinetic (PK) samples
      will be collected during each treatment period. Approximately 5-7 days of washout period
      between each treatment and a follow-up visit will occur approximately 5 to 7 days after the
      last dose of study drug.
