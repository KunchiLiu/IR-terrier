  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      More patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) die from cardiovascular
      disease than direct pulmonary complications. Inflammation and oxidative stress,
      characteristic in COPD, are likely contributors to the reduction in nitric oxide (NO)
      bioavailability and vascular endothelial dysfunction in COPD patients; however, this has yet
      to be determined. Thus, the overall objective of this proposal is to identify the role of NO
      bioavailability in contributing to vascular endothelial dysfunction in patients with COPD
      and to provide insight into the molecular mechanisms involved. Our central hypothesis is
      that inflammation and oxidative stress, both independently, contribute to the reduction in
      NO bioavailability and vascular endothelial dysfunction in patients with COPD.

      Testing All participants will initially be screened over the telephone to determine
      eligibility. After satisfying eligibility requirements, they will be asked to come in for a
      preliminary testing day. For each individual protocol, at least 2 study visits will be
      required (preliminary day and experimental day). The specific techniques for the study are
      underlined and presented below. Participants will arrive early on each testing day, having
      abstained from tobacco, vitamin supplementation, and exercise for at least 12 hours prior to
      investigation. Blood draws and measurements of vascular function will be performed at
      baseline and following each protocol (Aim 1A &amp; B, 2A &amp; B). The P.I., phlebotomist, or
      research assistant who is certified in drawing blood will collect a total blood sample equal
      to approximately 80ml (40ml pre and 40ml post), or about 5-6 tablespoons.

      Prescreening-Phone Screening - A phone screening form will be used with participants who
      wish to be involved in the research study. The study will be explained to all subjects and
      if they wish to continue they will be asked for their contact information and determine if
      exclusions apply. Subjects who are eligible will be scheduled for the initial preliminary
      day of testing.

      Preliminary Testing Day - All subjects will be asked to report to the laboratory following
      an overnight fast having abstained from exercise for at least 12 hours and vitamin
      supplementation for at least 72 hours prior to investigation. Following the initial
      telephone screening, all eligible subjects will sign a consent form and undergo a
      preliminary day of testing. The preliminary day will be utilized to assess 1) medical health
      history, 2) body composition, 3) pulmonary function, 4) maximal skeletal muscle function, 5)
      brachial ankle index as an assessment of peripheral vascular disease (PVD) and to
      familiarize each subject with the protocols of the study. Hematocrit and hemoglobin will be
      determined by finger stick to rule out anemia. A physical activity questionnaire (IPAQ) will
      be administered to all subjects to quantify physical activity status. Ankle-brachial index
      will be performed on all subjects to characterize the severity of peripheral artery disease
      (PAD).

      Subject/Medical Information Form - This form summarizes information about the subject's
      contact information, personal information, family and medical history information, and
      height and weight. If there is any concern regarding any information presented in the
      medical health history form, the subject's physician or our medical director may be
      consulted. Completion of this questionnaire should take approximately 10 minutes.

      Body Composition - Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) is the latest technology in
      detecting bone mineral density, bone mineral content, and lean and fat mass. The DXA scan is
      a non-invasive &amp; painless procedure and will be performed during the preliminary testing
      day. The DXA (Hologic Discovery W using Hologic Apex Software, 2.3.1) will be used to
      measure bone mineral density and body fat composition through the use of a very low level of
      radiation (Two scans is equivalent to three days of background radiation exposed from daily
      routines). Participants will be asked to remove all items that may contain metal including:
      jewelry, belts, shoes, ear and body piercings, etc. Gowns will be available for those who
      need to remove clothing. Participants will be instructed to lay on the padded platform and
      remain still until the platform stops moving. The DXA has been approved and performed in
      numerous protocols before (HAC#: 0901159, 0711123, etc.). Female participants will be
      advised that urine pregnancy testing will be done on prior to DXA testing to meet the
      inclusion criteria of only non-pregnant females in this study. Body Mass Index (BMI; kg/m2)
      will be calculated using height (m) measured to the nearest 0.1 cm and weight (kg) measured
      to the nearest 0.05 kg. Both height and weight will be taken without shoes and wearing as
      few clothes as possible. Waist to Hip Ratio (WHR) will be measured using an inelastic vinyl
      tape measure (Creative Health Products, Ann Arbor, MI). The site for the waist will be the
      horizontal plane, at the level of the narrowest part of the torso, between the 10th rib and
      the iliac crest; with the subject standing erect, arms by the side, and feet together, and
      relaxing their abdomen. The site for the hips will be the horizontal plane at the level of
      the maximal extension of the buttocks; with the subject standing erect. Three measurements
      will be taken to the nearest 0.1 cm at each site. The average of the three measurements will
      be used to calculate the WHR. The total duration of these assessments is approximately 45
      minutes.

      Pulmonary Function Test (PFT) - A routine pulmonary function test will be conducted on all
      subjects using spirometry. Each subject will be instructed to perform a forced expiration
      maneuver in which the subject will be asked to expire all the air into the spirometer as
      forcefully and rapidly as possible.

      Ankle Brachial Index (ABI) - This test is done by measuring the blood pressure in both the
      arm and near the ankle. The ABI is used to screen for peripheral vascular disease and will
      be used to control for confounding PVD in our subjects.

      Flow-Mediated Dilation (FMD) - Subjects will lie in the supine position for 20 minutes to
      obtain hemodynamic steady state. A blood pressure cuff (Hokanson) will be placed around the
      forearm (distal to the Doppler transducer) and rapidly inflated to 250 mmHg for 5 minutes
      (circulatory arrest). Simultaneous ultrasound images of the vessel (B-mode) and Doppler
      waveforms will be collected 10 seconds prior to and for 2 minutes following deflation of the
      cuff. All B-mode images will be analyzed using automated edge detection software (Medical
      Imaging Applications), while intensity weighted velocity spectra segments will be saved to
      the GE Logiq 7 hard drive for off-line blood velocity waveform analysis. P.I. has utilized
      the traditional method of brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD) induced by reactive
      hyperemia to assess vascular endothelial function in populations ranging from young healthy
      adults to older adults with pathological conditions47,58,59.

      Carotid Artery Health (IMT) - Immediately following FMD assessments, B-mode ultrasonography
      will be used on both the right and left carotid arteries to determine the thickness of the
      intima-media interface. Automated edge detection software (Medical Imaging Applications)
      will be used for the analysis.

      Carotid Artery Compliance (CAC) - After 20 minutes of rest in the supine position, carotid
      artery compliance will be determined non-invasively using high-resolution ultrasonography
      (Vivid 7, General Electric) and simultaneous applanation tonometry (Millar Instruments,
      Inc.) of the contralateral carotid artery [9,10,11]. Briefly, carotid artery diameters will
      be measured ~2 cm proximal to the carotid bulb with the transducer placed at a 90Â° angle to
      the vessel. Images will be recorded via frame grabber for subsequent off-line analysis of
      maximal diameters (i.e., systolic expansion) and minimal diameters (e.g., diastolic
      relaxation) corresponding to carotid artery pressure waveforms with vascular image analysis
      software (Medical Imaging Applications, LLC). High-fidelity carotid artery pressure
      waveforms will be recorded from the contralateral carotid artery with a pen-like applanation
      tonometer probe and recorded via data acquisition software (WinDaq, Inc). This technique
      provides waveforms with the same harmonic content as those obtained invasively in humans.
      The carotid blood pressure waveform will be calibrated to brachial mean and diastolic blood
      pressure as previously described [10, 11]. Dr. Pierce has ~3 years of experience in
      performing the carotid artery ultrasound and ~7 years performing applanation tonometry of
      the large arteries. He will be responsible for performing the ultrasound and training a
      research assistant to perform the applanation tonometry. All image and waveform analyses
      will be performed by the same investigator, who will be blinded to the identity of the
      subjects.

      Active Hyperemia Induced Flow-Mediated Dilation (Skeletal Muscle Function) - Performing
      localized exercise eliminates the systemic pulmonary limitation and allows for skeletal
      muscle function in patients with COPD to be compared to healthy controls. During the
      preliminary day, each subject will undergo a graded maximal plantar flexion exercise test
      (lower leg) to volitional fatigue. For each treatment day, a similar graded exercise test
      will be performed in addition to obtaining absolute progressive work rates of 2, 4, and 6
      watts for each subject. Each work rate will be performed for approximately 3 minutes to
      obtain steady state. Simultaneous B-mode images and Doppler waveforms to assess diameter and
      velocity of the popliteal artery(lower leg), respectively, will be collected for the last 45
      seconds of each work rate. Heart rate and oxygen saturation will be assessed throughout the
      exercise.

      Spygmocor - Pulse Wave Velocity (PWV) - A SpygmocorÂ® device will be used at baseline and
      following each protocol to assess PWV. PWV analysis provides a non-invasive assessment of
      arterial stiffness. Increased arterial stiffness is known to be associated with
      cardiovascular disease [13, 14, 15]. The participant is required to lie in a resting
      position for approximately 30-45 minutes. The research assistant will place ECG electrode
      sensors at the carotid, femoral, radial and distal artery locations. A highly sensitive
      pen-like device, called a tonometer, is then gently applied to record the velocity of the
      blood flow between each of the points.

      Blood Samples (pre and post protocols) - A 40 ml sample of venous blood will be drawn pre
      and post protocol by the P.I. or certified technician via sterile techniques and transferred
      into EDTA and SST tubes for analysis of HDL-cholesterol, total cholesterol, triglycerides,
      calculated LDL, and glucose by the Cholestech analyzer unit (Hayward, California) and other
      laboratory bioassays described below. When applicable (all protocols other than #3), to
      avoid multiple needle sticks a venous catheter will be placed into the subjects arm.
      Following each blood draw, and every 1-2 hours, approximately 3cc of injectable sterile
      saline will be flushed and locked into the catheter to maintain patency (saline block).
