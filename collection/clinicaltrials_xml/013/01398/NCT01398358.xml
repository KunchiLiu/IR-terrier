    <textblock>
      The goal of this integrated project targeting the Childhood Obesity Prevention Challenge
      Area is to reduce the prevalence of obesity among children attending Head Start in Michigan.
      The proposed intervention program is based on Social Cognitive theory and the premise that
      enhancing children's capacity for emotional and behavioral self-regulation is a key
      component of effective obesity prevention. A randomized controlled trial design is proposed
      to evaluate, among 600 Head Start children and their parents, the effectiveness of 2
      approaches to obesity prevention: (1) the Parents of Preschoolers Prevention Series (POPS),
      a curriculum delivered to preschoolers and their parents focused on obesity-related health
      behaviors; and (2) POPS in combination with the Incredible Years Series (IYS), an
      evidence-based program designed to improve preschoolers' emotional and behavioral
      self-regulation. The research objective is to test the hypotheses that: (1) POPS, compared
      to Usual Head Start exposure, will lead to greater improvements in obesity-related health
      behaviors and adiposity indices; and (2) POPS + IYS will lead to the greatest improvements
      in obesity-related health behaviors and adiposity indices, and this effect will be mediated
      by improved self-regulation. The extension objective is to evaluate the feasibility,
      fidelity, and educational effectiveness of the POPS and POPS + IYS interventions, as
      delivered by paraprofessionals and educators within Extension and Head Start. The education
      objective is to provide Extension and Head Start staff non-formal training and educational
      curricula which can be widely disseminated. The long-term goal of this project is
      disseminate a novel and effective approach to obesity prevention in preschoolers.

Parents are invited to attend a series of classes about nutrition and obesity prevention. In the classroom, children also receive a series of lessons about emotional and behavioral self-regulation delivered by a trained mental health specialist. The parents also are invited to classes about child behavioral and emotional self-regulation delivered by a mental health specialist.</description>

    <intervention_name>Parents of Preschoolers Series</intervention_name>
    <description>The POPS-Parent intervention consists of eight 60-90 minute lessons about preventing childhood obesity followed by four 10-minute reinforcing telephone contacts. Each lesson includes opportunities for parents to develop and practice skills, and a discussion of strategies to overcome challenges and problem-solving techniques, with an emphasis on building knowledge and self-efficacy.
The POPS-Child Intervention uses children's stories with embedded healthy nutrition themes. Five lessons (6 books) are delivered over 12 weeks. Activities include classroom cooking experiences, games/activities associated with the story's nutrition themes, and goal setting. &quot;Family Links&quot; and &quot;Parent Pages&quot; are sent home to reinforce content from school to home.</description>

    <description>The Parent component (BASIC) is a group-based program (12-14 weeks, 2 hours/week) focused on enhancing parenting skills such as using effective praise, incentives, and limit-setting, and handling misbehavior. Parents complete homework activities that will be reviewed in group sessions and receive follow-up reinforcement phone calls.
For the Child component (&quot;Dinosaur School&quot;), 60, 15-20 minute lessons are delivered during &quot;Circle Time&quot; in Head Start classrooms followed by small group activities. The curriculum focuses on teaching self-regulation skills, problem-solving strategies, and prosocial behaviors.
Teachers are trained in classroom management strategies.</description>
