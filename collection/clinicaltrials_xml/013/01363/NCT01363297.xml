  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Phase 1 portion of this study will assess the safety, tolerability and efficacy at
      increasing dose levels of inotuzumab ozogamicin in subjects with CD22-positive relapsed or
      refractory adult acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) in order to select the recommended phase 2
      dose (RP2D) and schedule. The Phase 2 portion of the study will evaluate the efficacy of
      inotuzumab ozogamicin as measured by hematologic remission rate (CR + CRi) in patients in
      second or later salvage status.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with CD22-positive ALL with either refractory disease (i.e. disease
             progression or no response while receiving their most recent prior anti-cancer
             therapy), or relapsed disease (i.e. response to their most recent prior anti-cancer
             therapy with subsequent relapse). Subjects enrolled in the Phase 2 portion of the
             study must be due to receive salvage 2 or later therapy.

          -  Subjects with Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) ALL must have failed standard
             treatment with at least one tyrosine kinase inhibitor.

          -  Adequate renal and hepatic function, and negative pregnancy test for women of
             childbearing potential.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with isolated extramedullary relapse or active central nervous system (CNS)
             leukemia.

          -  Prior allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) or other anti-CD22
             immunotherapy within 4 months, or active graft versus host disease (GvHD) at study
             entry.

          -  Evidence or history of veno-occlusive disease (VOD) or sinusoidal obstruction
             syndrome (SOS).
