        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1

          -  Histologic documentation of incurable, locally advanced or metastatic disease that
             has failed prior chemotherapy and for which no standard therapy exists, including the
             following: non-squamous NSCLC or non-mucinous and platinum-resistant ovarian cancer

          -  Availability and willingness to provide an adequate archival sample of tumor

          -  Measurable disease

          -  For fertile men or women of childbearing potential, documented willingness to use a
             highly effective means of contraception

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Anti-tumor therapy, including chemotherapy, biologic, experimental, or hormonal
             therapy within 4 weeks prior to study treatment

          -  Major surgical procedure within 4 weeks prior to study treatment

          -  Known active bacterial, viral, fungal, mycobacterial, or other infection (including
             HIV and atypical mycobacterial disease, but excluding fungal infections of the nail
             beds)

          -  Clinically significant history of liver disease, including viral or other hepatitis,
             current alcohol abuse, or cirrhosis

          -  Untreated or active central nervous system (CNS) metastases

          -  Requirement for supplemental oxygen to carry out activities of daily living

          -  Any other diseases, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding, or clinical
             laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition that
             contraindicates the use of an investigational drug or that may affect the
             interpretation of the results or render the patient at high risk from treatment
             complications

          -  Evidence of significant uncontrolled concomitant diseases, such as cardiovascular
             disease, nervous system, pulmonary, renal, hepatic, endocrine, or gastrointestinal
             disorders; or a serious non-healing wound or fracture

          -  Pregnancy or breast-feeding
