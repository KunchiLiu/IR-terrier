  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-center, non-randomized, non-controlled study designed to obtain
      survival and outcome data on the Continuum Metal on Polyethylene Acetabular System when used
      in primary total hip arthroplasty.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The safety and performance of the Continuum Metal on Polyethylene Acetabular System will be
      confirmed by the assessment of survival and outcome data. Assessments will include standard
      scoring systems, radiographs and adverse event records. Data will be used to monitor pain,
      mobility, and survivorship of the Continuum Metal on Polyethylene Acetabular system in
      primary total hip arthroplasty. Metal ion (cobalt, chromium and titanium) and renal function
      (BUN, Creatinine and GFR) levels will be analyzed for a subset of the enrolled study
      subjects.
