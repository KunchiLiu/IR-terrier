  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well Akt inhibitor MK2206 works in treating patients with
      recurrent or advanced endometrial cancer. Akt inhibitor MK2206 may stop the growth of tumor
      cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the activity of MK-2206 (Akt inhibitor MK2206) in patients with recurrent or
      persistent endometrial cancer classified by phosphoinositide-3-kinase catalytic alpha
      (PIK3CA) mutation. Activity will be ascertained by the proportion of patients who survive
      progression-free for at least 6 months after initiating therapy or who have objective tumor
      response.

      II. To evaluate the efficacy of MK2206 in patients with serous tumors using a composite
      endpoint of complete and partial response by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors
      (RECIST) and progression-free interval of 6 months or longer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the duration of progression-free survival and overall survival. II. To
      determine the nature and degree of toxicity of MK-2206 as assessed by version 4 of the
      National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria For Adverse Events (CTCAE) in
      these cohorts of patients.

      III. To explore the associations between select biomarkers and response to MK-2206 such as
      progression-free survival, objective tumor response, and overall survival as well as patient
      characteristics such as histological cell type.

      IV. To explore the development of feed-back loop activation (post-treatment biopsy biomarker
      analysis) and target inhibition using MK-2206 via analysis of pre-treatment and
      post-treatment biopsies in select patients enrolled in the trial.

      V. To determine the duration of progression-free and overall survival, following initiation
      of therapy with MK-2206.

      VI. To determine the toxicities of MK-2206, as assessed with the revised NCI CTCAE version
      4.

      VII. To explore the association between select biomarkers and response to MK-2206 such as
      progression-free survival, objective tumor response.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive Akt inhibitor MK2206 orally (PO) once weekly. Courses repeat every 28 days
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 3 years.

             disease is defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least
             one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded); each lesion must be &gt;= 10 mm when

             barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the
             duration of study participation; should a patient become pregnant or suspect she is
             pregnant while she is participating in this study, she should inform the treating
             physician immediately

          -  Toxicities of prior therapy (excepting alopecia) should be resolved to =&lt; grade 1 per
             the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4

          -  MK-2206 is an oral medication; patients must be able to tolerate oral medications and
             not have gastrointestinal illnesses that would preclude absorption of MK-2206

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 3 weeks (6 weeks for
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not
             recovered to =&lt; grade 1 (excepting alopecia) from adverse events (as per the revised
             NCI CTCAE version 4) due to agents administered more than 3 weeks earlier

          -  Participants may not be receiving any other study agents

          -  Participants with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse
             events; should patients develop brain metastases while on trial and have clinical
             benefit from MK-2206 otherwise, patients may continue on drug after clinical
             management of the brain metastases with the permission of the principal investigator.
             MK-2206 should be restarted between 3 and 6 weeks after the last radiation treatment

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to MK-2206

          -  Patients requiring any medications or substances that are strong inhibitors or
             inducers of CYP 450 3A4 are ineligible

          -  Preclinical studies demonstrated the potential of MK-2206 for induction of
             hyperglycemia in all preclinical species tested; patients with diabetes or in risk
             for hyperglycemia should not be excluded from trials with MK-2206, but the
             hyperglycemia should be well controlled on oral agents before the patient enters the
             trial. HgbA1c &gt; 7.5% or fasting glucose greater than 130mg/dL will exclude patients
             from entry on study; patients requiring insulin for control of their hyperglycemia
             are excluded from entry on this study

          -  Preclinical studies indicated transient changes in QTc interval during MK-2206
             treatment; prolongation of QTc interval is potentially a safety concern while on
             MK-2206 therapy; cardiovascular: baseline QTcF &gt; 450 msec (male) or QTcF &gt; 470 msec
             (female) will exclude patients from entry on study

          -  Due to a high incidence of bradycardia by Holter monitor, preexisting bundle branch
             block or baseline bradycardia due to cardiac disease will exclude patients from
             treatment with MK-2206

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study; mother with MK-2206 breastfeeding should
             be discontinued if the mother is treated with MK-2206; these potential risks may also
             apply to other agents used in this study

          -  MK-2206 is an oral medication; patients who are unable to tolerate oral medication
             are not eligible; patients with signs and symptoms of bowel obstruction or with
             uncontrolled, persistent diarrhea will be excluded

          -  Individuals with a history of a different malignancy are ineligible except for the
             following circumstances. Individuals with a history of other malignancies are
             eligible if they have been disease-free for at least 5 years and are deemed by the
             investigator to be at low risk for recurrence of that malignancy. Individuals with
             the following cancers are eligible if diagnosed and treated within the past 5 years:
             breast cancer in situ, cervical cancer in situ, and basal cell or squamous cell
             carcinoma of the skin

          -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive individuals on combination antiretroviral
             therapy are ineligible

          -  Patients may not use natural herbal products or other &quot;folk remedies&quot; while
             participating in this study
