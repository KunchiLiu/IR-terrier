    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety of an investigational
      intravenous iron (ferric carboxymaltose [FCM]) or an equal dose of iron dextran and explore
      the mechanism of hypophosphatemia following administration of FCM or that of an equal dose
      of iron dextran when treating women with iron deficiency anemia due to heavy uterine
      bleeding (HUB).
