      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as panitumumab, can block tumor growth in different
      ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and
      help kill them or carry cancer-killing substances to them. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such
      as oxaliplatin, leucovorin calcium, and fluorouracil, work in different ways to stop the
      growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.
      Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Giving monoclonal antibody
      therapy together with chemotherapy and radiation therapy before surgery may make the tumor
      smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving panitumumab, combination
      chemotherapy, and radiation therapy together before surgery works in treating patients with
      advanced esophageal or gastroesophageal (GE) junction cancer

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the pathologic complete response rate of a modified FOLFOX-6 regimen
      (leucovorin calcium, fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin) given with panitumumab at two-week
      intervals x 4 cycles in combination with external beam radiation therapy for patients with
      locally advanced adenocarcinoma of the esophagus.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the toxicities and ability to complete the planned treatment. II. To
      determine the achieved steady-state plasma concentrations of 5-FU (fluorouracil) and
      correlate these with clinical toxicity.

      III. To assess the potential importance of polymorphic variations in genomic
      deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) of pertinent genes whose protein products are the targets of the
      anti-neoplastic drugs used in the clinical protocol on response and toxicity to therapy.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive panitumumab intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on day 1. Patients also receive
      oxaliplatin IV and leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours, and fluorouracil IV continuously over
      46 hours on day 1 (FOLFOX chemotherapy). Treatment repeats every 2 weeks for 4 courses in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Within 24 hours of the start of
      chemotherapy, patients undergo radiation therapy 5 days a week for 5.5 weeks. Patients then
      undergo surgery within 6-8 weeks after completion of chemotherapy and radiation therapy.
      Patients with residual disease receive 4 additional courses of FOLFOX chemotherapy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have resectable adenocarcinoma of the esophagus or GE-junction and are
             medically fit to undergo surgery; patients must have no evidence of distant
             metastasis based on imaging studies

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 0 or 1

          -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of at least 2000 per mcL

          -  Platelet count of at least 100,000 per mcL

          -  Serum creatinine less than or equal to 2.0 mg/dL

          -  Serum magnesium greater than or equal to 1.8 mg/dL

          -  Total bilirubin less than or equal to 2.0 mg per dL

          -  Measurable disease is not required for this study, since the primary endpoint is
             complete pathologic response

          -  The patient must be aware of the neoplastic nature of his/her disease and willingly
             provide written, informed consent after being informed of the procedure to be
             followed, the experimental nature of the therapy, alternatives, potential benefits,
             side-effects, risks, and discomforts

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior therapy: patients with prior history of mediastinal radiation exposure will be
             ineligible; patients may not have received prior chemotherapy, or antibody therapy
             for esophageal or GE-Junction adenocarcinoma

          -  History of allergy to platinum compounds or to antiemetics appropriate for
             administration in conjunction with protocol-directed chemotherapy

          -  Patients with a prior history of marked intolerance to 5-fluoropyrimidines (5-FU,
             floxuridine, capecitabine, 5-fluorocytosine [flucytosine]), since such patients may
             have deficiency of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase, which places them at risk for
             severe and life-threatening toxicity with 5-FU

          -  Uncontrolled inter-current illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active
             infection requiring intravenous antibiotics, ongoing immunosuppressive therapy
             (except for replacement steroids), active human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
             infection, that might jeopardize the ability of the patient to receive the
             chemotherapy program outlined in this protocol with reasonable safety

          -  Clinically significant cardiac disease (including symptomatic congestive heart
             failure, myocardial infarction, unstable angina pectoris, or serious, uncontrolled
             cardiac arrhythmia) within 1 year of study enrollment

          -  Pregnant and nursing women, or women planning to become pregnant within 6 months
             after the end of treatment, are excluded from this study; a negative pregnancy test
             will be required of women of child-bearing age within 72 hours of study enrollment;
             subjects (male or female) who are not willing to use highly effective methods of
             contraception (per institutional standard) during treatment and for 6 months (male or
             female) after the end of treatment are excluded

          -  History of interstitial lung disease e.g. pneumonitis or pulmonary fibrosis or
             evidence of interstitial lung disease on baseline chest computed tomography (CT)
             scan, since the risk of radiation-associated pneumonitis would be increased in such
             individuals

          -  Patients with prior malignancy will be excluded except for adequately treated basal
             cell or squamous cell skin cancer, adequately treated noninvasive carcinomas, or
             other cancers from which the patient has been disease-free for at least 5 years

          -  Patients receiving an investigational agent within 30 days before enrollment
