  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adult smokers (21-65) and adolescent smokers (18 - 21) years of age residing in Alameda and
      Santa Clara counties will serve as the target population for this study. A total of 400
      smokers meeting eligibility criteria will be randomized. Treatment will include both open
      label and extended treatment phases. Randomization. Participants will be randomized to
      extended therapy or control conditions at baseline (prior to open label treatment) and the
      analysis will be intention-to-treat (ITT) to avoid the threat of selection bias. Primary
      hypothesis. Smokers randomized to receive CBT during extended treatment will have a higher
      prolonged abstinence rate (PA) at 52 week and 104 week follow-up than participants in the
      Supportive therapy Control treatment.

      During open label treatment, all receive CBT and zyban and nicotine patch. At week 10 those
      who continue to smoke will be switched to varenicline through week 26. At week 10 those who
      are abstinent and report low levels of craving and low levels of depression symptoms will be
      withdrawn from study medications. Those who are abstinent but report difficulty with craving
      or depression symptoms will remain on zyban and nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) through
      week 26. Medication will not be available after week 26. All will receive CBT through week
      26.
