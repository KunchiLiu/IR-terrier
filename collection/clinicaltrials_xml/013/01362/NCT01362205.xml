  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study of
      dexmedetomidine versus placebo, with lorazepam rescue, for the management of severe alcohol
      withdrawal syndrome (AWS) and alcohol withdrawal delirium (AWD) in critically ill adults.

      The investigators hypothesize that the integration of dexmedetomidine (Precedex®) with usual
      therapy for the management of severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS) and alcohol
      withdrawal delirium/delirium tremens (AWD) in critically ill adult patients will reduce the
      time to resolution of AWS/AWD, increase the number of delirium-free and ventilator-free days
      in the first 28 days of hospitalization, reduce the length of ICU and hospital stays, and
      improve neurocognitive and quality of life scores on hospital discharge.

    <textblock>
      Severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS) and alcohol withdrawal delirium (AWD) are frequent
      principal indication/s for admission to intensive care units. Additionally, unanticipated
      alcohol withdrawal complicates other critical illnesses and peri-operative states. Alcohol
      intoxication and withdrawal syndrome are characterized by classic symptoms of adrenergic
      activation, psychiatric agitation including seizures, as well as metabolic and respiratory
      dysfunction. The majority of patients with severe AWS are effectively managed with
      combinations of benzodiazepine (BZD) sedatives (e.g. lorazepam) and butyrophenone
      antipsychotics (e.g. haloperidol) and require intensive care admission for 2-3 days.
      However, almost 25% of patients with SAWS have a prolonged critical care course, often
      complicated by respiratory failure and associated with excessive sedation and risk for
      complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). AWS is frequently difficult to
      manage with usual care including benzodiazepines. Additionally, while intermittent bolus
      dose sedation is recommended for AWS, high dose BZD alone is associated with excessive
      respiratory suppression and metabolic acidosis. Such therapy increases the likelihood of
      respiratory failure with its attendant complications of hospital acquired pneumonia and
      sepsis. Further, patients with underlying chronic liver disease are at greater risk for
      prolonged sedative effects of BZD and progression of hepatic encephalopathy. The requirement
      for mechanical ventilation additionally prolongs the course of treatment for AWD because of
      the need for prolonged sedation. Strategies to control AWS/AWD that control symptoms but
      avoid adverse effects of excessive respiratory suppression are anticipated to improve the
      short and medium-term outcomes of AWS.

      BZD infusions have also been shown by several investigators to result in excessive and
      prolonged sedation. However, reasonable alternatives for effective control of psychomotor
      and adrenergic activation have until recently, been unavailable. The centrally acting
      alpha-2 receptor agonist, clonidine has been suggested as a useful adjunctive therapy to
      BZD. However, clonidine is only a mild sedative and can result in significant hemodynamic
      compromise. By contrast, dexmedetomidine (Precedex), a more potent alpha-2 receptor agonist,
      is potentially a more effective adjunctive therapy. Precedex is currently marketed in the
      USA for short-term use as a potent peri-operative sedative and analgesic. This agent has a
      short circulating half-life and has significantly fewer hemodynamic side effects than
      clonidine. In addition to its cardiovascular properties, dexmedetomidine possesses
      anxiolytic, hypnotic/sedative, anesthetic-sparing and analgesic actions and is devoid of
      significant respiratory depressant effects.

      Precedex has been shown to be a safe and effective single agent sedative for critically ill
      medical and surgical patients in prolonged infusions up to thirty days and is associated
      with significantly lower incidence of delirium than sedation with the benzodiazepine,
      midazolam. Preclinical experience and case reports suggest anecdotally Precedex may be of
      particular benefit in patients with SAWS.

      Measures of sedation and delirium will be assessed with the Minnesota Detoxification Scale
      (MINDS) derived for use in critically ill adults from the validated Clinical Institute
      Withdrawal Assessment (CIWA-r) scale.

    <description>Dexmedetomidine titrated to achieve predefined goals on selected components of the MINDS score using the minimum amount of medication possible. Blinded study medication will be started at a rate determined by the MINDS score. The maximum infusion rate is 1.4 μg/kg per hour. Uncontrolled SAWS/D symptoms, will be treated with open label lorazepam according to the MINDS score algorithm. Persistent SAWS/D symptoms despite maximum infusion rate of study medication treatment limiting symptoms while receiving higher infusion rates of study medication, ancillary therapies will be administered according to the MINDS score algorithm, at the discretion of the treating physician.</description>
