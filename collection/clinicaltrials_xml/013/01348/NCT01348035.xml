      Increased water intake slows autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD)
      progression in animal models, but clinical implication is unknown. Encouraged water intake
      in patients with ADPKD for one year resulted in accelerated kidney enlargement and
      functional deterioration. Increased urine sodium and/or unknown factors concurrent with
      increased urine volume might stimulate disease progression more strongly than decrease in
      plasma vasopressin ameliorated it.

      Abstract Background Increased water intake slows autosomal dominant polycystic kidney
      disease (ADPKD) progression in animal models, but clinical implication of this finding is
      unknown.

      Methods The prospective one-year study was conducted on 34 ADPKD patients with creatinine
      clearanceâ‰§50 ml/min/1.73m2. Prior to the enrollment, 30 patients annually evaluated TKV and
      24-hour urine for more than one year. Patients were divided into high (H-, n = 18) and free
      (F-, n = 16) water-intake groups. Total kidney volume (TKV) was measured at the beginning
      and end of the study. Twenty-four-hour urine and blood were analyzed every four months.

      Results Prior to the study, urine volume (UV) in H-group was higher (P = 0.034), but
      pertinent data including TKV and kidney function slopes were not significantly different
      between two groups. During the study, UV further increased (P &lt;0.001) in H-group but not in
      F-group. Plasma copeptin was lower (P = 0.024) in H-group than in F-group. Kidney function
      and TKV slopes became worse in H-group (P = 0.011 and 0.047, respectively) but not in
      F-group. High UV associated with increased urine sodium (UNa) and rapid decrease in
      eGFR(Eqcr-cys) (MDRD equation with cystatin C incorporated) (P = 0.043). UNa positively
      correlated with % increase in TKV (P = 0.014) and plasma copeptin weakly with increase in
      TKV (P = 0.038), respectively.

      Conclusions Although statistical significance was not reached, high water intake appeared to
      accelerate rather than prevent disease progression, and these findings necessitate a
      long-term randomized study before drawing a final conclusion.
