  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim is to test the reduction of bone marrow edema syndrome after a singular
      intravenous treatment with Zoledronic Acid within 6 weeks compared to placebo. The volume of
      the edema is defined as biometric data measured by the use of MRT before and six weeks after
      treatment. The hypothesis has to be checked whether Zoledronic Acid is efficient in the
      treatment of painful bone marrow edema. A statistically significant reduction of the edema
      in the MRT is considered as evidence for efficacy.
