      This is a single-arm, open-label, multicenter, dose escalation, phase 1-2 study of alisertib
      (MLN8237) administered in patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma
      (DLBCL)/transformed follicular lymphoma (TFL) treated with rituximab and vincristine. The
      study has three parts as follows:

      Part 1, Phase 1: Safety lead-in cohort to evaluate alisertib (MLN8237) and rituximab.

      Part 2, Phase 1: Dose escalation cohort to evaluate alisertib (MLN8237) + Rituximab +
      Vincristine and determine Phase 2 dose. Patients with other types of B-cell lymphoma
      (including mantle cell or Burkitt's lymphoma may enroll in Parts 1 and 2.

      Phase 2: Alisertib (MLN8237) + Rituximab + Vincristine in patients with relapsed or
      refractory DLBCL or TFL at recommended Phase 2 dose.
