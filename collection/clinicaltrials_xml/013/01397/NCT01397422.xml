  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 4-arm parallel group
      study to evaluate the tolerability and efficacy of each of three dose levels of ADS-5102
      oral capsules, an extended release formulation of amantadine, dosed once daily for the
      treatment of levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID) in subjects with Parkinson's disease (PD).
      The novel pharmacokinetic profile of ADS-5102 is expected to achieve i) higher amantadine
      plasma concentrations during daytime hours when dyskinesia as well as motor and non-motor
      symptoms of PD are most problematic, ii) low amantadine plasma concentrations overnight,
      which may reduce the sleep disturbances and vivid dreams occasionally associated with
      amantadine, and iii) a reduced initial rate of rise in plasma concentration, which is
      expected to improve overall tolerability of amantadine.
