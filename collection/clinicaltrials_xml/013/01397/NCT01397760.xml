  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is do describe the experience in the use of omalizumabe, in a real
      life scenario, in uncontrolled severe asthmatic patients attended in specialist outpatient
      clinics, and its efficacy and safety. The efficacy of omalizumab in the population observed
      will be evaluated as reduction of uncontrolled asthma related events, i.e. exacerbations,
      emergency dept. visits, hospitalization and asthma-related treatment (decrease of asthma
      medication).

      Omalizumab is indicated in children over 6 years of age, with diagnosis of difficult to
      control asthma, presenting a component of atopy demonstrated preferably positive skin tests
      (prick test) or in vitro reactivity (rast) allergens common inhalants. Patients must also
      present the total serum IgE levels between 30 and 700UI/mL. Children until 12 years the IgE
      level is between 30 and 300 IU/ml.
