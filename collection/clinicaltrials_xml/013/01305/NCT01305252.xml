    <textblock>
      The Study Hypothesis:

      Aggressive, upfront, dual therapy for treatment-naïve NYHA I/II/III PAH is superior to a
      traditional &quot;step-up&quot; approach.

      The study will evaluate:

        1. Impact of dual, upfront, therapy on cardiovascular parameters in PAH as gauged by
           cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (cMRI) at 24 weeks and event free survival at
           outcome at 48 weeks.

        2. Value of novel biomarkers (NT-pro BNP, Mts1/S100A4, and insulin resistance) and
           cutting-edge imaging technologies (cardiac MRI) as newer endpoints for clinical trials
           in PAH.

        3. Utility of longer clinical trial design with the use of combined clinical events as
           time to clinical worsening surrogate
