    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well bevacizumab with or without fosbretabulin
      tromethamine works in treating patients with ovarian epithelial, fallopian tube, or
      peritoneal cavity cancer that has come back or is persistent. Monoclonal antibodies, such as
      bevacizumab, find tumor cells and help kill them. Bevacizumab and fosbretabulin tromethamine
      may stop the growth of ovarian cancer by blocking blood flow to the tumor. It is not yet
      known whether bevacizumab is more effective with or without fosbretabulin tromethamine in
      treating ovarian epithelial, fallopian tube, and peritoneal cavity cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the progression-free survival hazard ratio of the combination of bevacizumab
      and fosbretabulin tromethamine (CA4P) compared to bevacizumab alone in patients with
      persistent or recurrent ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the nature and degree of toxicity of fosbretabulin tromethamine plus
      bevacizumab.

      II. To characterize and compare progression-free survival in patients with measurable
      disease (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] criteria) and patients with
      detectable (non-measurable) disease between regimens.

      III. To determine the overall survival for both regimens. IV. To estimate the proportion of
      patients with measurable disease who have objective tumor responses by treatment.

      V. To provide descriptive information about cancer antigen (CA)-125 responses by regimen and
      where possible by objective tumor responses.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes and fosbretabulin tromethamine IV
      over 10-20 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive bevacizumab as in Arm I. Courses repeat every 21 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months for 3 years.

                  management of primary disease containing carboplatin, cisplatin, or another

                  alone or in combination with chemotherapy)

          -  Patients with both platinum-sensitive and platinum-resistant disease are eligible;
             patients with platinum-refractory disease are NOT eligible; platinum-refractory

                       (whichever occurs first); non-platinum maintenance therapy (e.g., extending
                       taxane treatment) is excluded as a &quot;subsequent therapy;&quot; if the patient's
                       last regimen used platinum, and she has NOT progressed before enrolling
                       onto this study, then her PFI will be calculated from the date of last
