  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our primary hypothesis is that TENS decreases pain with movement by reducing hyperalgesia.
      Minimizing the severe pain experienced during required activities in the immediate
      postoperative period will promote functional recovery and prevent the development of new
      chronic pain syndromes.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-Reported Pain with Movement</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day post-op, 2 days post-op, and 6-wks post-op</time_frame>
    <description>While subject's knee flexion and extension is measured, they report their pain on 0-20 NRS.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pressure pain threshold</measure>
    <time_frame>2 days post-op and 6-wks post-op</time_frame>
    <description>A handheld dignital pressure algometer (Somedic AB, Farsta, Sweden), is used to assess PPT with the 1cm2 circular probe. Pressure is applied at 40 kPa/s and patients are instructed to press the hand held response switch when the sensation first becomes painful.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Thermal Threshold, Tolerance, Pain Intensity, and Summation</measure>
    <time_frame>2 days post-op, 6 wks post-op</time_frame>
    <description>TSA II NeuroSensory Analyzer used. For threshold and tolerance, the 5 cm2 probe placed with initial temp at 37 degrees C and increased at 1 degree/sec to max of 52 degrees C. Subject indicates when first becomes painful and when reaches worst pain imaginable, respectively. For summation, a temperature is identified that subject rates at 12 on 0-20 NRS; that temp is used for 20 seconds, with subj reporting pain at 0 sec, 10 sec, and 20 sec. Pain reported at 0 sec is used as pain intensity measure.</description>

    <measure>Cutaneous Mechanical Pain testing</measure>
    <time_frame>6-wks post-op</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed with a Von Frey filament (5.88), applied to skin; subjects rate pain on a 0-20 NRS&gt;</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Gait Distance Test (from Iowa Gait test)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 days post-op and 6 wks post-op</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects are instructed to walk as quickly as they safely can for 15 seconds. Their pain and distance walked are assessed.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Accelerometer</measure>
    <time_frame>6-wks post-op</time_frame>
    <description>The ActivPAL activity monitor is worn by subject for one week after the 6-wk visit. Average cadence, avg METS per day, time sitting/lying, time standing, avg steps per day, and time spent in transition per day are measured.</description>

    <description>High-frequency intense TENS provided with the EMPI Select TENS. The generator emits a balanced, asymmetrical, biphasic waveform and has buttons for variation of frequency and amplitude. A rate modulation frequency of 50pps and 150pps every 0.5 seconds will be used with a pulse width of 150 microseconds (μs).</description>

    <description>Subjects randomized to the placebo group will use an EMPI TENS Select device that emits a current for 45 seconds then shuts off. They will be asked when they first feel the current, then the device will be turned down a half-point to provide &quot;treatment&quot; at a sub-sensory level. This unit displays an active indicator light suggesting to the subject that the unit is actively emitting current. At discharge, subject will be sent home with an adequate supply of batteries and asked to change batteries when the device goes below 4 bars, further suggesting that the device is actively working.</description>
