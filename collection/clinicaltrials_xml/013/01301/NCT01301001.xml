    <textblock>
      The Specific aims of this project are to (1) test the prediction that pain from tampon
      insertion (primary outcome measure) is lower in PVD patients when treated with gabapentin
      compared to when treated with placebo. Secondary outcome measures include intercourse pain
      and 24-hour pain and (2)perform a mechanism-based analysis of gabapentin effectiveness, and
      to gain insight into the underlying pathophysiology of subtypes of PVD that may lead to more
      specific treatment options.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 18-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-treatment, two-period
      crossover design, where 120 women between 18 of age and older who report insertional
      dyspareunia, pain with tampon insertion, and tenderness localized to the vulvar vestibule
      will be enrolled in the study. Electronically entered daily diaries will be used to
      determine if pain is lower in PVD subjects when treated with gabapentin (up to 3600 mg/d)
      compared to when treated with placebo. Biological measurements will include assessment of
      allodynia and hyperalgesia from capsaicin administration, muscle tension using a vaginal
      pressure algometer, number of tender points by clinical examination, and changes in blood
      pressure, pulse and heart rate variability. . The Long-range goals of this project are to
      explicate the underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms of PVD, and to use this knowledge to
      create evidence-based differential diagnoses of subtypes of PVD and to individualize
      treatments for each subtype. The immediate goal is to conduct a multicenter, randomized
      controlled trial (RCT) of gabapentin treatment for PVD, and which will also provide critical
      data on a new PVD-testing and response paradigm, as well as on characteristics that may
      define subtypes of PVD. Gabapentin, an anticonvulsant with analgesic, anxiolytic, and
      antispasmotic effects, was selected because of its efficacy in treating other neuropathic
      pain conditions.

    <description>This is a 18-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-treatment, two-period crossover design. A parallel group design was considered but excluded because a crossover design provides the ability to compare several treatment regimens in the same subject and allows for comparison at the individual rather than group level. During the first four weeks of each 8-week treatment period, the dose will be escalated toward a maximal tolerated dose or the target ceiling dose of 3600 mg/d, whichever is reached first.</description>

If side effects are intolerable or do not diminish within 3-4 days, the AM dose will be decreased by 600 mg, and an increase will be attempted one more time. If this next increase again results in intolerable side effects, the study drug will be decreased to the previous dose (maximal tolerated dose) and continued for the remainder of the study (a minimal dose of 1200 mg/d will be permitted).</description>
