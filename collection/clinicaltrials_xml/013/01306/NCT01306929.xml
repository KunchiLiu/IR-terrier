  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Huntington disease (HD) is a hereditary neurodegenerative disorder causing impairment in
      movement, behavioral dysfunction and dementia. The movement disorder is mainly characterized
      by chorea (involuntary movements) and a progressive loss of voluntary movement causing a
      substantial functional impairment over time. The study will assess the long-term safety of
      pridopidine and the treatment effects during long-term, open-label treatment.

             related procedure.

          -  Subject has completed the HART (ACR16C009) trial, including the follow-up period, or
             the PRIDE-HD (TV7820-CNS-20002) trial , and has remained on drug during the on
             treatment part of the trial (including de-escalated subjects).

          -  Willing and able to take oral medication and able to comply with the study specific
             procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Ongoing treatment with tetrabenazine seizure threshold lowering medications, ,
             certain antipsychotics and antidepressants.

          -  Newly instigated or changed treatment with neuroleptics/antipsychotics (&lt; 6 weeks
             before Baseline Visit).

          -  Use of tricyclic antidepressants or class I antiarrhythmics within 6 weeks of
             Baseline Visit, or at any time during the study period.

          -  Any clinically significant, abnormal, laboratory result at any point during the
             randomized phase, including clinically significant hepatic or renal impairment, or
             any ongoing adverse events from the randomized phase, which in the opinion of the
             Investigator affects the subject's suitability for the study or puts the subject at
             risk if he/she enters the study.

          -  A prolonged QTc interval at Baseline Visit (defined as a QTc interval of &gt;450 msec
             for both males and females using Fredericia's formula , or other clinically
             significant heart conditions as judged by the investigator.

          -  Severe intercurrent illness, which, in the opinion of the Investigator, may put the
             subject at risk when participating in the trial.
