  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, open-label, phase I/II study. In the phase I, patients with
      HER2-positive MBC will be treated with paclitaxel, trastuzumab and increasing doses of
      dasatinib to determine the MTD (Maximum Tolerated Dose), DLT (Dose Limiting Toxicity) and
      RPD (Recommended Phase II Dose) of the combination. Once the RPD has been identified, 48
      additional patients will be treated at that dose to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the
      combination in the phase II.

      Primary Objective:

        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase II dose (RPD) of
           dasatinib in combination with fixed doses of trastuzumab and paclitaxel in
           HER2-positive MBC patients (Phase I).

        -  To determine the efficacy, measured by objective response rate (ORR) in HER2-positive
           MBC patients with measurable disease (Phase II).

      Primary Endpoint:

        -  To determine the incidence rate of dose limiting toxicity (DLT) within the first cycle
           of dasatinib in combination with trastuzumab and paclitaxel at each dose level in
           HER2-positive MBC patients (Phase I).

        -  To assess the ORR (defined in the RECIST 1.1 as complete response rate + partial
           response rate) measured by the appropriate radiological test in HER2-positive MBC
           patients with measurable disease (Phase II).

      Sample Size:

      Phase I: following the 3+3 rule, a minimum of 6 and a maximum of 12 patients will be
      recruited.

      Phase II:Assuming 10% drop-out rate, 48 patients are required to enter the study.

      The duration of the study, from first patient visit to last patient visit will be
      approximately 42 months.

    <description>Eligible patients will be enrolled and treated with 4-week cycles of trastuzumab 2 mg/kg IV weekly (following a loading dose of 4 mg/kg in cycle 1) and paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 weekly x 3 weeks followed by a rest period of 7 days. Dasatinib will be administered orally in two dose levels 100 and 140 mg QD (a -1 dose level is included just in case dose de-escalation is needed). Treatment will be repeated on Day 1 of a 28-day cycle until radiographic or symptomatic progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs. Only in the phase I, the first cycle will last 38 days.</description>

                       hormonal agents must be discontinued at least 3 weeks prior to study entry.

                    3. Radiation Therapy: patients may have had prior radiation therapy that has
                       not exceeded 25% of the bone marrow reserve. A minimum of 21 days must have
                       elapsed between the last dose of radiation and registration into the study.
                       Patients must have recovered from any acute toxic effects from radiation
                       prior to registration. Lesions that have been irradiated cannot be included
                       as sites of measurable disease for the phase II unless clear tumor
                       progression, according to RECIST criteria, has been documented in these
                       lesions since the end of radiation therapy.

                    4. Previous Surgery: previous surgery is permitted provided that wound healing
                       has occurred.

                       Patients treated with adjuvant anti-HER2 therapies (including but not
                       limited to trastuzumab and lapatinib) are allowed to be included if a
                       minimum of 12 months have elapsed from the end of this therapy.
