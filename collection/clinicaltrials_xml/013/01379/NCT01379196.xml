    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of Azithromycin (a macrolide class
      antibiotic), given three times weekly, for patients with active moderate-severe, non
      sight-threatening, Graves Orbitopathy.

      Indices for follow-up will include:

        -  Clinical activity score

        -  Anti-TSH receptor antibody levels

        -  Thickening of extraocular muscles per ultrasound

        -  Quality of life score for Graves Orbitopathy patients
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Graves Orbitopathy (GO) is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder causing visual morbidity,
      cosmetic morbidity and interference with quality of life. The disease has an inflammatory
      stage and a non-inflammatory, fibrotic stage.

      Treatment of inflammatory stage moderate-severe GO includes steroids, as recommended by the
      EUGOGO consortium. However, the length of treatment needed and the risk of steroid
      side-effects may lead to multiple undesired treatment induced morbidity.

      Antibiotics of the macrolide group posses known immune-modulatory effects that are separate
      from their antibacterial mode of action. This mode of action has lead to the routine use of
      macrolide antibiotics for delaying graft rejection following lung transplants.

      We propose to test the effect of this class of antibiotics for non-sight threatening,
      moderate-severe, inflammatory GO.

    <description>Change in the clinical activity score between baseline and after 3 months
(Clinical Activity Score is a validated index of Graves Ophthalmopathy that assigns one point to the presence of: 1.spontaneous retrobulbar pain, 2. pain on up/downgaze, 3. redness of eyelids, 4. redness of conjunctiva, 5. swelling of eyelids, 6. inflammation of caruncle/plica, 7. chemosis). The maximal clinical activity score is thus 7.</description>
