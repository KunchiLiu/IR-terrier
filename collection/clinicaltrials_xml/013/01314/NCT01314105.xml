    <measure>Maximum Tolerated Dose of Nintedanib Based on the Occurrence of DLTs During Treatment Course 1</measure>
    <time_frame>28 days</time_frame>
    <description>Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of Nintedanib in combination with carboplatin and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin based on the occurrence of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) during treatment course 1. MTD will be determined among the first 6 evaluable patients in each dose level. MTD is the highest dose at which the incidence of DLT is less than 2/6.</description>
