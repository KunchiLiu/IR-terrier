  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lymphoscintigraphy is an accepted and commonly performed procedure used for staging of
      certain cancers, especially melanoma and breast cancer. It involves injecting a small amount
      of radioactivity under the skin in order to identify lymph nodes which should be biopsied
      (i.e., the &quot;sentinel node&quot;) to determine if cancer has spread. Our objective is to evaluate
      the potential benefit of a new, camera-based technology which allows actual images to be
      obtained intraoperatively in the identification of sentinel nodes.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:3.1.1 Melanoma of the head and neck for which lymphoscintigraphy and
        sentinel lymph node biopsy are recommended as a standard of care

        3.1.2 Prior therapy has no impact on eligibility as long as sentinel lymph node biopsy is
        indicated

        3.1.4 Adults age 18 or greater.

        3.1.5 No life expectancy restrictions.

        3.1.6 The patients must be healthy enough for surgery

        3.1.8 Patients must be able to understand and the willing to sign a written informed
        consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria:3.2.1 No therapy restrictions.

        3.2.2 No restrictions on use of other Investigational Agents.

        3.2.3 No exclusion requirements due to co-morbid disease or incurrent illness.

        3.2.4 Patients will be excluded if they have a documented allergy to colloid.

        3.2.5 There are no known exclusion criteria relating to concomitant medications or
        substances that have the potential to affect the activity or pharmacokinetics of the study
        agent.

        3.2.6 No other agent-specific exclusion criteria.

        3.2.7 Pregnant and nursing patients will be excluded if lymphoscintigraphy is felt to be
        too high risk.

        3.2.8 Cancer survivors and those who are HIV-positive will not be excluded from the study.
