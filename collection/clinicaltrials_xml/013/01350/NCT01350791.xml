  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a non-randomized, prospective, open-label registry to compare the efficacy and
      safety of Promus Element stents versus first-generation drug-eluting stent (DES) in patients
      with coronary artery disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Element Stent platform features a proprietary Platinum Chromium Alloy, designed
      specifically for coronary stents. This alloy, coupled with a new stent architecture, is
      designed to enable thinner struts, increased flexibility and a lower profile while improving
      radial strength, recoil and visibility. In addition, the PROMUS Element Stent System
      incorporates the new Apex™ Dilatation Catheter technology, designed to enhance
      deliverability to complex lesions.

      Currently, there have been limited data regarding comparison of PROMUS Element stent with
      first-generation DES in routine clinical practice. Therefore, we perform large-scale
      real-world registry of PROMUS Element stents.
