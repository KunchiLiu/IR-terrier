  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this early (phase I/II) clinical trial is to assess the effects (both good
      and bad) of genetically modified T cells after chemotherapy on your cancer and general
      health.

      Purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of autologous genetically
      modified T cells. Genetic material is transferred into the subject's previously harvested
      autologous T cells to redirect them to target melanoma cells rather than their usual target.
      Study subjects must have histologically or cytologically melanoma stage 3/4 and their tumor
      must express HLA Class 1 allele HLA-A*0201 for NY-ESO-1/LAGE. Subjects must also have
      measureable disease on study entry, as defined by at least one lesion that can be measured
      in at least one dimension &gt;= 10mm with spiral CT scan.

        Inclusion Criteria

          -  Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed melanoma stage III/IV,
             unresectable

          -  Patients must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be
             accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as
             ≥10 mm with spiral CT scan

          -  One prior cytotoxic therapy for the treatment of metastatic disease is allowed.
             Unlimited regimens using biological agents (vaccines), immunotherapy, or targeted
             agents is permitted. For example, BRAF inhibitors and ipilimumab are permitted.
             Patients must have fully recovered from the acute toxicities related to any prior
             therapy. Prior therapy must be completed ≥28 days before the first dose of
             cyclophosphamide.

          -  Age ≥18

          -  Life expectancy of greater than 3 months

          -  ECOG performance status ≤ 1

        Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:

          -  Leukocytes ≥ 3,000/mcL

          -  Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) ≥ 1,500/mcL

          -  Platelets ≥ 100,000/mcL

          -  Total bilirubin within normal institutional limits

          -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) ≤ 2.5 X institutional upper limit of normal

          -  Creatinine ≤ 2.0 mg/dl Or Creatinine clearance ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for patients with
             creatinine levels above institutional normal

          -  The patient must express HLA class I allele HLA-A*0201 for NY-ESO-1/LAGE.

          -  Patient must have proven positive tumor sample for NY-ESO-1 as determined by an H
             score for immunohistochemistry staining. Positive expression is defined as an H score
             ≥ 100 where the H score = [2 x (% cells 2+) + 3 x (% cells 3+)].

        NOTE: The percentages of negative or weakly stained nuclei (i.e. 1+) are not to be
        included in the calculation of the H score.

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test and
             both male and female (of childbearing potential) subjects must agree to use reliable
             methods of contraception during the study.

          -  Ability of the patient (or legally authorized representative if applicable) to
             understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  Patients who have had 2 or more regimens containing cytotoxic chemotherapy for
             metastatic melanoma.

          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents.

          -  Patients with active brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse
             events.

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to cyclophosphamide or other agents used in the study.

          -  Active infection

          -  Prior malignancy (except non-melanoma skin cancer) within 3 years.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements. All patients will undergo a cardiac stress test for evaluation of
             cardiac function.

          -  Pregnant or nursing females

          -  Active infection with HIV, HBV or HCV as defined below, due to the immunosuppressive
             effects of cyclophosphamide used and the unknown risks associated with viral
             replication.

          -  Positive serology for HIV

          -  Active Hepatitis B infection as determined by test for hepatitis B surface antigen.

          -  Active Hepatitis C. Patients will be screened for HCV antibody. If the HCV antibody
             is positive, a screening HCV RNA by any RT-PCR or bDNA assay must be performed at
             screening by a local laboratory with a CLIA certification or its equivalent.
             Eligibility will be determined based on a negative screening value. The test is not
             required if documentation of a negative result of a HCV RNA test performed within 60
             days prior to screening is provided.
