    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that participants in the treatment advocacy intervention will
      show significantly better HIV treatment adherence than will participants in the no-treatment
      (wait-list) control group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Compared to other races/ethnicities, African Americans with HIV have lower levels of
      engagement in care, are less likely to be on antiretroviral treatment (ART), and are more
      likely to delay care and ART initiation; those on ART are less likely to be adherent at high
      enough levels for the treatment to be effective. We propose to test an innovative,
      culturally relevant treatment advocacy (TA) intervention for African Americans with HIV that
      targets social, cultural, and structural issues contributing to poor HIV treatment
      behaviors. TA, which has been sustained in many community organizations throughout the HIV
      epidemic, has never been systematically evaluated. TA facilitates patient navigation through
      the medical system and provides tailored HIV treatment education and client-centered
      counseling to improve adherence and engagement in care. TA targets structural issues in
      healthcare and patients' lives by advocating to providers to improve patient-provider
      relationships, recommending changes in treatment and/or providers (if needed), and referring
      patients to mental health and social services. TA is particularly appropriate for African
      Americans with HIV, who may be mistrustful of providers: it can be conducted outside of the
      medical system in a safe, neutral community setting by individuals not associated with
      patients' healthcare. We developed a culturally relevant TA program that additionally
      discusses factors such as racism that undermine healthcare in Black communities, by
      acknowledging and directly addressing patients' medical mistrust and stigma as coping
      strategies that arise in response to oppression. The specific aims are to (1) conduct a
      randomized controlled trial to examine the effects of a culturally relevant TA program on
      adherence among African Americans with HIV; (2) identify culturally relevant mediators that
      explain the effects of treatment advocacy on antiretroviral treatment adherence among
      African Americans with HIV (e.g., improved behavioral adherence skills, coping with
      stress/discrimination, mental health, and patient satisfaction; lower levels of HIV
      misconceptions, internalized HIV stigma/homophobia, medical mistrust, and substance use);
      and (3) explore culturally relevant moderators of the effects of treatment advocacy on
      antiretroviral treatment adherence among African Americans with HIV (e.g., access to care,
      discrimination, incarceration, poverty, social support, spirituality, and trauma). A sample
      of 200 African Americans with HIV will be randomly assigned to a TA intervention or
      wait-list control group. Participants will complete surveys at screening, and at 3- and
      6-months post-baseline, to assess pre-, intra-, and post-intervention effects on adherence.

    <description>Treatment advocacy is a 24-week intervention with booster sessions, including a 4-week intensive intervention followed by a 20-week maintenance period. In the first 4 weeks, all participants receive 4 individual weekly 60-minute sessions and 1 group HIV education session. In the next 20 weeks, all participants receive booster sessions in weeks 12 and 20, and a counselor check-in phone call in week 8 regarding need for new referrals and adherence barriers. Participants who have not demonstrated good adherence (≥90%) during the prior 2 weeks receive ≤4 additional booster sessions at weeks 14, 16, 22, and 24. Clients receive additional linkage with APLA's social service programs, as necessary. This description is subject to change after consideration by the community advisory board.</description>
