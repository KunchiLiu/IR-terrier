  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate whether the targeted hemoglobin increment (2 grams per
      decilitre) in the patient can be predicted from the hemoglobin dose/weight of the blood bag
      transfused. In the test group, the hemoglobin dose needed will be calculated, whereas in the
      control group, the prescribed number of red cell units will be transfused.

      Hypothesis: By matching the hemoglobin dose to the individual needs of the patient the
      investigators will reduce the total usage of red cell concentrates.
