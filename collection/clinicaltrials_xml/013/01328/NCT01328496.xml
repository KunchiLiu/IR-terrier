    <textblock>
      In this study, participants with high-risk hematologic malignancies undergoing hematopoietic
      cell transplantation (HCT), who do not have a suitable human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched
      related/sibling donor (MSD), matched unrelated donor (MURD) or killer-immunoglobulin
      receptors (KIR) ligand mismatched haploidentical donor identified, will receive an umbilical
      cord blood transplantation (UCBT) using a myeloablative preparative regimen.

      The preparative regimen includes fludarabine (75 mg/m2), fractionated total body irradiation
      (TBI) (10.0 Gy), and cyclophosphamide (120mg/kg) with mesna. Fludarabine will be given once
      a day at 25 mg/m2 for three days on day -10 to day -8, TBI will be given twice a day at 150
      cGy for four days on day -7 to day -4, and cyclophosphamide will be given once a day for at
      60mg/kg for two days on day -3 and day -2. Post-transplantation immunosuppression with
      cyclosporine and MMF will begin on day -3. Cord Blood infusion will occur on day 0 and G-CSF
      will start on day +1.

      The primary objectives is to estimate the event-free survival (EFS) at one-year
      post-transplant for research participants with high-risk hematologic malignancies undergoing
      hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) using single unit umbilical cord blood (UCB).

      Secondary objectives are:

        -  Describe the clinical outcome of patients undergoing a double unit UCBT.

        -  Estimate the incidence and severity of acute and chronic graft versus host disease
           (GVHD) of patients enrolled in the research arm.

        -  Estimate the incidence and time to neutrophil and platelet engraftment among patients
           enrolled in the research arm.

        -  Estimate the incidence of transplant related mortality (TRM) and transplant related
           morbidity in the first 100 days after transplantation among patients enrolled in the
           research

      Exploratory Objectives are:

        -  Assess the relationship between pre-transplant minimal residual disease (MRD) with
           transplant outcomes.

        -  Record immune reconstitution parameters, including chimerism analysis, quantitative
           lymphocyte subsets, T cell receptor excision circle (TREC) and spectratyping.
           Immunophenotyping and functional assays of T, B and NK cells and lymphocytes will also
           be evaluated.

        -  Evaluate the determinants of engraftment.
