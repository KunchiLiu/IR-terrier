  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, open-label, multicenter study evaluating the safety and PK profile of
      ABT-199 under a once daily dosing schedule. Two arms will be implemented for dose
      escalation: Arm A, CLL/SLL subjects and Arm B, NHL subjects. Arm A is designed to enroll
      approximately 116 subjects with relapsed or refractory CLL or SLL and Arm B is designed to
      enroll approximately 95 subjects with relapsed or refractory NHL. Fifty-six subjects were
      enrolled in Arm A and approximately 55 subjects will be enrolled in Arm B during the dose
      escalation portion of the study, with the objective of defining dose limiting toxicities
      (DLTs) and the MTD. Once the MTD is declared for the arm, approximately 60 additional
      CLL/SLL subjects in Arm A and approximately 20 additional DLBCL subjects and 20 additional
      follicular lymphoma subjects in Arm B will be enrolled in an expanded safety portion of the
      study at the recommended phase 2 dose (RPTD) and schedule.
