    <textblock>
      The administration of Anamorelin in patients with Stage III-IV non-small cell lung
      cancer-cachexia (NSCLC-C) is expected to increase appetite, lean body mass, weight gain, and
      muscle strength.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study to assess the
      safety and efficacy of Anamorelin in patients with non-small cell lung cancer-cachexia
      (NSCLC-C). The primary efficacy analysis will include the treatment difference in the change
      in lean body mass and physical function. Pharmacokinetic (PK) samples will also be collected
      at Day 43 visit for population PK.
