  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The administration of Anamorelin in patients with Stage III-IV non-small cell lung
      cancer-cachexia (NSCLC-C) is expected to increase appetite, lean body mass, weight gain, and
      muscle strength.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study to assess the
      safety and efficacy of Anamorelin in patients with non-small cell lung cancer-cachexia
      (NSCLC-C). The primary efficacy analysis will include the treatment difference in the change
      in lean body mass and physical function.
