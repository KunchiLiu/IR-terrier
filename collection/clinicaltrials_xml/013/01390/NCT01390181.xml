      The specific aims of this study are to:

        -  Establish baseline levels of circulating MMP-2 and -9 , TIMP-1and- 2 and TGFB levels in
           individuals with bicuspid aortic valve and ascending aortic or aortic sinus
           measurements &gt;40mm.

        -  Assess the effect on MMP levels during treatment with losartan, an angiotensin II
           receptor blocking agent.

        -  In the setting of losartan therapy for one year, evaluate the response of MMP levels in
           these patients, and clinical outcomes including effects on aortic growth rate

          -  Currently taking an angiotensin receptor blocker or ACE inhibitor specifically for
             hypertension and are therefore unable to or are unwilling to participate in a 4 week
             drug washout period.
