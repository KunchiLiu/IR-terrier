      RATIONALE: Studying samples of tumor tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may
      help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to
      cancer. It may also help doctors find better ways to treat the cancer.

      PURPOSE: This research trial studies biomarkers in tumor tissue samples from patients with
      peripheral T-cell lymphoma or natural killer cell neoplasms.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To identify mutations in oncogenes and tumor suppressors of peripheral T-cell lymphoma
           or natural killer (NK) cell neoplasm.

        -  To delineate the mechanisms that mediate oncogenic effects and their clinical
           prognostic significance in these diseases.

        -  To perform a comprehensive mutation analysis via whole exome resequencing in a panel of
           peripheral T-cell or NK lymphomas.

      OUTLINE: Fixed paraffin-embedded tumor tissue samples are analyzed for mutations by the
      Illumina HiSeq platform. Sequencing reads are performed by GAPipeline version 1.5.1 and
      mapping on the human genome performed using the MAQ software version 0.7.1. Genes harboring
      validated somatic mutations are then amplified by PCR and analyzed by Sanger resequencing.
