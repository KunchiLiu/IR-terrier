      This is a prospective, double-blind placebo-controlled randomized controlled trial of the
      preliminary safety and efficacy of bupropion SR in combination with behavioral counseling
      for smoking cessation during pregnancy. A total of 150 pregnant smokers will receive
      medication (75) or placebo (75) for 12 weeks. Compassionate care/continuance of therapy will
      be available to pregnant subjects. Women who relapse to smoking postpartum will be offered
      an additional course of medication treatment. All subjects irregardless of adherence with 12
      week study drug administration period and smoking habits during pregnancy will be followed
      through the duration of their pregnancy, delivery, and 6-month post partum period. Subject
      participation will begin between 13-26 wks of gestation and end 6 months postpartum.
      Participation will be ten (10) to thirteen(13)months in length.

    <measure>Minnesota Nicotine Withdrawal Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Completion of study therapy (12 wks study treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>The MNWS will be used to assess for change in withdrawal symptoms from the quit date (onset of smoking cessation + after 1 wk of treatment) to that at the completion of study therapy (status post 12 wks of study treatment, 11 wks post quit date).</description>

    <measure>7-day point prevalence smoking abstinence</measure>
    <time_frame>3 weeks post quit date (post 12 weeks of study therapy)</time_frame>
    <description>Abstinence, that is quit rate, measured via 7-day point prevalence abstinence will be assessed at the end of study medication treatment, that is post 12 weeks of study drug treatment and again at end of pregnancy (36.0-38.6 weeks of gestation). This outcome will be assessed twice to determine a change in the quit rate from immediately status post treatment to that which occurs immediately before delivery.</description>

    <description>Bupropion SR 150 mg po BID. We will administer a 12-week course of therapy, 150 mg bid x 12 weeks. Subjects will be dispensed a 30 day supply at a time. They will be instructed to begin using study medication (bupropion SR 150 mg orally for 3 days, then BID for 4 days) on study visit day 1, which will be approximately 1 week prior to their quit date. Thereafter, they will continue to dose BID for 12 full weeks of therapy.</description>
