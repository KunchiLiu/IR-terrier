      RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood from patients treated with sargramostim in the
      laboratory may help doctors learn more about the effects of sargramostim on cells. It may
      also help doctors understand how patients respond to treatment.

      PURPOSE: This research trial studies biomarkers in blood samples from patients with stage IV
      melanoma previously treated with sargramostim.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To correlate circulating myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) and Treg frequencies
           with clinical outcome.

      Secondary

        -  To correlate circulating anti-sargramostim (GM-CSF) antibody levels with clinical
           outcome.

      OUTLINE: Archived peripheral blood mononuclear cells and serum samples are analyzed for
      circulating myeloid-derived suppressor cells, Treg (CD3+/CD4+/CD25hi/FOXP3+) frequency, and
      anti-sargramostim (anti-GM-CSF) antibody levels by flow cytometry and anti-GM-CSF
      neutralizing antibody assay.
