  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study we are looking at a type of radiation called proton radiation which is known
      to spare surrounding tissue and organs from radiation. The proton radiation will be
      delivered using 3D conformal proton radiation or scanned beam/IMPT (Intensity Modulated
      Proton Radiation Treatment). Proton radiation delivers no dose beyond the region requiring
      treatment. This may reduce side effects that patients would normally experience with
      conventional radiation therapy or other means of delivering proton radiation therapy. In
      this study we are evaluating the effectiveness of using proton radiation delivered to reduce
      side effects association with radiation treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Proton radiation will be delivered daily for approximately 5 1/2 weeks. Patients will be
      assessed weekly for any side effects they may be experiencing.

      Patients will have follow-up visits 4 weeks after proton therapy ends, at 6 months, 12
      months, and then every year for up to five years after treatment. Follow-up visits will
      include a physical examination, radiological imaging (if necessary), echocardiogram, and
      laboratory tests.
