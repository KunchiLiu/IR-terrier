    <textblock>
      Metformin is a medication that is commonly used in the treatment of diabetes. Recently small
      studies in cancer patients without diabetes suggest that metformin may benefit in lowering
      insulin levels. In those studies of patients with cancer but not diabetes, glucose (or
      sugar) levels in the blood are generally no lowered. Insulin and insulin-like growth factors
      affect the growth of cancer cells.

      This randomized study will compare different interventions; exercise, exercise and
      metformin, metformin alone, or a control arm. The investigators are not directly testing how
      either exercise or metformin affects your disease. The investigators are testing how they
      affect insulin levels in your body as well as other blood markers. The investigators believe
      that these blood tests may either be related to cancer recurrences or be an early sign of
      cancer recurrences and they are testing how both exercise and metformin may change those
      markers.

      Subjects will be randomized into one of four groups: exercise training, exercise training
      and metformin, metformin alone, or control arm. All subjects will have lifestyle
      measurements, interviews regarding activity level, diet questionnaires, and blood tests.

      Subjects randomized to exercise training will participate in two supervised exercise
      sessions per week with an exercise physiologist for 3 months. They will also be asked to
      exercise on their own for up to an additional 120 minutes each week.

      Subjects randomized to exercise training and metformin will participate in two supervised
      exercise sessions per week and will take metformin. Metformin will be taken once daily for
      the first two weeks and then twice daily for 3 months.

      Subjects randomized to metformin will take metformin once daily for the first two weeks and
      then twice daily.

      Subjects on the control arm will receive a packet of educational information on nutrition
      and physical activity developed by the National Cancer Institute and American Cancer
      Society. In addition to education information, they will be offered two supervised sessions
      with an exercise physiologist as well as a pedometer 3 months after enrollment in the study.
