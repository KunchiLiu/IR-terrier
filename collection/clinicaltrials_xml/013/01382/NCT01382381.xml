      The goal of the study is to evaluate long term durability and hemodynamic effect of
      implanted stents in the aortic arch and in pulmonary artery branches.

    <textblock>
      Patients who underwent trans-catheter implantation of balloon expanded stents in the aortic
      arch and in branch pulmonary arteries will be evaluated by physical examination with blood
      pressure values measurement of upper and lower limbs.

      Echo-Doppler cardiography will be performed for flow velocity analysis. Zoomed fluoroscopy
      will be performed and recorded in two orthogonal views to evaluate stent integrity or stent
      fracture.

      It is our intention to include 20 patients in this study from our follow-up clinic.
