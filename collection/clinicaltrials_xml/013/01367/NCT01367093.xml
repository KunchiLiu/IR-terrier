      The purpose of this study is to identify within a cohort of ICU patients admitted for severe
      illness those who are at risk of death in the year following the discharge from ICU.

      FROG-ICU is an epidemiological, observational, prospective, multi centric, cohort study
      designed for description, prognostic and evaluation. This trial includes as a first step a
      complete registry of patients admitted to the ICU and as a second step, the outcome of the
      patients at 1 year after they have been discharged alive from ICU.

      Plasma and urine samples will be with drawn biomarkers measurements at admission and ICU
      discharge. It is a multicentric study involving 1 center in Belgium et 24 centers in France.
