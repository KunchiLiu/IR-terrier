    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the use of sitagliptin increases bone formation
      and reduces bone turnover in postmenopausal women with type 2 diabetes.

    <textblock>
      Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) are at an increased risk of fracture, despite
      having bone mineral density (BMD) similar to age and sex matched cohorts. Recent studies
      have indicated that changes in incretin (INtestinal seCRETion of INsulin) hormones in the
      setting of T2DM may play a role in bone metabolism. Two of these incretin hormones, gastric
      inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), have been shown to be
      involved in bone turnover regulation, in addition to their effect in increasing insulin
      secretion and decreasing glucagon secretion in a glucose-dependent manner. In addition, the
      rise in glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2) in the postprandial state has been found to have a
      direct effect on reduced bone resorption in a non-fasting state and treatment with GLP-2
      improved BMD in postmenopausal women. Due to their glucose lowering effects, incretins have
      been a therapeutic target for the treatment of T2DM through GLP-1 receptor analogs or
      inhibition of incretin metabolism via dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors (i.e.
      sitagliptin). Inhibition of DPP-4 leads to an approximate doubling of GLP-1 and GIP levels
      but also leads to reduced breakdown of GLP-2.

      Less is known about the effect of incretin-directed therapies, specifically sitagliptin, and
      bone metabolism. To our knowledge, two studies have looked at the direct effects of
      currently available incretin-directed therapies on bone metabolism. Exenatide (a GLP-1
      analog) treatment of insulin resistant and type 2 diabetic rats resulted in osteogenic
      effects with increased osteocalcin levels following treatment. In a study of female
      non-diabetic Sprague-Dawley rats treated with pioglitazone, rosiglitazone, sitagliptin, vs.
      placebo, no significant change in bone mineral density was seen in the sitagliptin or
      placebo treated rats (compared to significant loss of bone mineral density in the TZD
      groups). Even fewer published studies are available evaluating changes in bone metabolism
      with the use of incretin hormones in humans. The majority of the human studies have been
      completed with GLP-2. These studies show a dose-dependent effect of GLP-2 on bone resorption
      and, preliminarily, show improved bone mineral density in postmenopausal women treated with
      GLP-2. However, the changes in incretin activity vary in persons with glucose intolerance
      and T2DM. Therefore, it is important to understand the potential effects of these
      medications on bone metabolism in persons prescribed these medications for treatment of
      their T2DM.

    <description>Further information regarding the effect of incretin hormones on bone is important for safety reasons (recent information linking thiazolidinediones with increased risk of fracture), but more importantly,to better understand the mechanism of bone changes seen in persons with T2DM. Further information is needed to help guide clinicians in charge of caring for the growing population of persons with T2DM at risk of many complications, including an increased risk of fracture.</description>
