    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to gather information on how much exercising with video games
      (ExerGaming) can increase the physical activity among overweight and youth. This study will
      try to see if participating in physical activity and exercising with video games at the same
      time can make overweight children move around more to better their own health. The
      hypothesis is that those in Exergaming arm will physiological changes and increase physical
      activity.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  male and female

          -  aged 12-14 years

          -  baseline BMI &gt; 25

          -  gender- and age-specific 85th percentile cutoff points from the CDC growth chart

          -  parental consent and subject assent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  subjects not meeting the inclusion criteria or with physician-determined
             musculoskeletal, cardiopulmonary, metabolic, psychological, neuro-developmental or
             behavioral conditions that make mild-to-moderate physical activity potentially
             hazardous.

          -  Participants under the age of 12 are excluded from the study because Weingart YMCA
             has an age policy. Children under the age of 12 are not allowed to be at the facility
             alone. Therefore, the minimum age for the study is 12 years old so supervision is not
             a problem.
