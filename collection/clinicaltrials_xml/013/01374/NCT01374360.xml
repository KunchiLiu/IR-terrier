  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The PNH Registry will collect data to evaluate safety data specific to the use of Soliris.</measure>
    <time_frame>Ongoing (up to 13 years)</time_frame>
    <description>Primary analyses will assess safety endpoints, including occurrence and time to first event for the following: meningococcal infections, infections with serious outcomes, formation of HAHA to Soliris, malignancy, thrombotic events, pulmonary hypertension, impaired renal function, serious hemolysis, pregnancies, infusion reactions, targeted adverse events, bone marrow transplant, and mortality. In addition, all serious adverse events (SAEs), regardless of causality, will be collected in order to search for unknown safety concerns.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>PNH Registry will collect data to characterize the progression of PNH as well as clinical outcomes, mortality and morbidity in Soliris and non-Soliris treated patients.</measure>
    <time_frame>Ongoing (up to 13 years)</time_frame>
    <description>Secondary analyses will include descriptions of patient populations, PNH specific treatments, concomitant medications, progression of disease, PNH clone sites, clinical symptoms, and clinical outcomes.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients of any age, including minors, with a diagnosis of PNH or a detected PNH
             clone, including patients previously treated with Soliris and withdrawn from
             treatment. Patients who are minors must have parent/legal guardian consent and must
             be willing and able to give assent, if applicable as determined by the Ethics
             Committees/Institutional Review Boards. Upon attaining adulthood, these patients must
             be re-consented.

          -  Ability to comprehend and sign consent to have data entered in the PNH Registry.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Inability or unwillingness to sign informed consent.

          -  Patients currently enrolled in an interventional clinical trial for treatment of PNH
             cannot be enrolled in the Registry at the same time.
