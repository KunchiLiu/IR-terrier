  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prolactin is a hormone that naturally occurs in the body. Some women taking antipsychotic
      medications may have high levels of prolactin in their bodies. High levels of prolactin may
      cause women to have problems with sex or satisfaction from sex. It may also cause women to
      have fewer or no menstrual periods. It may also cause the production of breast milk and may
      contribute to long term bone loss.

      In this study, the investigators are testing whether taking adding a low dose of an
      antipsychotic medication called aripiprazole may help improve high prolactin levels and help
      with sexual dysfunction or problems with menstrual periods. The investigators are also
      looking to see if it may slow the loss of bones. This medication has been shown to be
      helpful for improving symptoms of schizophrenia.

      This will be a 16-week, double blind, placebo controlled randomized trial of aripiprazole
      added to an existing stabilized regimen of antipsychotics (either risperidone or
      paliperidone oral or long acting injectable formulations) for treatment of elevated
      symptomatic prolactin levels. Aripiprazole dosing will begin at 5 mg/day once daily and
      increased to 10mg by mouth once daily at the end of week 2 and then increased to 15 mg/day
      once daily at the end of week 8 in women who have not yet regained their menstrual period.
      If a woman gets her menstrual period on the 5 or 10 mg dose she will remain on this dose for
      the study. Women will remain on their current stabilized medication regimen during the
      course of the adjunctive trial of aripiprazole or placebo. Subjects will be able to receive
      anticholinergic medications as needed (e.g., benztropine and diphenhydramine) for
      extrapyramidal side effects, propranolol for akathisia, and benzodiazepines (e.g.,lorazepam)
      for agitation or anxiety.

      Participants will be assigned to either get aripiprazole or placebo (a sugar pill), this
      will be decided randomly with a 50-50 chance of receiving one or the other medication. The
      placebo will be sucrose filled capsules that are identical to the active medication. It is
      double blind so no one will know if the capsule is placebo or aripiprazole. The dosing will
      be the exact same, one capsule taken daily until week 8. At this time 2 capsules will be
      given if the participant dose not regains their menstrual period.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects will be females of any race, with an age range of 18?50.

          -  Subjects will meet DSM-IV TR (APA, 2000) criteria for either schizophrenia,
             schizoaffective disorder, or bipolar disorder. A best estimate diagnostic approach
             will be utilized in which information from the Structured Clinical Interview for
             DSM-IV (First et al, 1997) is supplemented by information from family informants,
             previous psychiatrists, and medical records to generate a diagnosis

          -  Women will need to be taking a stable dose of antipsychotic regimen for at least two
             months and are considered to have stable symptoms by the treating psychiatrist. This
             regimen must include any form of risperidone or paliperidone.

          -  All women will have a prolactin level &gt; 24 ng/ml (either identified at screening or
             from the past 6 weeks in the medical record)

          -  All women will have evidence of a prolactin related hormonal side effect (amenorrhea,
             oligomenorrhea or galactorrhea). This will be determined by patient report/history
             and medical record/clinician interview. Oligomenorrhea is defined as infrequent,
             irregularly timed episodic bleeding occurring at intervals of more than 35 days from
             the previous menstrual cycle and amenorrhea is defined as absence of menstruation for
             three menstrual cycles or 6 months (Berek et al. 2002). Galactorrhea is defined as
             lactation or copious milk secretion.

          -  Subjects must be judged competent to participate in the informed consent process and
             provide voluntary informed consent, by scoring a 10 out of 12 on the Evaluation to
             Sign Consent (ESC)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Postmenopausal women will be excluded. Since it may be difficult to determine
             menopause in patients with amenorrhea, any women more than 45 years will be assessed
             for menopausal symptoms such as but not limited to or by: hot flushes, depression,
             excitability and fatigue. A medical doctor will advise on the menopausal status.

          -  Patients with a history of a pituitary tumor (microadenoma, macroadenoma, neoplasm)
             will not be included in the study. Previous medical records will be obtained if
             possible to examine prolactin levels and medical histories.

          -  Subjects with documented Cushing's disease, or who are pregnant or currently
             lactating post pregnancy will be excluded.

          -  Subjects who meet DSM-IV TR criteria for alcohol or substance abuse within the last
             month are excluded. Subjects with nicotine use or dependence will not be excluded.

          -  Medications which may increase prolactin or cause sexual dysfunction, including:
             metoclopramide, methyldopa, reserpine, amoxapine, droperidol, prochlorperazine,
             promethazine, bromocriptine, cabergoline, pergolide, There are many medications that
             may affect sexual function (not hormonal side effects) unrelated to dopamine
             transmission. These are only permitted as long as the subject has been receiving them
             for greater than 4 weeks (SSRIs, mood stabilizers, diuretics, antihypertensives,
             H2antagonists, bupropion). We allow these medications to enhance generalizability
