  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to examine the immune response generated by sipuleucel-T in
      subjects previously treated with sipuleucel-T in the androgen dependent setting. The study
      will also assess the safety of receiving up to 3 additional infusions of sipuleucel-T. This
      is an open-label, uncontrolled, multicenter study, conducted in up to 14 clinical trial
      sites. The anticipated duration of the study is approximately 6 years.

             of non-measurable disease

          -  Castrate level of testosterone (&lt; 50 ng/dL) achieved via medical or surgical
             castration

             investigational product for prostate cancer within 28 days prior to registration

          -  Current or imminent pathologic long-bone fracture

          -  Known malignancies other than prostate cancer that are likely to require treatment

          -  A requirement for systemic immunosuppressive therapy for any reason

          -  A history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or
             biologic composition to sipuleucel-T or GM-CSF

          -  Any infection requiring antibiotic therapy or causing fever within 1 week prior to
             registration
