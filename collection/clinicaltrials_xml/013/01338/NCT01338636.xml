    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is asses whether ambrisentan can help people with Exercised
      Induced Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension. The investigators also want to find out if
      ambrisentan is safe to take without causing excessive side effects.

      Exercised Induce Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (EIPAH) population: These patients may
      provide a unique window into the pathogenesis of PAH. Our data suggest that these patients
      may represent an early phase of PAH with an abnormal vascular response.

      The study includes an assessment of the potential impact of ambrisentan on exercise capacity
      Advanced Level-3 CPET, and New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject provides written informed consent before the commencement of any study
             related procedure.

          -  The subject is 18 years of age or older.

          -  If a female subject of child-bearing potential, the subject must agree to use 2 forms
             of contraceptive therapy, including at least 1 barrier method, throughout the study
             and follow-up. (Women who are surgically sterile or those post-menopausal for at
             least 2 years are not considered to be of childbearing potential.)

          -  The subject has findings of either exercise induced PAH on a Advanced Level -3 CPET
             performed within the last 6-months and is a NYHA Class I or II.

          -  The subject has an LVEF 55%, obtained by any appropriate method (i.e., ECHO,
             radionuclide imaging, or cardiac catheterization)

          -  The subject is taking a stable concomitant medication regimen for at least 4 weeks
             prior to enrollment in the study that is not expected to change during the study
             period and follow-up. Changes in diuretic and/or nitrate therapy as needed during the
             study period are acceptable.
