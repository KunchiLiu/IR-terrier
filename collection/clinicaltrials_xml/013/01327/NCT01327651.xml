  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a method of preventing HIV infection through the use of
      antiretroviral (ARV) medications before exposure to HIV. This study will examine the
      feasibility of different methods of dosing for a PrEP regimen. Three methods of delivery
      will be compared: daily, time-based, and event-based.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      No single strategy for the prevention of HIV has emerged as consistently used and
      successful, so multiple strategies have been developed. PrEP involves delivering ARV
      medications to people before they are exposed to HIV, in order to prevent infection. The
      optimal method of delivering PrEP has not yet been determined. This study will examine the
      feasibility of delivering PrEP in three methods. Daily dosing involves receiving ARV
      medications every day; time-driven dosing involves receiving ARV medications twice weekly
      plus a post-exposure dose; and event-driven dosing involves receiving ARV medications before
      and after a potential exposure to HIV. The ARV medication that will be used in this study is
      a combination pill that contains emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (FTC/TDF).
      Recent research studies have shown that, if taken consistently, a daily oral dose of FTC/TDF
      can reduce the risk of HIV infection.

      This study will enroll HIV-uninfected men who have sex with men and transgender women
      (MSM/TGW) and women who have sex with men (WSM). Participation will last 34 weeks. All
      participants will be given a combination pill that contains FTC/TDF. For the first 5 weeks,
      all participants will come to the study clinic weekly to receive a single dose of FTC/TDF.

      At Week 6, participants will be randomly assigned to one of three groups. In the daily
      dosing group, participants will take FTC/TDF once a day. In the time-dosing group,
      participants will take FTC/TDF twice per week and another dose after sexual intercourse (a
      post-exposure dose). In the event-dosing group, participants will take FTC/TDF before and
      after sexual intercourse. During this part of the study, participants will be given FTC/TDF
      to take on their own. Every week, from Week 6 to Week 29, study officials will call to ask
      questions about how many pills participants have taken and when they have had sexual
      intercourse. Participants will also complete computer-assisted self-interviews (CASIs).

      Study visits will occur at enrollment, once a week for the first 5 weeks, and then once a
      month until Week 34. Assessment will include recording of medical history, completing an
      interview about sexual practices and background, and collection of blood, urine, and hair
      samples. Select study visits will include vaginal practices assessment (including use of
      lubricants and vaginal cleansing practices), family planning assessments (for women), and
      sex hormones assessments (for men).

      Participants who acquire HIV infection during the study will discontinue study product.
      These participants will continue to be followed after enrollment at Weeks 4, 6, 10, 14, 18,
      22, 26, 30, and every 12 weeks thereafter, as appropriate, until the last study participant
      completes follow-up at the study site. Participants whose first reactive HIV rapid test is
      at Week 34 who are later confirmed to be HIV infected will also be followed every 12 weeks
      after their Week 30 visit until the last study participant completes follow-up at the study
      site. Participants who acquire HIV infection during the study will undergo select protocol
      procedures and will receive counseling and referrals for HIV treatment.
