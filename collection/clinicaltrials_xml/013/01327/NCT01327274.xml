  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a Phase 3, multicenter, non-randomized study to evaluate the safety and
      efficacy of the next-generation outpatient Magnetic Mini-Mover Procedure (3MP) in 15
      patients aged 8-14 years for the correction of pectus excavatum ('sunken chest'). 3MP for
      pectus excavatum uses a magnetically coupled implant to pull the sternum forward and
      gradually remodel the deformed costal cartilage. The Funding Source for this trial is the
      FDA Office of Orphan Products Development (Grant #R01 FD003341).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pectus excavatum is the most common congenital chest wall abnormality in children. The
      investigators have developed a novel method of achieving gradual deformation/reformation of
      chest wall cartilage. A magnetic force field is used to apply controlled, sustained force to
      promote biologic reformation of structural cartilage. A magnet is implanted on the sternum
      and secured through a 2-inch subxiphoid incision as a one-hour outpatient procedure. The
      magnet (and sternum) is pulled outward by another magnet suspended in a novel, low-profile,
      lightweight device previously molded to the patient's anterior chest wall. The low-profile,
      non-obtrusive anterior chest wall prosthesis is held in place by the force field between the
      two magnets.

      In the single-center, FDA-funded trial (IDE G050196), the investigators tested proof of
      concept, safety and probable benefit of this procedure in 10. In this Phase III multicenter
      trial, the investigators will further test the safety and efficacy of the procedure in 15
      otherwise healthy patients with moderate-to-severe PE, ages 8 to 14. The investigators will
      be using the next generation Magnimplant device (IDE G090006), a design the investigators
      believe is much improved in terms of safety and ease of implantation/explantation.
      Implantation of the Magnimplant will be accomplished in an outpatient procedure. The
      investigators will document the rate of correction by comparing chest X-ray measurement of
      the Pectus Severity Index prior to implantation, to that measured after the magnet is
      removed. Treatment will last 18-24 months, depending on correction and when the patient has
      completed his or her pubertal growth spurt, as documented by hand x-ray. Explant of the
      device will be accomplished in an outpatient procedure. The investigators will document
      safety with an EKG prior to implantation, one month post-implantation, and finally after the
      magnet is removed. The investigators will document efficacy by comparing pre- and
      post-treatment PSI, as well as by evaluating patient satisfaction with a post-procedure
      Quality of Life-type survey. Long-term follow-up will occur at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months
      after explantation.

    <description>The rate of correction and final position of the sternum will be measured using the Pectus Severity Index. The mean value for pectus patients is approximately 4.98 and the normal chest is 2.56. Correction is defined as P.I. &lt; 3.25.</description>

    <description>Comfort of the external brace directly affects compliance (i.e., bracewear) and compliance will be measured throughout treatment. In addition, the satisfaction of the patient and family will be measured using a standard Quality of Life (QOL) questionnaire administered 1 month after implanting the device and 1 month after removing the device.</description>

They will undergo 3MP treatment for 18-24 months, enough to attempt to improve their PSI (&lt; 3.25).</description>
