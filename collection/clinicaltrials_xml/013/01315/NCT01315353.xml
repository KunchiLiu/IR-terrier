  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Women sometimes develop cancer in an area called the cervix, which is the opening to the
      uterus, or womb. Women who have HIV are more likely to get this kind of cancer than women
      who do not have HIV. Nearly all of these cancers are caused by another virus, called human
      papilloma virus (or HPV). Other times, the cause of this cancer is not known.

      The investigators are looking for a better way to prevent cervical cancer. This study is
      comparing two different methods to prevent cancer of the cervix in women who have HIV. This
      study will also see if these methods are safe and tolerable in women who have HIV.

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Participants in Arm A (HPV test-and-treat) will undergo cervical cryotherapy at entry. Post entry, participants in Arm A will be seen at regular intervals for the collection of cervical specimens, cytology, and as needed cervical colposcopy, directed biopsies, and LEEP.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Arm B: cytology-based strategy</arm_group_label>

    <description>Participants in Arm B will follow a cytology-based management plan involving three steps- cytology, colposcopy with directed biopsies, and LEEP (as needed).</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Arm C : Ineligible for randomization to Arm A or B</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Participants will be eligible for Arm C under the conditions noted in the inclusion criteria. Participants in Arm C will undergo colposcopy and directed biopsies at entry. If CIN2+ is found by biopsy, then LEEP will be performed and a follow-up visit 26 weeks after these procedures will be scheduled for the collection of cervical specimens, cytology, and as needed cervical colposcopy, directed biopsies, and LEEP. After the week 26 visit, Arm C participants will go off study.</description>

    <description>Participants will undergo cervical cryotherapy within 7 days after study entry. The cryotherapy consists of two 3-minute freezes separated by 5 minutes of thawing.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  HIV-1 infection.

             inspection or HSIL cervical cytology. These participants are not eligible for
             randomization to Arms A or B and will be followed in Arm C.

          -  Suitable candidate for cervical cryotherapy (as defined in the protocol). Unsuitable
             participants are not eligible for randomization to Arms A or B and will be followed
             in Arm C.

          -  For participants of reproductive potential, negative pregnancy test within 48 hours
             prior to study entry.

          -  Must agree not to participate in a conception process (e.g. active attempt to get
             pregnant or in vitro fertilization), or use at least one reliable contraceptive if
             participating in sexual activity, from time of study entry until 12 weeks after study
             entry.

          -  If recently gave birth, must be at least 12 weeks postpartum.

          -  Ability and willingness of participant or legal guardian/representative to provide
             written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Current or prior history of cervical, vaginal, or vulvar cancer.

          -  Prior cervical cryotherapy, LEEP, cervical conization, or total or partial
             hysterectomy.

          -  Cervical, vaginal, or vulvar lesions that are suspicious on clinical exam for cancer.

          -  Visual evidence of bacterial STIs or suspicion of pelvic inflammatory disease.

          -  Prior vaccination with an HPV vaccine.

          -  Hemophilia.

          -  Currently on anticoagulation therapy other than acetylsalicylic acid.

          -  Active drug or alcohol use or dependence or any other condition that, in the opinion
