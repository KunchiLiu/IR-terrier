    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the most effective method between Transcutaneous
      Electrical Stimulation and Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation therapy
      carbon dioxide therapy for pain control in the post-surgical rehabilitation of patients
      treated with reconstruction of the rotator cuff.

    <textblock>
      To evaluate the most effective method between Transcutaneous Electrical Stimulation and
      Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation therapy carbon dioxide for pain
      control in the post-surgical rehabilitation of patients treated with reconstruction of the
      rotator cuff and to evaluate, at the end of the rehabilitation period, the range of motion,
      the function gained and the quality of life comparatively in the two groups of patients
      treated with Transcutaneous Electrical Stimulation or Light Amplification by Stimulated
      Emission of Radiation therapy carbon dioxide therapy.
