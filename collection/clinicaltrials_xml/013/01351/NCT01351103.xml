      This primary purpose of this study is to find the recommended dose of LGK974 as a single
      agent and in combination with PDR001 that can be safely given to adult patients with
      selected solid malignancies for whom no effective standard treatment is available.

    <time_frame>61 months</time_frame>
    <description>The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (new or worsening from baseline) will be summarized by primary system organ class, severity based on the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03, type of AE, relationship to study drug by dose group. Deaths reportable as SAEs and non-fatal serious adverse events will be listed by patient and tabulated by primary system organ clase, type of AE and dose group.</description>

    <time_frame>61 months</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluate pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters such as AUClast, AUCtau, Cmax, the apparent elimination T1/2 and Racc for LGK974 and its pharmacologically metabolite. This will include but is not limited to the following timepoints: 8 times at C1D1; C1D2, C1D8, C1D16 and C1D22 pre-dose; 8 times at C1D15; and then pre-dose for each subsequent cycles D1.</description>

    <measure>Overall response rate of tumor</measure>
    <time_frame>61 months</time_frame>
    <description>Patients with an Objective Overall Response (OOR) were those whose best response to treatment was a complete response (CR) or a partial response (PR) assessed by RECIST 1.1 or irRC . A patient had a CR if the target tumors disappeared. A patient had a PR if there was a â‰¥ 30% reduction in the sum of the products of the largest perpendicular diameters of the target tumors compared to the baseline value. Duration of Response (DOR) will also be summarized and is defined as the time from first observation of response to the first time of progression or death.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Diagnosis of locally advanced or metastatic cancer that has progressed despite standard
        therapy or for which no effective standard therapy exists and histological confirmation of
        one of the following diseases indicated below:

        Single Agent Dose escalation part:documented B-RAF mutant colorectal cancer or pancreatic
        adenocarcinoma. In addition, tumors of any histological origin with documented genetic
        alterations upstream in the Wnt signaling pathway are eligible with prior agreement with
        Novartis.

        documented RNF43 mutation and/or RSPO fusion or pancreatic adenocarcinoma with documented
        RNF43 mutation. In addition, patients with tumors of any histological origin with
        documented genetic alterations upstream in the Wnt signaling pathway (e.g. RNF43 or RSPO
        fusion) are eligible with prior agreement with Novartis

        LGK974 with PDR001: Dose escalation: melanoma patients primary refractory to anti-PD-1
        inhibitor. Dose expansion: patients with pancreatic cancer, or TNBC, or melanoma, or head
        and neck cancer.
