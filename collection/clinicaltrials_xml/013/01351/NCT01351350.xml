    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, Open Label, Dose Escalation Study of Oral Administration of MLN0128 in
      Combination With Paclitaxel, With/Without Trastuzumab, in Subjects With Advanced Solid
      Malignancies

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, open-label study consisting of a dose escalation phase in advanced solid
      malignancies to determine the MTD of oral administration of MLN0128 in 1 or more dosing
      schedules, combined with paclitaxel on Days 1, 8 and 15 of each cycle, followed by an
      expansion phase for further safety and preliminary efficacy. Once the MTD is determined for
      each of the dosing schedules evaluated, a dose and schedule will be selected for the
      expansion phase, which may enroll subjects into 2 arms in parallel:

        -  Arm A will consist of HER2-/unknown cancer subjects receiving MLN0128+paclitaxel

        -  Arm B will consist of HER2+ cancer subjects receiving MLN0128+paclitaxel plus weekly
           trastuzumab
