    <textblock>
      This open-label, randomized, multicenter study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      bevacizumab (Avastin) in combination with standard of care (SOC) treatment in participants
      with advanced non-squamous NSCLC. Participants will be enrolled at documentation of
      progression of disease (PD) after 4-6 cycles of first-line treatment with bevacizumab plus a
      platinum doublet-containing therapy and a minimum of two cycles of bevacizumab maintenance
      treatment prior to PD. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment arms
      to receive either bevacizumab plus SOC treatment or SOC treatment alone.
