  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Between 12 and 16% of children in the United States have a developmental disability.
      Research has demonstrated that early intervention programs are not only essential for
      improved outcomes in these children, but also cost-effective. As a result, there has been a
      push within the pediatric medical community to identify children with developmental delays
      or disabilities as early as possible. Currently, most pediatric primary care providers do
      not use standardized methods for developmental surveillance and screening. Instead they rely
      on intuition and clinical judgment which has been shown to have limitations when compared
      with standardized screening methods. Researchers and physician organizations such as the AAP
      have called on pediatric primary care providers to institute a standardized approach for the
      identification of developmental delays that includes both developmental surveillance and
      screening. In fact, the AAP recently published an algorithm for developmental surveillance
      and screening within a primary care setting. Physicians, however, cite several barriers to
      the implementation of these recommendations within their practices, including lack of time,
      lack of office staff, inadequate reimbursement, and language barriers.

      The investigators have developed a novel computer decision support system (CDSS) for
      implementing clinical guidelines and algorithms within pediatric practices called CHICA. The
      investigators believe that this CDSS has the potential to address the barriers cited in
      previous studies as obstacles specific to the implementation of developmental surveillance
      and screening within primary care practices. CDSS will allow for developmental surveillance
      and screening to fit within the workflow of a busy pediatric practice without requiring an
      additional investment of time on the part of the physician and without requiring additional
      office staff.

      The aims of this study are to (1) Expand and modify an existing computer-based decision
      support system (CHICA) to include the 2006 AAP developmental surveillance and screening
      algorithm; (2) Evaluate the effect of the CHICA system on the developmental surveillance and
      screening practices of four pediatric clinics; (3) Evaluate the effect of the CHICA system
      on referrals for developmental and medical evaluations as well as early developmental
      intervention/early childhood services for those children identified as having concerning
      developmental screening results; and (4) Develop a cohort of children with identified
      developmental disabilities that can be followed over time in order to look at the end
      results/effects of developmental screening

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  This study will involve the analysis of data collected in the care of children seen
             in four IUMG-PC pediatric clinics. For aim 2 of the study all children between the
             ages of 0 and 3 seen in the four study clinics will be eligible for and will be
             participants in the study.

        For aim 3 of the study, a child is eligible for participation if they are younger than 5
        years of age, have a concerning developmental screening result, and are seen in one of the
        four clinics participating in this study. Additionally, these children cannot have a
        previous diagnosis of a developmental disorder and at least one of the child's parents
        must speak English.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  For aim 3, having no parents who can speak English
