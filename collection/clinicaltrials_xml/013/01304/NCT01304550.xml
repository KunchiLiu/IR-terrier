      This is a retrospective comparison of hemoglobin measurements obtained by arterial blood gas
      analysis and the Masimo Continuous Hemoglobin Monitor

      The chief objective of this study is to internally validate the accuracy of the Masimo SpHb
      (TM) technology as compared to our laboratory measurement of Hb. We have been using the
      Masimo SpHb monitor on patients who underwent open heart surgery, hepatic resection, kidney
      transplant and aortic aneurysm repair since January 2009. These patients also had hemoglobin
      concentration measurements as part of the arterial blood gas analysis performed by our
      laboratory to evaluate intraoperative ventilation and electrolyte changes. We will collate
      the laboratory measurements with the Masimo SpHb values documented in the anesthetic
      records.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who had indwelling arterial catheters placed for surgeries that involved
             major blood loss and who had serial hemoglobin concentration measurements for their
             surgeries, since January 2009. This will represent approximately 50 patients.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Inclusion criteria are patients undergoing major surgery from January 2009 - April
             2009, who had continuous hemoglobin pulse oximetry readings form the Masimo SpHb
             monitor and serial hemoglobin concentration measurement from the lab. Patient who did
             not have these studies will be excluded.
