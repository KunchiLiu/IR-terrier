  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between trauma and startle. The
      investigators are also looking at the effect of menstrual phase on this relationship.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are trying to understand if there is a relationship between the experience
      of traumatic events such as those experienced by people with post traumatic stress disorder
      and reactivity to startling noises or mild threats. So, the investigators are looking at
      startle reflex, heart rate, and stress hormone responses to short noises and small shocks in
      people exposed to trauma and who either do or do not have PTSD. Additionally, the
      investigators will be looking at how the menstrual cycle impacts these processes. The
      investigators know that women have twice the risk for developing PTSD and some research
      suggests that stress hormones change during the menstrual cycle and may have an effect on
      risk.
