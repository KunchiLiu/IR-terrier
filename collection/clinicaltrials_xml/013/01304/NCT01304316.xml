  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics and safety
      of a nasal spray containing the anesthetic drug tetracaine in combination with oxymetazoline

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to determine the safety and pharmacokinetics of the standard
      dose of intranasal Kovacaine Mist of 0.6 mL (18 mg tetracaine HCl with 0.3 mg oxymetazoline
      HCl) and a proposed maximum recommended dental dose of 1.2 mL (36 mg tetracaine HCl with 0.6
      mg oxymetazoline HCl). The primary objectives were to determine if either dose significantly
      changed blood pressure readings (systolic and diastolic), pulse rate, or oxygen saturation
      levels from baseline pretreatment values and to determine the safety profile of both doses.
      The secondary objectives were to establish the pharmacokinetics of oxymetazoline,
      tetracaine, and its major metabolite (parabutylaminobenzoic acid) following the intranasal
      administration of both doses. Each subject received the standard dose (3 sprays in each
      nostril with 4 minutes between each pair of sprays) followed 1 to 3 weeks later by the high
      dose (as 6 sprays in each nostril).
