  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Among HIV-infected individuals, non-injection drug use (NIDU) is associated with poor HIV
      medication adherence, greater HIV/AIDS risk behaviors, and increasing non-AIDS mortality.
      Thus reducing NIDU among HIV infected individuals is critical to their survival and to
      limiting the spread of HIV. We propose to study the efficacy of a technologically enhanced
      brief intervention (HealthCall) to reduce NIDU in HIV primary care patients that demands
      little from busy medical staff and is well accepted by patients. In a 3-arm randomized
      clinical trial will test the efficacy of (a) Motivational Interviewing (MI)+HealthCall; (b)
      MI-only; and (c) a control condition (advice + DVD HIV health education) in reducing NIDU.

    <description>Patients access HealthCall by calling a toll-free number and putting a four-digit Personal Identification Number (PIN). The HealthCall system will then ask a short script of pre-recorded questions in English or Spanish, on substance use and other variables (e.g., medication adherence, unprotected sex, feeling of physical well-being, stress, etc).</description>

    <description>The MI session focuses on reduce ambivalence and increase motivation to reduce non-injection drug use (NIDU), gain a commitment to change, if possible, and ultimately to reduce or eliminate NIDU. The intervention includes: a) identifying pros and cons of using and stopping; b) exploring ambivalence about stopping NIDU; c) eliciting change talk</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All research volunteers will be 18 and older and HIV positive. We will include
             participants whose primary drug is non-injection use of cocaine, opioids including
             heroin, or methamphetamines and current use in the past 30 days &gt; 4 days.
             Participants will need to complete a medically supervised detoxification if such
             detoxification is required.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Excluded are research volunteers for whom participation would not be clinically
             appropriate, who clearly could not participate. Psychotic, suicidal or homicidal
             patients require clinical management that is too intensive for this study, and we
             have no evidence that MI+HealthCall would be effective among injection drug users.
             Leaving New York precludes follow-up. Gross psychomotor/cognitive impairments that
             may hinder patients' HealthCall use. Hearing and severe vision impairments that
             preclude telephone use precludes randomization to MI+HealthCall.
