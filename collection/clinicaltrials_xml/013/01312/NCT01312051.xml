    <textblock>
      Blacks are at increased risk for obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular
      disease. A common pathogenetic link among these entities is insulin
      resistance/hyperinsulinemia.

      The specific aims of this project are: 1) to compare skeletal muscle lipid content (SMLC) in
      black vs white children by computed tomography (CT) scan of the mid-thigh, and assess the
      relationship to in vivo insulin sensitivity; 2) to test the hypothesis that free fatty acid
      (FFA) - induced insulin resistance is associated with larger increases in intramyocellular
      lipid (IMCL) in black vs white adolescents; 3) to examine if β-cell insulin secretion in
      prepubertal black children is more sensitive to the stimulatory effect of FFA than in
      whites; and 4) to test if the β-cell in black obese adolescents is more susceptible to the
      lipotoxic effect of FFA compared with whites. The methods to be used are: the well-
      established CT method as well as Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (1H-MRS) to assess SMLC and
      IMCL; intralipid infusion to elevate circulating FFA levels; the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic
      clamp with stable isotopes and indirect calorimetry to measure insulin sensitivity and
      substrate turnover; the hyperglycemic clamp to assess insulin secretion; DEXA and whole body
      MRI for body composition assessments.
