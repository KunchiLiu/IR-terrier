      This will be a proof of principle clinical trial to evaluate the use of pasireotide (SOM230)
      in women with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) of the breast. Surgery and radiotherapy are
      used as treatment for DCIS and subsequent treatment with antiestrogens has been effective in
      reducing the occurrence of invasive breast cancer. Unfortunately, treatment with
      antiestrogens carries potential serious side effects and toxicities that are intolerable to
      some patients. Preliminary data suggest that inhibition of IGF-1 action in the breast will
      be at least as effective as tamoxifen. Pasireotide is a somatostatin analog that prevents
      mammary development by inhibiting IGF-1 action directly in the mammary gland and also
      indirectly without causing menopausal symptoms. This study is an expansion of work that we
      have previously done in women with atypical hyperplasia of the breast, which showed that
      treatment with pasireotide for 10 days caused a reduction in the cellularity of these
      precancerous lesions. In our present study, women with DCIS will be treated with pasireotide
      for 20 days prior to surgical excision. Endpoints will be as follows:

        1. To determine whether pasireotide will inhibit cell proliferation and angiogenesis
           (signs of tumor growth), and stimulate apoptosis (cell death) in surgically excised
           tissue in comparison to core biopsies from women with estrogen receptor (ER) positive
           DCIS. Both the core biopsy and surgical excision are standard of care procedures that
           women with DCIS have regardless of participation in this trial.

        2. To use dynamic contrast enhanced MRI to assess patients before and after treatment with
           pasireotide and evaluate for changes in tumor volume and other tumor related features

        3. In our previous study we found that many women experienced a slight elevation in blood
           sugar with 10 days of treatment with pasireotide. Other work has shown that this effect
           often resolves with greater duration of treatment. We are therefore expanding the
           duration of treatment in this study to 20 days to assess if the initial hyperglycemia
           seen with pasireotide improves as treatment duration progresses.

    <textblock>
      Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is a direct precursor of invasive breast cancer and is also
      a marker of an increased chance of developing invasive cancer in the ipsilateral and
      contralateral breast. Surgery and radiotherapy are used as treatment for DCIS and subsequent
      treatment with antiestrogens has been effective in reducing the occurrence of invasive
      breast cancer in DCIS patients. Unfortunately, treatment with antiestrogens carries
      potential side effects and toxicities. The investigators have data to suggest that
      inhibition of IGF-I action in the breast will be more effective than antiestrogens, raising
      hopes it might be effective enough to stand alone as a treatment. Pasireotide is a
      somatostatin analog that prevents mammary development by inhibiting IGF-I action directly in
      the mammary gland and also indirectly, without causing menopausal symptoms and signs. As
      both estrogen (E2) and progesterone (P) require IGF-I in order to act, part of the
      inhibitory effect of pasireotide is on prevention of estrogen action. The investigators have
      data that indicate that IGF-I also has direct actions on the breast that are independent of
      steroid hormones. One example is that IGF-I has a direct stimulatory effect on mammary
      development in the absence of E2. Additionally, IGF-I has effects on ER-negative tumor cell
      lines that can be reversed by IGF-I inhibition. If pasireotide inhibited both E2 related and
      E2 unrelated effects of IGF-I it would likely be more effective than antiestrogens.
      Preliminary data in rats show that pasireotide, at minimum, can entirely substitute for
      tamoxifen. To determine whether pasireotide had activities in women at high risk for breast
      cancer, similar to those observed in rats, the investigators were awarded a DOD Synergistic
      Idea grant. Those data are expected to be reported soon.

      The investigators plan to expand this work to determine in principle whether pasireotide has
      the potential to treat DCIS. The investigators plan on treating 24 women, with low grade
      (8), intermediate grade (8) and high grade (8) ER-positive DCIS tumors. The investigators
      will assess its effect on apoptosis, cell proliferation, angiogenesis, ER and PR and
      phosphorylation of IGF-IR and IRS-1 before and after 20 days of treatment with pasireotide
      in core biopsy vs. surgical excision specimens. These endpoints will be measured by specific
      immunohistochemistry. Simultaneously, the investigators will determine whether IGF-I
      inhibition will reduce angiogenesis in DCIS using dynamic contrast enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) at
      3.0 Tesla, in addition to mammography. This MRI technique is able to detect early changes of
      neo-angiogenesis associated with invasive breast cancers and DCIS. Pasireotide should
      theoretically inhibit angiogenesis in these women, as it does in mice. The DCE-MRI may also
      show changes in tumor volume, morphologic and kinetic features. Imaging will serve as an
      additional measure to monitor response to treatment. Results will be correlated with
      pathology and immunohistochemical endpoints.

      In our previous work the investigators noted that there was an increase in blood glucose
      early after starting pasireotide, but the work of others has indicated that this side effect
      lasts only several weeks. The investigators found that suppressed levels of insulin (due to
      pasireotide effect on Î² cells) began to rise by day 10 of treatment. Therefore, extending
      the treatment period from 10 to 20 days with daily monitoring of patients will enable us to
      make certain that the early elevated glucose associated with pasireotide is only temporary.
      Another side effect is reduction in circulating levels of IGF-I. Theoretically, this could
      lead to body changes associated with growth hormone deficiency (GHD). Although, tamoxifen
      and raloxifene also lower serum IGF-I, and women taking it do not usually complain of
      symptoms of GHD, this is an issue that must be further investigated. However, if pasireotide
      is found to be effective in the treatment of DCIS, the benefit would likely outweigh the
      risk.

    <description>To determine whether pasireotide prevents angiogenesis in DCIS as it does in the rat mammary gland, we will immunostain tissue samples for Factor VIII to identify vessels in DCIS before and after treatment. Further, using dynamic contrast enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) we plan to detect changes in angiogenesis in vivo, non-invasively, and also detect effects of pasireotide which theoretically should inhibit vascularity. We propose to evaluate changes in the size of the lesion, changes in the morphologic appearance and kinetic features of the lesion.</description>

    <description>In our previous study, we found that women had moderately increased blood sugar early after starting SOM230. In other studies in normal individuals this effect disappeared by a week or two. We found some evidence of improvement during administration. However, extending the treatment period from 9.5 to 19.5 days will enable us to make certain that the early elevated sugar associated with SOM230 is only temporary.</description>
