    <textblock>
      The study will have three phases: Prerandomization, Randomization (Core Study), and
      Extension. The Randomization Phase may include Treatment Periods A1 and A2 (depending
      when/if subjects enter the open-label extension, and a follow-up period (for those subjects
      not continuing into the open-label extension). The open-label extension may include
      Treatment Periods B1, B2, and B3 (depending on when subjects enter the open label
      extension), and a follow-up period. Subjects may be followed for sustained viral response,
      if appropriate. In the Core Study (randomization phase) subjects will be randomized (in a
      1:1:1:1 ratio) to receive one of four treatments (placebo or E5501 [10mg, 20mg, and 30mg]
      for up to 21 days. Subjects will successfully complete Treatment Period A1 once their
      platelet counts are sufficient to enable initiation of antiviral treatment with PEG-IFN. The
      open label extension period will consist of up to three (depending on if/when subjects
      enter) Open-label Treatment Periods (B1, B2, and B3) and a follow-up period. During
      open-label treatment, all subjects will begin once-daily treatment with E5501 at a dose of
      20 mg. In Treatment Periods B2 and B3, subjects will be allowed to have their E5501 dose
      titrated up or down in accordance with their individual response, within the range of a
      minimum of 5mg and a maximum of 50mg.
