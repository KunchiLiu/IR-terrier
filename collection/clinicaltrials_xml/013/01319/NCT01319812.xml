    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to separately demonstrate the safety and efficacy of
      BIOTRONIK's Astron and Pulsar stents. The Pulsar stent will be used for the treatment of
      femoro-popliteal lesions, located in the native superficial femoral artery (SFA) or proximal
      popliteal artery (PPA), while the Astron stent will be used for the treatment of the common
      or external iliac artery lesions.

        Inclusion Criteria

        To support the objectives of this study, the following initial inclusion criteria must be
        met for a subject to be enrolled and considered for the index procedure:

          -  Candidate for PTA

          -  Life-style limiting claudication or rest pain with an ABI ≤ 0.9 (resting or
             exercise). Thigh brachial index (TBI) may be used / performed if ABI is inadequate.

          -  Written informed consent

        For a subject to receive an investigational stent, the following procedure-related
        criteria must be met:

          -  One de novo, restenotic or occluded lesion representing a femoro-popliteal or iliac
             indication OR Two de novo, restenotic or occluded lesions representing one
             femoro-popliteal indication and one iliac indication on contralateral limbs - (i.e.
             one lesion per limb)

          -  Lesions may be one solid lesion or a series of multiple, smaller lesions to be
             treated as one lesion

          -  Subjects with bilateral, SFA/PPA disease (i.e. one SFA/PPA lesion per limb) are
             eligible for enrollment into the study. The target lesion will be selected at the
             investigator's discretion based on study eligibility criteria. The contralateral
             SFA/PPA intervention may be performed at the time of the index procedure (prior to
             treatment of study lesion); however, the use of an investigational treatment is
             prohibited. If the contralateral SFA/PPA intervention is not performed at the time of
             the index procedure, the intervention must be performed at least 30 days after the
             index procedure. The use of an investigational treatment for the contralateral
             intervention is prohibited.

          -  Subjects with bilateral, iliac disease (i.e. one iliac lesion per limb) are eligible
             for enrollment into the study. The target lesion will be selected at the
             investigator's discretion based on study eligibility criteria. The contralateral
             iliac intervention may be performed at the time of the index procedure; however, the
             use of an investigational treatment is prohibited. If the contralateral iliac
             intervention is not performed at the time of the index procedure, the intervention
             must be performed at least 30 days after the index procedure. The use of an
             investigational treatment for the subsequent contralateral intervention is also
             prohibited.

          -  Femoro-popliteal lesions must be located at least 1 cm distal to the profunda femoris
             artery and at least 3 cm above the knee joint (radiographic joint space)

          -  Iliac lesions must be located only in either the common or external iliac artery

          -  Lesions must be treatable with a maximum of two stents

          -  Angiographic evidence of ≥ 70% stenosis or occlusion (operator visual assessment)

          -  Lesion length ≤ 190 mm (if de novo or restenotic) or ≤ 100 mm (if occluded)

          -  Target vessel reference diameter: 2.5 to 6 mm (SFA/PPA) or 6 to 9 mm (iliac arteries)
             by visual estimate

          -  Angiographic evidence of patent SFA and PPA (iliac indication) and angiographic
             evidence of at least one distal vessel runoff to the foot (both femoro-popliteal and
             iliac indications). Patent is defined as &lt; 50% stenosis.

          -  For SFA/PPA intervention, a significant stenosis (&gt; 70%) or occlusion of an
             ipsilateral, inflow artery (e.g. aortoiliac, common femoral) must be successfully
             treated (use of investigational treatment prohibited) just prior to treatment of the
             target lesion. Successful treatment is defined as no complications and less than 30%
             residual stenosis following intervention.
