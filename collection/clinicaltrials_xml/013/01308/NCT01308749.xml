  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to conduct this pilot study to evaluate oxytocin as a supplemental
      treatment for improving social difficulties in individuals with autism.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed pilot study is an essential first step toward rigorously evaluating oxytocin
      treatment of individuals with autism. The biologic actions of oxytocin on social cognition
      and prosocial behaviors and the clinical, genetic and epigenetic evidence for involvement of
      the oxytocin system in the pathophysiology of some cases of autism strongly suggest that
      supplemental oxytocin therapy could significantly improve the social disabilities involved
      in autism. Many people feel that these social difficulties are the most characteristic and
      central feature of autism. Overall, this study aims to determine the tolerability,
      accessibility, and feasibility of an oxytocin pilot study.

      This study will consent up to 30 subjects in order to randomize up to 25 subjects into a
      2-month (8 weeks) randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled initial treatment period, a
      subsequent 2-month (8 weeks) period in which all participants receive oxytocin, and up to
      three post-treatment visits that occur at week 28 (±2 weeks),an interim visit anytime
      between week 16 and week 76 only for those patients who plan to start oxytocin on their own
      outside of study treatment and who will experience a lag time between week 16 (end of open
      label treatment) and when outside oxytocin treatment will begin, and some time before week
      76. The investigators hope that this study will help to inform future study designs in
      determining whether a short term or long term treatment trial is necessary to observe
      significant effects. This will also help to develop systematic preliminary safety measures.

    <measure>ADOS Severity Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 16 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) is a semi-structured assessment used to assess and diagnose individuals suspected of having autism of varying ages, developmental levels, and language skills (from no speech to verbally fluent). The ADOS includes four modules, each requiring just 35-40 minutes to administer. The individual being evaluated is given just one module, depending on his or her expressive language level and chronological age. The rater will observe social and communication behaviors during various activities in the appropriate module.
We will graphically examine the relationship between baseline levels of the biomarker measures and the within-subject change for severity at each of the major time points during oxytocin treatment and placebo treatment.</description>

    <description>The Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) focuses on problem behaviors in five sub-domains: irritability, attention, repetitive behaviors, unusual speech, and social withdrawal.
We will graphically examine the relationship between the ABC-Social Withdrawal sub-domain and baseline levels of the biomarker measures at each of the major time points during oxytocin treatment and placebo treatment.</description>

    <description>The PDD-BI examines both adaptive and maladaptive behaviors related to autism. It has normative scores for children between 2-11 years. For children 12 years and older, the norms (11 years, 11 months) will be used.
We will graphically examine the relationship between the PDD-BI outcome measure and the baseline levels of the biomarker measures at each of the major time points during oxytocin treatment and placebo treatment.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Between 3 and 17 years old, inclusive.

          -  Have a clinical diagnosis of autistic disorder confirmed according to DSM-IV criteria
             by using the Autism Diagnostic Interview - Revised (ADI-R) and/or the Autism
             Diagnostic Observation Scale (ADOS, Lord et al., 1989).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Changes in allied health therapies, behavioral or educational interventions within
             the past 2 months of the baseline visit other than those associated with school
             holidays.

          -  Changes in psychotropic and alternative medication doses in the last 30 days of the
             baseline visit.

          -  Subjects with a medical condition that might interfere with the conduct of the study,
             confound interpretation of the study results, or endanger their own well-being. This
             includes, but is not limited to, Rett Syndrome, impairment of renal function,
             evidence or history of malignancy or any significant hematological, endocrine,
             cardiovascular (including any rhythm disorder and uncontrolled hypertension),
             respiratory, hepatic, or gastrointestinal disease.

          -  Marked sensory impairment such as deafness or blindness that would interfere with
             conduct of the study.

          -  Pregnancy/Nursing because of the unknown effects of oxytocin to unborn babies and/or
             nursing infants. All females of child-bearing potential will be administered a urine
             or serum pregnancy test at screening and at any point during the study at physician
             discretion. Refusal to undergo a pregnancy test will result in exclusion from the
             study. The investigators will share results of pregnancy test with the subject's
             legal guardian.

          -  Refusal to practice contraception if sexually active because the effects of exposure
             to high concentrations of oxytocin on sperm or newly conceived embryos are unknown.
             Sexually active men and women should not take part in this study if they and their
             partners are not both using an effective birth control method (for example, women use
             birth control pills, an intrauterine device [IUD] or a diaphragm and men use
             condoms).

          -  Inability of caretakers to speak English.

          -  Absence of a consistent caretaker to report on symptoms.

          -  Subjects who, in the Investigator's opinion, might not be suitable for the study.
