      Study Background and Objectives: In the U.S. the majority of heart disease deaths are in
      women, not men. Much of the gender disparity in CVD rates relate to the burden of CV risk in
      women after the menopause. Depression has been associated with an increased risk for CVD
      morbidity and mortality. Even histories of recurrent depression in euthymic individuals are
      associated with elevated CV risk. Understanding the depression-CVD link may have particular
      relevance for women since women experience depression at a rate twice that of men.
      Substantial convergent evidence indicates that ovarian failure (estrogen deprivation) is one
      likely mechanism contributing to both CVD and depression in women. The perimenopause, a time
      associated with a two-fold increase in rates of depression, may provide an ideal opportunity
      for studying the pathophysiology of CV risk and depression in women.

      The primary objective of this study is to examine the prophylactic role of estradiol in the
      development of depressive symptoms and the progression of cardiovascular risk in
      perimenopausal women with or without histories of depression. The investigators predict that
      women susceptible to depression will be particularly vulnerable to the acceleration of CVD
      in the context of the perimenopause and, consequently, will show differentially greater
      benefit of estradiol treatment during the menopause transition for both indices of CV risk
      (e.g. inflammation, endothelial function, stress reactivity), as well as depressive
      symptoms.

    <description>Primary measures reflecting stress reactivity will consist of mean arterial pressure (MAP), vascular resistance index (VRI), plasma cortisol, and plasma IL-6. For each of these four measures, a delta score (change from rest to stress) will be calculated and then standardized as Z scores. The individual Z scores will then be averaged to yield a single Stress Reactivity profile measure - a composite score reflecting magnitude of activation in the four primary stress-responsive pathways.</description>
