      Mechanism-based choice of therapy for neuropathic pain:

      Can treatments success in neuropathic post-operative pain be coupled to psychophysical pain
      modulation profile?

      Neuropathic or idiopathic pain patients will be assessed with the variety of pain tests
      including the conditioned pain modulation (CPM) and temporal summation (TS). Then, they will
      be offered on the double-blind design a several weeks treatment with either pregabalin or
      duloxetine. Patients will be followed-up weekly by phone for their pain relief and will be
      re-assessed in the lab toward the end of the treatment. The investigators suggest that
      patients with less-efficient CPM (deficient pain inhibition) will &quot;earn&quot; more pain relief
      from the treatment with duloxetine, while the patients with the enhanced pain summation will
      response better to pregabalin.

    <description>The pain relief will be achieved by treatment with duloxetine or pregabalin. We propose that the patients with deficient pain inhibition (As assessed by conditioned pain modulation lab test) will have better drug efficacy of cymbalta which restores the deficient level of serotonin and noradrenalin. In turn, pregabalin will be more effective in patients with enhance central sensitization of pain as measured by temporal summation assessment. In line, CPM and TS will be modulated by the treatment, in parallel with the analgesic effect.</description>
