      The investigators propose a randomized, controlled trial of stapled pancreatic transection
      versus mesh reinforced stapled pancreatic transection. For the duration of the study period,
      participating surgeons will utilize a standardized staple technique. Either a reabsorbable
      polytrimethylene carbonate mesh (SEAMGUARD®) or reabsorbable strips of bovine pericardium
      (PERI-STRIPS DRY®) will be used to reinforce the stapled pancreatic transection line in the
      test group. In order to have a uniform test method, the investigators will utilize a
      laparoscopic stapling device for both open and laparoscopic procedures and a uniform staple
      size (4.8mm).

    <textblock>
      Pancreatic leak remains a significant cause of morbidity and extra cost following distal
      pancreatectomy. Historically, previous attempts to reduce the leak rate have met with
      limited success. To examine this problem the investigators propose a randomized, controlled
      trial of stapled pancreatic transection versus mesh reinforced stapled pancreatic
      transection. For the duration of the study period, participating surgeons will utilize a
      standardized staple technique. Either a reabsorbable polytrimethylene carbonate mesh
      (SEAMGUARD®) or reabsorbable strips of bovine pericardium (PERI-STRIPS DRY®) will be used to
      reinforce the stapled pancreatic transection line in the test group. In order to have a
      uniform test method, the investigators will utilize a laparoscopic stapling device for both
      open and laparoscopic procedures and a uniform staple size (4.8mm). A drain will be placed
      in the left upper quadrant at the time of resection. Drainage of the pancreatic resection
      bed is widely accepted and remains our current standard of care.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants must be 18 years or older and able to give consent. Any patient
             undergoing a distal pancreatectomy, laparoscopic or open, will be eligible for
             randomization.

          -  No exclusion is provided for primary diagnosis. In the event of a patient undergoing
             a planned resection of another organ or organs with only a possibility of a distal
             pancreatic resection (i.e. colectomy, hepatectomy, gastrectomy, nephrectomy), the
             patient will still be eligible for inclusion in the study. We expect that some
             patients will be randomized but not resected (ie metastasis identified). A few
             patients may not be stapled using the study device for technical reasons (ie the
             stapler does not fit). The data will be analyzed in an intent-to-treatment approach.
