  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prognosis of patients with locally advanced unresectable pancreatic cancer is poor, and
      the median survival is less than 1 year. FOLFIRINOX therapy, which induces tumor downstaging
      sufficient to allow surgical resection, could improve the overall survival of patients with
      locally advanced pancreatic cancer. Based on the FOLFIRINOX regimen for advanced pancreatic
      cancer, a phase II study of this regimen in patients with locally advanced unresectable and
      borderline pancreatic cancer is planned to determine the rate of conversion to operability.

    <description>Combination of drugs (Irinotecan, Oxaliplatin, Leucovorin, and 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU)) known as FOLFIRINOX every 2 weeks for 4 treatments. At the end of 4 cycles, patients will be re-evaluated for resectability by CT scan within 28 days of the last dose of chemo. If found amendable to surgery, patient will proceed with resection, and type of resection (R0 or R1) will be recorded.</description>
