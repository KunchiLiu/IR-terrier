  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to compare the effects of paliperidone versus oral
      antipsychotics on changes in brain parenchymal volume, number of relapses, and time to
      relapse during a one-year period of follow up of patients with new onset schizophrenia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will participate in 1 year of treatment with 3 MRI scans at six month intervals.
      Side effects and metabolic measures will be followed over the course of the study.

    <measure>The primary objective of this study is to compare the effects of paliperidone vs. &quot;standard treatment&quot; on changes in brain parenchymal volume</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Null Hypothesis 1: During a 1 year follow up period, brain parenchymal (tissue) loss in persons recently diagnosed with schizophrenia who are treated with paliperidone palmitate is not different from that seen in similar patients treated with oral antipsychotic treatment as measured by sMR.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>: To conduct a comparison study of the effects of paliperidone vs &quot;oral antipsychotic treatment&quot; on brain structure as measured using MR scanning in the two treatment groups and versus normal controls.</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>: Patients in both treatment groups will have progressive decreases in frontal lobe GM, WM, and in frontal lobe FA that are significantly greater than changes occurring in the normal controls. They will also have reduced intensity and extent of BOLD effect in prefrontal cortex and overall reduction in functional connectivity in the default network as measured with fMR during the default state.</description>
