  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to examine survival, safety, and the magnitude of the immune
      response induced following administration of DN24-02 in subjects with HER2+ urothelial
      carcinoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, Phase 2 study. Subjects will be randomized to either the
      investigational product, DN24-02, or to standard of care. The purpose of this study is to
      compare the length of survival between these 2 groups of subjects. Other purposes of the
      study are to learn about the safety of DN24-02, to learn if it delays the time until
      urothelial cancer recurs, and to learn if the immune system responds to treatment with
      DN24-02. All subjects will be followed for this study for the remainder of their lives.

             tissue expression.
