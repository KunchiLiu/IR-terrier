  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see the effect of adding a systemic study drug, Ipilimumab,
      to two standard chemotherapy drugs, Melphalan and Dactinomycin. The study drug Ipilimumab is
      an antibody to a normal protein found in the body, CTLA-4. This protein normally allows the
      immune system (the body's natural defense system that helps fight infections) uses to quiet
      an immune response. The study drug works by blocking this protein and allowing the immune
      system to become more active. This study will investigate the effects, of combining ILI
      (using two standard drugs to treat melanoma, Melphalan and Dactinomycin), with the study
      drug, Ipilimumab on advanced Melanoma cancer.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Willing and able to give written informed consent.

          -  Histologic diagnosis of melanoma with in transit metastasis Stage IIIB, IIIC, or IV

          -  Required values for initial laboratory tests:

          -  WBC ≥ 2000/uL

          -  ANC ≥ 1000/uL

          -  Platelets ≥ 50 x 103/uL

          -  Hemoglobin ≥ 8 g/dL

          -  Creatinine ≤ 3.0 x ULN

          -  AST/ALT ≤ 2.5 x ULN

          -  Bilirubin ≤ 3.0 x ULN, (except patients with Gilbert's Syndrome, who must have a
             total bilirubin less than 3.0 mg/dL)

          -  No active or chronic infection with HIV, Hepatitis B, or Hepatitis C.

          -  Karnofsky performance status ≥60

          -  Men and women, ≥ 18 years of age. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must be
             using an adequate method of contraception to avoid pregnancy throughout the study and
             for up to 8 weeks after the last dose of investigational product, in such a manner
             that the risk of pregnancy is minimized. WOCBP include any female who has experienced
             menarche and who has not undergone successful surgical sterilization (hysterectomy,
             bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral oophorectomy) or is not post-menopausal.
             Post-menopause is defined as:

          -  Amenorrhea ≥ 12 consecutive months without another cause, or

          -  For women with irregular menstrual periods and taking hormone replacement therapy
             (HRT), a documented serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level ≥ 35 mIU/mL.

          -  Women who are using oral contraceptives, other hormonal contraceptives (vaginal
             products, skin patches, or implanted or injectable products), or mechanical products
             such as an intrauterine device or barrier methods (diaphragm, condoms, spermicides)
             to prevent pregnancy, or are practicing abstinence or where their partner is sterile
             (eg, vasectomy) should be considered to be of childbearing potential. WOCBP must have
             a negative serum or urine pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent
             units of HCG) within 72 hours before the start of ipilimumab.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any other malignancy form which the patient has been disease-free for less than 2
             years, with the exception of adequately treated and cured basal or squamous cell skin
             cancer, superficial bladder cancer or carcinoma in situ of the cervix.

          -  Autoimmune disease: Patients with a history of inflammatory bowel disease are
             excluded from this study, as are patients with a history of symptomatic disease (eg,
             rheumatoid arthritis, systemic progressive sclerosis [scleroderma], systemic lupus
             erythematosus, autoimmune vasculitis [eg, Wegener's Granulomatosis]); motor
             neuropathy considered of autoimmune origin (e.g. Guillain-Barre Syndrome).

          -  Any underlying medical or psychiatric condition, which in the opinion of the
             investigator will make the administration of ipilimumab hazardous or obscure the
             interpretation of AEs, such as a condition associated with frequent diarrhea.

          -  Patients with underlying heart conditions who are deemed ineligible for surgery by
             cardiology consult

          -  Any history of prior treatment with ipilimumab or prior CD137 agonist or CTLA-4
             inhibitor or agonist.

          -  Concomitant therapy with any of the following: IL-2, interferon, or other non-study
             immunotherapy regimens; immunosuppressive agents; other investigation therapies; or
             chronic use of systemic corticosteroids.

          -  Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP), who:

          -  are unwilling or unable to use an acceptable method of contraception to avoid
             pregnancy for their entire study period and for at least 8 weeks after cessation of
             study drug, or

          -  have a positive pregnancy test at baseline, or

          -  are pregnant or breastfeeding.

             treatment of either a psychiatric or physical (eg, infectious) illness.

          -  Persons of reproductive potential must agree to use an adequate method of
             contraception throughout treatment and for at least 8 weeks after ipilimumab is
             stopped.

          -  Sexually active WOCBP must use an effective method of birth control during the course
             of the study, in a manner such that risk of failure is minimized. Before study
             enrollment, WOCBP must be advised of the importance of avoiding pregnancy during
             study participation and the potential risk factors for an unintentional pregnancy.
             All WOCBP MUST have a negative pregnancy test before first receiving ipilimumab. If
             the pregnancy test is positive, the patient must not receive ipilimumab and must not
             be enrolled in the study.
