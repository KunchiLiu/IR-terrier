    <textblock>
      Ten study centers from US are anticipated to participate for this evaluation. Published
      literature on coils with electrolytic, thermal or hydraulic detachment will serve as the
      basis for control comparisons to the Axium™ MicroFX™ Detachable Coil System for patients
      undergoing embolization of intracranial aneurysm. Comparison will be based on criteria
      evaluating the safety of the procedure, the reliability of detachment, the occlusion
      stability and the packing density impact

        All patients presenting with an intracranial aneurysm will be evaluated by the neuro
        interventional team, in accordance with institutional practice, to establish an
        appropriate treatment plan based on the patient's medical condition and available
        diagnostic screening prior to recruitment

          -  Aneurysm AVM related or dissecting.

          -  Participation in a clinical investigation of other aneurysm treating or related
             devices.

          -  Any condition that would preclude the conduct of protocol follow-up.

          -  Aneurysm anatomy that is determined inappropriate for Axium coil placement, prior to
             opening of an Axium coil.
