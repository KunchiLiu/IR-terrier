  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Life Span study (HANDLS) is a
      multidisciplinary, community-based, prospective longitudinal epidemiologic study examining
      the influences of race and socioeconomic status (SES) on the development of age-related
      health disparities among socioeconomically diverse African Americans and whites in
      Baltimore. This study investigates whether health disparities develop or persist due to
      differences in SES, differences in race, or their interaction. This study is unique because
      it will assess over a 20-year period physical parameters as well as evaluate genetic,
      biologic, demographic, and psychosocial parameters of African American and white
      participants in higher and lower SES. It also employs novel research tools, mobile medical
      research vehicles, in hopes of improving participation rates and retention among
      non-traditional research participants. The domains of the HANDLS study include: nutrition,
      cognition, biologic biomarkers, body composition and bone quality, physical function and
      performance, sociodemographics, psychosocial, neighborhood environment and cardiovascular
      disease. Utilizing data from these study domains will facilitate understand the driving
      factors behind persistent black-white health disparities in overall longevity,
      cardiovascular disease, and cognitive decline.

      HANDLS Wave 1, the initial recruitment and examination phase that began in August 2004, is
      complete. The current protocol outlines the revisit waves of this study HANDLS Wave, 2
      entitled, The Association of Personality and Socioeconomic status with Health Status An
      Interim Follow-up Study, which began in June 2006 under a separate protocol is designed as a
      telephone interview to occur approximately 18 months after the first visit to the mobile
      Medical Research Vehicles (MRVs). Wave 2 provides interim contact with study participants,
      and important interim information regarding their health. The next visit HANDLS Wave 3 will
      consist of the second visit to the mobile Medical Research Vehicles (MRVs) for a health
      examination to occur at least 3 years after the first, a telephone interview to include the
      dietary interview and questionnaires, and for a random sample of those who participate in
      the revisit a direct measurement of renal function and a brain scan study using M RI to
      examine the structure of the brain.

      HANDLS recruited a fixed cohort as an area probability sample of Baltimore City from August
      2004 through November 2009 as Wave 1 (Figure 1). HANDLS Wave 2 entitled The Association of
      Personality and Socioeconomic status with Health Status An Interim Follow-up Study began in
      June 2006 under a separate protocol. It was designed as a follow-up telephone interview
      approximately 18 months after the initial examination (Wave 1) was complete. Wave 2 provided
      interim contact with study participants, and important interim information regarding their
      health. Now completed, wave 3 was the first follow-up examination and participants second
      visit to our mobile Medical Research Vehicles (MRVs). The current protocol outlines Wave 4,
      the second follow-up examination and participants third visit to our mobile Medical Research
      Vehicles (MRVs). Planned as a follow-up after 3-4 years, Wave 4 consists of health
      examinations, a telephone dietary-recall interview, renal function assessments, and optional
      studies of circadian rhythm, structural MRIs, and an evaluation of the subjective experience
      of diabetes mellitus.
