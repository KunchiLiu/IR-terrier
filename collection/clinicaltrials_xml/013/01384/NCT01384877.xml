  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study's primary objective is to test the hypothesis that a single infusion of
      subcutaneous lidocaine can cause a clinically useful reduction in cancer pain within 48
      hours of infusion and lasting a minimum of 7 days. Subjects will receive either lidocaine or
      placebo, followed at least 3 weeks later by the alternate agent.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ten mg/kg of lidocaine will be infused subcutaneously via a Baxter infusor over a 5.5 hour
      period in ambulatory adult cancer patients with aworst pain score of at least 4 out of 10
      despite therapy with at least one opioid plus appropriate oral adjuvant analgesic(s).

      A clinically useful reduction in pain is defined by either a 2-point reduction (on a 0-10
      scale) in the worst pain experienced over a 24-hour period, or a ≥30% reduction in 24-hour
      opioid requirement.

      The secondary objectives are 1) to determine whether any significant toxicities occur as a
      result of the infusion. For this study significant toxicity is considered as any adverse
      event which either leads to the infusion being terminated, or which leads to medical
      intervention, such as prescribing of another medication or equivalent treatment, 2) to
      determine the effect of Lidocaine infusion on QOL parameters as measured by the Patient
      Outcome Scale (POS) Questionnaire and 3) to determine the duration of response to lidocaine
      infusion.

    <description>The primary outcomes measure is a binary variable indicating whether lidocaine caused a reduction in cancer pain within 48 hours of infusion and lasting a minimum of 7 days. Lidocaine will be considered to have caused reduction in cancer pain if the subject had either one of the following episodes lasting a minimum of 7 days:
A 2-point reduction in severity of pain as assessed by the worst pain score in the last 24 hours (question 3) of the Brief Pain Inventory - Short Form (BPI), compared to the BPI pain score at baseline.
Or:
≥30% reduction in 24-hour opioid dose.</description>
