    <textblock>
      The general hypothesis is that elderly have diminished nutritive flow to skeletal muscle and
      impaired capacity for building of muscles. In aging populations, this decreased ability to
      build muscles may represent a tipping point in the progression towards chronic physical
      frailty and disability. The goal is to examine whether novel pharmacologic therapies can
      improve nutritive blood flow to the muscles and muscle building in the elderly.

      The purpose of this study is 1) to determine if losartan administration will enhance the
      building of muscles via proteins and suppress muscle breakdown 2) to determine if
      N-acetylcysteine (NAC) will enhance blood flow to muscles and the building of muscles via
      proteins.

      The investigators will study community dwelling, healthy older men and women (60-85 years).
      Subjects will be randomized to one of three groups:

      Experimental Group 1: Placebo losartan and placebo N-acetylcysteine (NAC). Experimental
      Group 2: losartan (25mg/dose) and placebo N-acetylcysteine (NAC). Experimental Group 3:
      N-acetylcysteine (NAC) (50 mg/kg/dose) and placebo

      Subjects will admit the night before and get their first dose of NAC/ losartan/ placebo with
      dinner. Subjects will be fasted after 10 pm. The next morning at 6 am blood samples will be
      taken and leg blood flow (LBF) will be measured. Subjects will receive their second dose of
      NAC/ losartan/ placebo. As from 6 am every hour blood will be drawn until 1 pm. At 8am, the
      second biopsy is taken and LFB and CEU will be measured. At 11am they get their third dose
      of NAC/ losartan/ placebo together with leucine (oral) and again a muscle biopsy is taken
      and LBF is measured. Leucine is anabolic to skeletal muscle of elderly and so the
      investigators will use it to stimulate muscle building.

      The overall goals of this project are to 1) provide control (ambulatory) data for a
      subsequent grant proposal in which losartan will be tested for its ability to reduce loss of
      muscle mass and function during simulated hospitalization (SH) in older individuals, 2)
      determine the effect of losartan on basal and meal-stimulated muscle protein synthesis, in
      older individuals, and 3) determine the effect of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) on basal and
      meal-stimulated muscle protein synthesis in older individuals.

      Theoretical Framework The investigators have determined that skeletal muscle tissue
      perfusion in healthy elderly is blunted compared to young. Additionally, local skeletal
      muscle vasodilation with sodium nitroprusside or exercise increased muscle perfusion in the
      elderly to more youthful levels, and when performed in combination with increased plasma
      amino acid availability, greatly amplified muscle protein synthesis. In the absence of
      physical activity, protein ingestion via traditional mixed nutrient meals is the primary
      means of stimulating muscle protein anabolism via an increase in precursor availability.
      However, anabolic efficiency and protein synthetic response to a mixed nutrient meal is
      often blunted in elderly. Therefore, they propose that a common vasodilatory drug, losartan,
      newly discovered to block TGF-β activation and signaling in skeletal muscle by antagonizing
      the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1), will restore skeletal muscle nutritive flow via
      its vasodilatory actions and concomitantly prevent angiotensin II-induced muscle wasting.
      Notably, the vasodilatory effects of losartan are thought to be at least partially due to
      alleviation of oxidative stress (1) and the investigators previously found evidence for
      age-related oxidative stress in older individuals who exhibited resistance to the anabolic
      effects of amino acids (2). This latter finding is consistent with a previous report that
      antioxidant administration alleviates age-related anabolic resistance to leucine in rats
      (3). Accordingly, in the current study the investigators postulate that administration of
      the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) will restore skeletal muscle nutritive blood flow and
      sensitivity to the anabolic effects of leucine. Thus, in the current study they propose to
      administer placebo, losartan or NAC in a group of healthy elderly to target key mechanisms
      responsible for inactivity-induced losses of lean body mass and function.

      Hypotheses and Specific Aims

      The investigators will test the following hypotheses in older men and women (60-85 y):

        1. Losartan therapy will enhance skeletal muscle nutritive blood flow and nutritive
           flow-mediated muscle protein synthesis, will improve skeletal muscle redox homeostasis,
           and will suppress skeletal muscle TGF-β activation/signaling.

        2. NAC therapy will enhance skeletal muscle blood flow, nutritive flow-mediated muscle
           protein synthesis, and will improve skeletal muscle redox homeostasis

      The following specific aims will be tested:

        1. To determine if losartan administration will enhance nutritive flow-mediated muscle
           protein synthesis and suppress activation of TGF-β.

        2. To determine if NAC will enhance skeletal muscle blood flow, nutritive flow-mediated
           muscle protein synthesis, and improve skeletal muscle redox homeostasis.

      RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

      Subjects. The investigators will conduct a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
      intervention study designed to clinically and mechanistically assess novel therapies
      targeted at minimizing or preventing diminished nutritive flow to skeletal muscle and
      impaired capacity for net muscle protein anabolism in elderly. Subjects will be randomized
      to one of three groups:

      Group 1: Placebo losartan and placebo N-acetylcysteine Group 2: Losartan (25mg/dose) and
      placebo N-acetylcysteine Group 3: N-acetylcysteine (50 mg/kg/dose) and placebo losartan
      Recruitment. They will recruit and study 24 (n=8 per group) elderly men and women
      representative of the ethnic makeup of the United States (see Targeted/Planned Enrollment).
      The investigators will screen 48 people to achieve a total of 24 completed studies Subjects
      will be recruited through the Sealy Center on Aging Volunteer Registry at the University of
      Texas Medical Branch (UTMB). This registry provides a contact point for more than 600 older
      volunteers. Recruitment coordinators within the Center are trained to telephone screen
      individuals for past medical history, current health status and medications to determine if
      they will &quot;fit&quot; into a particular study. Recruitment and study coordinators will then
      arrange to meet the volunteer at the Clinical Research Center (CRC) to discuss the study and
      review the consent form. If consented, volunteers are screened and deemed eligible if they
      meet all inclusion criteria.

      Rationale for Subject Selection. The rationale for studying healthy elderly is that elderly
      have diminished nutritive flow to skeletal muscle and impaired capacity for net muscle
      protein anabolism. While it is understood that older subjects will fall along a continuum
      for any measurement of physical frailty, the investigators will perform this study in freely
      living subjects whose daily life does not depend on the direct assistance of others.

      Methods. Subjects will admit the night before and get their first dose of NAC/ losartan/
      placebo with dinner. Subjects will be fasted after 10 pm. The next morning at 6 am blood
      samples will be taken and leg blood flow (LBF) will be measured. Subjects will receive their
      second dose of NAC/ losartan/ placebo. As from 6 am (t = 0) every hour blood will be drawn
      until t = 7. At t = 2, the second biopsy is taken and LFB and CEU will be measured. At t = 5
      they get their third dose of NAC/ losartan/ placebo together with leucine (oral) and again a
      muscle biopsy is taken and LBF is measured. Leucine is anabolic to skeletal muscle of
      elderly and so they will use it to stimulate anabolism.

      Screening Visits. All procedures and risks associated with the study will be explained to
      the volunteer while obtaining informed consent. To determine eligibility for participation,
      all subjects will be screened with a battery of tests, including: 1) a physical examination
      and medical history (including history of asthma); 2) blood tests (25 ml blood), including
      cell count and liver function, hepatitis B and C, HIV, cholesterol, and electrolytes;
      coagulation panel; Urea Nitrogen (BUN), creatinine 3) urinalysis for kidney function; 4) an
      electrocardiogram (ECG); 5) an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and 6) a 2D echo with
      agitated saline.

        -  Oral Glucose Tolerance Test: On the Screening Visit all subjects will undergo a blood
           test for fasting blood glucose and then undergo a standard 2 hour oral glucose
           tolerance test. This test is important because losartan therapy has been suggested to
           improve insulin sensitivity in patients with type 2 diabetic nephropathy and reactive
           oxygen species have been reported to improve insulin sensitivity, an effect blocked by
           NAC.

        -  Baseline plasma creatinine and electrolytes will be measured. Once all screening test
           reports have been generated, the study team physicians and the PI will meet to
           determine subject eligibility. Eligible subjects will be notified by phone and
           scheduled for second screening visit.

        -  Second screening visit: 2D echo Doppler with agitated saline will be performed to rule
           out right to left shunt for administration of Definity® microbubbles for assessment of
           muscle microvascular perfusion.

      Randomization. All subjects will undergo block randomization based upon age and sex to
      ensure balanced experimental groups. Randomization will be performed by our biostatistician.

      Enrolled subjects will arrive at 3pm the day before measurement day at the CRC. Measurement
      of Muscle Mass and Volume with DEXA (Night before). Muscle mass will be determined using a
      DEXA scan (GE Lunar iDXA). The patient will be placed supine on the table and a whole body
      DEXA performed. The procedure takes ~15 minutes and radiation exposure is comparable to the
      dose received in a 2-hour airplane flight (~0.04 mrem). The same CRC operator will perform
      all DEXA analyses. The body will be divided in subregions: Truncal area, android, gynoid,
      right and left arm, and right and left leg. The investigators will be able to measure lean
      and fat mass individually for each subregion. The investigators will also analyze specific
      regions of interest for lean body mass, including the thigh and calf. The coefficient of
      variation for repeated measures of lean tissue is &lt;1%.

      Femoral Doppler Blood Flow and Heart Rate (t = 0, 2, 5, 6, 7) Subjects will be evaluated via
      Doppler ultrasound after placement of three ECG leads for heart rate and R wave monitoring.
      For the two-dimensional (2-D) and Doppler ultrasound measurements, an ultrasound system
      (HDI-5000; Philips Medical Systems, Bothell, WA) with a linear array transducer (L7-4) will
      be used with a transmit frequency of 12MHz. 2-D imaging of the common femoral artery will be
      performed in the long axis. Images will be triggered to the R wave of the cardiac cycle, and
      the femoral artery diameter will be measured using online video calipers. A pulsed-wave
      Doppler sample blood volume will be placed at the same location in the center of the artery,
      and the mean blood velocity will be measured using online angle correction and analysis
      software. Femoral artery mean blood flow will be calculated from 2-D and Doppler ultrasound
      data using the equation: Q = vπ ∙ (d/2)2, where Q is femoral blood flow, v is mean femoral
      artery blood flow velocity, and d is femoral artery diameter. The investigators have used
      this technique extensively in the first cycle of this grant.

      Contrast-enhanced Ultrasound (Night before and at t = 2, t = 7) All subjects will undergo
      imaging of the vastus lateralis muscle using an HDI-5000 and a P4-2 transducer. Imaging will
      be performed in a transaxial plane over the lateral portion of the vastus lateralis muscle
      group using power Doppler imaging after the continuous infusion of Definity® microbubbles. A
      mechanical index of 1.3 will be used. Depth, focus, and gain will be optimized and held
      constant throughout each study. Intermittent imaging will be performed using an internal
      timer. Data will be recorded on an SVHS videotape. A suspension of octafluoropropane
      gas-filled albumin microbubbles (Definity®, Lantheus Medical) will be infused intravenously
      at a rate of 3.0 mL/min for 8 min. Once systemic microbubble concentrations reach
      steady-state (~1.5 min), background images will be obtained at a frame rate of 1 second.
      Intermittent imaging will then be performed at a pulsing interval (PI) ranging from 1-25
      seconds, thus allowing progressively greater replenishment of the ultrasound beam elevation
      between destructive pulses. At least three images will be acquired at each PI. Videotape
      images will be digitized to an offline image analysis system. Several background frames will
      be averaged and digitally subtracted from similarly averaged frames at each PI.
      Background-subtracted video intensity (VI) at each PI will be measured from a region of
      interest (ROI) placed around the vastus lateralis muscle. PI vs. VI data will be fitted to
      the function: y = A (1 - e-βt), where y is video intensity at PI t, A is plateau video
      intensity (an index of microvascular blood volume) and β is the rate constant, which
      provides a measure of microvascular flow velocity. The investigators have used this
      technique extensively in past studies.

      Losartan Administration (Night before and t = 0, t = 5) Losartan is a novel orally available
      FDA-approved drug that pharmacologically inhibits the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.
      In particular, its primary mechanism of action is to inhibit production of the
      vasoconstrictor angiotensin II. It has a strong record of safety and efficacy and benefits
      patients with all grades of heart failure. losartan dosing is not based on individual body
      weight. The max dosing regimen proposed (25 mg losartan/day) is predicted to drop systolic
      blood pressure by approximately 5-12 mmHg and diastolic by 4-8 mmHg. The response is
      expected to be most profound among individuals with the highest systolic blood pressure. For
      safety purposes the investigators will administer losartan at 25 mg BID.

      N-acetylcysteine (NAC) Administration (Night before and t = 0, t = 5) NAC is a cysteine
      donor and antioxidant approved for use in humans, orally or intravenously. When given to
      treat acetaminophen overdose, NAC is typically given as a large bolus (~120-150 mg/kg over
      15-60 minutes), followed by continued administration over the next 20-36 hours. NAC has also
      been used as a cysteine donor for malnourished children, HIV infected individuals, and
      patients with pulmonary disease. When administered orally, the sulfur content of NAC reduces
      palatability. As a result, it is typically mixed with soda, juice, or a flavored drink mix.
      A recent study found that NAC, administered as a 75mg/kg oral bolus mixed with flavored
      drink mix, was well tolerated and markedly influenced 3-methylhistidine levels. The
      investigators will follow this strategy, administering 50 mg/kg doses mixed with flavored
      drink.

      With both oral and intravenous administration, most side effects are associated with the
      initial bolus loading period. With intravenous infusion, &quot;anaphylactoid&quot; reactions are more
      common and potentially more serious than with oral administration. As a result, an
      intravenous loading protocol was developed by McKenna's research group specifically to
      safely study acute effects of NAC in skeletal muscle. In this protocol, subjects receive an
      initial bolus infusion of 125 mg/kg/h NAC for 15 minutes, followed by constant infusion at
      25 mg/kg/h thereafter; this protocol is well-tolerated with minimal side effects. As no
      established protocol exists for the chronic infusion of NAC with the aim of improving
      skeletal muscle redox homeostasis and anabolic sensitivity during hospitalization in older
      adults, the investigators propose to administer NAC orally, to reduce the likelihood of
      anaphylactoid reactions, in 50 mg/kg boluses administered 3 times each day. Our rationale is
      as follows: 1) As opposed to the setting of acute acetaminophen toxicity, oxidative stress
      is not expected to develop suddenly during hospitalization-induced inactivity; thus, a more
      gradual approach to a plateau in systemic NAC levels should be satisfactory and should
      minimize the likelihood of NAC-induced side effects, 2) based on a recent study of NAC
      effects on exercise-induced oxidative stress, such an infusion should affect redox status in
      vivo, 3) the total NAC dose per day will be 150 mg/kg, which is approximately half of the
      total amount administered over the first 24 hours following acetaminophen overdose or in a
      previous study of NAC effects in healthy young controls (~320 mg/kg).

      Although not expected based on the literature (i.e. in the absence of bolus dosing),
      subjects will be monitored for side effects as described previously following NAC
      administration to healthy volunteers: peripheral effects (swelling, sweating, erythema,
      pruritis, conjunctivitis), altered sensations (lightheadedness, drowsiness, dysphoria,
      metallic taste), gastrointestinal disturbances (nausea, dyspepsia, flatulence, diarrhea),
      and hypotension. Side effects will be assessed and recorded by CRC nursing staff as well as
      by the investigators. Our intent is to avoid side effects and, if they should occur, manage
      them with reduced dosing or, if necessary, diphenhydramine administration, as directed by
      the study physician(s). Subjects with a history of asthma will be excluded, as they have
      been reported to experience more severe anaphylactoid reactions to NAC.

      Any uneaten food items will be recorded. Water will be provided ad libitum. Metabolic
      Studies for Fractional Synthesis Rate of Muscle Protein (Night before, t=2, t=5, t=6 t=7) At
      night subjects will be given a standardized dinner, and allowed only ad libitum water
      thereafter. The next morning, fasting anthropometric indices (height, weight, leg volume)
      will be recorded. The subject will then undergo a stable isotopic study to measure muscle
      protein turnover.

      For the tracer study, a forearm catheter will be placed for tracer infusion, and a
      retrograde catheter will be placed in the opposite hand for arterialized blood sampling,
      with the hand heated thereafter. After collecting a background blood sample, a
      primed-continuous infusion of L-[ring-13C6] Phenylalanine (priming dose=2 umol/kg; infusion
      rate = 0.05 umol/kg/min) will be started to measure muscle protein synthesis and boluses of
      [methyl d3] methionine (17.5umol/kg) and [methyl d3] 3-methylhistidine (0.5umol/kg) will be
      infused to measure myofibrillar protein synthesis and breakdown using the pulse-bolus method
      when the leucine is taken. At t=2 the first muscle biopsy will be taken from the vastus
      lateralis using aseptic procedure and local anesthesia with lidocaine to measure basal
      muscle protein synthesis rate with the precursor-product model (see E. Human Subjects for
      details on protections against risks), cell signaling, and redox homeostasis (reduced and
      total glutathione). Between t=5 and t=7, frequent arterialized blood samples will be taken
      from the hand vein to measure phenylalanine, methylhistidine and methionine enrichments and
      concentrations; additionally, blood flow and muscle perfusion will be measured by real-time
      Doppler and CEU (see Methods). At the end of basal period (t=5) a second, muscle biopsy will
      be taken to measure muscle protein synthesis.

      After the second biopsy, subjects will consume a test meal, with 10 grams of leucine, within
      10 minutes. To avoid disruption of the phenylalanine isotopic steady state due to ingestion
      of unlabeled amino acids, L-[ring-13C6]Phenylalanine, [methyl d3] 3-methylhistidine and
      [methyl d3] methionine will be added to the meal to enrich it to the expected arterial
      enrichments. The investigators have shown that this approach can adequately prevent changes
      in the arterial isotopic enrichment during bolus ingestion of an amino acid supplement, thus
      allowing for steady state equations to calculate muscle protein synthesis. After meal intake
      the investigators will follow the blood amino acid concentrations and enrichments with
      frequent blood sampling. At t=6 and t=7 a third and fourth muscle biopsy will be taken to
      measure muscle protein synthesis, cell signaling, and redox homeostasis during treatment and
      in response to the meal. Between t=6 and t=7 Doppler blood flow and muscle perfusion (CEU)
      will be measured again to determine the effect of treatment and meal on these parameters.
      After the last muscle biopsy, the tracer infusion will be stopped and the subject will be
      made comfortable and fed.

      Fatigue (Night before, t = 3, t = 7) Handgrip strength and skeletal muscle fatigue will be
      assessed using handgrip dynamometry. Strength (maximal voluntary contraction) will
      determined from 3 maximal efforts, separated by 1 minute. Performance fatigue will be
      measured as the total number of successful 3 second contractions at 50% maximal voluntary
      contraction, with a 50% duty cycle, as described in a previous study of NAC effects on
      handgrip fatigue. To assess perceptual fatigue, the investigators will administer two
      questionnaires: the Brief Fatigue Inventory Score and Multidimensional Fatigue Symptom
      Inventory-Short Form (MFSI-SF). In addition, perceptual fatigue following the handgrip
      fatigue protocol will be assessed using a 0-10 scale (0 = no fatigue, 10 = worst fatigue
      imaginable).

      Methods detailed in this section are common to all groups. Analytical methods and procedures
      are presented below in translational context, from molecular to functional.

      Sample storage and processing. Blood samples to measure amino acid enrichments and
      concentrations will be collected in an ice-cold sulfosalicylic acid solution containing
      appropriate internal standards, spun, and the supernatant stored in cryovials at -80 Celsius
      until further analysis. Blood samples for hormonal and cytokine assays will be collected in
      clotting-activated tubes, immediately spun and the supernatant serum will be stored in
      cryovials at -80 Celsius. Muscle samples for measurement of amino acid free enrichment and
      incorporation in contractile proteins, and for molecular biology assays will be immediately
      rinsed with ice-cold saline, blotted and quickly (less than 5 seconds) frozen in liquid
      nitrogen and stored in cryovials at -80 Celsius until further analyses. Immediately after
      collection, muscle samples for microscopic and morphologic analysis will be mounted and snap
      frozen at -80 Celsius until later analysis.

      Measurement of intracellular signals. Muscle tissue samples (100-200 mg) will be immediately
      quick-frozen in liquid nitrogen following biopsy, and kept under liquid nitrogen until
      analyzed. Expression of NF-κB fragment will be measured using an ELISA kit (TransAM, Active
      Motif, ), Total protein abundance of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) and FKBP12 will be
      measured using Western blotting. Phosphorylation of Akt, AMPKα, mTOR, S6K1, FoxO, eIF-2β,
      eIF-4, 4E-BP1, Smad2/3 and GSK-3β will be measured with phospho-Akt (Ser473) antibody,
      phospho-AMPKα (Thr172), phospho-mTOR (Ser2448) antibody, phosphor-p70 S6 kinase (Thr389)
      antibody, phospho-FoxO1 (Ser256), phosphor-FoxO3a (Ser318/321) antibody, phospho-FoxO3a
      (Ser192) antibody, phospho-eIF-2β (Ser 540) antibody, phospho-eIF-4E (Ser 209) antibody,
      phosphor-4E-BP1 (Thr37/46) antibody, phospho-Smad2 (Ser465/467) antibody, phospho-Smad3
      (Ser423/425) antibody and phospho-GSK-3β (Ser9) antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.,
      Beverly, MA), respectively, and chemiluminescence autoradiography as previously described
      (47). Western blot signals will be analyzed with a BioRad ChemiDoc Chemiluminescence imaging
      system (BioRad, Hercules, CA), which detects ECL signals over 5 orders of magnitude, and its
      sensitivity range far exceeds that of conventional densitometry.

      Total abundance of GSH/GSSG will be measured using commercial kits (Cayman Chemical, Ann
      Arbor, MI). MnSOD and CuZnSOD will be evaluated using an activity assays. Notably, mice
      lacking CuZnSOD are a model for age-related muscle loss and exhibit increased production of
      reactive oxygen species. Likewise, MnSOD activity has been suggested to play a role in
      age-related muscle loss and dysfunction.

      Measurement of muscle morphology and satellite cell activation. Muscle morphology will be
      determined using immunohistochemical techniques. Muscle fiber cross sectional area (CSA),
      proportion, and assessment of intramuscular oxidative enzyme content, glycolytic enzyme
      content, and lipid content will be determined using standard methods. Tissue sections will
      be cut at 10 μm thickness in a cryostat maintained at 25ºC, mounted on Fisherbrand
      Superfrost®/Plus microscope slides (Fisher Scientific, USA). Satellite cell content will be
      determined using anti-CD56 antibody directed against the neural cell adhesion molecule
      (NCAM) (identical to the Leu 19 antigen) [Clone MOC-1, (DakoCytomation, Carpinteria, CA) and
      Pax7. For muscle cell boundary polyclonal rabbit anti-laminin antibody directed against
      laminin (extracellular matrix protein) (DakoCytomation) will be utilized. Fiber typing will
      be accomplished with anti-Myosin Heavy Chain-slow (MyHC-slow, Sigma, St. Louis, MO). Nuclear
      marker 4', 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, dihydrochloride (DAPI; Molecular Probes) will be used
      to localize DNA (nuclei). Digital images will be captured on a Zeiss Axio-Cam
      Epi-Fluoroscent microscope and analyzed using the Zeiss AV4 software.

      Femoral Doppler Blood Flow. Contrast-enhanced Ultrasound. Immunoassay of Serum and Muscle
      Inflammatory Biomarkers. For both experimental groups, the investigators will assess various
      serum and muscle cytokines including TNF-a, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8,
      IL-10, IL-12, IL-13, GM-CSF, and IFN-γ. Samples will be measured by immunoassay using the
      Millipore high sensitivity Human Cytokine-13plex kit (Millipore, Billerica, MA). TGF-β will
      be determined using the Millipore Single Plex kit.

      Hormone Assays. Serum concentrations of CRP, IGF-I, IGFBP-3, insulin, hGH, C-peptide, and
      urinary cortisol will be measured using a high-throughput, continuous random access
      immunoassay analyzer, Immulite 2000. Briefly, after the sample is incubated with an alkaline
      phosphatase-labeled reagent, the reaction mixture is separated from the bead by spinning the
      reaction tube at high speed along its vertical axis. The bound label specific to each
      analyte is then quantified using the dioxetane substrate to produce light. Amount of light
      emitted is proportional to the amount of analyte in the sample. Losartan, angiotensin II,
      renin, and aldosterone will be measured by UTMB Clinical Services.

      GCMS Analysis. The enrichment of free L-[ring-13C6]Phenylalanine and 3-Methylhistidine in
      blood and tissue fluid will be measured by GCMS after addition of appropriate internal
      standard U-13C9-15N Phenylalanine , precipitation of blood and tissue proteins with
      sulfosalicylic acid, extraction with cation exchange chromatography, and
      tert-butyldimethylsilyl derivatization (t-BDMS). Correction for skewed isotopomer
      distribution and overlapping spectra will be performed as previously described. The
      incorporation of L-[ring-13C6]Phenylalanine, [methyl d3] methionine and [methyl d3]
      3-methylhistidine in the mixed and myofibrillar muscle proteins will be measured after
      protein extraction and hydrolysis, amino acid extraction with cation exchange
      chromatography, t-BDMS derivatization, and GCMS analysis.

      Calculation of muscle protein synthesis and myofibrillar protein breakdown. The fractional
      synthesis rate (FSR) of mixed muscle proteins will be calculated from the incorporation rate
      of L-[ring-13C6]Phenylalanine into the mixed and myofibrillar muscle proteins, and the
      free-tissue phenylalanine enrichment:

      (1) where EP/t is the slope of the straight line that fits the protein-bound phenylalanine
      enrichment across two sequential biopsies, t is the time interval encompassing the two
      biopsies, EM(1), and EM(2) are the phenylalanine enrichments (tracer/tracee) in the free
      muscle pool in the two biopsies. The results are presented as %.h-1. Myofibrillar protein
      synthesis and breakdown will be calculated using the pulse-bolus method.

      D.5. Statistical Considerations Analyses for all aims will primarily be statistical models
      to assess the effects of the two main treatment variables of losartan (Yes vs. No) and NAC
      (Yes vs. No). These two factors along with the control (placebo losartan plus placebo NAC)
      condition form the three groups of interest for the statistical models.

      Statistical Analysis. Data for most outcomes will be collected at baseline and during the
      performance of the metabolic study. Our general approach to address the specific and
      secondary aims is to develop an analysis of variance (ANOVA) model for each outcome of
      interest. Only losartan and NAC effects will be tested in these models, as a combined
      (losartan + NAC) treatment group is not proposed. Each outcome will have a different ANOVA
      model.

      The main outcomes of FSR will have 3 measures. The statistical models will be fit with a
      maximum likelihood based class of models called mixed models, which allow some dropout to
      occur without introduction of bias. Common software is available such as MIXED procedure in
      SAS. Main effects will be assessed. A covariance structure will be chosen according to
      suggestions by Grady and Helms. Mean differences in outcomes and 95% confidence intervals
      will be reported.

      Gender differences will be assessed by including a gender covariate in the model. The
      investigators will also examine the (gender - treatment) interaction to assess if the
      treatment is equally effective for both genders. If that term is not significant, the
      investigators will initially leave gender in the model for potential adjustments. If the
      gender term is not significant, it will imply that gender does not add information to the
      model and it will be dropped.

      Sample Size and Power. A power analysis was conducted to assess the ability of the study
      design to detect statistical significance and to avoid type II errors. Estimates of
      variation are from data that originated in the PI's lab as well as published studies.
      Conservative assumptions are made so as to not overestimate power. Power is based on change
      across two time points or at the end of the study.

      The strategy is to demonstrate power for each outcome using ANOVA models, which address all
      specific aims simultaneously.

      FSR Extensive preliminary data are available from our research team regarding changes in
      protein synthesis. The primary statistical approach is ANOVA and the study design described
      above for Aim 1. Preliminary data from the PI's lab were available for the outcome of FSR.
      The mean increase in FSR with vasodilator (SNP) infusion was 0.02, with a SD of the change
      score of 0.026. Based on a previous animal study which found that antioxidant administration
      restored amino acid stimulation of muscle protein synthesis, along with the fact that
      losartan and NAC may exert non-perfusion related effects that could augment anabolic
      responses, the investigators estimate a change of 0.07 with each treatment, with a SD of the
      change score of 0.026. Power calculations from the SAS procedure GLMPOWER indicate with N=8
      per group (24 total) will provide &gt;99% power to detect the treatment effects, using a
      2-sided alpha level of significance of 0.05.

      Summary: Sample size calculations demonstrate that N=8 subjects per group (N=24 total) will
      provide sufficient power to assess each of our specific aims, across two main outcomes for
      assessing lean body mass and functional assessment. The investigators also show that they
      can study FSR with this design. As in all human intervention studies, the investigators
      expect attrition. To account for an expected attrition rate of 20% the investigators will
      randomize 1.2x8=10 subjects per group (N=30 total). The investigators will screen 48 people
      to achieve a total of 24 completed studies.

      Future Studies Many potential avenues may be explored following these experiments. If our
      hypothesis is correct, and findings that losartan is capable of significantly improving
      nutritive flow to skeletal muscle and capacity for net muscle protein anabolism, the
      investigators will pursue longer-term outcome studies with this novel vasodilator, perhaps
      during a simulated hospitalization period. Potential future studies include looking further
      into the amino acid signaling pathways and determining if suppression of TGF-β blocks
      transcriptional upregulation of the ubiquitin E3 ligases. However, if findings that losartan
      does not promote nutritive flow to skeletal muscle or the capacity for net muscle protein
      anabolism, then the investigators will further examine the mechanisms behind the apparent
      lack in nutritive flow mediated stimulation of muscle protein synthesis (e.g., studies with
      amino acids to determine where the defect lies in the intracellular signaling pathway). If
      losartan or NAC can successfully improve nutritive flow to skeletal muscle and capacity for
      net muscle protein anabolism in healthy older subjects, the investigators will pursue
      additional outcome studies during and following inactivity, like common elective surgeries
      such as hip and knee replacement.
