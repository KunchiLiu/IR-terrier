      This is an observational study to investigate the prevalence of osteoporotic fractures in
      post menopausal patients. Post menopausal patients who visit OS(orthopedic surgery)
      including GHs(general hospitals) and clinics will be enrolled. They will take the evaluation
      of spine X-ray and answer to a few questions. Their medical record will be reviewed and
      relevant clinical findings will be collected.
