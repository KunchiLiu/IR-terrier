    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to evaluate the safety, efficacy (clinical and
      microbiological), pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of GSK2251052 and to assess whether it
      would be a suitable antibiotic for the treatment for febrile lower cUTI and
      pyelonephritis(complicated and uncomplicated). GSK2251052 will be compared to
      imipenem-cilastatin, which is an antibiotic commonly used to treat serious cUTI infections.
      GSK2251052 has a spectrum of microbiological activity that includes pathogens responsible
      for cUTI.
