  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Balloon kyphoplasty for the treatment of patients with osteoporotic vertebral compression
      fractures has been shown to be successful in providing acute pain relief, enabling improved
      function, and restoring of vertebral body height. However, limited prospective data exists
      in the investigation of unipedicular balloon kyphoplasty as a sufficient alternative to
      bipedicular balloon kyphoplasty. The purpose of this prospective randomized study was to
      compare the clinical and radiographic outcomes of unipedicular and bipedicular balloon
      kyphoplasty.

    <description>Balloon kyphoplasty achieves reduction of the vertebral compression fracture using a balloon tamp inserted into the vertebral body by a transpedicular approach, followed by fixation of the fracture fragments with polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) bone cement. In this arm only vertebral body pedicle was entered to deliver bone cement.</description>

    <description>Balloon kyphoplasty achieves reduction of the vertebral compression fracture using a balloon tamp inserted into the vertebral body by a transpedicular approach, followed by fixation of the fracture fragments with polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) bone cement.

    <description>A Jamshidi Crown Bone Biopsy Needle (Cardinal Health; Dublin, OH) was then introduced through the incision into the pedicle, and advanced through the pedicle into the center of the vertebral body using a mallet at a 30 to 45 degree angle relative to the AP axis. A guidewire was then placed through the Jamshidi needle, and the needle removed. A series of dilating cannulae were then advanced over the guidewire until a working cannula was in place. A 15 millimeter (mm) or 20 mm bone tamp (Kyphon Inc; Sunnydale, CA) was then introduced into the vertebral body via the cannula and inflated until the balloon was in contact with the subchondral plate, lateral vertebral body wall, or anterior cortex of the vertebral body. The balloon was then deflated and removed. Subsequently, cement was injected into the cavity and allowed to harden.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Males or females older than 50 years of age with acute vertebral compression
