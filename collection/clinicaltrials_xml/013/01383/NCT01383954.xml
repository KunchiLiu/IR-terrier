      The purpose of this proposed study is to conduct a trial with knee OA patients using the
      diclofenac gel. The effectiveness of diclofenac gel in managing breakthrough pain or the
      neuropathic components of pain (e.g., the burning, soft tissue joint sensitivity, or
      allodynic components) in knee OA is unknown. It is likely that patients will use the gel in
      a prn fashion, on top of other analgesics prescribed for their pain. The neuropathic
      components of a generally nociceptive or inflammatory condition, such as knee OA, are
      underappreciated, and typically not tracked in OA analgesic studies. Yet, evidence across a
      variety of chronic painful conditions suggests that these components are quite disabling.
      The results of this study would show whether diclofenac gel as a prn medication is
      beneficial to patients suffering from knee OA pain.

    <description>The primary outcome measure is the percent improvement in pain (prior to gel-1 hour after gel) after each diclofenac gel application for breakthrough pain. This is calculated from the pain ratings input into the ED just prior to and after gel application. Sample size calculations use a power of .85, an alpha level of .05, a pre-gel pain level of ~7/10, a standard deviation of response of 1.6, and T test comparisons. We estimate that 30 subjects will be needed to find a 30% improvement in breakthrough pain on average in the cohort.</description>
