  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of entinostat when given
      together with imatinib mesylate and to see how well it works in treating patients with
      relapsed or refractory Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
      Entinostat and imatinib mesylate may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the
      enzymes needed for cell growth

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of entinostat when given in combination
      with imatinib (matinib mesylate).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the rate of complete response (CR) for patients greater ≥ 18 years of age
      with relapsed/refractory Ph+ ALL treated with a combination of entinostat and imatinib.

      II. To estimate the 1 year progression free survival (PFS) for patients greater ≥ 18 years
      of age with relapsed/refractory Ph+ ALL treated with a combination of entinostat and
      imatinib III. To describe the comparative pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of
      entinostat when administered alone vs. in combination with imatinib.

      IV. To assess the predictive value of levels of flow cytometric minimal residual disease
      (MRD) on duration of progression free survival for the study population.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of entinostat followed by a phase II
      study.

      Patients receive entinostat orally (PO) daily on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 and imatinib mesylate
      PO twice daily on days 1-28 (days 4-28 of course 1). Courses repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.
