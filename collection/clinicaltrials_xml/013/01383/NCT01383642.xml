  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vestibular dysfunction is a known contributor to imbalance and fall risk, and may be a
      precursor to the frailty phenotype seen in the elderly population. A recent study found that
      vestibular dysfunction is common in the US population, and that the prevalence of this
      impairment increases steeply with age. However, it is unknown whether the aging process has
      global effects on the vestibular end-organ or whether specific structures, e.g. the
      semicircular canals or the otoliths, are selectively impaired. Moreover, the clinical
      implications of specific deficits of the vestibular end-organ are unclear. As such, the aims
      of this proposed research are: 1) to evaluate whether the normative aging process is
      predominantly associated with dysfunction of the semicircular canals (as measured by caloric
      and angular vestibulo-ocular reflex testing) or of the otoliths (as measured by VEMP
      testing); 2) to determine if there are any characteristic clinical features associated with
      the subtypes of vestibular dysfunction; and 3) to assess whether dysfunction of the
      semicircular canals or of the otoliths is associated with a higher risk of frailty and
      falls. The investigators plan to pursue these aims through a cross-sectional and prospective
      cohort study of a group of individuals age 70 and above. Vestibular physiologic tests will
      be administered to all study participants, and test results will be correlated with baseline
      clinical symptoms and frailty status as well as prospective one-year fall risk. A greater
      understanding of vestibular physiologic deficits and their clinical implications in older
      individuals can inform the development of rational vestibular rehabilitation strategies that
      may more effectively mitigate the frailty phenotype and reduce fall risk.
