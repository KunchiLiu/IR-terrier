      Number of patients: An enrollment of approximately 25 patients is planned to be treated with
      the Direct application of Selective Laser Trabeculoplasty.

      This is a single site outpatient study assessing the safety &amp; efficacy of the TSLTP laser
      (TSLTP))( &quot;DIO-DENT 10&quot; DENTAL DIODE LASER SYSTEM ) in the ability to reduce IOP in patients
      with open angle glaucoma. 20 patients are to be enrolled in the study. The investigational
      site will accrue patients with uncontrolled open-angle glaucoma. These eyes will be treated
      with the direct application of Selective Laser Trabeculoplasty (TSLTP).

      Only one eye per patient is to be treated during the study interval up to 3 months.
      Thereafter the treatment of the fellow eye may be done per the medical judgment of the
      investigator.

      Subjects are evaluated preoperatively and postoperatively at 1 hour, 2 hours (and hourly to
      4 hours in the event of an IOP elevation in the immediate postoperatively course), 1 day, 1
      week, and 1, 3, months.

      The interval for evaluation of equivalence of the two trabeculoplasty procedures is 6
      months. Patients will be followed out to 3 months.

      Investigational Device The TSLTP laser, &quot;DIO-DENT 10&quot; DENTAL DIODE LASER SYSTEM is a
      flash-lamp-excited solid-state laser emitting in the near infrared at 790 nm. It is used to
      perform either direct application of Selective Laser Trabeculoplasty to the conjunctiva just
      above the trabecular Meshwork (TM). The laser and slit-lamp delivery system combine to form
      a system that focuses the treatment beam onto the conjunctiva. An aiming beam, coincident
      with the treatment beam, is used to direct placement of the treatment beam onto the
      conjunctiva. Pressing a footswitch delivers the treatment beam in the form of a short pulse
      of energy approximately 8 us in duration.

      Study Procedures and Evaluations

      Operative Procedure Only one eye per patient is to be treated during the study up to the 6
      month interval. The treating physician will use his/her medical judgment in determining
      which eye should be treated based on current IOP and general ocular and visual status of the
      patient's treated eye and fellow eye.

      Topical anesthesia is administered to the eye to be treated prior to treatment. the DSALT
      will be used, than the aiming beam is placed just above the TM .

      Patients will be treated with a TSLTP laser (790 nm) over a 360 degree arc, with 100 spots.
      The energy level used will be determined on a patient by patient basis based on the
      threshold needed to achieve an effect on the tissue. Placement of the spots, inferior,
      superior, temporal or nasal will be documented. Immediately following the laser treatment,
      Diclofenac drops are administered and continued in the treated eye four times daily for four
      to seven days.

      Preoperative and Postoperative Procedures and Evaluations A schedule of preoperative and
      postoperative procedures and evaluations is provided in Table B.

      Preoperative Procedures and Evaluations

      The variability of IOP in patients is monitored for two consecutive weeks before treatment
      begins. The examination at the first screening visit is conducted two to six weeks before
      treatment and includes a full ophthalmic examination of both eyes, consisting of the
      following:

        -  Two readings of IOP by applanation.

        -  Determination of best corrected visual acuity.

        -  Slit-lamp examination of the anterior segment.

             -  Conjunctival injection (0-4+)

             -  Cornea appearance

             -  Iris and lens appearance

             -  Anterior Chamber Cell and Flare (0-4+)

        -  Gonioscopy with grading of the degree of pigmentation in each quadrant.

        -  Evaluation of angle opening.

        -  Evaluation of presence of posterior anterior synechiae (PAS).

        -  Lens examination.

        -  Determination of ratio of optic disc cupping.

        -  Fundus examination.

        -  Visual field examination (could be performed within the 6 weeks before treatment,
           including the day of treatment).

        -  Recording of current glaucoma medications (type and dosage).

        -  Recording of date and time of last administration of each listed glaucoma medication.

      Patient demographic information (sex, race, and date of birth) and a medical history that
      includes previous ocular surgery are also recorded.

      At least four days should elapse between the initial and the second screening examinations.
      The following are assessed and recorded for both eyes:

        -  Date and time of the evaluation.

        -  Results of two readings of IOP by applanation.

        -  Current glaucoma medications (type and dosage).

        -  Date and time of the latest administration of each listed glaucoma medication.

      Finally, the following are assessed and recorded for both eyes immediately before treatment
      begins.

        -  Results of two readings of IOP by applanation.

        -  Best corrected visual acuity.

        -  Glaucoma medications (number, type, and dosage).

        -  Date and time of latest administration of each listed glaucoma medication.

      Postoperative Observations and Follow-Up Immediately following treatment, two readings of
      the IOP in the treated eye are assessed and recorded for at least 2 hours postoperatively.
      The IOP continues to be monitored on an hourly basis if there is an IOP rise *5 mmHg from
      the immediate preoperative IOP. If necessary, the elevated IOP is treated with appropriate
      increase in anti-glaucoma medications and the administration of the additional medications
      is recorded.

      The presence and level of cells in the anterior chamber are recorded at each hourly
      examination. Any immediate postoperative complications or complaints are recorded.

      The IOP management medications will be maintained throughout the treatment and the
      post-treatment follow-up intervals. Any anti-glaucoma medication regimen adjustments needed
      are instituted and recorded.

      At the examination on the day following treatment, as well as all subsequent scheduled and
      unscheduled examinations, the physician or technician measuring the IOP is blinded with
      regard to which eye had received the TSLTP. At this visit, the following are assessed and
      recorded:

        -  IOP by applanation in both eyes.

        -  Glaucoma medications (type and dosage).

             -  Iris and lens appearance

             -  Cornea appearance

      At Months 3 the following are assessed and recorded for both eyes:

        -  Two readings of IOP by applanation.

        -  Best corrected visual acuity.

        -  Glaucoma medications (type and dosage).

        -  Date and time of last administration of each listed glaucoma medication.

      Safety and Efficacy Variables

      Criteria for evaluation: Efficacy:

      Primary Efficacy Endpoint:

      The primary efficacy endpoint is the percentage reduction in IOP at 6 months postoperative
      from preoperative medicated IOP. The mean percentage reduction in IOP will be assessed .

      Secondary Efficacy Endpoints The following efficacy endpoints will be compared between the
      two treatment groups.

        -  Postoperative IOP at 3, 6 and 12 months

        -  Absolute reduction and percentage reduction in IOP at 3, 6 and 12 months from
           preoperative medicated IOP

        -  The relationship between preoperative medicated IOP and the change in IOP at 3, 6, and
           12 months following treatment.

      Safety: Safety will be determined by frequency tabulations of adverse events and
      complications such as the following:

        -  Acute elevation of IOP *10 mmHg above the immediate preoperative measurement in either
           the treated or non-treated eye.

        -  Mild or moderate anterior chamber inflammation in the treated eye, including iritis,
           cells and flare.

        -  Any of the following in the treated eye:

        -  transient blurred vision;

        -  discomfort; pain

        -  deterioration of visual field;

        -  mild hemorrhage

        -  loss of more than 2 lines of BCVA, associated with the procedure

      Safety will also be determined by evaluating the change from baseline following TSLTP
      treatment in other ocular characteristics such as

        -  cells and flare,

        -  visual acuity, and

        -  disc cup to disc ratio

      All patients enrolled and treated in the study will be evaluated for safety.
