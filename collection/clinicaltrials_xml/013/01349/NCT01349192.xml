  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Purpose: There has been a recent, rapid increase in prevalence of Methicillin-resistant
      Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) among patients with Cystic Fibrosis (22% across US CF centers
      in 2009). Some epidemiologic studies suggest possible worse outcomes, a recent analyses
      showing this with chronic but not intermittent MRSA. Given the chronic difficult to treat
      lung infections in CF it is unclear how the onset of MRSA should be approached. This
      randomized, controlled, interventional study seeks to determine if an early eradication
      protocol is effective for eradication of MRSA and will provide an opportunity to obtain data
      regarding early clinical impact of new isolation of MRSA.

      Participants: Cystic fibrosis patients with new isolation of MRSA from their respiratory
      culture on a routine clinic visit.

      Procedures (methods): Randomized, open-label, multi-center study comparing use of an
      eradication protocol to an observational group who receives the current standard of care
      i.e. treatment for MRSA only with pulmonary exacerbations.

          3. First OR early repeat MRSA colonization defined as:

               -  First MRSA colonization: first documented isolation of MRSA from respiratory

               -  OR Early repeat MRSA colonization:

             MRSA was previously isolated from the respiratory tract (≤ 2 times), but this was
             followed by at least 1 year of documented negative cultures for MRSA as noted below:

             -- At least 2 cultures performed at least 3 months apart to document 1 year of
             culture negativity. Each of these cultures should be documented to have been
             collected at least 1 week after end of any antibiotic prescription with MRSA
             activity.

             mL/min using the Cockcroft-Gault equation

         12. Abnormal liver function at the time of screening, defined as ≥2x upper limit of
             normal (ULN), of serum aspartate transaminase (AST) or serum alanine transaminase
