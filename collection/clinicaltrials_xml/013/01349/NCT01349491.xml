    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that ranolazine would decrease the incidence of recurrence of
      Atrial Fibrillation (AF) after electrical cardioversion of persistent AF. Patients with
      persistent AF who are candidates for electrical cardioversion will be randomized to either
      placebo or ranolazine after successful electrical cardioversion.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common clinically significant cardiac arrhythmia and is
      associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Although a rhythm control
      strategy offers no survival benefit over a rate control strategy, elective electrical
      cardioversion is still recommended in patients without hemodynamic instability for
      symptomatic relief. However, recurrences are frequent after cardioversion and antiarrhythmic
      medications are required to maintain sinus rhythm. Nonetheless, the use of antiarrhythmic
      medications is problematic because of the risk of serious potential adverse effects,
      including drug-induced ventricular arrhythmias.

      Ranolazine is a novel antianginal agent, which inhibits the late inward sodium current and
      produces antiischemic effects without reducing heart rate or blood pressure. Additionally,
      recent preclinical as well as preliminary clinical data suggest that ranolazine exhibits
      distinct antiarrhythmic properties. However, there is no controlled data for the use of
      ranolazine to prevent recurrence of AF after electrical cardioversion of persistent AF.

      The investigators hypothesize that ranolazine would decrease the incidence of recurrence of
      AF after electrical cardioversion of persistent AF. Patients with persistent AF who are
      candidates for electrical cardioversion will be randomized to either placebo or ranolazine
      after successful electrical cardioversion. They will be followed at 2 weeks, 1, 3 and 6
      months for clinical evaluation and electrocardiography for the detection of recurrence of
      AF.

    <description>To evaluate the efficacy of ranolazine in preventing hospitalizations for symptomatic AF. We will follow the patients at 2 weeks, 1, 3 and 6 months after randomization, with an outpatient office visit. At each visit, patients will have a brief history and physical examination, any cardiovascular events, including hospitalizations for symptomatic AF, will be recorded and a 12-lead electrocardiogram will be obtained to assess maintenance of sinus rhythm.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female with persistent atrial fibrillation, aged 21 or older

          -  Duration of atrial fibrillation less than one year

          -  The patient does not have any contraindications for anticoagulation

             in the investigator's opinion precludes the patient from safely participating in the
             study.
