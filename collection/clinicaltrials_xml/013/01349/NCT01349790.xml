  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      NewGam is a newly developed human normal immunoglobulin solution for intravenous
      administration (IGIV). This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of NewGam 10% in
      patients with primary immune thrombocytopenia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to assess the efficacy of NewGam in correcting the
      platelet count. The secondary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety of NewGam.
      Safety will be assessed by monitoring vital signs, physical examination, evaluation of
      adverse events (AE) and laboratory parameters, and viral safety testing.

          2. Confirmed diagnosis of chronic primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) with a threshold
             platelet count &lt; 100x10^9/L) of at least 12 months duration.

          3. Platelet count of no more than 20x10^9/L with or without bleeding manifestations.

          4. Freely given written informed consent from patient.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Thrombocytopenia secondary to other diseases (such as acquired immunodeficiency
             syndrome [AIDS] or systemic lupus erythematosus [SLE]) or drug-related
             thrombocytopenia.

          2. Administration of intravenous immunoglobulin (IGIV), anti-D immunoglobulin or
             thrombopoetin receptor agonists, or other platelet enhancing drugs (including
             immunosuppressive or other immunomodulatory drugs) within 3 weeks before enrollment,
             except for:

               -  Long-term corticosteroid therapy when the dose has been stable during the
                  preceding 3 weeks and no dosage change is planned until study Day 22.

               -  Long-term azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, or attenuated androgen therapy when
                  the dose has been stable during the preceding 3 months and no dosage change is
                  planned until study Day 22.

          3. Unresponsive to previous treatment with IGIV or anti-D immunoglobulin.
