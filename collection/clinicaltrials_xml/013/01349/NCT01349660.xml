  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this phase I/II study,investigators are evaluating the feasibility and efficacy of the
      combination of BKM120, an oral inhibitor of PI3 kinase, and bevacizumab in the treatment of
      patients with relapsed/refractory GBM. In the Phase I part of the trial, the optimal BKM120
      dose to be administered with a standard dose of bevacizumab will be determined in patients
      with refractory solid tumors. Although it is unlikely that the concurrent administration of
      bevacizumab will alter the pharmacokinetics of BKM120, limited pharmacokinetic sampling will
      be performed on all patients treated during the Phase II portion of the study. Assuming this
      combination is feasible, the Phase II portion of the study will proceed, using the doses
      determined in the Phase I portion. In the phase II portion, eligible patients will be
      limited to those with recurrent/progressive GBM following 1st line combined modality
      therapy.

      This is an open-label, non-randomized Phase I study of patients with advanced refractory
      solid tumors followed by a Phase II study for the second-line treatment of patients with
      relapsed/refractory glioblastoma multiforme.

      In the phase I part of the study the MTD of BKM120 when combined with bevacizumab was
      determined to be 60 mg/day. In the Phase II part of this study, patients with
      relapsed/refractory GBM following first line therapy are being treated with the
      BKM120/bevacizumab combination. Limited BKM120 pharmacokinetic evaluation will be performed
      on all patients treated during this part of the study. Patients will be reevaluated for
      response to treatment after 2 cycles (8 weeks). Patients with objective response or stable
      disease will continue treatment, with subsequent reevaluations every 8 weeks, until disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs.

      Two populations of patients with relapsed/refractory GBM will be treated in the Phase II
      trial: 1) patients with no previous exposure to bevacizumab (N= 55) and 2) patients who
      received bevacizumab as part of first-line combined modality treatment (N= 20).
