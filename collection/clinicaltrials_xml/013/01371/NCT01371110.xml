  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is a chronic and disabling anxiety disorder and a
      leading cause of worldwide disability that presents a significant public health problem.
      Treatment options are limited and many OCD patients fail to respond completely or quickly to
      standard treatments, including pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy. At this time, patients who
      fail to respond to treatment with serotonergic drugs, augmenting antipsychotic agents, and
      behavioral therapy, have few additional treatment options aside from deep brain stimulation.
      Therefore, despite advances in current pharmacological and behavioral treatments, and the
      utility of serotonergic drugs, it is likely that other neurotransmitter systems are involved
      and that targeting these systems may increase treatment efficacy. Despite little evidence
      for serotonergic dysfunction in OCD, there is significant evidence that glutamatergic
      dysregulation may contribute to the development and progression of the disorder. Also,
      preliminary studies suggest that glutamatergic modulators (i.e. riluzole and d-cycloserine),
      particularly agents acting at the NMDA receptor (i.e. memantine), may be useful in OCD. The
      NMDA antagonist, ketamine, has demonstrated rapid effects when delivered as a single
      intravenous (IV) dose in depressed patients. Therefore, the objective of the current study
      is to investigate the safety and efficacy of a single dose of IV ketamine in
      treatment-resistant OCD.

      This study will test the safety and efficacy of a single intravenous (IV) dose of the
      N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor antagonist, ketamine, in treatment-resistant
      OCD.
