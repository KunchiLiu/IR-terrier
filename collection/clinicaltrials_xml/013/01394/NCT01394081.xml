  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the Alabama Veterans Rural Health Initiative is to better understand access
      and barriers to health care and to enhance veteran enrollment or engagement in health care
      services of veterans residing in rural areas. It describes an intervention that is adaptable
      for use by other VA facilities that serve veterans in rural settings, and importantly, this
      study will improve our understanding of barriers to care and evaluate a method for enhancing
      access to care. The anticipated impact is that more veterans in rural areas who were
      previously under-utilizing VA services will receive and attend a health care appointment.
      This gain may improve preventative and primary care health care and reduce long term health
      care morbidity, expense and burden. This study may also identify previously unknown barriers
      to care that can be surmounted by innovative access and health care delivery approaches.

      The primary objective is to evaluate an innovative approach for enhanced enrollment or
      engagement intervention (EEE intervention) for rural veterans in VA health care services.
      Phase I entails a two-cell design, addressing this objective with a prospective, randomized
      controlled multi-site clinical trial that evaluates an active intervention compared to a
      control treatment as usual (TAU)condition on whether or not a rurally-residing veteran
      obtains and attends a VA appointment. Phase II encompasses a three-cell design, addressing
      the above mentioned objective with a randomized controlled, multi-site clinical trial that
      evaluates two active interventions compared to a control intervention.

      PHASE I I. Primary Hypothesis: Compared to veterans randomized to the control condition
      (Treatment as Usual; TAU), veterans who receive the enhanced enrollment or engagement
      intervention (EEE - patient navigation, motivational interviewing, and education), will be
      significantly more likely to attend a VA clinic appointment within 6 months of the
      comprehensive baseline evaluation.

      PHASE II I. Primary Hypothesis: Compared to veterans randomized to the control condition
      (Outreach C - education only), veterans who receive the enhanced enrollment or engagement
      (EEE) intervention (Outreach A - patient navigation, motivational interviewing, and
      education), will be significantly more likely to attend a VA clinic appointment within 6
      months of the comprehensive baseline evaluation.

      II. Secondary Hypothesis: Compared to veterans randomized to the control condition (Outreach
      C), veterans who receive the patient navigation and education (Outreach B) will be
      significantly more likely to attend a VA clinic appointment within 6 months of the
      comprehensive baseline evaluation.

      III. Tertiary Hypothesis: Compared to veterans randomized to the patient navigation and
      education (Outreach B), veterans who receive the EEE intervention (Outreach A) will be
      significantly more likely to attend a VA clinic appointment within 6 months of the
      comprehensive baseline evaluation.
