  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Some overweight individuals develop problems with their breathing such that they gradually
      breathe less and less. This leads to a lack of oxygen and a buildup of carbon dioxide in the
      blood, called ventilatory failure. As a consequence, if such a person develops a chest
      infection, they are more likely to become seriously ill and need intensive care. In addition
      they are much more likely to develop severe complications during and following operations.
      This problem can be treated with a machine at home used overnight to help breathing. It is
      interesting that ventilatory failure only happens in some overweight individuals, and the
      investigators do not understand what factors make this complication develop. There are a
      number of theories: for example the distribution of the fat, additional lung disease (such
      as asthma), the addition of obstructive sleep apnoea, a condition when there are periods of
      cessation of breathing overnight (which is more common in obese individuals), weak muscles
      of breathing (perhaps due to fatty infiltration of muscles or vitamin D deficiency), and
      other hormonal changes.

      The investigators intend to measure many potential factors in a range of overweight
      individuals, some who have ventilatory failure, and some who do not, to try and work out
      which are the important factors that cause this problem. If the investigators can identify
      such factors, then this will help predict in advance who is at risk from chest infections
      and during operations; thus allowing for earlier provision of an overnight breathing
      machine. This should reduce complications and potentially deaths in such individuals.

      specific factors related to the development of ventilatory failure, compared to obese
