  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare median overall survival of patients with advanced
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with CRLX101 to patients treated with best
      supportive care (BSC).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in men and women
      worldwide. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for approximately 80% of all lung
      cancer. The development of targeted therapies has changed the approach to treating NSCLC
      significantly over the past decade with targeted therapies generally possessing safety
      advantages over traditional cytotoxic regimens. However, combination paradigms and
      resistance patterns complicate the use of these agents. CRLX101 is a nanoparticle comprised
      of camptothecin (CPT) conjugated to a cyclodextrin-based polymer. CRLX101 is designed to
      increase the exposure of tumor cells to CPT while minimizing side effects.
