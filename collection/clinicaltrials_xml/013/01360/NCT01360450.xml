  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Thousands of critically ill infants (and children) are exposed to opioids and
      benzodiazepines to achieve sedation and analgesia as part of routine care in neonatal and
      pediatric intensive care units. While the use of these agents are undisputedly beneficial in
      reducing pain and anxiety, improving ventilation, reducing pulmonary vascular resistance and
      improving outcomes; the consequence is often the development of tolerance and physiologic
      dependence - similar to prenatal exposure from these same classes of drugs. The
      investigators have recently reported the results of randomized placebo control trial showing
      that the addition of clonidine (central alpha 2 agonist) to tapering doses of opioids was
      efficacious and safe in treating opioid dependence in infants who had moderate to severe
      neonatal abstinence syndrome from prenatal drug exposure to opioids. Currently, the
      investigators propose to perform a double-blind, randomized placebo control trial in a
      cohort of critically ill infants without prenatal drug exposure at Johns Hopkins Hospital to
      test the overall hypothesis that early addition of clonidine to a cohort of critically ill
      neonates on mechanical ventilation who are receiving opioids and benzodiazepines for
      analgesia and sedation will be efficacious and safe in reducing both the incidence and
      severity of withdrawal symptoms (NICU-NAS); as well as, reducing the time to complete
      sedative and analgesic drug detoxification. The hypothesis will be tested by addressing 2
      specific aims that will determine: 1) the efficacy and safety of clonidine in critically ill
      infants, and 2) pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics using population-based
      pharmacokinetics in this vulnerable infant population who have only been exposed to these
      drugs as part of their routine care. Many &quot;standard of care practices&quot; are incorporated in
      neonatal and pediatric care prior to evidence based studies. This proposal will fill a much
      needed gap in translating what the investigators have learned about basic mechanisms
      mediating dependence and withdrawal to proven therapies for vulnerable pediatric
      populations.

      The study will test the following 2 specific aims:

      Specific Aim 1

      To determine the efficacy and short-term safety of clonidine in reducing the severity of
      iatrogenic neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) by decreasing the time required for complete
      sedative and analgesic drug detoxification. The investigators will enroll 88 neonates at
      risk for having moderate to severe NAS in a randomized, double-blinded placebo controlled
      trial comparing opioid/benzodiazepine administration combined with a placebo (control) vs.
      opioid/benzodiazepine combined with clonidine. Principal outcome measure will be the
      difference in length of treatment for complete detoxification. Early safety of clonidine
      will be determined by monitoring for cardiorespiratory side effects that might be associated
      with clonidine use in this high risk population.

      Specific Aim 2

      To determine the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of clonidine in this critically ill
      infant population. The investigators will estimate the dose-exposure-response relationship
      of clonidine in neonates at risk for developing iatrogenic by using nonlinear mixed-effects
      population pharmacokinetic (PK)-pharmacodynamic (PD) analysis.
