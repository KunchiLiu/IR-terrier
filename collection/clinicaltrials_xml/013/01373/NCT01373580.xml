      This study will be a prospective, multicenter clinical trial in which a total of 400
      subjects will be enrolled. All subjects will be followed over a 36 month time frame with a
      maximum of 15 clinical sites participating. Qualified subjects will provide informed consent
      for entry into the study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The loss of near vision and the ability to perform tasks that require near vision is part of
      the normal aging process. This natural transformation in the eye occurs as a result of the
      loss of accommodation of the crystalline lens, a condition known as presbyopia. Presbyopia,
      characterized by a progressive, age-related loss of accommodation (i.e., the lens ability to
      focus clearly over a wide range of distances), is most prevalent of all visual deficiencies,
      affecting 100% of the population over the course of a normal life span. Loss of
      accommodation begins early in life and, for an emmetropic eye, generally culminates in a
      complete loss of functional near vision.

      ReVision Optics has developed the Raindrop corneal inlay for the correction of near vision.
      The Raindrop is a 2mm corneal inlay, as small as a pinhead, thinner than a human hair and
      about 1/500th of a droplet of water. The inlay is the same refractive index as the human
      cornea. The inlay is placed in the non-dominant eye,centered over the pupil after a corneal
      flap (LASIK)has been made. The Raindrop is expected to provide presbyopic subjects with
      improvement of near and intermediate vision.

    <description>A single-arm study to evaluate the effectiveness of a 2 mm corneal inlay (Raindrop Near Vision Inlay) for the treatment of presbyopia (age-related near vision loss). The anterior curvature of the cornea is re-shaped after implanting the Raindrop Near Vision Inlay in the non-dominant eye under a femtosecond laser flap to improve near vision.</description>
