    <description>Administered orally twice daily for 14 days followed by 14 days of rest. Dose escalation will proceed if none of the first 3 participants experience a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) during the first cycle of treatment. If 1 of 3 participants experiences a DLT, the cohort will be expanded to include an additional 3 participants. If 2 or more participants experience a DLT, then the sponsor and investigator will jointly decide whether to reduce the dose to 20 mg BID for Cohort 1 or recruit into an additional cohort at an intermediate dose for Cohorts 2 and 3.
Phase 2 recommended dose will be based on review of overall toxicity, dose reductions, omissions, and pharmacokinetic information from Phase 1b Cohorts. Dose will be administered orally twice daily for 14 days followed by 14 days of rest.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria: For both Phase 1b and Phase 2 (unless specified in the following),
        patients are eligible to be included in the study only if they meet all of the following
        criteria:

        For Phase 1b:

          -  Have histological or cytological evidence of a diagnosis of cancer that is advanced
             and/or metastatic disease; that is refractory to standard therapy and/or therapies
             known to provide clinical benefit or for which no standard therapy exists; and/or in
             which gemcitabine therapy at the proposed doses and schedule would be considered
             appropriate treatment for the metastatic disease (eg, pancreatic cancer)

          -  Patients may have received prior chemotherapy, radiotherapy, cancer-related hormone
             therapy, or other investigational therapy as treatment. There is no limit in the
             number of previous lines of therapy.

        For Phase 1b and Phase 2:

          -  Have measurable disease or non-measurable disease, defined according to Response
             Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST)

          -  Have given written informed consent prior to any study-specific procedures

          -  Have adequate organ function including: Hematologic: absolute neutrophil count (ANC)
             greater than or equal to 1.5 x 10^9/L, platelets greater than or equal to 100 x
             10^9/L, and hemoglobin greater than or equal to 9 g/dL. Hepatic: bilirubin less than
             or equal to 1.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP),
             aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT)less than or equal to
             2.5 times ULN. If the liver has tumor involvement, AST less than or equal to 5 times
             ULN and ALT less than or equal to 5 times ULN are acceptable. Patients may have
             endoscopic or radiologic stenting to treat biliary obstructions. If so, then
             bilirubin must return to less than or equal to 1.5 times ULN and ALP, AST, and ALT to
             less than or equal to 5 times ULN prior to enrollment. Renal: serum creatinine within
             normal limits, less than or equal to 1.5 times ULN.

          -  Have a performance status of less than or equal to 2 on the Eastern Cooperative
             Oncology Group (ECOG) scale

          -  Patients must have recovered from any Grade 3/4 toxicities of previous therapies

          -  Are reliable and willing to make themselves available for the duration of the study
             and are willing to follow study procedures

          -  Prior radiation therapy for treatment of cancer is allowed to &lt;25% of the bone
             marrow, and patients must have recovered from the acute toxic effects of their
             treatment prior to study enrollment. Prior radiation to the whole pelvis is not
             allowed. Prior radiotherapy must be completed at least 4 weeks before study entry.

          -  Male and female patients with reproductive potential must use an approved
             contraceptive method during and for 3 months after discontinuation of study
             treatment. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative beta-human chorionic
             gonadotropin (B-HCG) pregnancy test documented within 14 days prior to treatment. If
             condoms are used as a barrier contraceptive, a spermicidal agent should be added to
             ensure that pregnancy does not occur. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she
             is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating
             physician immediately.

        For Phase 2:

          -  Have histological or cytological diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the pancreas that is
             locally advanced (Stage II, III) or metastatic (Stage IV) and not amenable to
             resection with curative intent. Patients with previous radical surgery for pancreatic
             cancer are eligible after progression is documented. If they received adjuvant
             chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy with gemcitabine, they can be enrolled if the
             treatment was completed 3 months before or longer

          -  Tumor tissue or unstained slides are available from original biopsy or resection or
             other tumor biopsies

          -  Patients may have received previous adjuvant treatment with gemcitabine with or
             without radiotherapy for pancreatic cancer. Adjuvant treatment must have finished at
             least 6 months before enrolling.

        Exclusion Criteria: Patients will be excluded from the study if they meet any of the
        following criteria:

          -  Are currently enrolled in, or discontinued within the last 30 days from, a clinical
             trial involving an investigational product or unapproved use of a drug or device
             (other than the investigational product used in this study), or concurrently enrolled
             in any other type of medical research judged not to be scientifically or medically

             moderate or severe heart valve function defect and/or left ventricular ejection
             fraction (LVEF) &lt;50%, evaluation based on the institutional lower limit of normal)

          -  Predisposing conditions that are consistent with development of aneurysms of the
             ascending aorta or aortic stress (for example, family history of aneurysms,
             Marfan-Syndrome, bicuspid aortic valve, evidence of damage to the large vessels of
             the heart documented by CT scan or MRI with contrast)

          -  Are unable to swallow tablets or capsules

          -  Have a history of any other cancer (except non-melanoma skin cancer or carcinoma
             in-situ), unless in complete remission and off of all therapy for that disease for a
             minimum of 3 years

          -  Have active infection that would interfere with the study objectives or influence
