  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inflammation related to cytokine release is known to occur with surgery. The cytokine IL6, a
      major marker of inflammation is known to increase during total joint replacement surgery.
      IL6 has been found to be elevated postoperatively in patients with hip fractures and has
      been linked to mental status changes and possibly other complications. It is known to lead
      to shock and participate in the inflammatory state seen in sepsis. High levels have further
      been linked to postoperative fever, confusion, symptoms of depression, acute respiratory
      distress syndrome (ARDS) and fat embolism syndrome (FES). Previously the investigators found
      that low dose steroids given in two doses in the initial perioperative period decreased the
      amount of IL6 released compared to placebo, but this was not sustained past 24 hours.

      Desmosine is a stable breakdown product of elastin from lung tissue that can be measured in
      urine samples. It is considered to be a marker of lung injury and is found to be elevated in
      patients with ARDS, congestive obstructive pulmonary disease and FES. Previously, the
      investigators have found that urine desmosine levels rise with bilateral total knee
      replacement compared to unilateral total knee replacement indicating possible lung injury.

      Therefore the investigators hypothesize:

      Continued low dose steroids given three times over a 24 hour period will:

        1. Significantly decrease peak IL6 cytokine release during bilateral total knee
           replacement and maintaining this reduction in IL6 beyond 24 hours.

        2. Decrease urinary desmosine levels, and hence be protective of lung injury.
