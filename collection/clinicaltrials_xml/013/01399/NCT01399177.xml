      The purpose of this study is to find out if there is any change in diet on food cravings and
      weight loss in the 12 months following bariatric surgery.

      Research suggests that satiation processes in obese patients may be impaired, possibly
      resulting in excessive energy intake and poorer weight loss outcomes. One factor that may
      contribute to disruption of satiation processes and related overconsumption is dietary
      variety. Additionally, food cravings for restricted foods are believed to contribute to poor
      compliance to diets, and in controlled feeding studies, food cravings are the most
      frequently provided reason for poor dietary adherence. Interestingly, several investigations
      have found that cravings decrease when individuals follow a very-low-calorie or monotonous
      diet (9-11). Thus, reductions in the variety of the diet may also reduce food cravings, and
      assist in dietary adherence. It is also possible that the type of surgical procedure
      performed may influence changes in dietary variety, and consequently food cravings. To date,
      few studies have analyzed bariatric surgery patients' selection of foods within specific
      food groups and no study has examined the variety of foods consumed within food groups.
      Changes in food group variety which facilitate improvements in regulation of energy intake
      and body weight among obese individuals after behavioral weight loss may have a similar
      impact in patients who undergo bariatric surgery. Additionally, no studies have examined the
      relationship between changes in dietary variety and food cravings, and how these factors may
      be related to weight loss outcomes in any population.

      Primary Objectives:

      To examine by surgery type(Roux-En-Y gastric bypass [RYGB], laparoscopic adjustable gastric
      banding [LAGB], vertical sleeve gastrectomy [VSG])

        1. changes in dietary variety from pre- to post-bariatric surgery at 3, 6, and 12-months

        2. changes in variety of high-energy-dense foods and changes in cravings of
           high-energy-dense foods at 3, 6, and 12 months and

        3. changes in variety of high-energy-dense and low-energy-dense foods and changes in
           energy intake and weight loss at 3, 6, and 12 months.
