  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a phase 1/2, multicenter, 2-arm, open-label study using the oral formulation of
      IXAZOMIB when added to standard melphalan and prednisone (MP) treatment. Both phases of the
      study will include patients who have newly diagnosed multiple myeloma and are ineligible for
      high-dose therapy plus stem cell transplantation because of age (â‰¥65 years of age) or
      coexisting conditions and for whom standard MP treatment is indicated.

      Note: Phase 2 of the trial will be randomized.
