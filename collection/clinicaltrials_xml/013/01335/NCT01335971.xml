    <textblock>
      Evidence from investigators' group has shown that chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
      (COPD) patients have impairment of antioxidant defenses which are caused by a defect in
      activity of Nrf2. This trial focuses on sulforaphane, a derivative of cruciferous
      vegetables, which is a potent stimulator of Nrf2 activity. The investigators want to
      investigate whether ingestion of sulforaphane by COPD patients will increase Nrf2 activity
      and expression of downstream antioxidants. Accordingly, the investigators are conducting a
      placebo-controlled randomized proof of principle trial of two oral doses of sulforaphane, 25
      and 150 micromoles, for 4 weeks in 90 COPD patients. The investigators' goal is to establish
      a safe and tolerable dose of sulforaphane that effects in vivo antioxidants via Nrf2, then
      the investigators will have a novel candidate treatment for longer-term efficacy trials.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in
      the United States and is a growing cause of chronic disease internationally. Presently,
      there are limited treatment options for this disease to modify the progression of airflow
      obstruction and decrease periodic exacerbations. Recent evidence has emphasized the central
      role of oxidative stress as a mechanism of COPD pathobiology. Evidence from investigators'
      group has shown that COPD patients and animals exposed to cigarette smoke have impairment of
      antioxidant defenses which are caused by a defect in activity of Nrf2, a prolific regulator
      of anti-oxidant enzymes, glutathione homeostasis, and cytoprotective proteins. Activation of
      Nrf2 protects mice with chronic smoke exposure from developing emphysema, decreases
      oxidative stress, increases proteasomal anti-apoptotic cytoprotective responses, improves
      bacterial phagocytosis and killing, and reverses tobacco-smoke induced corticosteroid
      resistance. Similarly, in vitro Nrf2 activation in human COPD lung cells has shown improved
      cytoprotection, improved bacterial clearance, and restoration of steroid sensitivity. This
      trial focuses on sulforaphane, a derivative of cruciferous vegetables, which is a potent in
      vitro and in vivo stimulator of Nrf2 activity. The investigators want to investigate whether
      ingestion of sulforaphane by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients will
      increase Nrf2 activity and expression of downstream antioxidants in alveolar macrophages and
      bronchial epithelial cells. Accordingly, the investigators are conducting a
      placebo-controlled randomized proof of principle trial of two oral doses of sulforaphane, 25
      and 150 micromoles, for 4 weeks in 90 COPD patients. Collections of alveolar macrophages by
      Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), bronchial epithelial cells by endobronchial brushings will be
      performed at baseline and 4 weeks. Other bio-specimens will include nasal epithelial cells,
      Peripheral Blood Monocyte Collection (PBMCs), and expired breath condensate (EBC). The
      investigators' goal is to establish a safe and tolerable dose of sulforaphane that effects
      in vivo antioxidants via Nrf2, then the investigators will have a novel candidate treatment
      for longer-term efficacy trials. Ancillary studies are proposed to explore the efficacy and
      mechanisms of sulforaphane to increase bacterial clearance and to restore steroid
      sensitivity in COPD lung cells.
