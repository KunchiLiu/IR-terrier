      BMi 2 is a study that tests a behavioral counseling approach to reduce obesity in children.
      Practitioners (Pediatricians, Nurse Practitioners) were randomly assigned to one of three
      groups. The first group continued with standard care; in group 2, each practitioner
      delivered four study Motivational Interviewing visits with the parent/caregiver, and in
      group 3 in addition to the practitioner, a registered dietitian delivered 6 Motivational
      Interviewing visits. The primary outcome will be the child's percentile BMI change between
      the baseline and 2-year follow-up. Secondary outcomes will include behavior change around
      fruits and vegetables, sweetened beverages and exercise. Our hypothesis is that there will
      be a larger decrease in BMI percentile for children in group 3 than in group 2, and that
      children in group 2 will have a decrease in BMI percentile when compared to group one.

      The study is a cluster-randomized intervention trial with clinical practices serving as the
      unit of randomization and analysis. The investigators are testing two increasingly intensive
      interventions compared to a minimal intensity/Usual Care Group. Group 1 (Usual Care)
      includes determination of BMI percentile at baseline, 1-year, and 2-year follow-up. Usual
      Care (UC) practitioners provide parents with educational materials and routine care. UC
      pediatricians and their study staff received a ½ day study orientation session which
      included a brief CME-type workshop addressing obesity treatment.. Group 2 (Pediatric
      Practitioner only) includes the same assessment points as UC. In addition, Group 2 Pediatric
      Practitioners (PPs) received 2 days of in-person training in Motivational Interviewing (MI)
      and Behavior Therapy (BT) as well as an interactive DVD MI booster training system focusing
      on pediatric obesity. PPs in Group 2 are asked to schedule 3 proactive counseling sessions
      with a parent of the index child in Year 1 and one additional &quot;booster&quot; visit in year 2. To
      guide their counseling they are provided with a food and activity screening tool. In
      addition, Group 2 practices are provided with educational materials written in a style
      consistent with Motivational Interviewing and Self Determination Theory. Unlike in Group 1,
      where all of the educational materials are provided proactively to each parent, in Groups 2
      and 3, materials are distributed on a more selective tailored basis depending on parent
      needs. Group 3 (PP+RD) includes the same intervention components as Group 2, but adds
      MI-based counseling from a trained and registered dietitian (RD) who is linked to that
      practice. RDs deliver 6 MI-based counseling sessions over 2 years. The intervention is front
      loaded with 4 sessions in Year 1 and the remaining 2 in Year 2. The RD sessions are
      delivered both in-person (required for visit 1) and optionally by telephone or in-person,
      subsequently. Similar to MDs, RDs received 2.0 days of in-person MI and BT training, and the
      interactive DVD MI booster training system.
