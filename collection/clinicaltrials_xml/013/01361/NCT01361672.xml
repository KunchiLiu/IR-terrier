      The purpose of this study is to evaluate long-term performance of the 4296 LV Lead. This
      evaluation is based on the number of lead-related complications occurring during the study
      compared to the number of leads enrolled in the study. The leads will be followed for 5
      years after implant. This study is required by FDA as a condition of approval of the Model
      4296 LV Lead. This study is conducted within Medtronic's post-market surveillance platform.
