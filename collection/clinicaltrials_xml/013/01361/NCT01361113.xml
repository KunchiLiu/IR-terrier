  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a single arm phase II clinical trial of 8 weeks of daily, oral
      neo-adjuvant pazopanib prior to nephrectomy in 39 evaluable patients with histologically
      confirmed localized renal cell carcinoma (RCC).

      The primary objective of this study is to determine the objective response rate Complete
      Response + Partial Response(CR+PR) associated with neoadjuvant pazopanib at 8 weeks as
      defined via RECIST1.1. The investigators will also estimate the recurrence free survival
      (RFS), specifically the 1 and 2 year rates, with recurrence defined via RECIST1.1, and
      characterize the safety issues. Finally, this study also includes a number of exploratory
      analyses designed to evaluate potential correlations between RFS and; serum levels of
      cytokine and angiogenesis factor (CAF).
