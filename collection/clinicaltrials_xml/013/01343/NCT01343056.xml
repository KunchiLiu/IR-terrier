    <textblock>
      Patients who receive DSME (Diabetes Self Management Education) will be enrolled in a 4 arm,
      randomized study with each group receiving a different method of follow up. The 4 arms will
      be evaluated based on clinical indicators, goal achievement and patient satisfaction.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As the diabetes burden worsens, the need for people to become more involved in
      self-management will increase. Research has demonstrated that diabetes self-management
      education (DSME) can improve HbA1C levels by 0.76%. While the rates of diabetes are
      increasing, the numbers of educators available are shrinking. This is a particular hardship
      in underserved and military communities where the supply of health care providers is already
      scarce. Our investigative team has led efforts in supporting DSME in the PA state-wide
      deployment of the Chronic Care Model (CCM) and reported findings nationally on innovative
      ways to increase the pool of education services by integrating educators into primary care,
      establishing nurse clinics in underserved communities and demonstrating that an educator
      position could be sustained by reimbursement. A 0.76% reduction associated to DSME can be
      considered an enormous benefit and is equivalent to the impact of most pharmacologic
      treatments for diabetes. Unfortunately, however the benefits of DSME decrease over time.
      This suggests that sustained improvements require contact and follow-up. SMS is defined as
      the process of ongoing support of patient self-care, to sustain the gains following DSME.
      There is often confusion among the terms self-management education (DSME) and
      self-management support (SMS). DSME is associated with the provision of knowledge and skills
      training delivered by a health care professional, e.g. nurses, dietitians, etc. SMS is
      defined as the process of making and refining changes in health care systems (and the
      community) to support patient self-care and maintain the gains made following DSME. We know
      that SMS is currently provided by diabetes educators, but only one 3-6 month follow up is
      usual care. It has been suggested that SMS can be provided by community workers, peers with
      diabetes, and office staff within community sites, like PCP offices, and wellness centers,
      etc. The National Standards for DSME and American Diabetes Association (ADA) Education
      Recognition Program (ERP) require that SMS approaches be delivered and documented, yet no
      evidence has been provided to define who should deliver it and how often. This uncertainty
      has led to many programs delivering SMS in an unstructured, non-standardized and at times
      haphazard fashion. Practical approaches designed for providing SMS have the potential to
      sustain improvements. The objective of this study is to compare Self-Management Support
      (SMS) interventions following Diabetes Self-Management Education (DSME) and determine which
      will be more likely to maintain improvements in behavioral and clinical outcomes following
      DSME while achieving patient satisfaction.

    <description>Diabetes Self Management Education (DSME) is an important part of the treatment for diabetes. Unfortunately, the positive effects of education sometimes wane over time. We are evaluating four distinct methods of follow up for behavior goals set by the participant. We will evaluate success by measuring how many patients in each of the four total groups reach their self-initiated behavioral goals.</description>
