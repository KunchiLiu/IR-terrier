    <textblock>
      The purpose of this two part study is to test the safety and efficacy of Tafenoquine (with
      Cholorquine) as a radical cure for Plasmodium vivax (P.vivax) malaria relative to the
      control Chloroquine.Part 1 aims to select an efficacious and well tolerated dose that can be
      co-administered with Chloroquine. Part 2 will investigate the safety and efficacy of the
      selected dose (300 mg tafenoquine) in the treatment and radical cure of Plasmodium Vivax
      Malaria.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Plasmodium vivax represents 50-80% of all malarial cases in Latin America and South East
      Asia. It is able to establish a dormant liver stage called the hypnozoite. Hypnozoite
      activation after initial infection can cause a relapse. Currently the only widely available
      drug is primaquine which requires administration over 14 days, resulting in poor compliance
      and treatment failure. Tafenoquine (an 8-aminoquinoline anti-malarial drug) has been shown
      to possess activity against all stages of the plasmodium life cycle, including the dormant
      stage in the liver. This is a multi-centre, double dummy, double blind, parallel group,
      randomized, active control study which is conducted in two parts. For both parts, subjects
      are treated with Chloroquine on days 1 to 3 (600mg, 600mg, and 300mg) to treat the blood
      stage vivax malaria. Part 1 will include at least 324 subjects and part 2 at least 600
      subjects. Part 1 has 6 treatment arms, arms 1 to 4 contain different doses of Tafenoquine
      (50mg, 100mg, 300mg, and 600mg) dosed on day 1 or 2, arm 5 contains primaquine (15mg) dosing
      over 14 days (days 2-15 (15mg)) and arm 6 contains chloroquine only. The aim of this is to
      find a dose of Tafenoquine which meets the defined dose criteria. Based on Part 1 efficacy
      and safety, a single Tafenoquine dose (300 mg) will be studied in the pivotal Part 2. Part 2
      contains 3 treatment arms one with the selected Tafenoquine dose (300 mg), the second arm
      will be 15mg Primaquine which will again be dosed over 14 days and the final arm contains
      chloroquine only dosed days 1-3 (600mg, 600mg, 300mg). Therefore as with Part 1, in Part 2
      all subjects will receive Chloroquine. The aim of Part 2 is to investigate the safety and
      efficacy of the selected Tafenoquine/Chloroquine dose in the treatment and radical cure of
      Plasmodium vivax malaria. In addition to the Primary and Secondary endpoints stated below we
      will also be collecting; other efficacy endpoints (gametocyte clearance time, Recrudescence
      defined as any Plasmodium vivax parasitemia occurring on or before Day 29 (blood stage
      treatment failure), Incidence of Plasmodium falciparum malaria and Incidence of
      recrudescence and new Plasmodium vivax infection, determined by Polymerase Chain Reaction
      (PCR), safety endpoints (clinically relevant haemolysis leading to drops in haemoglobin /
      haematocrit or complications thereof (required transfusions, acute renal failure), changes
      in methaemoglobin, gastrointestinal (GI) tolerability - incidence of abdominal pain,
      heartburn, diarrhoea, constipation, nausea and vomiting and ophthalmic safety - incidence of
      corneal deposits, retinal and visual field abnormalities. Data collected at up to four
      centres . Additionally, the incidence and severity of adverse events and abnormal laboratory
      observations will be presented).Pharmacokinetic endpoints (Population pharmacokinetic
      parameters for tafenoquine including but not limited to oral clearance (CL/F) and volume of
      distribution (V/F)and Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic endpoints (e.g. tafenoquine plasma
      concentrations) and selected Pharmacodynamic endpoints (e.g. relapse efficacy, change in
      methaemoglobin) if appropriate, will be explored.
