    <textblock>
      The aim of this combined, two part study is to evaluate the safety and glucose lowering
      effects of GSK256073 when administered to diabetic subjects for 12 weeks.

      The study will be conducted at centers in Europe and the United States. The study is being
      conducted in two parts. Part A (n = 90 subjects) will provide a preliminary evaluation of 12
      weeks of treatment. Initiation of part B (n = 210 additional subjects) will be dependent on
      the results observed in part A. The emerging data from part A will be used to guide
      selection of the doses in Part B. Up to 8 dose levels of GSK256073 may be included in part
      B. The emerging exposure response relationships from the part A interim analysis will be
      used to guide dose selection.

      Each subject enrolled in the study will undergo screening procedures, a 2 week placebo
      run-in period, baseline assessments, randomization, a twelve week treatment period, and a 2
      week follow-up period. Following completion of the baseline visit and randomization into the
      study, subjects will return to the clinic for safety and efficacy assessments at Weeks 3, 6,
      9, and 12. A subject's total participation in the study will last up to approximately 20
      weeks. Subjects will continue their current prescribed regimen of metformin (glucophage)
      monotherapy and will monitor fasting blood glucose levels daily using a glucometer.
