      Background:

      - Influenza (the flu) is highly infectious and contagious. It causes considerable illness in
      the United States each year. The most severely affected are the very young, sick, and
      elderly. Researchers want to find healthy volunteers for influenza &quot;challenge studies.&quot; In
      these studies, doctors expose a person to a flu virus. Then they study the flu through the
      body's natural healing process. This information will help to find better ways to prevent
      the flu. It may also improve the treatment of people who get the flu.

      Objectives:

      - To screen healthy volunteers for future influenza challenge studies.

      Eligibility:

        -  Healthy people between the ages of 18 and 65 who do not routinely smoke.

        -  People who share the same apartment or house with people at least 65 years of age or
           children under age 5 will not be eligible.

        -  People who share living quarters with nursing home residents, people with chronic or
           acute medical conditions, or people with cancer or a compromised immune system are also
           ineligible.

      Design:

        -  The 3- to 5-hour screening exam includes the following:

        -  Medical history and physical exam

        -  Standard blood tests including pregnancy and HIV tests

        -  Standard urine drug testing

        -  Electrocardiogram (ECG) to test heart rhythm and function

        -  Chest x-ray

        -  Eligible volunteers are enrolled in the study for up to 1 year, until they take part in
           a virus challenge study, or are found to be ineligible to participate.

        -  Volunteers may withdraw from the study pool at any time.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The high morbidity and mortality associated with both pandemic and seasonal influenza and
      the anticipation for future influenza pandemics puts influenza front and center in
      infectious disease research. Because the natural history and pathogenesis of human influenza
      has not been well characterized and cannot be adequately studied in animal models or with
      current in vitro techniques, important questions about influenza pathogenesis can only be
      approached through human challenge studies.

      Previous human challenge studies have addressed some aspects of the natural history by
      evaluating the timing of viral replication, shedding, clinical symptoms, and innate and
      adaptive immune responses. Although these studies have provided important information, all
      but one was performed prior to 1990. Without exception, these studies had limitations due to
      the scope of the study and/or the scientific techniques available at that time.

      The primary goal of this study is to collect and store serum and PBMC samples and obtain
      clinical and laboratory data from volunteers to determine in advance if they are potentially
      eligible to participate in future influenza challenge and/or vaccine studies. To accomplish
      this objective, up to 5000 participants will be enrolled in this protocol at the NIH
      Clinical Center clinic or day hospital in order to maintain a pool of participants who have
      been evaluated and can be screened for future influenza challenge studies.
