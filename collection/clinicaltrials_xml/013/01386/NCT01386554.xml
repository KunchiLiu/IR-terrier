      The purpose of this study is to provide nephrologists with additional clinical evidence
      regarding the efficacy and safety of Acthar in subjects with treatment-resistant idiopathic
      membranous nephropathy. Approximately sixty (60) subjects will be randomized in this
      double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, multicenter study comparing Acthar and
      Placebo administered 2 times per week for a 24-week treatment period followed by a 24-week
      observation period. The primary objective of this study is to assess the proportion of
      treatment-resistant subjects (defined as subjects who either have had no response or have
      suffered a relapse after achieving a partial response to their most recent standard
      treatment regimen) who have a complete or partial remission of proteinuria in nephrotic
      syndrome due to idiopathic membranous nephropathy after 24 weeks of treatment.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        For complete list of inclusion and exclusion criteria, please refer to contact below.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female subjects ≥18 years of age, at screening Visit 1:

             a. If potential subjects are &gt;75 years of age, discussion between the investigator
             and the Medical Monitor must take place;

          -  Body mass index ≤40 kg/m2, at screening Visit 1;

          -  A history of nephrotic syndrome due to iMN as confirmed by documented results from a
             renal biopsy performed within 4 years prior to screening Visit 1:

             a. If a biopsy has been performed between 4-8 years prior to screening, and if the
             subject has no signs or symptoms of diabetes or other clinical diagnoses that could
             suggest a change in renal histology in the opinion of the investigator and the
             Medical Monitor, the subject is eligible.

          -  Renal target disease requirements:

               1. Total urine protein of ≥3.0g (≥3000mg) from the 24-hour urine returned at Visit
                  1A, AND.

               2. An estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) value &gt;25mL/min/1.73m2 at Visit
                  1A (as calculated using the abbreviated Modification of Diet in Renal Disease
                  [MDRD] equation.

          -  Any prior course of at least 1 month of treatment with ≥1 of an immunosuppressant
             therapy(ies) for iMN:

               1. Subjects must be followed for at least 3 months after treatment prior to
                  screening with the exception of rituximab or a cytotoxic based therapy, where
                  the follow-up period is 6 months after treatment. If after follow-up it was
                  determined that the subject did not achieve a complete or partial remission or
                  suffered a relapse after achieving a partial remission, the subject will be
                  eligible for the study.

               2. If in the investigator's opinion, the subject should be enrolled prior to
                  meeting the follow-up period criteria and the decrease in proteinuria is no
                  longer occurring, discussion between the investigator and the Medical Monitor
                  must take place for approval to enter screening.

          -  History of treatment-resistant iMN defined as either having had no remission or
             having suffered a relapse after achieving a partial remission to their most recent
             standard treatment regimen as defined in the Definition of Response Status Table
             despite treatment with at least 1 month of treatment with a prior therapy for iMN.
             Note the following:

             a. If the subject has been treated with prior standard therapy and can no longer be
             re-treated with any component of that therapy, regardless of whether a complete or
             partial remission was achieved, then the subject may be eligible, but approval from
             the Medical Monitor is required.

             i. For example, if early discontinuation of standard therapy occurred because of a
             serious adverse event (Grade 3 or 4) during the treatment, regardless of whether a
             partial or complete remission was achieved, then the subject may be eligible.

             b. If (a) does not apply, and the subject did not have either a partial or complete
             remission to the most recent treatment regimen, then the subject is eligible.

             c. If (a) does not apply, and the subject achieved a partial remission from the most
             recent treatment regimen, and later relapse occurred, then the subject is eligible.

          -  Antihypertensive treatment including use of ACE inhibitors and/or ARB:

             a. Unless there is a history of intolerance to ACE inhibitors or ARB therapy, the
             subject must be treated with at least one of these agents.

             b. Treatment with ACE inhibitor and/or ARB for ≥3 months prior to screening Visit 1A,
             with stable maintenance dose for ≥30 days prior to randomization.

             c. If treated with other antihypertensive therapies, treatment duration of ≥30 days
             and stable maintenance dose for ≥7 days prior to screening Visit 1A.

          -  Blood pressure determined by the average of ≥3 seated readings taken ≥5 minutes apart
             during the screening period at Visit 1A:

               1. Mean systolic blood pressure ≤140 mmHg and

               2. Mean diastolic blood pressure ≤80 mmHg.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Therapies and/or medications:

               1. History of previous use of Acthar for treatment of nephrotic syndrome;

               2. Prior sensitivity to Acthar or other porcine protein products; or

               3. Planned treatment with live or live attenuated vaccines once enrolled in the

             prior to Visit 1A.

          -  Renal target disease exclusions:

               1. Subjects with known diabetic nephropathy or nephrotic syndrome due to a disease
                  or process other than idiopathic membranous nephropathy, or

               2. Subjects requiring diagnostic or interventional procedure requiring a contrast
                  agent must delay screening/randomization for at least 7 days.

                  (hematuria in combination with flank pain and &gt;30% unexplained acute rise in
                  serum creatinine) with renal vein thrombosis confirmed by ultrasound, MRI or
                  computed tomography scan.

          -  Cardiovascular exclusions:

               1. History of or active congestive heart failure (NYHA Functional Classification of
                  CHF Class II through Class IV), or.

               2. History of known dilated cardiomyopathy with left ventricular ejection fraction
                  ≤40%, or.

               3. Occurrence of any of the following within 3 months of screening Visit 1A:
