  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label, randomized study will assess the efficacy and safety of obinutuzumab
      (RO5072759) in combination with chemotherapy compared to MabThera/Rituxan (rituximab) with
      chemotherapy followed by obinutuzumab or MabThera/Rituxan maintenance in patients with
      untreated advanced indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. After the end of the induction period,
      patients achieving response (CR or PR) will go on to a maintenance period thereby continuing
      on their randomized antibody treatment alone every 2 months until disease progression for a
      total of 2 years. Anticipated time on study treatment is up to approximately 2.5 years.
      After maintenance or observation patients will be followed for 5 years until progression.
      After progression, patients will be followed for new anti-lymphoma therapy and overall
      survival until the end of the study.
