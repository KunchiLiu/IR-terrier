    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess safety and ability of the endoscopic bipolar
      radiofrequency ablation (RFA) probe (ENDOHPB) to produce an improvement in the management of
      cancer of the bile duct or the pancreatic duct. By using radiofrequency (RF) energy to heat
      the tissue in the duct prior to insertion of the stent, the surrounding tissue becomes
      coagulated and this may delay tumour growth and the time before the stent lumen becomes
      blocked. Thereby, allowing increased periods between the need for intervention and further
      stent deployment. The study will look to see if the ENDOHPB is able to keep the stent open
      longer and perhaps decrease the number of invasive procedures for occluded (blocked) stents.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Only a small proportion of patients with biliary obstruction caused by cholangiocarcinoma or
      pancreatic cancer are suitable for surgical resection. As the cancer grows, it blocks the
      drainage of the bile ducts that carry digestive juices from the gall bladder and pancreas to
      the small intestine. Blocked drainage causes abdominal pain, bloating, and nausea. ERCP
      (endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography) is often prescribed. ERCP with stent
      placement is the standard medical procedure for people with bile duct and pancreatic cancer.

    <description>Intervention:
The EndoHPB is an endoscopic bipolar catheter designed to ablate tissue in malignant tumors within luminal structures, such as the biliary tree or pancreatic ducts. EndoHPB can be deployed via an ERCP or Percutaneous Transhepatic Cholangiographic (PTC) route. By using radiofrequency (RF) energy to heat the tissue in the duct prior to insertion of the stent, the surrounding tissue becomes coagulated and this may delay tumour growth and the time before the stent lumen becomes blocked. Thereby, allowing increased periods between the need for intervention and further stent deployment</description>

    <description>EndoHPB (EMcision Ltd, UK) is a single use sterile device for use at ERCP or PTC. It is a 8F (2.6mm) catheter with a 1.8m working length, that is designed to be inserted into the target duct of the hepatic, biliary or pancreatic system over a guide wire. The device is compatible with endoscopes that have a working channel of 3.2mm or greater. It comprises of a coaxial over the wire (OTW) catheter with 2 ring electrodes spaced 8mm apart at its distal end. The distal electrode is 5mm from the leading edge of the catheter. The two electrodes at the distal end of EndoHPB are designed to produce a heating zone length of approximately 25 mm.</description>
