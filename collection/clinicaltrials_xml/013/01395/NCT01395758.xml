      The purpose of this study is to evaluate progression-free survival among subjects with KRAS
      mutation positive Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) treated with erlotinib plus tivantinib
      (ARQ 197) compared to single agent chemotherapy.

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, open-label Phase 2 study designed to compare treatment with erlotinib
      plus tivantinib (ARQ 197) versus single agent chemotherapy in subjects with previously
      treated KRAS mutation positive NSCLC. Eligible subjects are randomly assigned to receive
      erlotinib plus tivantinib or one of three (based on Investigator's decision) single-agent
      chemotherapy agents including pemetrexed, docetaxel, or gemcitabine.
