      Aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) is an enzyme responsible for the final step in
      the synthesis of neurotransmitters dopamine and serotonin. AADC deficiency is a rare genetic
      disorder. Taiwanese carry a high prevalence of AADC deficiency due to the founder mutation
      IVS6+4 A&gt;T, and patients usually die before the age 5-6 years due to severe motor
      dysfunction.

      Gene therapy with adeno-associated virus (AAV) serotype 2 (AAV2) driven human AADC (hAADC)
      has been tested in both animal models and Phase I clinical trials of Parkinson disease. We
      have done a compassionate treatment of 8 patients with AADC deficiency by AAV2-hAADC and
      demonstrated a result that among the treated patients, 4 could stand with support, 3 could
      sit with support, and there was no virus-associated toxicity. The longest follow up has
      exceeded 4 years.

      This study is to prove the safety and efficacy of AAV2-hAADC treatment for patients with
      Aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) deficiency.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. A definitive diagnosis of AADC deficiency, including a CSF study showing decreased
             levels of HVA and 5-HIAA, and an elevated L-dopa level, and the presence of at least
             one AADC gene pathologic mutation.

          2. The patient must have clinical symptoms of AADC deficiency, include hypotonia,
             dystonia, and oculogyric crisis.

          3. The patient must be older than 24 months of age or has skull bones suitable for
             surgery.

          4. The parents of study participants must agree to comply in good faith with the
             required baseline and follow-up assessments.

          5. The parents or guardians must understand and sign their child's informed consent
             form.

        Exclusion criteria

          1. Other significant medical or neurological conditions which would create an
             unacceptable operative risk. Each case will be individually reviewed and the final
             decision shall rest with the Primary Investigator.

          2. Preexisting immunity to AAV may limit AAV-mediated gene delivery. Patients with
             anti-AAV2 antibody titer higher than 1.0 OD will be excluded.

          3. The patient cannot take medicines that will alter the effect of this clinical trial.
