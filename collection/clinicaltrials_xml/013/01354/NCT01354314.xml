  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if paroxetine and fluconazole are safe and effective as
      a treatment for problems with memory, concentration, thinking, and judgment in people who
      are infected with HIV. Paroxetine is an antidepressant approved by the FDA to treat major
      depression. Fluconazole is an antifungal medication approved by the FDA to treat fungal
      infections.

      The study will be a 24 week double-blind, placebo-controlled 2x2 factorial design pilot
      Phase I/II study in 60 HIV+ individuals with HAND. Participants will be randomly assigned to
      one of four groups: 1) fluconazole 100 mg every 12 hours orally per day, 2) paroxetine 20mg
      every evening orally per day, 3) fluconazole 100mg every 12 hours orally per day and
      paroxetine 20mg every evening orally per day and 4) placebo.

      Primary Aim: To obtain preliminary data to evaluate the efficacy of fluconazole and/or
      paroxetine to decrease CSF lipid and protein markers of oxidative stress [CSF ceramide and
      (C18:0 levels) and 3-nitrosylated proteins].

      Secondary Aims:

      i) To evaluate the safety and tolerability of fluconazole and/or paroxetine in HIV+
      individuals with HAND ii) To evaluate the effect of fluconazole and/or paroxetine on
      neurocognitive performance in HIV+ individuals with HAND iii) To evaluate the effect of
      fluconazole and/or paroxetine on functional performance in HIV+ individuals with HAND iv) To
      evaluate the CNS penetration of fluconazole and paroxetine after 24 weeks of treatment v) To
      obtain preliminary data to evaluate the efficacy of fluconazole and/or paroxetine to improve
      abnormal imaging markers as measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and arterial
      spin labeling

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  HIV+ based on ELISA and confirmed by either Western blot or plasma HIV RNA

          -  capable of providing informed consent

          -  age range: 18-65 years

          -  presence of neuropsychological testing impairment as defined by performance at least
             1.0 standard deviation below age-matched and education-matched controls on three or
             more independent neuropsychological tests at the screening visit, or performance at
             least 2.0 standard deviations below age-matched and education-matched controls on one
             independent neuropsychological test and at least 1.0 standard deviation below
             age-matched and education-matched controls on a second independent neuropsychological
             test at the screening visit

          -  a stable HAART regimen for 3 months with no plans to change the antiretroviral
             regimen over the study period (confirmed by discussion with a patient's primary
             provider)

          -  the following lab values within 2 weeks prior to entry: hemoglobin &gt; 8.9 g/dl,
             absolute neutrophil count &gt; 500 cells/mm3, platelet count &gt; 50,000 cells/mm3, ALT &lt;
             2.5 X upper limit of normal, alkaline phosphatase &lt; 3 X upper limit of normal, serum
             creatinine &gt;= 2 X upper limit of normal

          -  a negative serum or urine beta-HCG pregnancy test for all women of reproductive
             potential (have not reached menopause or undergone hysterectomy, oophorectomy, or
             tubal ligation)

          -  neurological examination by a physician revealing no contraindication to a lumbar
             puncture. If an examination suggests a possible space-occupying brain mass lesion,
             neuroimaging with CT or MRI must confirm the absence of a mass lesion.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  current or past opportunistic CNS infection (fungal or non-fungal) at study entry

          -  current systemic fungal infection

          -  current or past use of fluconazole within 30 days of the screening visit

          -  history or current clinical evidence of schizophrenia

          -  history of chronic neurological disorder such as multiple sclerosis or uncontrolled
             epilepsy

          -  active symptomatic AIDS defining opportunistic infection within 30 days prior to
             study entry

          -  history of abnormal medical illness or current severe affective disorder (e.g.,
             depression with suicidal intention) which in the opinion of the investigators would
             constitute a safety risk for patients or interfere with the ability of a patient to
             complete the study

          -  treatment with anticoagulants including coumadin, heparin, or low molecular weight
             heparin which would be a contraindication for the lumbar puncture

          -  HIV+ individuals with moderate or severe confounding illnesses

          -  prior use of SSRI's within 1 month of screening

          -  active substance abuse (illicit drugs and/or controlled medications) or active severe
             alcohol abuse, evidenced by history intake or urine toxicology at any visit prior to
             study entry (starting study medication)
