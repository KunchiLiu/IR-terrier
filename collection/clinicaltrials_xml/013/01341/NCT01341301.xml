  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to examine the survival of patients undergoing
      partially matched hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) on a new type of treatment
      approach, which has been developed specifically for patients who have evidence of their
      disease at the time of transplant. In this research study, a way of strengthening the
      response of the donor cells against the disease has been developed. Patients will undergo
      one additional day between the two steps of the transplant which may allow their donor's
      cells to fight the disease more effectively.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II study in which patients receive a haploidentical HSCT from a single
      donor. The period between the donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) and tolerizing doses of CY has
      been extended to allow for an increased period of allogeneic response against tumor targets.
      The outcomes of patients undergoing this extra time period will be compared to historical
      data to assess efficacy.

      Primary Objective:

      1) To assess 1 year relapse free survival in patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell
      transplant (HSCT) using the Thomas Jefferson University (TJU) 2 step approach with an extra
      day inserted between the DLI and administration of cyclophosphamide (CY).

      Secondary Objectives:

        1. To assess the consistency and pace of engraftment.

        2. To assess the pace of T cell and B cell immune recovery.

        3. To assess regimen related toxicity, GVHD incidence and severity, and overall survival
           in patients undergoing treatment on this protocol. .

        4. To assess the tolerance of the period of fever, diarrhea, and rash in each arm in an
           effort to determine whether a longer interval prior to cytoxan changes this side effect
           qualitatively compared to prior patient groups or concurrent patient groups. N.B.
           Patients with hematologic malignancies in remission will continue to be transplanted
           without modification to the original 2-step approach and will serve as a concurrent
           comparison group.

        5. To collect leukemia samples prior to transplant and after relapse whenever possible. To
           assess the overall degree of HLA-class I and class II expression on these paired
           samples. To test for loss of one or both HLA haplotypes in the relapsed tumor
           specimens.

        6. To determine the number of CD4+ CD25+ FOXP3+ regulatory cells post HSCT and to assess
           whether this is correlated with the development of GVHD after transplant.
