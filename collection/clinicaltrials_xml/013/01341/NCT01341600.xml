  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clopidogrel (also known as Plavix) is used commonly in patients to prevent heart attacks and
      conditions caused by blood clots. Although clopidogrel works in many individuals, some
      people do not respond as well to this drug. The variation in treatment response may be
      linked to genetics. This study will examine the effects of clopidogrel in a population whose
      genes are well known in order to determine the role that genes play in the response to
      various clopidogrel maintenance doses.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Clopidogrel is a prodrug with high inter-individual response variability. Clopidogrel is
      converted to an active drug through an enzyme encoded by the gene named CYP2C19. Individuals
      with genetically-impaired CYP2C19 metabolism have lower capacity to convert the prodrug to
      its active form. Consequently, these individuals have lower blood levels of the activated
      form of clopidogrel, diminished antiplatelet responses, and higher rates of cardiovascular
      events and stent thrombosis. Increasing doses of clopidogrel in such patients represents a
      possible approach to managing the gene-drug interaction.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether increasing the dose of clopidogrel
      increases antiplatelet responses and active metabolite exposure in individuals with
      genetically reduced CYP2C19 metabolism relative to those with normal CYP2C19 metabolism.

      The primary objective is to assess changes in clopidogrel response and exposure at three
      clopidogrel dose levels and with coadministration of omeprazole.

    <description>platelet aggregation will be measured at baseline and at 4-hours post-dose of clopidogrel on day 1 and at 4-hours post-dose of clopidogrel on day 8. The primary endpoint of this study will be the change in maximal platelet aggregation 4-hours post-dose (MPA4; units are a percentage) on day 8 of each study period compared to baseline.</description>
