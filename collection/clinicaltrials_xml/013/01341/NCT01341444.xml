  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to see how safe and effective the Prevena Incision Management
      System &quot;Prevena&quot; is when placed over a renal transplantation incision. Prevena provides
      negative pressure (suction) wound therapy. Prevena will be tested while applied during the
      time each subject is hospitalized and up to 5 days after the surgery. Prevena is a small
      portable negative pressure device which consists of a therapy unit that delivers negative
      pressure. It also includes a dressing system that is intended for use over closed incisions
      after surgery.

      The intent of this study is to evaluate Prevena versus the standard care that a doctor would
      use normally after a kidney transplant.

      This is a randomized, single-center, comparative interventional study looking at the effect
      of Prevena™ on renal transplant surgical Subjects compared to a control arm treated with the
      standard-of-care wound dressing. The prospective, post-marketing clinical study described in
      this protocol will assess the effectiveness and functional performance of PrevenaTM in this
      clinical indication.

    <description>The primary objective to compare short-term surgical incision-related clinical outcomes in Subjects undergoing open renal transplant surgery when treated with Prevena vs. the standard-of-care wound dressing. Clinical outcomes of interest are defined as Surgical Site Complications (SSCs) that include incisional fluid accumulation (i.e. seroma, hematoma, abscess), dehiscence, surgical site infection (SSI). These outcomes will be compared to a control group consisting of subjects screened for the same inclusion/exclusion criteria but treated with standard-of-care incision dressing.</description>
