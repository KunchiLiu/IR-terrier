      This study will investigate the association between levels of the peptide copeptin and
      response to tolvaptan, a drug that blocks the action of the water retaining hormone
      vasopressin.

             reduce diuretic administration

          3. Presence of clinical contraindications to tolvaptan

          4. Episode of acute myocardial infarction or acute coronary syndrome within the past 3
             months

             cardiomyopathy.

          7. History of primary significant liver disease or acute hepatic failure, as defined by
             the investigator.

          8. Chronic uncontrolled diabetes mellitus as determined by the investigator.

          9. Supine systolic arterial blood pressure &lt; 90 mmHg at screening

         10. Serum creatinine &gt; 3.5 mg/dL at screening

         11. Serum potassium &gt; 5.5 mEq/L or &lt; 3.5 mEq/L at screening

         12. Subjects currently treated with hemofiltration or dialysis

        j. Subjects judged by the investigator to be unable to maintain accurate intake and output
        during their hospitalization related to medical or other problems
