      Using a 4-arm, cluster-randomized controlled trial, the investigators will test the
      effectiveness of different behavioral economic interventions in increasing statin use and
      reducing LDL cholesterol among patients with poor cholesterol control who are at very high
      risk for CVD. The investigators will test these approaches among primary care physicians and
      their patients at very high risk of CVD at Geisinger Health System and University of
      Pennsylvania outpatient clinics.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the United States. Despite
      strong evidence that reducing low-density lipoproteins (LDL) with statins successfully
      lowers CVD risk, physicians under-prescribe statins, physicians fail to intensify treatment
      when indicated, and more than 50% of patients stop taking statins within one year of first
      prescription, though such therapy typically should be life-long. In this study, we will test
      the effectiveness of different behavioral economic interventions in increasing statin use
      and reducing LDL cholesterol among patients with poor cholesterol control who are at very
      high risk for CVD. The application of conceptual approaches from behavioral economics offers
      considerable promise in advancing health and health care. Pay for performance initiatives
      represent one such potential application, but one in which incorporating the underlying
      psychology of decision makers has not generally been done, and experimental tests have not
      been conducted. We will test these approaches among primary care physicians and their
      patients at very high risk of CVD at Geisinger Health System and University of Pennsylvania
      outpatient clinics. Using a 4-arm, cluster-randomized controlled trial, we aim to answer
      these questions: [1] How does the provision of provider incentives compare to the provision
      of patient incentives, to a combination of patient and provider incentives, or to no
      incentives at all? [2] Are results sustained after incentives and other interventions are
      withdrawn? [3] How do these approaches compare in implementation, acceptability, cost, and
      cost-effectiveness?

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Physicians: All primary care providers who have at least 5 patients who meet
             eligibility criteria will be eligible.

          -  Patients: 10-year CVD risk of between 10-20% who do not have an LDL below 140 mg/dl
             or 10-year CVD risk of at least 20% (including those with preexisting CHD) who do not
             have an LDL below 120 mg/dl will be the primary inclusion criteria. We have chosen to
             include all patients meeting these inclusion criteria regardless of their reported
             adherence to statins, as there clearly is room for improvement in the LDL through a
             combination of physician and patient actions.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients will be excluded if they have a known allergy or history of side effects to
             statins, will not or cannot give consent, or have a markedly shortened life
             expectancy (diagnosis of metastatic cancer, end-stage renal disease on dialysis, or
             dementia).
