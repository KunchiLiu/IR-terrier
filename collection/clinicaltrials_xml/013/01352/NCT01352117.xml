  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma (AIDS-KS) occurs in persons with HIV infection who are also
      infected with the Kaposi's sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV). Several chemotherapy (anti-cancer)
      drugs work well in treating KS, but there is no treatment that cures KSHV infection. One
      chemotherapy drug called etoposide (VePesid®, ET) has caused KS tumors to get smaller in
      some people.

      Antiretroviral therapy (anti-HIV drugs or ART) is a group of medicines taken together to
      treat HIV infection. These medicines help to stop HIV from growing in the body. When this
      happens, your immune system, which fights infection and some cancers like KS, will get
      stronger. For some people, limited stage KS often improves or stays the same when they take
      ART. However, in some people KS gets worse when taking ART. These people may need
      chemotherapy at a later date.

      This study is being done to find out if taking ART with immediate etoposide (ET) is better
      than taking ART alone or ART with delayed ET to treat limited stage KS. The study will also
      try to better understand KSHV and to see what kind of side effects are caused by ART and ET
      and how safe ART and ET are.

          1. KS progression as defined in the study protocol or KS progression after a complete or
             partial response as defined in the study protocol, while on Step 1 Arm 1A, between
             weeks 8 and 80.

          2. Need for ET for treatment of KS progression, in the opinion of the site investigator,
             after confirmation of KS progression by the IERC.

          3. Willingness to receive ET for treatment of KS progression.

          4. Female participants of reproductive potential must have a negative serum or urine
             pregnancy test performed within 7 days prior to initiating ET.

          5. Karnofsky Performance Score &gt;= 50.

          9. Female participants who are participating in sexual activity that could lead to
             pregnancy must agree to use a combination of TWO of the following methods- Condoms
             (male or female) with or without a spermicidal agent, diaphragm or cervical cap with
             spermicide, IUD, hormonal-based contraception.

        For Etoposide, confirmation of lack of reproductive potential is required for all
        participants. More information on this criterion can be found in the study protocol.
