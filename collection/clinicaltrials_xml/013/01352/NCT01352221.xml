      The purpose of this study is to determine whether ST10-021, an oral ferric iron preparation,
      is safe and effective in the treatment of iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) in subjects with
      non-active Crohn's Disease (CD).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As no curative treatment is currently available for Crohn's Disease (CD), treatment options
      are restricted to controlling symptoms, maintaining remission and preventing relapse. As
      such, treatment of iron deficiency anaemia (IDA), a key symptom of the disease, is integral
      to the medical management of CD. Iron deficiency anaemia in CD is a chronically debilitating
      disorder which has a significant impact on the quality of life of affected subjects.
      Characteristic symptoms of IDA include chronic fatigue, headache, and subtle impairment of
      cognitive function. Up to one third of subjects with CD suffer from recurrent anaemia, with
      hospitalization required in severe cases. First line standard therapy for mild to moderate
      IDA in CD is typically oral ferrous products (OFP), however this is often not successful.
      Many subjects are intolerant and suffer from continuously occurring side effects, occasional
      exacerbation of inflammatory lesions and failure to correct iron deficiency. Common adverse
      effects of OFP include nausea, epigastric discomfort and constipation, all of which are
      dose-related and appear especially evident in subjects with CD.

      As compared to oral ferrous iron, oral ferric iron can be administered with improved
      tolerability and the total dose exposure of unabsorbed iron within the gastrointestinal
      tract is significantly reduced. In addition, the iron is retained in its chelated form if
      not absorbed and this may reduce the risk of irritation within the gastrointestinal tract.
      Clinical studies conducted to date provide preliminary evidence for the therapeutic
      potential of ST10-021 in patients with IDA in Inflammatory Bowel Disease, including CD.

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether ST10-021 is safe and effective in the
      treatment of IDA in subjects with non-active CD. In an effort to target an underserved
      population, the study will include only those subjects who have failed OFP in the past, or
      where OFP cannot be used.
