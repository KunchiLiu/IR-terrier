  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After decades of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) intervention research, only
      two intervention approaches (i.e., psychopharmacology, behavioral treatment) have a
      &quot;well-established&quot; evidence-base supporting their efficacy for children with ADHD. Both of
      these interventions have inherent limitations. Recently multiple studies have demonstrated
      that cognitive training may improve neuropsychological and behavioral functioning in
      children with ADHD. The magnitude of treatment effects for cognitive training has been
      comparable to treatment effects for behavioral treatment for ADHD (i.e., small to moderate
      effect sizes). A limitation of existing cognitive training programs that may limit their
      efficacy is that each has employed a unifaceted approach. Each intervention program has
      targeted a single cognitive domain (e.g., working memory). This is problematic since as a
      group, children with ADHD have multiple areas of cognitive deficit (i.e., working memory,
      attention, response inhibition, delay aversion, intra-individual variability) and thus a
      unifaceted intervention does not address the multifaceted array of cognitive dysfunction in
      children with ADHD. Also, because individuals with ADHD each have unique patterns of
      cognitive deficits, a unifaceted cognitive training approach may target areas which are
      non-deficient and miss areas of significant deficit in individual patients depending on
      their ideographic cognitive profile. The primary goal of the proposed research is to develop
      and test a multifaceted cognitive training intervention that addresses a comprehensive array
      of ADHD-related cognitive deficits thereby ensuring that children's unique areas of
      cognitive deficit are targeted. During Phase I (R21 grant), software and a manual will be
      developed consisting of four training tasks targeting response inhibition, verbal working
      memory, attention, and delay aversion. Each task will possess advancing levels of
      difficulty. On each task, children will receive feedback on performance accuracy as well as
      on intra-individual variability in reaction times. The software will be pilot tested in
      Phase I to determine performance thresholds and intervention duration. Also, focus groups
      will be conducted to obtain patient perceptions of each task's difficulty and interest
      level. In Phase II (R33 grant), a preliminary randomized clinical trial will be conducted in
      order to obtain initial estimates of treatment efficacy. Pre-, post-, and follow up outcomes
      will be collected on a wide range of neuropsychological, behavioral, and academic measures.
      Effect size estimates across outcomes will be used to guide sample size determinations for
      future clinical trials of multifaceted cognitive training.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Consent: The family must provide signature of informed consent by parents or legal
             guardians.

          -  Age at time of Screening: 7 to 12 years of age, inclusive.

          -  Gender: includes male and female children.

          -  ADHD Diagnostic Status: ADHD patients must meet DSM-IV criteria for ADHD-PIT or
             ADHD-CT subtype. Section D.4 below describes in detail the diagnostic process for
             arriving at diagnosis.

          -  Cognitive Functioning: IQ of greater than 80 as estimated by the Wechsler
             Intelligence Scale for Children Fourth Edition.

          -  Learning Disability: Children must score 75 or above on two of the Wechsler
             Individual Achievement Test (WIAT) subtests (Reading &amp; Numerical Operations).

          -  School: Children must be enrolled in a school setting from which teacher ratings can
             be obtained.

          -  History of Psychiatric Medications: Children may be taking psychiatric medications.
             However, they must present with significant ADHD inattention symptoms while on
             medication in order to be included in the study. We will ask that children on ADHD
             medications to refrain from altering the dosage for 10 weeks from study enrollment to
             after the immediate post-intervention follow-up. In order to screen for possible
             medication adjustments, all parents will be asked during the initial phone screen if
             their child is on an ADHD medication and if they anticipate a change in that
             medication dosage. If they answer that they anticipate a dosage change, they will be
             excluded from the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Understanding Level. The patient and parent cannot understand or follow instructions
             given in the study.

          -  Exclusionary Psychiatric Conditions: Children who meet diagnostic criteria on the
             K-SADS for OCD, any psychotic disorder, major depressive disorder or bipolar disorder
             will be excluded from participation.

          -  Developmental Disabilities. Patients will be excluded if they are deemed to be
             significantly developmentally delayed or have a pervasive developmental disorder.
             Developmental delay will be operationally defined as an IQ score below 80. Children
             scoring 80 or above will be included. A semi-structured interview, the CAARTE, will
             be used to screen for autism.
