  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the persistence of the vaccine induced immune
      responses at Month 48 (Year 4) and Month 60 (Year 5) in healthy subjects who received 3
      doses of GSK Biologicals' candidate CMV vaccine according to a 0-1-6 month schedule during
      the primary study 108890 (NCT00435396) (vaccine group). The immune response to CMV infection
      in naturally infected subjects who participated in the screening visit of the primary study
      108890 (NCT00435396) and who were tested CMV-seropositive, will be used as a reference value
      (seropositive reference group). In addition, this study will continue to assess the
      occurrence of CMV infections as well as the continued development and validation of
      read-outs in the CMV project.

      The primary vaccination phase and Year 2 follow-up were posted as a separate protocol
      posting (NCT00435396).

      During the long-term follow-up study, all subjects who received 3 doses of GSK Biologicals'
      candidate CMV vaccine according to a 0-1-6 month schedule during the primary study 108890
      (NCT00435396) will be invited to participate at Visit 8 (Year 4) and Visit 9 (Year 5) as the
      vaccine group. In addition, the healthy subjects who participated in the screening visit of
      the primary study 108890 (NCT00435396) and who were tested CMV-seropositive will be invited
      to Visit 9 (Year 5) of this study as the seropositive reference group.This Protocol Posting
      has been updated following Protocol Amendment 1, March 2012, leading to the update of brief
      summary, intervention model, enrolment, outcome measures, eligibility and arms.

             20mg/day, or equivalent. Inhaled and topical steroids are allowed.

          -  Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within three months
             preceding study visit(s).

          -  Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, based on
             medical history and physical examination (no laboratory testing required).

        For subjects in the vaccine group, the following exclusion criterion should be checked in
        addition:

        • Administration of any additional CMV vaccine since end of primary study 108890
        (NCT00435396).

        For subjects in the seropositive reference group, the following exclusion criterion should
        be checked in addition:

        • Administration of any CMV vaccine since the screening visit of primary study 108890
