      The purpose of this study is to conduct a randomized controlled trial that examines how a
      family based, community centered intervention effects early childhood BMI trajectories.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Increases in sedentary lifestyle and high calorie food consumption, among other factors,
      have contributed to epidemic levels of childhood obesity in the US. Children who are
      overweight during the preschool period are more likely to become overweight adolescents and
      obese adults. Food preferences and activity habits set in early childhood can profoundly
      influence lifelong trajectories for Body Mass Index (BMI) and health. Specifically, rapid
      BMI gain in early childhood has been established to affect adulthood mortality and
      morbidity. Unfortunately, the longer such unhealthy patters are in place, the more difficult
      it can be to reverse them. Therefore, healthy lifestyle interventions targeted at children
      as early as preschool have enormous potential to affect lifelong health. Furthermore,
      nutrition and activity patterns are determined not only at the child level, but within the
      family and the community.

      This study will assess the impact of a family-based and community centered multilevel
      behavioral intervention addressing nutrition and physical activity with high risk
      parent-preschool children dyads to promote pediatric obesity prevention. The 7 year study
      will follow 600 parent preschool child dyads, half of whom will be randomized into the
      intervention condition which will utilize a health literate approach, build new social
      networks, utilize behavior modification tools including goal setting, self monitoring, and
      problem solving, and create behavior-environmental synergy with cues to action for use of
      the built environment for healthy behaviors. Both the intervention and control group
      (separately) will receive the control condition in which parent-child dyads will receive a
      literacy promotion/school success curriculum.

      The primary outcome of interest will be early childhood BMI trajectories measured at
      multiple time points over the three year RCT. Additional measures collected throughout the
      study from children and parents will include: tricep skin fold, waist circumference,
      actigraphy, 3-day diet recalls, questionnaires, social network data, and saliva to assess a
      genetics/epigenetics associated with obesity. Consistent with a multilevel systems approach,
      the investigators will develop and assess policy changes around obesity prevention.
      Moreover, working with the study's community partners, the investigators will evaluate how
      this approach affects local policy.
