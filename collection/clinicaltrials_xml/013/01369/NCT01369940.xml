      Background:

      -Normal growth and development of twins are important for a healthy pregnancy and the
      long-term health of the children. This study will look at how twins grow and develop inside
      the womb. This knowledge may reduce and/or prevent pregnancy and newborn health problems in
      the future.

      Objective:

      -To describe how twins grow.

      To describe how identical (from the same egg) and fraternal (from different eggs) twins
      grow.

        -  To compare growth patterns between twin and single pregnancies.

        -  To find out how many babies have growth problems and why they have them.

      Eligibility:

      -Women from nine U.S. clinical centers who are in the first three months of a twin
      pregnancy.

      Design:

        -  Participants will answer questions about personal characteristics (age, education,
           race). They will also answer questions about pregnancy history, health behavior, and
           their environment. This will take about 30 minutes. They will also fill out a
           questionnaire about physical activity, and mood and depression. An ultrasound will be
           done to check on the babies measurements.

        -  Participants will return for six visits during their pregnancy. Each follow-up will
           include an ultrasound and a test to measure the length of the cervix. We will ask
           questions about health and any events or symptoms since the visit before. We will also
           take body measurements.

        -  A nutrition questionnaire will be completed at the first visit and at follow-up visits
           2 and 5.

        -  Blood will be drawn at the beginning of the study, at three follow-up visits, and just
           before delivery.

        -  When the babies are born, they will have placenta and cord blood samples, measurements,
           and swabs from the inside of the mouth.

      Fetal growth is an important determinant of health and disease in the perinatal period,
      childhood and adult life. NICHD is conducting an ultrasound study in singleton pregnancies
      to establish a national standard for normal fetal growth by gestation and interval
      velocities. Twins represent 3.2% of all births in the U.S, and these pregnancies are at
      increased risk for fetal growth disorders, preterm and, most importantly, very preterm
      delivery. The rate of small-for-gestational-age (SGA) defined as below the 10th percentile
      using a singleton birth weight-for-gestational-age reference is 35%. Neonatal morbidity is
      higher in twin gestations than in singletons (25.6 versus 4 per 1,000), and the infant
      mortality rate is also higher (31 versus 6.4 per 1,000). Discrepancy in the sizes of twins
      at birth is a frequent phenomenon, and is associated with an increased risk of perinatal
      morbidity and mortality.

      The trajectory of fetal growth in twins throughout gestation has been observed and described
      in a few studies, both using ultrasonography and ultrasonography combined with birth weight.
      The findings suggest a slowing of growth for almost all twins after 28-30 weeks gestation,
      and even twins who had been growing at rates similar to singletons before 28 weeks may show
      slowed rates of growth in the third trimester. It has been hypothesized that this pattern of
      growth for even well-growing twins is a normal down-regulation in response to a constricted
      uterine environment and may underscore the need for a birth weight-for-gestational-age or
      ultrasound reference that is specific for twins. As for singleton births, however, such
      slow-downs later in pregnancy appear to be associated with earlier delivery and a greater
      risk for morbidity associated with preterm birth. This would argue against a separate
      reference for twins or, at least, for the development of a growth velocity standard for
      singletons and twins to allow for the accurate assessment of interval growth to better
      manage these cases.

      We propose to conduct the NICHD Fetal Growth Study Twin Gestations, which is a prospective
      cohort study with longitudinal measurement of fetal growth conducted in nine clinical
      centers. Overall, there are four main research objectives: 1) to describe fetal growth
      trajectories in twins using two- and selected three-dimensional ultrasound measures; 2) to
      compare and contrast fetal growth trajectories for twins with the newly established fetal
      growth standard developed for singletons to determine its applicability for monitoring the
      growth of twin fetuses and discordant growth of the pair; 3) to estimate the incidence of
      growth restriction (with SGA as a proxy) in singleton and twin gestations (by zygosity),
      however, growth restriction may be defined by the new growth standard; and 4) to compare
      singleton and twin gestations with respect to maternal biomarkers of fetal growth,
      well-being and maternal nutritional status using banked biospecimens to determine if the
      biomarkers ranges established for singletons are applicable to twin gestations.

      This study will recruit 350 pregnant women with a twin gestation from nine clinical centers.
      The study is designed to enroll approximately 350 dichorionic twin pairs based upon
      incidence figures for twinning at the population level. Women will be recruited during the
      first trimester and followed until delivery. Serial ultrasound assessments of fetal growth
      are the standard of care for twin pregnancies, and we will coordinate the timing of research
      ultrasounds to the fullest extent possible with clinical scans to minimize exposure as
      further described in this protocol. Each woman will have seven scheduled ultrasound
      examinations, including fetal biometry at all visits, fetal Doppler studies, and four blood
      draws at baseline and at targeted gestational ages for the eventual identification of
      biomarkers indicative of fetal growth. After delivery, neonatal anthropometric measures will
      be assessed for each twin, and select information about the obstetrical course and newborn
      status will be abstracted from medical charts.
