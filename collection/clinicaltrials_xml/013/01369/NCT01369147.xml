  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Protein and/or energy deficits are associated with increased rates of hospital infection,
      skeletal muscle weakness, impaired wound healing, and prolonged convalescence in ICU
      patients. To prevent or treat malnutrition, enteral nutrition (EN) and/or parenteral
      nutrition (PN) are routinely given worldwide to a significant proportion of ICU patients.
      Optimal caloric requirements in critically ill patients are unknown due to a lack of
      rigorous randomized clinical trials. The comparative efficacy of energy doses in critically
      ill patients is unknown and clinical recommendations are conflicting and controversial; this
      issue is the focus of our study.

      The investigators have designed this pilot, single-center Randomized Clinical Trial (RCT) to
      prospectively compare, for the first time, the clinical efficacy of different energy doses
      in ICU patients requiring PN due to intestinal failure/dysfunction. A total of 60 patients
      will be studied (20 per energy dose group) to generate critical preliminary data needed to
      inform subsequent appropriately powered Phase III multicenter trials.

      The primary aim of this study is to perform a controlled, double-blind, prospective,
      randomized, intent-to-treat Phase II clinical trial to test the efficacy of three specific
      energy doses [0.6, 1.0 and 1.3 x measured REE (resting energy expenditure), respectively],
      given for 28 consecutive days during the ICU and post-ICU course, on 28-day total
      hospital-acquired infections (primary endpoint), Blood Stream Infections ( BSI), and other
      important clinical outcomes in medical/surgical ICU patients requiring specialized
      parenteral ± enteral feeding. The investigators would also determine, in these subjects A)
      the impact of cumulative and mean daily 28-day energy deficits [energy intake-measured REE]
      on clinical outcome endpoints; and B) the practical utility of estimated REE determined by
      Harris-Benedict equation versus measured REE across different energy doses. The
      investigators would also like to determine the impact of administered energy dose and energy
      deficits on global metabolomic patterns over time and their association with key clinical
      outcomes.

      This study will allow us to generate needed data on the effect of energy dose and energy
      deficits on global metabolomic patterns over time that may be associated with key clinical
      outcomes in ICU patients. This exploratory research is also needed to develop new methods
      that evaluate the metabolic responses to nutrition support and their potential relationships
      to clinical outcomes.

    <description>Daily energy deficit will be calculated by subtracting the calculated mean daily Measured Resting Energy Expenditure (using a metabolic cart) during each study week from the actual daily energy intake ( per subject nutrition intake records). We will compare the daily 28 day energy deficits for each of the three study groups to determine how they relate to the nosocomial infection incidence rates</description>
