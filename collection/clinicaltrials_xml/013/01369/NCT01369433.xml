      Open-label, multi-center, multi-national rollover study to allow continued access to
      tivozanib for subjects who have participated in other tivozanib (monotherapy or combination)
      protocols. Eligible subjects will continue to receive tivozanib at the same dose and
      schedule as per the original (parent) protocol. The length of time that a subject must be on
      the parent protocol before rolling over to this protocol will be dictated by the (original)
      parent protocol. Subjects will be seen by the investigator every 4 weeks (± 5 days). Adverse
      events and blood pressure will be recorded. At the beginning of Cycle 1 and at the beginning
      of every odd-numbered cycle (Cycle 3, Cycle 5, etc), clinical laboratory values will be
      recorded. CT scans to assess disease will be performed at the end of even-numbered cycles
      (Cycle 2, Cycle 4, etc).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label multi-center, multi-national rollover protocol to allow continued
      access to tivozanib for subjects who have participated in other tivozanib (monotherapy or
      combination) protocols, who are tolerating study drug, and displaying clinical benefit.

      Enrollment to this protocol will remain open to subjects who participate in current and
      future protocols with tivozanib. The end of the study is the last treatment visit of the
      last subject at the last site. Enrollment in this protocol will continue until tivozanib
      becomes commercially available in the country where the subject is being treated. If a
      subject is experiencing clinical benefit from tivozanib when the study is discontinued, the
      sponsor will make every effort to assist the subject in obtaining commercially available
      tivozanib.

      This rollover protocol will be open to eligible subjects on current and future protocols
      with tivozanib. The number of subjects who will enroll is dependent upon the number of
      subjects enrolled in tivozanib protocols that tolerate the drug, display clinical benefits,
      and are willing to participate.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The subject must have received tivozanib while enrolled in another protocol, must be
             tolerating study drug and must currently display clinical benefit. The length of time
             that a subject must be on the parent protocol before rolling over to this protocol
             will be dictated by the parent protocol.

          2. If female and of childbearing potential, documentation of negative pregnancy test
             prior to enrollment.

          3. Ability to give written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. &gt; 4 weeks since discontinuation of tivozanib treatment on a previous protocol

          2. If female, pregnant or lactating

          3. Sexually active male and pre-menopausal female subjects (and their partners) unless
             they agree to use adequate contraceptive measures, while on study and for 30 days
             after the last dose of study drug. All fertile male and female subjects (and their
             partners) must agree to use a highly effective method of contraception. Highly
             effective birth control includes (a) IUD plus one barrier method; or (b) 2 barrier
             methods. Effective barrier methods are male or female condoms, diaphragms, and
             spermicides (creams or gels that contain a chemical to kill sperm). (Note: Oral,
             implantable, or injectable contraceptives may be affected by cytochrome P450
             interactions, and are not considered effective for this study.)

          4. Uncontrolled hypertension: systolic blood pressure &gt; 140 mmHg or diastolic blood
             pressure &gt;90 mmHg on 2 or more antihypertensive medications, documented on 2
             consecutive measurements taken at least 24 hours apart.

          5. Newly identified CNS malignancies or documented progression of CNS metastases;
             subjects will be allowed only if the CNS metastases have been adequately treated with
             radiotherapy or surgery. For subjects receiving steroid therapy please refer to
             Section 6.3 for allowed steroid maintenance therapy.

          6. Unhealed wounds (including active peptic ulcers)

          9. Psychiatric disorder, altered mental status precluding informed consent or necessary
             testing

         10. Inability to comply with protocol requirements
