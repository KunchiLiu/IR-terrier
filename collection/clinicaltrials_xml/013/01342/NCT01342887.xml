      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of etoposide and mitoxantrone
      hydrochloride when given together with cyclosporine and pravastatin sodium and to see how
      well they work in treating patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia
      (AML). Cyclosporine may inhibit efflux of cancer drugs out of cancer cells and may thereby
      improve chemotherapy treatment for AML. Pravastatin sodium may stop the growth of cancer
      cells by blocking some of the nutrients needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy,
      such as etoposide and mitoxantrone hydrochloride, work in different ways to stop the growth
      of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving
      cyclosporine together with pravastatin sodium, etoposide, and mitoxantrone hydrochloride may
      kill more cancer cells

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the maximum tolerated doses of mitoxantrone (mitoxantrone hydrochloride) and
      etoposide in combination with pravastatin (pravastatin sodium) and cyclosporine.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Describe the complete remission (CR)/CR with incomplete peripheral blood count recovery
      (CRi) rate after up to 2 cycles of induction therapy.

      II. Describe the disease-free survival of patients that achieve CR/CRi. III. Estimate the
      frequency and severity of regimen-associated toxicities, along with 28-day mortality after
      start of study treatment.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I/II, dose-escalation study of etoposide and mitoxantrone
      hydrochloride in combination with pravastatin sodium and cyclosporine.

      Patients receive cyclosporine intravenously (IV) continuously on days 5-9. Patients also
      receive pravastatin sodium orally (PO) every 6 hours on days 1-10, etoposide IV continuously
      on days 5-9, and mitoxantrone hydrochloride IV continuously on days 5-9. Treatment repeats
      for up to 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients
      achieving CR/CRi may receive 2 additional courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 1 month.
