    <textblock>
      This Phase I, multicenter, first in human, open-label, dose escalation study will evaluate
      the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of atezolizumab (MPDL3280A) administered as
      single agent by intravenous (IV) infusion every three weeks (q3w) to participants with
      locally advanced or metastatic solid malignancies or hematologic malignancies. The study
      will be conducted in two cohorts: Dose-escalation cohort and Expansion cohort.
