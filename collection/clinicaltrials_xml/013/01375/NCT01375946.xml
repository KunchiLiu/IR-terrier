    <textblock>
      A study to evaluate pharmacokinetic profile, wearability and safety of AG200-15, transdermal
      delivery of levonorgestrel (LNG) and ethinyl estradiol (EE), under normal conditions and
      external conditions of heat, humidity, cold water and exercise.

    <textblock>
      Normal conditions - average daily living activities, Dry Sauna - 10 minutes at 168.8 - 179.6
      degrees Fahrenheit, Whirlpool - 10 minutes at 102.2 - 105.8 degrees Fahrenheit, Treadmill -
      20 - 30 minutes at 60-80% max heart rate, Cold Water - 5 - 15 minutes at 71.6 degrees
      Fahrenheit.

      There will be three treatment periods. Subjects will be randomly assigned to one of the five
      conditions for the treatment period. The subject will be exposed daily to the condition
      assigned while wearing the patch. The study patch will be worn for a 7 day treatment period,
      followed by a 7 day washout period. The total duration of the study is 6 weeks.
