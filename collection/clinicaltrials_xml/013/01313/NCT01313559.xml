  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label randomized phase II study for prostate cancer patients who have
      disease progression after hormonal therapy. SOM230 LAR (Pasireotide) binds to its receptor
      of prostate cancer cells and can prevent them from growing. Everolimus works by targeting a
      cell survival factor in prostate cancer. The combination of these drugs may work better for
      the treatment of prostate cancer without toxic chemotherapy. Patients will receive either
      SOM230 LAR (group A) or SOM230 LAR in combination with Everolimus (group B).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer cells typically have neuroendocrine (NE) differentiation features after they
      become resistant to hormonal therapy. Somatostatin (SST - a peptide hormone) receptors
      (SSTR) are usually expressed in a high level in these advanced prostate cancer cells. When
      SSTR is activated pharmacologically by drugs similar to SST, prostate cancer cell growth is
      inhibited. SOM230 is a new agent which can activate SSTR and block other key survival
      molecules/pathways such as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3K), mitogen-activated protein
      (MAP) kinases (MAPK) signaling pathways. Thus SOM230 itself has anticancer activity for
      prostate cancer.

      It is also well known that hormonal refractory prostate cancer can grow in an environment of
      very low male hormone level because of the activation of several non-androgen receptor
      survival pathways. One key survival pathway is mediated by an important molecule called
      mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Drugs, such as Everolimus, have anticancer activity in
      prostate cancer pre-clinically, but do not sustain its activity. The reason was that cancer
      cells can up-regulate other survival pathways such as PI3K, MAPK, thus bypass mTOR.

      It is hypothesized that SOM230 not only have anti-tumor effect in prostate cancer directly,
      but also can block the up-regulated (feed-back loop), alternative PI3K or MAPK survival
      pathways induced by mTOR inhibitors.

      The goal of this study is to develop a new well tolerated therapy that can be offered to
      prostate cancer patients prior to receiving chemotherapy.
