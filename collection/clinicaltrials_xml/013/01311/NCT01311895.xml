      The purpose of this study is to compare two opioid protocols (&quot;H2O&quot; and &quot;1+1&quot;) for the
      treatment of acute severe pain in the emergency department. The investigators primary
      hypothesis is that the &quot;H2O&quot; protocol will be more efficacious than the &quot;1+1&quot; protocol in
      Emergency Department patients aged 21-64 years. The primary outcome is the proportion of
      patients in each arm who choose to forgo additional pain medication at 60 minutes.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age greater than 21 years and less than 65 years: This is a study of non-elderly
             adult patients. In addition, patients aged 21 years and younger are automatically
             triaged to the Children's ED.

          2. Pain with onset within 7 days: Pain within seven days is the definition of acute pain
             that has been used in ED literature.

          3. ED attending physician's judgment that patient's pain warrants IV opioids

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Use of other opioids or tramadol within past 24 hours: to avoid introducing assembly
             bias related to recent opioid use, since this may affect baseline levels of pain and
             need for analgesics.

          2. Prior adverse reaction to opioids.

          3. Chronic pain syndrome: frequently recurrent or daily pain for at least 3 months
             results in modulation of pain perception which is thought to be due to
             down-regulation of pain receptors. Examples of chronic pain syndromes include sickle
             cell anemia, osteoarthritis, fibromyalgia, and peripheral neuropathies.

          4. Alcohol intoxication: the presence of alcohol intoxication as judged by the treating
             physician may alter pain perception.

          5. SBP &lt;90 mm Hg: Opioids can produce peripheral vasodilation that may result in
             orthostatic hypotension.

          6. Oxygen saturation &lt; 95% on room air: For this study, oxygen saturation must be 95% or
             above on room air in order to be enrolled.

          7. Use of MAO inhibitors in past 30 days: MAO inhibitors have been reported to intensify
             the effects of at least one opioid drug causing anxiety, confusion and significant
             respiratory depression or coma.

          8. C02 measurement greater than 46: In accordance with standard protocol, three subsets
             of patients will have their CO2 measured using a handheld capnometer prior to
             enrollment in the study. If the CO2 measurement is greater than 46 then the patient
             will be excluded from the study. The 3 subsets are as follows:

               -  All patients who have a history of COPD

               -  All patients who report a history of asthma together with greater than a 20
                  pack-year smoking history

               -  All patients reporting less than a 20 pack-year smoking history who are having
                  an asthma exacerbation
