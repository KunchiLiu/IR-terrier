    <textblock>
      This randomized trial will evaluate whether varenicline directly observed therapy provided
      at a methadone clinic is more efficacious than self-administered varenicline for promoting
      smoking cessation and enhancing adherence.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is a marked prevalence of tobacco use and tobacco-related disease among methadone
      maintenance patients. Varenicline's demonstrated efficacy may not be generalizable to
      methadone maintained smokers because of poor adherence, which is highly prevalent among drug
      users. Adherence to smoking cessation medication is strongly associated with cessation, and
      is one of the few factors shown to increase cessation among methadone maintained smokers,
      but strategies to promote smoking cessation medication adherence have not been evaluated in
      methadone patients. Based on the Information, Motivation, and Behavior model, the
      investigators plan a directly observed therapy (DOT)-based intervention targeting behavioral
      skills necessary for optimal adherence. Because methadone clinic-based DOT interventions
      have been shown to improve medication adherence and clinical outcomes in HIV and TB, the
      investigators plan to determine in a randomized trial whether DOT varenicline provided at a
      methadone clinic is more efficacious than self-administered varenicline for promoting
      smoking cessation and enhancing adherence. The investigators will also evaluate moderating
      effects of drug and alcohol use and psychiatric symptoms on DOT effects. The investigators
      hypothesize subjects in the mDOT arm will have greater 7 day point prevalence abstinence at
      12 weeks, reduction in cigarettes/day, time to first daily cigarette, ≥ 24 hour quit
      attempts, and 7 day point prevalence abstinence at 24 weeks compared to subjects receiving
      self administered varenicline. The investigators also hypothesize that adherence in the mDOT
      arm will be higher than in the TAU arm. Lastly the investigators hypothesize that ongoing
      illicit drug use and psychiatric symptoms will moderate the effect of mDOT on adherence.
