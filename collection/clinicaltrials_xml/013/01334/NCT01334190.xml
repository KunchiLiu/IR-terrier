      This will be a non-comparative prospective observational study of women using Zarin as a
      primary method of contraception in Kenya. It will be conducted in close collaboration with
      the Kenya MoH in several MoH-affiliated clinics that have experience with implants and
      sufficient expected flow of implant users per month. The investigators will enroll a total
      of 600 women divided into two cohorts in this one-year prospective study:

        -  a prospective cohort consisting of 300 women who will be followed-up 3 and 12 months
           after enrollment; and

        -  a surveillance cohort of 300 women who will report back to the clinic during 12 months
           after enrollment only if they have complications, medical problems, pregnancy, or want
           to remove the implant

      The main study outcomes are pregnancy, immediate and delayed complications associated with
      insertion or removal, adverse events, early discontinuation and reasons for discontinuation,
      and level of women's satisfaction with Zarin services.
