      Context

      The investigators recently demonstrated a highly significant increase in muscarinic receptor
      density in the myocardium of infants deceased from sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS)
      compared to those of infants deceased from identified causes 1. Muscarinic receptor
      overexpression was found in all SIDS samples studied to date. It was associated with an
      average increase in acetylcholinesterase activity, appearing as a compensatory mechanism to
      oppose the cardiac muscarinic receptor overexpression. Similar vago-cardiac abnormalities
      were detected in a rabbit model of vagal hyperreactivity that the investigators first
      described some years ago2. In these hyperreactive animals, expression of muscarinic
      receptors was also enhanced in blood white cells. Noticeably, the pattern of changes in
      these cells paralleled the pattern of changes in the heart. Thus, muscarinic abnormalities
      in cardiac tissues could be inferred with high confidence from those measured in
      lymphocytes.This was the first report of a vago-cardiac abnormality in sudden infant death
      syndrome. The investigators findings also provided original and important perspectives for
      the identification and therapeutic management of infants at risk of sudden death. As such,
      the publication of the investigators work raised a major interest from the population and
      from the scientific and medical communities, in particular cardio-pediatricians.
      ObjectivesThe objective of the present clinical project is to validate, in human
      lymphocytes, muscarinic receptor expression level (assessed by quantitative RT-PCR) as a
      circulating biomarker of autonomic nervous system dysfunction and more specifically, of
      vagal hyperactivity and of risk of sudden death. The project will include 2 major items,
      conducted in parallel:1. evaluation of the muscarinic receptor expression in lymphocytes
      from adults with vagal syncopes (n=60 patients from an existing file versus 60 controls)
      (Cardiology unit + Clinical Investigation Centre (CIC) + Laboratory of Neurobiology and
      Cardiovascular Pharmacology); 2. evaluation of the muscarinic receptor expression in
      lymphocytes from children with vagal syncopes (n=60 versus 60 controls) (Pediatry unit +
      Clinical Investigation Centre + Laboratory of Neurobiology and Cardiovascular
      Pharmacology).PerspectivesThis project represents the first step of validation of a
      circulating marker of vagal hyperactivity and of risk of SIDS in human. Once this step is
      completed, the investigators will start with the prospective study &quot; muscarinic receptor
      expression in lymphocytes and SIDS &quot; (cord blood collected at birth and follow up of the
      new-borns) (Maternity ward + CIC + Laboratory of Neurobiology and Cardiovascular
      Pharmacology). Then therapeutic preventive management becomes a realistic objective. A
      therapeutic clinical study will then be started with atropinic drugs, in order to test their
      potential protective action against sudden death. The final objective of the investigators
      research is the prevention of SIDS through i) identification - as soon as birth - of
      new-borns at high risk and ii) appropriate prophylactic therapy. The investigators work also
      opens exciting perspectives in the field of the still poorly understood vagal disorders in
      children and adults such as vagal pauses.1 Livolsi et coll, Plos One 5, e9464, 2010 ; 2
