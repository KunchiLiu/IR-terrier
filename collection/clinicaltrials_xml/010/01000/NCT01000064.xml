  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate whether Vyvanse, a psychostimulant, can
      help with attention deficits due to traumatic brain injury (TBI). Vyvanse is currently
      approved for the treatment of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity (ADHD). The exact effects this
      drug may have on attention deficits caused by TBI are not known, but we expect that Vyvanse
      will be of some help in treating those types of problems as well. The study will utilize
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) methods, as well as neurobehavioral measures,
      to elucidate neural mechanisms of response.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Symptoms of inattentiveness, impulsivity, and poor persistence have been observed in both
      children and adults following traumatic brain injury (TBI). These often are among the most
      prominent symptoms manifested and may contribute to interference in a variety of other
      functional domains. Although there has been some use of psychostimulant medication to treat
      TBI-acquired attention deficits, it remains a relatively uncommon clinical practice. This
      study, by highlighting mechanisms of action, could serve to promote the appropriate use of
      this type of treatment for the patients.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Males and females, ages 16 to 45

             estimated posttraumatic amnesia, etc.)

          -  Sustained 6 to 36 months earlier, and considered to be neurologically stable

          -  Persistent (&gt; 6 months) problems with focused or sustained attention (+1 SD or worse
             on Inattention component of ADHD self ratings) corroborated by professional staff
             (nurses, therapists, etc.) or caregivers. Problems with attention/concentration rated
             as among most prominent cognitive changes.

          -  Accompanying features may include diminished arousal/speed/stamina and/or
             disinhibited symptoms

        Exclusion Criteria:
