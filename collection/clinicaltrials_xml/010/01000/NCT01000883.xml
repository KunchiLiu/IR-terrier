      RATIONALE: Studying samples of tumor tissue and blood from patients with cancer in the
      laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify
      biomarkers related to cancer. It may also help doctors predict how patients will respond to
      treatment.

      PURPOSE: This research study is looking at tissue and blood samples from women with locally
      advanced or metastatic breast cancer

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Collect , catalogue, and store biological specimens from patients with locally advanced
           or metastatic breast cancer

        -  To collect clinical data from these patients containing identifiers, demographics,
           epidemiologic review, clinical evaluation, treatment, and long-term follow-up.

        -  To provide an efficient bi-directional flow of clinical information and specimens
           between laboratory and clinical scientists in order to foster innovative translational
           research.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients undergo core biopsy and blood sampling at diagnosis, between chemotherapy regimens,
      and prior to definitive surgery. Tumor markers are assessed using immunohistochemistry and
      flow cytometry.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 500 patients will be accrued for this study.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS:

        PATIENT ELIGIBILITY

        Inclusion Criteria

          -  Histologically proven metastatic breast cancer with measurable or evaluable disease
             per investigator discretion.

          -  Patients must be 18 years of age or older. Women of child bearing potential must be
             practicing barrier or oral contraception for the duration of the study, or documented
             as surgically sterile or one year post-menopausal.

          -  ECOG performance status 0-2

          -  Cardiac function by MUGA with an EF &gt; 45% or an echocardiogram that shows normal LV
             function.

          -  Serum Creatinine &lt; 2.0 mg/dl.

          -  Hepatic transaminases (alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase
             (AST)) ≤3.0 times the upper limit of normal if no liver metastases or ≤5 times the
             upper limit of normal if liver metastases are present.

          -  Bilirubin no more than 2X normal.

          -  Seronegative for HIV.

          -  Negative for Hepatitis B surface antigen.

          -  Signed and dated informed consent.

          -  HLA A0201+ by DNA genotyping.

          -  Absolute neutrophil count greater than 1,500/mm3. Platelet count greater 100,000/mm3
             and hemoglobin greater than or equal to 10

          -  3+ expression of HER-2/neu from original pathology (diagnostic) tumor sample by IHC
             or 2+ expression by IHC with gene amplification by FISH.

          -  Patients will be eligible even if they have failed treatment for metastatic breast
             cancer with trastuzumab and a chemotherapy agent other than vinorelbine or if they
             have progressed within 12 months of receiving adjuvant chemotherapy using trastuzumab
             and a taxane.

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  Patients with any serious medical, cardiac, or psychiatric condition which, in the
             opinion of the investigator, would make the patient unsuitable for study
             participation or would impede probable compliance with the protocol.

          -  Patients with central nervous system metastases must have stable disease for at least
             3 months prior to study entry.

          -  Patient is currently taking steroid medications. Systemic steroid treatment is not
             allowed.

             eligible for therapy.

          -  Patient has received hormonal or cytotoxic chemotherapy within 14 days of apheresis
             and within 28-30 days prior to study treatment.
