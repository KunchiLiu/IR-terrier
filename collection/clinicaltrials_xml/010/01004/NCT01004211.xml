  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To date, fluorescence and narrow band imaging cystoscopy have been tested in many
      prospective within patient trials but only as an &quot;add on&quot; procedure. This results in a bias
      that does not allow to determine the real impact of such innovative technologies on bladder
      cancer management. Hereby we propose the first prospective randomized trial which compares
      narrow band imaging trans urethral resection as a stand alone procedure versus white light
      transurethral resection. The primary end point is to assess the recurrence rate of bladder
      cancer lesions with each treatment modality. The study is designed to disclose an inferior
      recurrence rate (estimated 10%) in the group treated by narrow band imaging transurethral
      resection respect to the control group, treated by standard transurethral resection.

    <description>The system will be switched to narrow band imaging by simply pushing a button. Transurethral resection and/or cold cup biopsies of all visible lesions known or suspected to be bladder cancer will be performed; 6 random cold cup biopsies from healthy mucosa of bladder trigone, anterior, posterior and lateral walls will be taken in case of a second transurethral resection of newly diagnosed high grade non muscle invasive bladder cancer or of recurrent high grade non muscle invasive bladder cancer.</description>
