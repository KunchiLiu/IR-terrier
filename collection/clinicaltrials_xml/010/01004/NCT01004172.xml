  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine how well the combination of bevacizumab
      and carboplatin works in treating breast cancer that has spread to the brain. Bevacizumab is
      an antibody (a protein that attacks a foreign substance in the body) that is made in the
      laboratory. Bevacizumab works differently from the way chemotherapy drugs work. Usually
      chemotherapy drugs attack fast growing cancer cells in the body. Bevacizumab works to slow
      or stop the growth of cells in cancer tumors by decreasing the blood supply to the tumors.
      When the blood supply is decreased, the tumors don't get the oxygen and nutrients they need
      to grow. Carboplatin is in a class of drugs known as platinum-containing compounds and has
      been approved for use in the treatment of ovarian cancer. Information from other research
      studies suggests that the combination of bevacizumab with carboplatin may be effective in
      treating breast cancer.

      -  Participants will receive bevacizumab and carboplatin intravenously. In addition to
           bevacizumab and carboplatin, participants whose cancer is positive for HER2 will
           receive Herceptin intravenously. Herceptin is a standard treatment for patients with
           HER2-positive breast cancer.

        -  The first treatment cycle lasts four weeks. Participants will receive bevacizumab on
           Day 1 and carboplatin on Day 8. After the first treatment cycle, each treatment cycle
           thereafter lasts three weeks and participants will receive bevacizumab and carboplatin
           together on Day 1 of each cycle.

        -  Physical exams and vital signs will be performed and collected at multiple time points
           during the participants first treatment cycle and at the beginning of each cycle
           thereafter.

        -  Participants will have a brain MRI and MRA between days 2-4 of the first treatment
           cycle and again at the end of the second treatment cycle for research purposes only.
           These scans are mandatory and must be performed at the Massachusetts General
           Hospital-Charlestown Navy Yard facility. A brain MRI will be performed every other
           cycle after that (the end of cycles 2, 4, 6, 8, etc.). Participants will also have CT
           or MRI scans of their body at the enof of every other treatment cycle.

        -  MUGA or ECHO scans will be done every 4 treatment cycles.

        -  Participants will have blood tests done on Day 8 of the first treatment cycle and at
           the beginning of every treatment cycle thereafter to check blood cell counts and how
           well their organs are functioning.

        -  A urine test will be done every other cycle (at the beginning of cycles 3, 5, 7, etc.)
