    <textblock>
      Shared decision-making (SDM), in contrast to traditional medical decision-making, involves a
      collaborative process where patients discuss personal values and preferences and clinicians
      provide information to arrive at an agreed upon treatment decision. The proposed study will
      evaluate the impact of a brief SDM nursing intervention among elderly, depressed primary
      care patient subjects in comparison to physician recommended Usual Care. The focus of the
      SDM intervention is to empower depressed patients and help them arrive at a treatment
      decision that can be successfully carried out.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Shared Decision Making (SDM) may be particularly relevant for depressed individuals, as it
      seeks to enhance their autonomy and empowerment in a manner that directly addresses the
      helplessness and hopelessness associated with depression. Shared decision-making
      interventions are being developed for depression in primary care, but have yet to be
      adequately tested. It is also unknown whether the same premises regarding shared
      decision-making's ability to enhance autonomy and empowerment pertain to elderly
      populations.

      This randomized study will recruit elderly depressed primary care patient subjects and
      evaluate the impact of a three-session SDM nursing intervention on their (1) adherence to
      antidepressant medication or psychotherapy and on (2) their reduction in depressive
      symptoms. The comparison group will be physician-recommended Usual Care (UC). The focus of
      the SDM intervention is to empower elderly depressed primary care patients and help them
      efficiently arrive at a treatment decision that can be successfully implemented.

      The study randomizes physicians to provide their depressed patients with SDM or UC. A total
      of 210 elderly depressed patient subjects whose physicians recommend starting depression
      treatment, will receive either Shared Decision-Making (SDM) or the physician recommended
      Usual Care (UC) comparison condition. Participants will be assessed at baseline and at weeks
      4, 8, 12, and 24 to determine treatment adherence and depressive status. Nurses currently
      employed by the participating physicians will administer the SDM intervention.

    <description>Usual Care reflects the standard of care in primary care practice: following physician recommendation for treatment. Physicians will recommend some form of depression treatment. This may take the form of an antidepressant prescription or psychotherapy referral. The physician will encourage patients to telephone with any questions. Following the treatment recommendation provided to the patient, the physician will provide care as usual.</description>
