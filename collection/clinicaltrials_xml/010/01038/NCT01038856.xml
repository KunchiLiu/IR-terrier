  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the overall response rate to erlotinib
      in patients with polycythemia vera (PV). Response rate will be assessed by improvement in
      the complete blood count, ultrasound of the spleen, and JAK2 molecular status. It is
      purposed in this study to explore a possible molecular targeting of the driving mechanism of
      PV.

      This is a phase II open-label study. Patients will be screened for MPN diagnoses and
      patients with Polycythemia vera proven to have JAK2V617F mutation will be given the option
      to enroll. Consenting patients will take erlotinib daily for 16 weeks. Blood work and
      pharmacokinetics will be drawn for serum level monitoring. Doses will be administered
      according to side effects or held. First assessment will be at day 15 wth subsequent
      assessments at 28 day intervals. Non-responders will be taken off the study and managed
      according to standard of care. Patients who do respond will continue taking the therapy for
      a total of 12 months. Observation will be for a total of 12 months after finishing
      treatment. In addition to the clinical aspect of this study, there will be correlative
      studies where molecular response will be checked and its correlation with clinical response.
