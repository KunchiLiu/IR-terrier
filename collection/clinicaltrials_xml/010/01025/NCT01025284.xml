    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have histological or cytological evidence of extensive-disease small-cell lung cancer

          -  Have the presence of measurable disease as defined by the Response Evaluation
             Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1)

          -  Have received at least 1 prior chemotherapy regimen with agents known to provide
             clinical benefit for small-cell lung cancer and be, in the opinion of the
             investigator, an appropriate candidate for experimental therapy

          -  Have discontinued all previous therapies for cancer, including chemotherapy, biologic
             therapy, hormone therapy, or radiotherapy. Patients must have recovered from the
             acute effects of therapy (except alopecia and fatigue) before study enrollment

          -  Part A: Have a performance status of 0 to 2 on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
             scale

          -  Part B: Have a performance status of 0 to 1 on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
             scale

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have received treatment within 28 days of the first dose of LY2523355 with a drug
             that has not received regulatory approval for any indication

          -  Have a mixed histological diagnosis of small-cell lung cancer and non-small-cell lung
             cancer

          -  Have serious preexisting medical conditions that, in the opinion of the investigator,
             would preclude participation in this study

          -  Part A: Have symptomatic, untreated, or uncontrolled central nervous system (CNS)
             metastases. Patients with treated CNS metastases are eligible provided their disease
             is radiographically stable, asymptomatic, and corticosteroid use has been
             discontinued for at least 2 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug. Screening of
             asymptomatic patients without history of CNS metastases is not required

          -  Part B: Have symptomatic, untreated, or uncontrolled central nervous system (CNS)
             metastases or a history of CNS metastases. Patients who have received prophylactic
             radiation are not excluded. Screening of asymptomatic patients without history of CNS
             metastases is not required
