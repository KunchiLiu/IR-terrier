    <textblock>
      Randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, double-blind, multiple-dose, activity and
      safety clinical study of SRT2104 administered orally once daily for 28 consecutive days.
      This will be an inpatient/outpatient study to assess the safety and pharmacokinetics of
      SRT2104 in type 2 diabetic male and female subjects on an existing, stable, background
      metformin therapy. Approximately 80 subjects will be enrolled. Subjects will be evenly
      randomized to receive SRT2104 2.0 g/day or placebo in the fed state.

      Subjects will be required to stay overnight at the study center on Days -2, -1, 0, 1
      (optional discharge at investigator's discretion), 27, 28, 41, and 42. During these
      admissions, pharmacokinetic, biomarker and glycated albumin samples will be collected, and
      glucose profiling, OGTT, glucose stabilization, hyperinsulinemc euglycemic clamp (HEGC)
      studies with indirect calorimetry and various other safety and activity procedures will be
      performed. On Day 1 of the study, subjects will be randomized to receive SRT2104 or placebo.
      Day 43 will be the last day of the study and subjects will be released. In addition,
      subjects will be asked to return to the study center on Day 14 for interim safety
      assessments.

      During the dosing period, study personnel will contact subjects by telephone on Days 7 and
      21 to conduct a safety assessment. Subjects will be required to monitor their fasting blood
      glucose and complete a daily diary for the outpatient portion of the study between Days 1
      and 28. A follow-up, safety phone call will occur 30 days following their final dose of
      SRT2104 or placebo (Day 58 of the study) to identify any possible additional adverse events
      or concomitant medications.

      Randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, double-blind, multiple-dose, activity and
      safety clinical study of SRT2104 administered orally once daily for 28 consecutive days.
      This will be an inpatient/outpatient study to assess the safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) of
      SRT2104 in type 2 diabetic (T2D) male and female subjects on an existing, stable, background
      metformin therapy. Approximately 112 subjects aged 18-65 years, who fulfill the
      inclusion/exclusion criteria, will be screened for this study to enroll approximately 80
      subjects. Subjects will be evenly randomized to receive SRT2104 2.0 g/day or placebo
      approximately 15 minutes following consumption of a standardized morning meal. Subjects will
      remain on a fixed dose of test material for all dosing days in the study.

      Subjects will sign the informed consent form at the Screening Visit, and will undergo
      screening assessments to verify eligibility for the study. If eligible and willing to
      participate, subjects will return to the clinic within 21 days of the Screening Visit to
      participate in the pre-dosing phase of the study. On Day 1 of the study, subjects will be
      randomized to receive SRT2104 or placebo. Subjects will be required to stay overnight at the
      study center on Days -2, -1, 0, 1 (optional discharge at investigator's discretion), 27, 28,
      41, and 42 for testing, to assess safety, and to gather required biomarker samples. In
      addition, subjects will be asked to return to the study center on Day 14 for interim safety
      assessments. The subject will be telephoned on Days 7 and 21 to assess safety. Subjects will
      be required to monitor their fasting blood glucose and complete a daily diary for the
      outpatient portion of the study between Days 1 and 28. A follow-up, safety phone call will
      occur 30 days following their final dose of SRT2104 or placebo (Day 58 of the study) to
      identify any possible additional adverse events (AEs) or concomitant medications.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Able and willing to provide written informed consent to participate in the study

          -  Ambulatory male and female subjects (of any race) with T2D within the age range of
             18-65 years (inclusive) at the time of screening

          -  All female subjects must be of non-childbearing potential. All male subjects must
             agree with their partners to use double-barrier birth control or abstinence while
             participating in the study and for 12 weeks following the last dose of
             investigational product. For the purposes of this study, non-childbearing is defined
             as:

               -  Amenorrheic for at least 12 consecutive months; menopausal status in amenorrheic
                  females will be confirmed by demonstrating levels of follicle stimulating
                  hormone (FSH) &gt;40-138 mIU/mL and estradiol &lt; 30 pg/mL at entry. In the event a
                  subject's menopause status has been clearly established (for example, the
                  subject indicates she has been amenorrheic for 10 years), but FSH and/or
                  estradiol levels are not consistent with a post-menopausal condition,
                  determination of subject eligibility will be at the discretion of the principal
                  investigator with agreement of the independent medical monitor

               -  At least 6 weeks post-surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without
                  hysterectomy) or post tubal ligation

                  average QTc value of triplicate ECGs obtained over a brief period)

               -  QTcB must be &lt;480 msec in subjects with Bundle Branch Block

          -  Comprehension of the nature and purpose of the study and able to comply with the
             protocol requirements

             first dose of investigational product

          -  Use of any prescription drug therapy, with the exception of any prescription
             medication administered at a stable dose for at least 6 weeks prior to Screening,
