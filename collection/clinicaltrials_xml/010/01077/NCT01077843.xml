  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a descriptive study of a cohort of patients with ankylosing spondylitis and use of
      etoricoxib in this population. It also includes a nested case-control analysis (when greater
      than or equal to 700 events of a given type are available for analysis) that will estimate
      the odds of current exposure to etoricoxib, and to various other anti-inflammatory
      treatments, compared with non-exposure to any such treatments, for the clinical outcomes of
      interest in European patients with Ankylosing Spondylitis.

      The study population and follow-up time will be refreshed / added to annually, and the
      analysis re-run annually on a cumulative basis until 2017.
