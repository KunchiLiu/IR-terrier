      To demonstrate that Intrathecal Baclofen (ITB) Therapy, compared to Best Medical Treatment
      (BMT), has superior efficacy in the treatment of severe spasticity in adult post-stroke
      patients with generalized spastic hypertonia who have not reached their therapy goal with
      other treatment interventions assessed by a decrease in the average Ashworth Scale (AS)
      score in the lower extremities.

      This is a randomized, controlled open-label parallel group study to demonstrate the efficacy
      benefit of ITB Therapy over BMT in post-stroke patients with severe spasticity who have not
      reached their therapy goal with other treatment interventions.

      In order to evaluate the efficacy benefit of ITB Therapy over BMT in post-stroke patients, a
      two-arm parallel group design will be applied. Patients will be equally randomized to one of
      two treatment arms:

        1. ITB Therapy arm; or

        2. BMT arm

      The study consists of a run-in phase of 21 days for the BMT treatment arm and 2-25 days for
      the ITB Therapy treatment arm, followed by a 6 month active trial.

      The BMT treatment arm will receive a combination of oral antispastic medication and
      physiotherapy. Patients must be prescribed at least one or a combination of the following
      oral antispastic medications: oral baclofen, tizanidine, diazepam (or other benzodiazepines)
      or dantrolene. Following the run-in phase, patients will enter the 6 month active trial.

      The ITB Therapy treatment arm will receive a combination of ITB Therapy and physiotherapy.
      During the run-in phase, a test with intrathecal baclofen will be performed to evaluate the
      response of the patient. Patients fulfilling the test success criterium will be implanted
      with a Medtronic SynchroMed®II infusion system. Following implant, patients will enter into
      the 6 month active trial, which includes a 6 week titration phase, during which time oral
      antispastic medications must be gradually reduced with complete discontinuation by the end
      of the titration period.

      During the 6 month active trial, patients will be assessed at 3 and 6 months. All primary
      and secondary endpoint assessments will be performed by a blinded assessor.

      The total study duration is expected to be 60 months, including a 39 month enrollment
      period. The total duration per patient is approximately 7 months (approximately 1 month
      run-in period followed by 6 months active treatment).

Function assessed by 10 meter timed walking test
Function assessed by ability to transfer
Pain assessed by Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS)
Primary therapy goal achievement assessed by Goal Attainment Scale (GAS)
Quality of Life (QoL) assessed by EuroQol group-5 Dimensional (EQ-5D)
QoL assessed by the SF-12
