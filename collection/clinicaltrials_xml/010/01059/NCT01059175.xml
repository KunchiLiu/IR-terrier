  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is an effective treatment of heart failure (HF)
      refractory to optimal medical management, in presence of a depressed left ventricular (LV)
      ejection fraction and a wide QRS complex. It is mainly limited by a high proportion of
      non-responders. Attempts have been made, in small studies, to increase the number of
      stimulation sites in order to optimize the resynchronization therapy. V3 is a planned
      multicenter, randomized trial whose objective is to evaluate the clinical benefit conferred
      by the addition of a second endocardial or epicardial LV lead in non-responders after at
      least 6 months of standard biventricular stimulation.

      The V3 trial will examine the clinical benefit conferred by the addition of a second LV lead
      in non-responders compared to standard CRT.
