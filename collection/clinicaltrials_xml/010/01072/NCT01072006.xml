      This research investigates processes involved with one being able to focus on relevant
      information and ignore non-relevant information in veterans with PTSD and those with a
      history of traumatic brain injury. In addition, this study evaluates whether there is an
      additive effect of having both PTSD and history of TBI on ability to focus attention and
      inhibit distracting information.

      Traumatic brain injury (TBI) and PTSD both are characterized by deficits in attention, yet
      it is unclear as to whether this is related to an inability to focus on relevant information
      or ignore non-relevant information. History of TBI and PTSD are common to returning soldiers
      from OEF/OIF and thus is highly relevant to veteran health care. It is unclear how TBI and
      PTSD separately, and together, affect one's ability to focus attention versus inhibit
      distracting stimuli. This research investigates this issue by use of a working memory
      paradigm with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) that entails the subject being
      instructed to ignore some stimuli and remember other stimuli resulting in discrete
      biomarkers of (1) task-related enhancement of neural processes as well as (2) suppression of
      task-irrelevant neural processes. In this way, the specific aspect of attention in TBI and
      PTSD will be elucidated in addition to exploring whether PTSD and TBI have an additive, or
      even synergist, effect when combined.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All subjects will be between 18 and 40 years of age.

          -  In order to be included in the mTBI group, participants must have sustained between 1
             and 3 mild TBIs. The criteria for TBI will be consistent with what the VA currently
             uses (i.e., American Congress of Rehabilitative Medicine).

          -  More specifically, patients will have sustained a traumatically induced physiologic
             disruption of brain function as indicated by at least one of the following:

               -  any period of loss of consciousness,

               -  any loss of memory for events immediately before or after the accident,

               -  any alteration in mental status at the time of the accident, and

               -  focal neurologic deficits.

          -  Additional criteria for TBI include:

               -  TBI must have been sustained during OEF or OIF and

               -  TBI must consist of less than 30 minutes loss of consciousness, posttraumatic
                  amnesia of less than 1 hour, and no positive CT/MRI findings.

          -  For PTSD group inclusion, psychiatric diagnoses will be established via the PTSD
             Clinical Checklist- Military (PCL-M) and the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale
             (CAPS).

          -  For PTSD/mTBI group inclusion, the above criteria must be met for both PTSD and mTBI.

          -  Control subjects will be OEF/OIF veterans with a history of exposure to combat
             without current or previous diagnosis of PTSD and no history of TBI.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who meet diagnostic criteria for drug abuse/dependence over the past year
             will be excluded.

          -  Individuals will be excluded if they have neurological confounds (e.g., baseline
             history of a CNS opportunistic infection, CNS neoplasm, neurosyphilis, current
             seizure disorder, demyelinating diseases), learning disorder, or current psychiatric
             disorders involving psychosis (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder with psychosis).

          -  Patients will also be excluded from the study if they are claustrophobic or are
             taking cardiovascular medications as these are contraindications for fMRI.

          -  All 4 subject groups will be matched for age and education.
