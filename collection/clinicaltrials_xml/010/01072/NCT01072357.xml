  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The leading risk factor for corneal transplant rejection is abnormal blood vessel growth of
      the host bed. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is thought to be a mediator of this
      corneal neovascularization (NV), therefore we would like to test the safety and efficacy of
      local VEGF blockade in the promotion of graft survival in high risk corneal transplants.

      The purpose of this study is to test the effectiveness of a drug, bevacizumab (Avastin), in
      preventing blood vessels that often occur after a corneal transplantation which are
      considered at &quot;high-risk&quot; for rejection. In many cases these blood vessels lead to the graft
      rejection and eventual failure of the corneal transplant. It is hoped that this treatment
      will increase the chances of corneal graft survival.

      The medication used in this study is called bevacizumab or Avastin (Genentech, Inc). It
      works by inhibiting the action of a molecule called vascular endothelial growth factor
      (VEGF). VEGF is a substance molecule that binds to certain cells to stimulate new blood
      vessel formation. When VEGF is bound to the drug, it cannot stimulate the formation and
      growth of new blood vessels. Growth of blood vessels into the cornea is a complication which
      can worsen the prognosis of your corneal transplant and put the transplant at a higher risk
      for rejection.

    <description>Treatment will begin on Day 0, immediately upon the conclusion of the penetrating keratoplasty procedure with an injection of 0.1 milliliter (mL) (2.5 mg) bevacizumab. Starting Day 1 post-transplant surgery, subjects will begin treatment with topical bevacizumab (1% solution). Topical treatment will be self-administered 4 times a day for 4 weeks.
The study treatments are to be given in addition to standard of care treatments. Also, all patients will follow a standard post-operative follow-up visit schedule.</description>
