  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this protocol is to determine whether the use of repetitive transcranial
      magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over vermis of the cerebellum may be safe and therapeutically
      effective in patients with schizophrenia. Because this is the first evaluation of this
      treatment in this population, the focus of this study is safety.

    <intervention_name>Transcranial magnetic stimulation via MagPro x100 device</intervention_name>
    <description>Participants will receive 10 repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation sessions to the vermis of cerebellum using the MagPro x100 TMS device. These 10 rTMS sessions will be administered from Monday to Friday in five days, twice a day with a minimum of 4-hour gap between the sessions. Repetitive TMS will be applied with the intermittent theta burst pattern (iTBS). These parameters are known to cause excitation in brain activity.
Anatomically precise localization of rTMS will be achieved using a frameless stereotactic system.</description>
