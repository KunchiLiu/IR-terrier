        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who the investigator believes that they can and will comply with the
             requirements of the protocol (e.g. return for follow-up visits).

          -  A male or female between, and including, 18 and 50 years of age at study start.

          -  A subject having received a Yellow Fever (YF) vaccine on the day of study entry.

          -  Written informed consent obtained from the subject.

          -  Healthy subjects as established by medical history and clinical examination performed
             on the day of YF vaccination.

          -  Female subjects of non-childbearing potential may be enrolled in the study.

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential may be enrolled in the study, if the
             subject:

               -  has practiced adequate contraception for 30 days prior to study start, and

               -  has agreed to continue adequate contraception during the entire study period.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Use of any investigational or non-registered product (drug or vaccine) within 30 days
             preceding study start, or planned use during the study period.

          -  Concurrently participating in another clinical study, within 3 months preceding study
             start and at any time during the study period, in which the subject has been or will
             be exposed to an investigational or a non-investigational product (pharmaceutical
             product or device).

          -  Clinically significant anaemia or any known condition as per medical history that
             would preclude the drawing of blood as described in the protocol.

          -  Known previous infection with YF virus.

          -  Previous vaccination against YF more than approximately 5 hours before the blood
             sampling at Visit 1.

          -  Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the 3 months
             preceding the study start or planned administration during the study period.

          -  Chronic administration (defined as more than 14 days in total) of immunosuppressants
             or other immune-modifying drugs (including chloroquine) within six months prior to
             the study start. For corticosteroids, this will mean prednisone â‰¥ 10mg/day, or
             equivalent. Inhaled and topical steroids are allowed.

          -  Receipt of live attenuated vaccines other than the YF vaccine during the period
             beginning 30 days preceding the blood sampling at Visit 1 or planned use during the
             study up to the blood sampling at Visit 2.

          -  Receipt of inactivated influenza vaccines (seasonal or pandemic) during the period
             beginning 21 days preceding the blood sampling at Visit 1 or planned use during the
             study up to the blood sampling at Visit 2.

          -  History of malignancy (unless there has been surgical excision followed by a
             sufficient observation period, of at least 5 years, to give a reasonable assurance of
             sustained cure and which, in the estimate of the investigator, is not likely to recur
             during the study period).

          -  Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition (including
             HIV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C), based on medical history and physical examination
             (no laboratory testing required).

          -  Family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency.

          -  Major congenital defects or serious chronic illness.

          -  Acute or chronic, clinically significant pulmonary, cardiovascular, hepatic or renal
             functional abnormality, as determined by physical examination and medical history.

          -  Acute disease and/or fever at the time of enrolment.

          -  Known pregnant or lactating female, as per medical records.

          -  Female planning to become pregnant or planning to discontinue contraceptive
             precautions.

          -  History of chronic alcohol consumption and/or drug abuse.

          -  Any condition that may preclude the compliance to the study protocol.
