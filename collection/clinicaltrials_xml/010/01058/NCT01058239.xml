  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Post transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD) is a type of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma
      that occurs in patients with weakened immune systems due to immunosuppressive medications
      taken after organ or stem cell transplantation. This is usually related to a virus called
      Epstein-Barr (EPV). Rituximab is a type of drug called an &quot;antibody&quot; that specifically
      destroys both normal and cancerous B-cells, and is commonly used for PTLD. Bortezomib is a
      drug that has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat multiple
      myeloma and a B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma called Mantle Cell Lymphoma, and shows significant
      activity in lymphoma cells caused by EBV. In this research study, we hope to learn if the
      addition of bortezomib to rituximab treatment can increase the rate of complete remissions
      and cures of PTLD after organ or stem cell transplant.

      -  Both rituximab and bortezomib will be given to participants intravenously. Each cycle
           of treatment will consist of 21 days. Rituximab will be given on Days 1, 8 and 15 of
           Cycle 1 and on Day 1 of subsequent cycles. Bortezomib will be given on Days 1, 4, 8 and
           11 of every cycle. Participants will receive a maximum of 4 cycles.

        -  The following study procedures will be performed during each cycle throughout the
           study: Medical history review; Physical exam; Performance Status; Questionnaire; Blood
           draws and; PET/CT scans (After cycles 2, 4 and 6 only).

        -  After Cycle 4, if the study doctor feels the participant has had a complete response to
           treatment, then they will continue onto the Post-Treatment Surveillance period, which
           will consist of regular clinic visits over two years.

        -  However, if the study doctor feels the participant has had a partial response to
           treatment and that they may benefit from continuing, they will receive an additional
           two cycles of bortezomib and be given daily tablets of the antiviral drug
           valganciclovir to help further target EBV.
