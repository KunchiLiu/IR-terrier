    <textblock>
      Acute respiratory failure is a heterogeneous disorder that results in more than 300,000
      Americans requiring admission to an intensive care unit for invasive mechanical ventilatory
      support each year. Though acute respiratory failure is a pulmonary disorder, patients who
      survive their hospitalization are not limited by respiratory symptoms after discharge.
      Rather persistent neuromuscular weakness is the primary disorder that adversely alters their
      quality of life and ability to function on a daily basis. In this application we plan to
      conduct a randomized clinical trial called the Do It Now study (Diagnosis and Treatment of
      Neuromuscular Weakness) to determine the effectiveness of an intensive physical therapy
      program for patients recovering from acute respiratory failure. This trial will establish
      the efficacy of the physical therapy programs that is currently performed for patients with
      acute respiratory failure in a non-evidence based manner across the United States.

      Acute respiratory failure is a heterogeneous disorder that results in more than 300,000
      Americans requiring admission to an intensive care unit for invasive mechanical ventilatory
      support each year. Though acute respiratory failure is a pulmonary disorder, patients who
      survive are not limited by respiratory symptoms after discharge. Rather persistent
      neuromuscular weakness is the primary disorder that adversely affects their quality of life
      and ability to function on a daily basis. Weakness in these survivors is related to the
      development of critical illness polyneuromyopathy (CIPNM). Presently, there are no therapies
      to treat the estimated 110,000 acute respiratory failure survivors who have developed CIPNM
      each year. Based on the results of our national surveys of physical therapists and intensive
      care physicians, the utilization and types of physical therapy for patients recovering from
      acute respiratory failure with neuromuscular weakness varies significantly depending on the
      type of hospital and primary diagnosis of the patient. We plan to perform a randomized
      clinical trial to determine the effectiveness of an intensive four week physical therapy
      program for patients with acute respiratory failure. This trial will determine the efficacy
      of the physical therapy programs that is currently performed in a non-evidence based manner
      for patients with acute respiratory failure across the United States. If successful, our
      study will pave the way for a larger multi-center clinical trial of intensive physical
      therapy for survivors of acute respiratory failure.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Acute respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation for at least four days.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Recent myocardial infarction within the last 3 weeks, presence of signs or symptoms
             of unstable angina or history of unstable arrhythmias including ventricular
             tachycardia and atrial fibrillation (HR &gt; 100 bpm).

          -  Recent history of pulmonary embolism within the last six weeks.

          -  History of severe aortic stenosis.

          -  Presence of a dissecting aortic aneurysm.

          -  Significant language barrier that would limit the ability to participate in the
             physical therapy program.

          -  Patients who live greater than 45 miles from the University of Colorado Hospital.

          -  Underlying disorder that makes it unlikely that the patient will survive 6 months.

          -  Severe physical or cognitive impairment that would impair their ability to exercise.
