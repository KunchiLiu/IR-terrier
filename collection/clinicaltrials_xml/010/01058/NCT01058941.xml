  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if taking lipoic acid plus omega-3 fatty acids
      (omega-3s) can slow the Alzheimer's disease (AD) process. To see if the treatment can slow
      the AD process, the investigators will look at changes in memory and changes in a person's
      daily activities over 18 months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Current pharmacological agents for AD have had no impact on disease prevalence and have had
      limited effects on improving the clinical course of AD. The exponential rise in the
      prevalence, incidence, and cost of care for AD make finding therapeutic agents that can
      either prevent AD or delay disease progression an urgent health care need. Since
      inflammation, lipid dysregulation, and insulin resistance have each been associated with AD
      pathology, the combination of lipoic acid plus fish oil has the potential to maximize
      therapeutic benefit by acting on all three mechanisms associated with disease pathology. Our
      primary study aim is to evaluate the ability of lipoic acid plus omega-3 fatty acids to
      delay cognitive and functional decline in people with AD. The investigators will also
      evaluate the effect of lipoic acid plus omega-3 fatty acids on changes in serum and plasma
      biomarkers over 18 months to determine which markers are associated with whole brain atrophy
      (MRI volume changes) and clinical outcomes (ADAS-cog, ADL). The associations identified will
      aid in the identification of specific biomarkers that may be used to evaluate treatment
      effects in future clinical trials.

             permitted - dose must be stable for 4 months prior to study enrollment
