  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized clinical trial designed to evaluate oral nitazoxanide compared to a
      placebo in the treatment of acute uncomplicated influenza in adults. We hypothesize that
      treatment with nitazoxanide will reduce the duration of symptoms in patients with confirmed
      influenza infection. Secondarily, we hypothesize that treatment with nitazoxanide will
      reduce the complications of influenza, severity of symptoms, time lost from work, time to
      return to normal daily activities, and viral shedding.

    <textblock>
      The study is conducted at approximately 25 sites in the United States. Subjects selected
      based on symptoms will be randomized to receive oral nitazoxanide or placebo twice daily for
      5 days. Subjects will be monitored by daily by telephone or home visit to monitor symptoms
      and complications of influenza for safety and will be referred for medical care as required.
      Subjects will complete a diary twice daily to record the presence and severity of symptoms,
      ability to perform normal daily activities and time lost from work. Complications of
      influenza (including sinusitis, otitis, bronchitis, pneumonia, central nervous system
      disease) and other adverse events will be reported. Nasopharyngeal swabs will be collected
      at Baseline (Day 0) and Day 7 for all patients and on Days 1 through 4 for a subset of
      patients to test for influenza A (including novel H1N1), influenza B and 17 other
      respiratory viruses by RT-PCR and culture and to evaluate quantitative viral shedding. The
      primary analysis will be for patients with confirmed influenza, and secondary analyses will
      be conducted for subjects with any respiratory virus and for all treated subjects.
