      To determine if patients with a deficiency of alpha-galactosidase A are at-risk for cardiac
      complications that commonly occur in the general population

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fabry disease is an X-linked deficiency of alpha-galactosidase A resulting primarily in an
      accumulation of globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) in virtually all organs and systems. The main
      complications of Fabry disease are a 20-fold increased risk of ischemic stroke, cardiac
      disease including cardiomyopathy, atrio-ventricular conduction defects, a wide variety of
      arrhythmias, valvular dysfunction (insufficiency or stenosis) and cardiac vascular disease
      as well as progressive renal failure. Fabry disease cannot be easily diagnosed in patients
      with routine EKGs, echocardiograms or MRIs. Screening non-selected at-risk populations of
      patients with ischemic stroke or cardiac disease for urinary Gb3, alpha-galactosidase A
      activity and GLA gene mutations should enable the identification of patients previously
      undiagnosed with Fabry disease among the general population of patients with heart disease
      and stroke
