      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that patients will improve the immediate
      treatment outcomes from successive radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of incompetent perforator

      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that patients who have competent great saphenous
      vein (GSV) and short saphenous vein (SSV) or have undergone prior successful endovenous
      treatment of an incompetent GSV and/or SSV but continue to demonstrate clinical symptoms of
      peripheral venous insufficiency resulting from incompetent perforator veins (IPVs) will
      improve the immediate treatment outcomes from successive radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of
      IPVs veins.

          -  Male and female, ages 18 to 80 years, from all racial and ethnic origin

          -  Have the ability to understand the requirements of the study, provide written
             informed consent to participate, and agree to abide by the study requirements

          -  Available for all the follow-up visits and in a physical condition allowing
             ambulation after the procedure

          -  Incompetent GSV and/or SSV in the target limb has been treated at least 3 months
             before study enrollment or competent GSV and SSV at time of treatment

          -  CEAP 4 - 6 classification

          -  DUS reflux of ≥0.35 sec or more of the target IPV and/or an intra-fascia diameter of
             ≥0.3 mm

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Acute (at Screening) superficial venous thrombosis of either limb

          -  Acute (within the prior 3 months) deep venous thrombosis or phlebitis in either limb

          -  Complete or near complete deep venous obstruction documented by ultrasound

          -  Previously participated in any study involving ClosureRFS

          -  Actively participated in any other investigational study within 30 days of enrollment
             into this study

          -  Pregnant at the time of treatment. Status verified by pregnancy test via blood or
             urine for women ≤ 55 years old.

          -  Having a medical condition, serious intercurrent illness, or extenuating circumstance
             that would significantly decrease study compliance, including all required study
             follow-up

          -  Have any condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would jeopardize the
             safety of the patient or affect the validity of the trial results

          -  Have a history of excessive alcohol consumption or any use of illegal drugs rendering
             the patient unreliable, or at risk during this trial

          -  Have undergone major surgery which may result in abnormalities of the target body
             area, reasonably suspected to compromise the study outcomes

          -  Have undergone an invasive procedure of the target body area (e.g., needle biopsy or
             surgical procedure) within 30 days of enrollment into this study

          -  Known incompatibility, such as an allergic reaction to anesthetics to be used in the
             incompetent perforator vein treatment

          -  Patients requiring hyperbaric therapy involving the treated limb during the 6 month
             post treatment follow-up period

          -  Great toe pressure measurement of ≤ 70 mmHg

          -  CEAP 6 classified patients receiving high dose steroid medication or the following
             medications that interfere with normal mechanisms of wound healing, e.g.
             glucocorticoids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), anti-neoplastic and
             immunosuppressive drugs, and others like, colchicine and penicillamine.
