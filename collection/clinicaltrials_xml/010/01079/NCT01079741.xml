  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of melanoma is increasing with an estimated incidence of 59,940 cases and an
      annual death rate of 8110 in 2007. Although patients diagnosed with early stage disease have
      an excellent clinical outcome, patients diagnosed with advanced or recurrent disease,
      continue to have a high mortality rate, even with initial optimal surgical resection.
      Effective adjuvant strategies are needed to increase the time to progression and to decrease
      the recurrence rate. Immunotherapy has long been recognized as a potential therapy for
      melanoma; the goal of adjuvant vaccine therapy is to train the endogenous immune system to
      recognize and target minimal residual disease.

      This is a Phase I open label dose escalation study of the TLR3 agonist Poly-ICLC as an
      adjuvant for NY-ESO-1 protein vaccination in patients with high risk melanoma in clinical
      complete remission (cCr), followed by a randomized Phase II component in which patients will
      be randomized to subcutaneous vaccination of NY-ESO-1 protein with Poly-ICLC alone dose TBD
      (Arm A) or with NY-ESO-1 protein, Poly-ICLC dose TBD and Montanide® ISA-51 VG (Montanide)
      (Arm B).

      Patients with histological confirmed malignant melanoma, AJCC Stages: IIB, IIC, III or IV,
      who are in complete clinical remission (cCr) but at high risk of disease recurrence, will be
      eligible for enrollment, regardless of whether antigen expression in the autologous tumor
      can be demonstrated by either PCR or immunohistochemistry.

      Primary Objectives:

        -  Phase I: To define the safety of subcutaneous vaccination with NY-ESO-1 protein,
           Montanide and escalating doses of Poly-ICLC.

        -  Phase II: To evaluate the induction of humoral and T cell (CD4+ and CD8+) immunity to
           subcutaneous vaccination with NY-ESO-1 protein in combination with Poly-ICLC when given
           with or without Montanide.

      Exploratory analyses:

        -  Evaluation of primary tumor expression of NY-ESO-1 by IHC or RT-PCR.

        -  Histologic quantitation of original tumor TILs (tumor infiltrating lymphocytes), CD3+
           cells, evaluation of mitotic index and correlation of this data with immunologic
           response.

        -  Correlation of NY-ESO-1 specific T cell responses with HLA type

        -  Investigation of polymorphisms for TLR3 through germline SNP analysis.

        -  Clinical Outcome (Time to Progression) reported descriptively.

        -  Skin section analysis of protein/adjuvant treated sites for immune cell infiltration
           and gene expression analysis

    <description>Up to 3 cohorts of 3 patients will be given a subcutaneous vaccination of 100µg NY-ESO-1 protein emulsified in 1.1mL Montanide® ISA-51VG (day 1) with escalating doses of Poly-ICLC.

    <description>When Phase I is complete (no cohort 3 DLT observed) 24 new patients are randomized in Phase II to receive treatment under Arm A or Arm B.

Administrations occur every 3 wks on study wks 1,4,7,&amp;10. Injections may occur w/in +/-3 days of planned date. Blood samples are obtained at baseline, 1 wk after vaccinations, and 1&amp;3 months after last vaccination for assessment of NY-ESO-1 specific antibodies and CD4+ &amp; CD8+ T cells.</description>
