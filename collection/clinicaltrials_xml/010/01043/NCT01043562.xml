  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients who receive an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) usually undergo testing
      at the end of the ICD procedure to measure the amount of energy able to successfully
      defibrillate the heart (defibrillation threshold testing, or DFT). This study proposes to
      perform that measurement in pediatric patients already undergoing clinically necessary ICD
      procedures, with the measurement performed using a binary search method that has been
      previously validated in adult cohorts. We hypothesize that pediatric DFTs, when precisely
      measured, may be lower than previously assumed from extrapolation of adult data.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Current follow-up at Children's Hospital Boston

          -  Children with current or planned ICDs who are scheduled by their primary
             electrophysiologist for clinically necessary assessment/re-assessment of
             defibrillation threshold

          -  If the patient has an ICD system with a non-transvenous shock coil: weight ≤35kg at
             time of initial implant, with current weight &lt;50kg

          -  If the patient has an ICD system with a conventional transvenous shock coil: current
             weight ≤60kg

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinical failure of any system component not able to be addressed by hardware repair
             or exchange

          -  Hemodynamic instability that in the judgment of the primary electrophysiologist
             warrants abbreviation of DFT assessment

          -  Unsuccessful induction of fibrillation during DFT testing
