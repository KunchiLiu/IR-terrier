    <textblock>
      Rationale: Chemotherapy administration before a donor stem cell transplant is necessary to
      stop the patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. When healthy stem
      cells from a donor are infused into the patient, the donor white blood cells can provide the
      missing enzyme that causes the metabolic disease. Sometimes the transplanted cells from a
      donor can make an immune response against the body's normal cells. Giving a monoclonal
      antibody, alemtuzumab, before transplant and cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil before
      and after transplant may stop this from happening. This may be an effective treatment for
      inherited metabolic disorders.

      Purpose: The design of this study is to achieve donor cell engraftment in patients with
      standard-risk inherited metabolic diseases with limited peri-transplant morbidity and
      mortality. This will be achieved through the administration of the chemotherapy regimen
      described. The intention is to follow transplanted patient for years after transplant
      monitoring them for complications of their disease and assisting families with a
      multifaceted interdisciplinary approach.

      Primary Objective:

        -  To estimate the proportion of patients with donor derived engraftment at day 100 post
           transplant as defined by 80% or greater donor cells in the CD3 (T cell) fraction

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To determine the incidence and severity of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) by day 100

        -  To determine the incidence of peri-transplant mortality (death by day 100)

        -  To monitor donor cell chimerism at various time points following allogeneic
           transplantation with this transplant regimen as determined at day 28, 42, 100, 6 months
           and yearly for 5 years.
