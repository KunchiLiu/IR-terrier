    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of port (PAC) flushes
      every 3 months rather than every four to six weeks.

      It is routine practice to flush ports every four to six weeks, according to the
      manufacturer's recommendations, using salt solution followed heparin if needed. This study
      examines the effectiveness of port flushes at an alternative interval of 3 months, reducing
      the number of visits to the health-care provider.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, non-blinded, non-inferiority prospective cohort trial of patients with
      ports (PAC) after a systemic therapy to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of PAC flushes
      in 3 months intervals. Patients with any type of cancer are eligible. The study will extend
      1 year from enrollment of the last patient. Each enrolled patient will have his or her port
      flushed five times in 3 month intervals.

      Patients will be enrolled after the completion of systemic therapy and after completion of
      the restaging follow up, which is the time period from 4 weeks to 3 months after
      discontinuation of the chemotherapy. Once patients are enrolled to extended interval PAC
      flushes, they will be followed for one year. At the end of the year patients will return to
      standard PAC flushes. If patients experience any PAC malfunction, it would be considered a
      PAC failure and the flushing will reverted back to the schedule recommended by the
      manufacturer.

    <description>The short-term endpoint is time to port complication (EFP- event free port-complication). The long term end point will be time to port failure requiring removal of the port (OAP - overal port failure) and will be used to determine the efficacy of port flushes every 3 months.</description>
