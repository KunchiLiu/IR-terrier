    <textblock>
      The goal of this research study is to learn if a new type of PET scan (18F-FLT) can help to
      better detect changes of tumor growth rate (or how active) in esophagus cancer. Researchers
      will study at what time during treatment the 18F-FLT PET scan should be given to get the
      best results.

      A Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scan is a type of scan that uses a radioactive solution
      to locate cancer cells inside the body. Using the PET scan, doctors can locate solid tumors
      and collect information about how &quot;active&quot; the cancer cells are.

      For this study, a new type of solution, [F-18] fluoro-L-thymidine (FLT), will be used. FLT
      can detect actively growing tumor, and researchers hope that FLT may be able to help provide
      information about how well esophagus cancer treatment is working. This information could be
      used to help predict if the cancer will respond to treatment.

      All enrolled subjects will receive 4D-PET/ CT imaging at pre-chemoradiotherapy (CRT) and
      post-CRT prior to the esophagectomy. At each time of the 4D-PET/ CT procedure, the subject
      will receive an injection of FLT which is an investigational pharmaceutical labeled with
      radioactive fluorine. Each scan process might take 45 to 60 minutes. The 4DPET/ CT imaging
      at pre-CRT and at post-CRT will be compared and evaluated with the pathological assessment
      of the surgical specimens.

      Participation in this pilot study will not change the patients normal chemotherapy,
      radiation treatment, and surgery recommended the patients physician as parts of their
      standard of care.

      The goal of this study is to obtain preliminary data and initial estimates of the FLT
      ability(FluoroLThymidine)-PET (Positron Emission Tomography) to identify pathCR (pathologic
      complete response) patients who have esophageal carinoma and undergo Chemo-RT prior to
      surgery. Despite improvements in surgical management, long-term survival rates in patients
      with esophageal cancer have not changed dramatically. Achievement in pathCR after
      pre-operative CRT (chemoradiotherapy) is associated with improved patient outcomes; however,
      there is no effective method to predict pathological response before surgery. Thus, a
      patient with pathCR, for whom esophagectomy may be unnecessary, still undergoes surgery and
      faces the prohibitive side effects of this surgical procedure. Additionally, CRT is
      associated with considerable morbidities and tool to predict and avoid ineffective therapy
      are lacking. Because deregulated proliferation is one of the hallmarks of cancer and its
      proliferation rate is associated with aggressive biologic behavior and response to therapy,
      imaging the proliferative state of cancer cells by noninvasive functional imaging is of
      great interest. Recently 18F-FLT (3'deoxy33'-18F-fluorothymidine) has been reported as a
      promising PET radiopharmaceutical for imaging cancer proliferation and has been validated in
      several in vitro &amp; in vivo models. However, only a few studies addressed its role in
      depicting changes in cancer proliferation and assessing response to CRT, and none of these
      studies have focused on esophageal cancer. We propose to conduct a pilot study to learn the
      optimal FLT PET imaging timepoint during the early course of CRT that has the highest
      predictive value for pathCR in patients with esophageal cancer.
