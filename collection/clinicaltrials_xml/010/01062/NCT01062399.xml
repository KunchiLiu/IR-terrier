      RATIONALE: Everolimus may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Drugs used in chemotherapy,
      such as temozolomide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by
      killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Radiation therapy uses high energy
      x-rays to kill tumor cells. Giving everolimus together with temozolomide and radiation
      therapy may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of everolimus when
      given together with temozolomide and radiation therapy and to see how well it works in
      treating patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To define the maximum tolerated dose of everolimus (up to an established dose of 10
           mg/day) when combined with concurrent radiotherapy and temozolomide in patients with
           newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme. (Phase I)

        -  To determine the efficacy of everolimus in combination with radiotherapy and
           temozolomide followed by adjuvant everolimus in combination with temozolomide, as
           measured by progression-free survival, in these patients. (Phase II)

      Secondary

        -  To characterize the safety profile of everolimus in combination with radiotherapy and
           temozolomide in these patients. (Phase I)

        -  To determine the overall survival of these patients. (Phase II)

        -  To further evaluate the safety profile of everolimus in combination with radiotherapy
           and temozolomide in these patients. (Phase II)

        -  To determine if activation of the Akt/mTOR axis predicts response to everolimus. (Phase
           II)

        -  To determine if there is an association between tumor MGMT gene methylation status and
           response to everolimus. (Phase II)

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, phase I, dose-escalation study of everolimus followed by a
      phase II, randomized study.

        -  Phase I (closed to accrual 7/3/12): Patients undergo radiotherapy (intensity-modulated
           or 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy) 5 days a week for 6 weeks and receive oral
           everolimus and oral temozolomide once daily for 6 weeks. Beginning 28 days after the
           completion of therapy, patients receive adjuvant oral everolimus once daily on days
           1-28 and oral temozolomide once daily on days 1-5. Treatment with adjuvant everolimus
           and temozolomide repeats every 28 days for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease
           progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Phase II (opened to accrual 12/19/12): Patients are stratified according to recursive
           partitioning analysis class (III vs IV vs V). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2
           treatment arms.

             -  Arm I: Patients undergo radiotherapy (intensity-modulated or 3-dimensional
                conformal radiotherapy) 5 days a week for 6 weeks and receive oral temozolomide
                once daily for 6 weeks. Beginning 28 days after the completion of therapy,
                patients receive adjuvant oral temozolomide once daily on days 1-5. Treatment with
                adjuvant temozolomide repeats every 28 days for up to 12 courses in the absence of
                disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

             -  Arm II: Patients receive treatment as in phase I. Tumor tissue, plasma, and urine
                samples may be collected for correlative laboratory studies (mandatory for phase
                II).

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year,
      every 4 months for 1 year, and then every 6 months thereafter.
