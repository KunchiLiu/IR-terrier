    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a prospective randomized 2 arm parallel observer-blinded phase II
      clinical study comparing a distinct method of upper cervical chiropractic manipulation to a
      sham technique in 50 individuals with stage I hypertension (systolic blood pressure (SBP):
      140-159 mm Hg; diastolic blood pressure (DBP):90-99 mm Hg).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      More than 50 million Americans suffer from hypertension, a disease with far-reaching public
      health impact causing or contributing to 7.1 million deaths yearly at an estimated annual
      incremental direct cost of $54 billion per year. Common treatments include antihypertensive
      medications and lifestyle modifications. While these treatments have been shown to be
      effective, only about 30% of hypertensive patients achieve blood pressure goals. Based on a
      recently published study (Bakris et al, 2007), one unique non-pharmaceutical approach may be
      a non-rotary type of upper cervical spinal manipulation to align the first cervical vertebra
      (atlas) performed by a doctor of chiropractic. We propose to conduct a similar study with a
      more commonly known chiropractic technique called Toggle Recoil. We propose a prospective
      randomized 2 arm parallel observer-blinded phase II clinical study comparing a distinct
      method of upper cervical chiropractic manipulation to a sham technique in 50 (25 in each
      group) individuals with Stage I hypertension (systolic blood pressure (SBP); 140-159 mm Hg
      or diastolic blood pressure (DBP):90-99 mm Hg). Patients will be seen by doctors of
      chiropractic twice each week for 6 weeks and outcomes will be collected at baseline, 3
      weeks, and 6 weeks after enrollment. The primary outcome measure will be change in SBP and
      the primary endpoint will be at the week 6 assessment.

    <description>To assess the feasibility of conducting a full-scale randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of Toggle Recoil chiropractic manipulation for patients with stage I hypertension. We will assess: 1) the success of blinding clinic personnel to treatment allocation; 2) the ability to effectively use Academic Health Center faculty as research clinicians; 3) the ability to take blood pressure measurements according to protocol and keep clinic personnel blinded; 4) the ability to retain participants who are randomized to the placebo treatment (n=25) and the active treatment (n=25).</description>

    <description>This non-rotary upper cervical procedure uses an impulse thrust with a controlled depth (high velocity). The participant's head is supported by a specially designed cushion and the doctor usually approaches the participant from in front of his or her head to contact soft tissue over the atlas transverse process, posterior to the lateral mass or occasionally on the C2 lamina or spinous process, with the pisiform process of one hand. The thrust is delivered by a contraction of the triceps muscles of both arms, which straightens the arms and applies the thrust to the participant.</description>

    <description>The procedure in its broadest definition describes the application of a load (force or displacement) to specific body tissues (usually vertebral joints) with therapeutic intent. The mechanical characteristics of SM can vary in terms of its duration and amplitude, (hence, the rate at which it is applied), as well as its anatomical location, choice of levers, direction of force application, and the vehicle used to apply the force (manually or mechanically assisted).</description>

    <description>The sham assessment procedures will be the same as those in the high velocity treatment group. The sham intervention is identical to this treatment protocol except for the placement of the treating clinicians pisiform contact. The force and vector applied will be the same.</description>
