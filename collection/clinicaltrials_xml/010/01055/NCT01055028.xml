  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single-arm, multi-center, Phase 2 study with Paclitaxel in
      combination with Bevacizumab in patients with Unresectable or Metastatic Angiosarcoma. The
      study aims to determine the safety and effectiveness of combining two drugs Paclitaxel and
      Bevacizumab in the treatment of Angiosarcoma that cannot be removed by surgery, or has
      spread to other parts of your body. The primary objective is to evaluate 4month non
      progression rate. The secondary objective is to evaluate overall response rate after 3rd and
      6th cycle, median duration of response, 6th and 12th month survival, toxicity of Paclitaxel
      and Bevacizumab combination, toxicity of maintenance Bevacizumab and to collect
      paraffin-embedded tumor blocks for angiogenesis markers and tissue microarray.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Baseline measurements and evaluations must be obtained within 4 weeks of registration
             to the study. Abnormal PET scans will not constitute evaluable disease, unless
             verified by CT scan or other appropriate imaging.

          -  Patient must have at least one objective measurable disease parameter by RECIST
             criteria.

          -  Patients must have unresectable locally advanced or metastatic angiosarcoma.

          -  Patients must have had &lt;= 2 prior chemotherapeutic regimens for angiosarcoma.

          -  No prior paclitaxel, docetaxel, or bevacizumab for angiosarcoma. (Previous paclitaxel
             or docetaxel allowed if not given for angiosarcoma and more than 12 months has
             elapsed since last dose)

          -  Patients must not have had evidence of other active malignancies other than
             carcinomas in-situ of the cervix or basal cell carcinoma of the skin within 6 months
             prior to registration.

          -  Patients with a history of deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism must be
             receiving a stable dose of anticoagulation therapy for at least 2 weeks prior to
             registration.

          -  Patients must not have been using any anti-platelet drugs, such as ticlopidine,
             clopidogrel, and cilostazol, during study or within 7 days prior to registration. The
             use of aspirin or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) is allowed.

          -  Patients must have an ECOG performance status 0-2.

          -  Patients must have adequate organ function as evidenced by the following laboratory

               -  Total bilirubin &lt;= 2.0 x ULN and SGOT (AST) &lt; 2 x ULN. If documented hepatic
                  involvement, total bilirubin can be &lt;= 3 x ULN, and AST &lt;= 5 x ULN.
