  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine if an on demand dosing of 50 mg or 150 mg of GSK557296 demonstrates superior
      efficacy with respect to duration of intra vaginal ejaculatory latency time (IELT) during an
      8 week study period compared to placebo in men with primary premature ejaculation. An
      assessment of the safety and tolerability of all doses of GSK557296 will be performed as
      well as an assessment for change in the Index of Premature Ejaculation (IPE) from baseline
      and at the end of the 8 weeks of treatment. During the active treatment period study
      participants will be limited to a maximum of 40 doses of GSK557296, or placebo, spilt as 20
      doses for both 4 week intervals.
