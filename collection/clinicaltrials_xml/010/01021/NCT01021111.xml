  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this project is to reduce the risk for anterior cruciate ligament
      injuries by designing a targeted intervention that will alter the known kinematic and
      kinetic risk factors associated with ACL injuries. This study will address the following
      specific aims: 1) To optimize a wearable, targeted, active training feedback device to
      reduce the risk of ACL injury among healthy subjects by inducing patterns of movement that
      alter the known kinematic and kinetic risk factors associated with ACL injuries. 2) To
      evaluate the efficacy of the active device and determine if the device reduces the risk of
      ACL injury among healthy subjects by effectively inducing patterns of movement that alter
      the known kinematic and kinetic risk factors associated with ACL injuries.
