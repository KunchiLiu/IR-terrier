          -  Concurrently participating in another clinical study, at any time during the study

          -  Evidence of previous or intercurrent poliomyelitis disease or vaccination.

          -  History of seizures or progressive neurological disease.

          -  Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, based on
             medical history and physical examination.
