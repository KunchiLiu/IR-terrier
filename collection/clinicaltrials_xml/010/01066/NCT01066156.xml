      An initial telephone interview will be conducted to determine if potential subjects meet the
      basic study requirements. If no obvious counterindications are present, subjects will be
      scheduled for a screening visit. After briefing the subjects on the reasons for the
      research, they will be given an opportunity to read the Informed Consent Form, approved by
      the Cambridge Health Alliance Institutional ReviewBoard, and to ask questions prior to
      signing it. Subjects will be given a copy of the signed Consent Form. Each subject will
      complete a standardized interview schedule designed to obtain personal and background data
      along with psychodiagnostic and psychometric evaluations. An open-label treatment will be
      utilized for all patients. Seroquel tablets will be flexibly dosed and begun at a target
      dose of 25 mg per day and taken over an 8 week period.
