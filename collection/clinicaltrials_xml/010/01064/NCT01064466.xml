      Personalized Etoposide (VP-16) chemotherapy targeting the SCLC patient-specific biomarkers
      (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms - SNPs of relative etoposide targets, topoisomerase II and
      CYP4503A4)

      Targeted SCLC chemotherapy with Etoposide (VP-16) and patient-specific biomarkers (SNPs)

      Individualize or personalize etoposide chemotherapy toward small cell lung cancer (SCLC)
      with maximizing effectiveness and minimizing risk via assay single nucleotide polymorphisms
      (SNPs) of relative etoposide targets, topoisomerase II and CYP4503A4, based on precisely
      sequencing drug targets' genes.

      Targeted SCLC chemotherapy with VP-16 and personalized patient-specific biomarkers (SNPs)

      We obtained the IND 78,420 Exemption Letter from FDA like as Drug Sponsor on 04/29/2009. In
      future, any IND is not required to conduct our further relative clinical studies. // We
      obtained DHHS and IRB approval document: Federal-wide Assurance (FWA) for the Protection of
      Human Subjects for Institutions within the United States (FWA: 00015357). So we can develop
      our further relative clinical studies in USA.

      Our Further Retrospect Clinical Study will use Combined Chemotherapy on ETOPOSIDE INJECTION
      plus CARBOPLATIN INJECTION or Combined Chemotherapy on ETOPOSIDE INJECTION plus CISPLATIN
      INJECTION to treat Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC) patients, and will try to look for the
      relationship between the ETOPOSIDE INJECTION therapeutic efficacy and the Topoisomerase II
      SNP Genotyping, and the relationship between the ETOPOSIDE INJECTION therapeutic safety and
      the CYP4503A4 SNP Genotyping, based on precisely sequencing drug targets' genes.

      The treatment option must be ETOPOSIDE INJECTION plus CARBOPLATIN INJECTION or ETOPOSIDE
      INJECTION plus CISPLATIN INJECTION, but the the specific SCLC patients, who had used the
      ETOPOSIDE INJECTION or the ETOPOSIDE INJECTION plus CISPLATIN INJECTION until right now,
      have had to survive over 2 years.

      According to Etoposide Injection Directions, the Etoposide efficacy target may be
      Topoisomerase II and the Etoposide metabolism target should be CYP4503A4. // We hope to
      discover the Topoisomerase II SNP Genotypes which could be more relative to higher
      therapeutic efficacy, and the CYP4503A4 SNP Genotypes which could be more relative to lower
      therapeutic risk.

      We will assay Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) of Etoposide (VP-16) drug target
      (Topoisomerase II) which are effectiveness-associated, and will assay Single Nucleotide
      Polymorphisms (SNPs) of Etoposide (VP-16) drug target (CYP4503A4) which are risk-associated
      in the specific SCLC patients who are surviving after 2 years used Combined Chemotherapy on
      ETOPOSIDE INJECTION plus CARBOPLATIN INJECTION or Combined Chemotherapy on ETOPOSIDE
      INJECTION plus CISPLATIN INJECTION, based on precisely sequencing drug targets' genes.

      In the Retrospect Stage, 400 SCLC patients, used the Combined Chemotherapy on ETOPOSIDE
      INJECTION plus CISPLATIN INJECTION at all times since 2 years ago until right now, like as
      the usual approach group. // In the Retrospect Stage, 400 SCLC patients, used the Combined
      Chemotherapy on ETOPOSIDE INJECTION plus CARBOPLATIN INJECTION at all times since 2 years
      ago until right now, like as the study approach group. // In the Retrospect Stage, the usual
      approach group 400 SCLC patients will continue to be used the Combined Chemotherapy on
      ETOPOSIDE INJECTION plus CISPLATIN INJECTION. // In the Retrospect Stage, the study approach
      group 400 SCLC patients will continue to be used the Combined Chemotherapy on ETOPOSIDE
      INJECTION plus CARBOPLATIN INJECTION. // All of oncology drugs must be approved by USA FDA
      and must be sold on USA market legally. // The dosages about all of oncology drugs must
      abide by their labeling in USA.

      We need use the SCLC patients' tissue or humoral specimens to assay the Topoisomerase II SNP
      Genotypes and the CYP4503A4 SNP Genotypes with precisely sequencing drug targets' genes in
      USA.
