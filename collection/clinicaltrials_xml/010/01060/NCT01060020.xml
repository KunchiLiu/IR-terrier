  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary hypertension is common in patients with aortic stenosis and is associated with
      worse operative and long-term outcomes. Sildenafil has been shown to reduce pulmonary artery
      pressure and improve exercise performance in patients with left-sided heart failure, but
      this has not been tested in patients with aortic stenosis. We hypothesize that Sildenafil
      will produce a clinically significant decrease in pulmonary artery pressure in patients with
      severe aortic stenosis. The dose of Sildenafil that produces a significant decrease in
      pulmonary artery pressure will be safe and well tolerated in patients with and without a
      depressed ejection fraction.

      Patients with severe aortic stenosis referred for a clinically ordered right and left heart
      catheterization will be eligible. Twenty subjects will be enrolled: 10 patients will receive
      40mg and 10 patients will receive 80mg; each dose will be equally distributed among those
      with preserved (≥50%) and reduced (&lt;50%) EF. Subjects will get a baseline echo prior to the
      heart catheterization. Baseline invasive hemodynamic measurements will be performed using a
      Swan Ganz catheter. A single oral dose of sildenafil will then be administered (40mg or
      80mg), followed by invasive hemodynamic measurements at 30 and 60 minutes. Also at 60
      minutes, limited echocardiographic images will be obtained.
