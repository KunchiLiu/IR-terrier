  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      When a match related or matched unrelated donor is not available a Haploidentical donor
      (parent, sibling or child)is immediately available. The challenges associated with
      haploidentical HCT include increased risk of GVHD, graft rejection and impaired immune
      reconstitution. This trial will evaluate the safety and feasibility of simultaneous
      administration of conventional T cells and regulatory T cells after haploidentical
      allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation to overcome these challenges.

        Inclusion Criteria:Recipient Inclusion Criteria

        3.1.1 Patients with the following diseases that are histopathologically confirmed are
        eligible:

          1. Acute leukemia (in first remission with poor risk factors and molecular prognosis;
             AML with -5,-7, t(6;9), tri8, -11 and ALL with Ph+ t(9;22), t(4;22), (q34;q11)

          2. Acute leukemia with refractory disease or &gt;CR1

          3. Chronic myelogenous leukemia (accelerated, blast or second chronic phase)

          4. Myelodysplastic syndrome (in high and high intermediate risk categories)

          5. Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma with poor risk features not suitable for autologous
             transplantation

          6. Refractory CLL

        3.1.2 There are no limits on amount of prior therapy but there must be at least 21 days
        from the end of most recent prior therapy to start of transplant conditioning regimen.

        3.1.3 The recipient must be &lt;= 60 years old at time of registration.

        3.1.5 Karnofsky Performance Status &gt; 70%

        3.1.6 The recipient must have a related donor genotypically HLA-A, B,C and DRB1, DQ loci
        haploidentical to the recipient (but differing for 2-3 HLA alleles on the unshared
        haplotype in the GvHD direction) and no HLA matched sibling or matched unrelated donor is
        identified.

        3.1.7 Adequate cardiac and pulmonary function (LVEF &gt; 45%, DLCO &gt;50% corrected for
        hemoglobin)

        3.1.8 Serum creatinine &lt;1.5 mg/dL or creatinine clearance &gt;50 ml/min for those above serum
        creatinine of 1.5; serum bilirubin &lt;2.0 mg/dL; ALT &lt;2x ULN (unless secondary to disease)

        3.1.9 No prior myeloablative therapy or hematopoeitic cell transplantation

        Donor Inclusion Criteria

        3.3.1 Age &lt; 70 years and weight &gt; 25 kg. 3.3.2 Medical history and physical examination
        confirm good health status as defined by institutional standards 3.3.3 Seronegative for
        HIV Ag, hepatitis B sAg or PCR+ or hepatitis C ab or PCR+ within 30 days of apheresis
        collection 3.3.4 Genotypically haploidentical as determined by HLA typing 3.3.5 Female
        donors of child-bearing potential must have a negative serum or urine beta-HCG test within
        three weeks of mobilization 3.3.6 Capable of undergoing leukapheresis, have adequate
        venous access, and be willing to undergo insertion of a central catheter should
        leukapheresis via peripheral vein be inadequate 3.3.7 Capable of agreeing to second
        donation of PBPC (or a bone marrow harvest) should the patient fail to demonstrate
        sustained engraftment following the transplant 3.3.8 The donor or legal guardian greater
        than 18 years of age, capable of signing an IRB-approved consent form.

        3.3.9 Donor Selection

        The order of donor section will be as follows:

          1. If available, the recipient's biological mother will be the preferential donor

          2. If the biological mother is not available, then other available haploidentical donors
             will be selected based upon the presence of NK alloreactivity between donor and
             recipient. The donor will be selected based on the presence of NK alloreactivity as
             determined by high-resolution HLA typing of the C locus of both donor and recipient.
             Recipients lacking a KIR-ligand present in the donor along with the corresponding KIR
             defines &quot;NK alloreactivity&quot;. An NK alloreactive donor will be preferentially chosen.

          3. If more than 1 NK alloreactive donor is available, then preference will be to use an
             NK alloreactive donor that is CMV seronegative.

        Exclusion Criteria:Recipient Exclusion Criteria

        3.2.1 The recipient is a suitable candidate for autologous transplantation or allogeneic
        transplantation with an available matched related or unrelated donor.

        3.2.2 Seropositive for any of the following: HIV ab, hepatitis B sAg or PCR+ or hepatitis
        C ab or PCR+ 3.2.3 History of invasive Aspergillosis; presence of any other active,
        uncontrolled bacterial, viral or fungal infection 3.2.4 Uncontrolled CNS disease
        involvement 3.2.7 The recipient is a lactating female

        3.4 Donor Exclusion Criteria 3.4.1 Evidence of active infection or viral hepatitis 3.4.3
        Factors which place the donor at increased risk for complications from leukapheresis or
        G-CSF therapy 3.4.4 Lactating female 3.4.5 HIV positive
