    <textblock>
      The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), a large research study conducted in the United
      States, found that lifestyle intervention was effective in lowering risk for development of
      type 2 diabetes. It is important to evaluate the DPP lifestyle interventions in &quot;real world&quot;
      settings. The purpose of this project is to test an adapted version of the DPP lifestyle
      intervention in several community settings, including a worksite, a health care facility
      (primary care practice and local community centers dedicated to older adults.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Evidence that lifestyle intervention can prevent or delay the development of type 2 diabetes
      has been demonstrated in several clinical trials including a multi center clinical trial in
      the US, the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP). The challenge for public health is to
      translate this promising and proven behavioral intervention utilized in the DPP research
      effort to the &quot;real world&quot;, i.e., how to make it work in diverse communities in a variety of
      local settings at a reduced cost so that the maximal number of those at risk can benefit.

      The purpose of this application is to test a framework for translation of the DPP that
      includes: 1) demonstration of a training model for community health care professionals that
      includes initial training, support, and supervision in the delivery of a diabetes prevention
      curriculum and the needed behavioral lifestyle materials both initially and over time; 2)
      evaluation of a more compact and flexible DPP intervention program administered to each
      participant in a version of his or her choice (standard face-to-face group format or a DVD
      version of the same lifestyle intervention program content). These lifestyle intervention
      programs will be carried out in three different community settings; i.e. a health care
      practice, a worksite, and local centers in the community dedicated to healthy aging for
      older adults. Lastly, the cost-effectiveness analyses of the GLB intervention program in
      each of the three community settings will be tested.

    <description>Participants assigned to Current Intervention will receive the intervention described below immediately after randomization.
GLB-GROUP: Members of the original DPP lifestyle team collaborated to adapt the individual intervention to a group-based program and to condense the program from 16 individual sessions delivered over 24 weeks to 12 group sessions delivered over 12-14 weeks. As in the original DPP lifestyle program, the goals of the GLBintervention are to achieve and maintain a 7% weight loss, and to safely and progressively increase physical activity to 150 minutes per week of moderately intense physical activity similar to a brisk walk.
GLB-DVD: Consists of a series of taped sessions of a staged GLB group following a script which was developed to closely follow the original Group Lifestyle Balance. GLB-DVD covers all of the sessions of the Group Lifestyle Balance program; sessions are portrayed by professional actors.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Screening Eligibility Criteria: Non-diabetic men and women from the specific study
             sites in the local area who are age 18 years and older at the time of screening with
             a BMI of at least 25 kg/m2 are eligible for screening.

          -  Intervention Eligibility Criteria: Individuals attending screening who are found to
             have prediabetes AND/OR metabolic syndrome are eligible to participate in the
             intervention. Pre-diabetes is defined as having a fasting glucose &gt;100 mg/dL and
             &lt;126mg/dL. Metabolic syndrome is defined as having at least 3 of the 5 following risk
             factors:

               1. Waist circumference (&gt;40 inches men, &gt;35 inches women);

               2. Blood pressure &gt;130 mmHg (systolic) or &gt;85 mmHg (diastolic) OR history of
                  diagnosed hypertension

               3. Low HDL level (&lt;40mg/dL men, &lt;50 mg/dL women)

               4. Elevated triglyceride level &gt;150 mg/dL

               5. Fasting glucose &gt;100mg/dL and &lt;126mg/dL All individuals enrolled in the study
                  should have at least 6th grade reading/writing ability.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Screening Exclusionary Criteria: Women who are currently (or within past 6-weeks)
             pregnant or lactating, or any individual planning to leave the area before the end of
             the effort will be considered ineligible to participate in the screening.

          -  Intervention Exclusionary Criteria: Exclusionary criterion for intervention is the
             same as for screening. In addition, individuals who are on metformin or are
             identified as having diabetes as a result of the screening are not eligible.
             Individuals who have recently (within the past 3 months) initiated or changed their
             dosage of any blood pressure or lipid medication will also be excluded as being on an
             unstable regimen will complicate the interpretation of any blood pressure or lipid
             effects of the intervention.
