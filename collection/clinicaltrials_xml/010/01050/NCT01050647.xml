  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preterm birth is the leading cause of neonatal death and a significant cause of life long
      disability and health problems. It has been shown that the drug 17-hydroxyprogesterone
      caproate can help reduce the risk of preterm delivery in women with certain risk factors for
      preterm birth. We hope to learn whether this same medication can be used to prolong
      pregnancy in a group of patients in whom this medication has not been previously studied.
      Specifically, we hope to learn whether progesterone supplementation will delay delivery in
      women with pre-term, premature rupture of membranes (PPROM).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      When women present to either the Obstetrical clinic or labor and delivery with a complaint
      of possible preterm, premature rupture of membranes (PPROM), they will be examined by an
      obstetrician to either confirm or rule out this diagnosis. If they are diagnosed with PPROM,
      they will then be admitted to Lucile Packard Children's Hospital and treated with the normal
      protocol which includes receiving antibiotics, receiving steroids, being hospitalized until
      delivery, and having ongoing maternal and fetal monitoring for possible complications. The
      patients will be identified by their treating obstetricians as possible study candidates and
      asked by a member of the treatment team if they are potentially interested in participating
      in a research study. Subsequently, a member of the study team or the treating physician will
      approach the patient about participating in the trial. Those who choose to participate will
      receive the standard care protocol in addition to receiving the study medication. The study
      medication will be a weekly injection of either placebo or 17-hydroxyprogesterone caproate
      or placebo. The placebo medication (castor oil) was chosen as it has been used in previous
      studies as a placebo for 17-hydroxyprogesterone caproate. The choice of which medication the
      patient receives will be determined by a randomization table. Only the pharmacist will be
      aware of the medication that has been administered. The patient, members of the treatment
      team, and members of the study team will be blinded to the medication that is being
      administered. The timing of their delivery will be managed by the treating obstetrician
      according to standard medical practice. After delivery, the patient's and her infant's
      medical outcomes will be recorded for analysis.
