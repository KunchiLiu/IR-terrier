      To compare digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) with full field digital mammography (FFDM)
      regarding effectiveness as screening modalities.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mammography is the only approved method for breast cancer screening, but not all tumors can
      be detected with mammography. The main reason is overlapping structures that can either
      mimic or hide a tumor on a 2-dimensional image like mammography. Digital breast
      tomosynthesis, (DBT) is a 3-dimensional x-ray technique that has been developed during the
      last years. A tomographic technique like DBT, which reduces or eliminates the detrimental
      effect of over- and underlying tissue, can probably help to find more tumors. This study
      aims to investigate whether more breast cancers can be detected with DBT compared to full
      field digital mammography (FFDM) in population invited to screening. An interim analysis
      will be performed during 2013 including the first 7,500 women of the study cohort.

    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The number of breast cancers detected by DBT will be compared with the number detected by DM. A follow-up period of 24 months after the intervention period will provide information on the actual numbers of breast cancers in the study population through record linkage with the Swedish Cancer Registry. Sensitivity and specificity for breast cancer detection will be assessed for DBT and BT respectively.</description>

    <description>Women in the study will once undergo both standard FFDM screening (2-views) and DBT (1 view, MLO). This will result in a doubled radiation dose compared to only 2-view FFDM, which is the standard procedure for women in the screening program.</description>
