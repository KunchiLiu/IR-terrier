  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done to learn how seminal fluid affects the lining of the colon, and
      whether this might make it easier for HIV to get into the body and cause infection.

    <textblock>
      Design of effective rectal microbicides to prevent HIV infection requires an understanding
      of rectal HIV transmission and the location within the lower gastrointestinal (GI) tract
      (luminal and mucosal) of HIV (cell-free and cell-associated) following exposure to infected
      seminal fluid. These basic details of HIV transmission have yet to be determined in human
      subjects, yet they are essential to select microbicide candidates if they are to be
      rationally designed to achieve effective concentrations at sites of HIV transmission.
      Rational development of a rectal microbicide also requires an understanding of those factors
      that may contribute to colonic mucosal injury - potential confounders of microbicidal
      effect. Such factors include exposure to seminal fluid which has been shown in animal and in
      vitro studies to cause histologic and permeability changes that might facilitate HIV
      transmission.
