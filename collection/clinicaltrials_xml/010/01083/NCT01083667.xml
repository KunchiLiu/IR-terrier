      The objective of this study will be to evaluate the safety, tolerability and effect on SOD1
      levels by pyrimethamine in patients with familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease causing relentlessly
      progressive weakness of the arms, legs and respiratory muscles that is uniformly fatal.
      There are approximately 30,000 patients living with ALS in the United States. There is no
      treatment. The cause is uncertain in most patients. However, 3% of patients (&lt; 1000 in
      number) have a familial form of ALS (FALS), phenotypically identical to the sporadic
      illness, that is caused by a mutation in the gene coding for the free radical scavenging
      enzyme copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1). Inserting the SOD1 mutant gene into mice
      causes them to develop a disease closely resembling ALS.

      Inhibiting expression of the SOD1 gene prevents animals from developing the disease.
      Increasing or decreasing the number of mutated genes proportionately speeds or slows the
      progression of the disease. Therefore, reducing SOD1 levels in patients with SOD1 associated
      FALS may be a promising therapeutic approach. Through an extensive in vitro screening
      program for medications having the ability to reduce SOD1 levels, several molecules that
      reduce SOD1 protein levels are known. One of the most potent molecules is pyrimethamine, an
      FDA approved medication used for the treatment of malaria and toxoplasmosis. Pyrimethamine
      dramatically reduces SOD1 levels in mice and our preliminary studies show similar findings
      in humans. Our study's primary objective is to determine if familial ALS patients taking
      pyrimethamine will show a decline in SOD1 levels in the CSF by 15% or more. We will also
      determine if SOD1 and pyrimethamine are present in the blood and if the SOD-1 levels decline
      over the course of the study. We will also evaluate the safety and tolerability of
      pyrimethamine in patients with FALS. Secondary objectives will be to determine dose
      optimization for maximal SOD1 level reduction. We will also assess the feasibility of
      proceeding to phase II/III studies using pyrimethamine. Using futility methodology in which
      patients treated with pyrimethamine will be compared to historical controls, 40 patients
      with mild to moderate FALS and SOD1 mutations will receive up to 75 mg of pyrimethamine for
      36 weeks. A change of 15% in the slope of decline will be deemed significant with a power of
      80.7 percent. Change in ALS-FRS and quality of life will also be measured. A clinical effect
      realized in patients with FALS associated with an SOD1 mutation may serve as an important
      foundation toward finding a treatment for sporadic ALS.
