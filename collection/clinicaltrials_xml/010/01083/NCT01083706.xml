      This phase II trial studies how well azacitidine works in treating patients with relapsed
      myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), or acute myeloid
      leukemia (AML) who have undergone stem cell transplant. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as
      azacitidine, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing
      the cells or by stopping them from dividing.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To improve overall survival in patients with post-transplant relapse of myeloid
      malignancies.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive azacitidine subcutaneously (SC) or intravenously (IV) on days 1-7.
      Treatment repeats every 28 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  MDS, CMML or AML patients (as diagnosed by World Health Organization [WHO] criteria)
             with evidence of relapse or progression at &gt;= day 28 and &lt; day 100 post-transplant

          -  Recurrent or increased cytogenetic abnormalities by standard karyotype or
             fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) (the cytogenetic abnormalities must have
             been previously documented at some time point between diagnosis and date of stem cell
             transplant)

          -  Morphologic evidence of recurrence or increased abnormal myeloblasts in peripheral
             blood or marrow

          -  Flow Cytometric evidence of disease as determined by recurrent or increased abnormal
             myeloblasts in peripheral blood or marrow

          -  Extramedullary relapse (local radiotherapy will be allowed)

          -  MDS, CMML, or AML patients with persistent stable disease or persistent disease with
             regression at &gt;= day 28 and &lt; day 100 post-transplant; the inclusion of patients with
             persistent stable or persistent regressing disease in this protocol is not meant to
             advocate treatment; however, if the attending physician is inclined to offer
             treatment then these patients would be eligible for this study

          -  Persistence of cytogenetic abnormalities by standard karyotype or FISH

          -  Persistent morphologic evidence of abnormal myeloblasts (in patients with CMML the
             monoblastoid population is included) in peripheral blood or marrow

          -  Persistent flow cytometric evidence of abnormal myeloblasts (in patients with CMML
             the monoblastoid population is included) in peripheral blood or marrow

          -  Extramedullary persistence or regression

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Refractory disease at time of stem cell transplant; patients who received
             chemotherapy prior to transplant with no evidence of response by International
             Working Group (IWG) criteria

          -  &gt;= 10% bone marrow myeloblasts as measured by morphology

          -  Evidence of central nervous system (CNS) disease at time of relapse by morphology or
             flow (a diagnostic lumbar puncture [LP] is not required at time of relapse)

          -  Serum creatinine &gt; 2 x ULN (upper limit of normal)

          -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/ alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &gt; 2x ULN

          -  Performance status &gt; 2 (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group [ECOG] Scale)

          -  Patients with severe disease other than MDS, CMML or AML which would be expected to
             prevent compliance with treatment

          -  Patients with severe infections (pneumonia, sepsis, etc) within the 2 weeks prior to
             the anticipated start of protocol treatment
