    <textblock>
      The investigators would like to determine if using Dexmedetomidine alone or in a reduced
      dose can prevent or reduce the incidence of adverse effects, while providing adequate
      sedation, and respiratory stability as compared to propofol.

    <textblock>
      Alpha2 adrenergic receptor agonist have been used increasingly as a new armamentarium to
      provide sedative/hypnotic, analgesic, anxiolytic and sympatholytic effects in the
      perioperative settings. Dexmedetomidine, a selective and specific alpha2- adrenoceptor
      agonist has unique properties that makes it an almost ideal sedative drug for monitored
      anesthesia care in procedures under local or regional block. Unlike other drugs use for
      sedation, dexmedetomidine induces sedation that is similar to natural sleep (readily
      arousable) without causing respiratory depression. It attenuates the stress-induced
      sympathoadrenal response seen with laryngoscopy and intubation. It has anesthetic and opioid
      sparing effects, hence it may be a useful adjunct to general anesthesia and monitored
      anesthesia care in patients susceptible to narcotic induced respiratory depression. Another
      unique property of dexmedetomidine is that its sedative effect is reversible with
      Atipamezole. A previous study wherein dexmedetomidine has been used in procedures under
      local and regional block had shown that it provides effective sedation and better operating
      condition without significant respiratory depression. As a supplement to general anesthesia,
      it has been shown to provide stable hemodynamics. However, it is associated with some
      adverse events such as hypertension, hypotension and bradycardia, these commonly occur
      during bolus administration of the recommended dose of 1ug/kg. Post-operatively it can cause
      nausea and vomiting. Vitreoretinal surgery requires either an injection of local anesthetic
      within the muscle cone (retrobulbar block),or into the periorbital space (peribulbar block).
      This can be done individually or in combination. This surgery can also be done under a safer
      technique of retrobulbar block that is given using a sub-tenon's approach through a snip
      peritomy; a blunt cannula can be used with this technique mitigating the complications of
      retrobulbar hemorrhage or inadvertent injection into the optic nerve sheath or perforation
      of the globe using a sharp needle. The anesthetic goal is to provide an immobile and
      uncongested operative field. Hemodynamic stability of the patient is also important since
      some patients that require this procedure are elderly with co-morbid conditions such as
      hypertension, diabetes mellitus and CAD. In our study we would like to investigate if
      Dexmedetomidine alone and in a reduced dose can prevent or reduce the incidence of adverse
      effects, provide hemodynamic and respiratory stability, provide adequate sedation with
      patient and surgeon satisfaction and compare it with Propofol.

      Objectives:

      Primary:

        1. Adequate sedation

        2. Hemodynamic and respiratory stability

      Secondary:

        1. surgeon and subject satisfaction

        2. Incidence of nausea and vomiting

        3. Time to achieved &quot; street fitness &quot; status

        4. Post op hemodynamic stability
