      The objective of this study is to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of GSK Biologicals'
      investigational influenza vaccine GSK2340274A following one dose and following a second
      dose, using the same dosage as has been used in the H5N1 development program in Japanese
      children aged 10-17 years and an alternative dose in children aged 6 months to 9 years.

             administration within the first vaccination up to blood sampling at Day 42 and within
             30 days prior to blood sampling at Day 182, with the exception of seasonal influenza
             vaccine.

          -  Administration of any seasonal influenza vaccine within 14 days before vaccination on
             Day 0, or planned administration within the first vaccination up to blood sampling at

             infection) without fever may be enrolled at the discretion of the investigator.

          -  Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition based on
             medical history and physical examination (no laboratory testing required).

          -  Acute or chronic, clinically-significant pulmonary, cardiovascular, hepatic or renal
             functional abnormality, as determined by medical history and physical examination.

          -  Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the three months
             prior to the enrolment in this study, or planned during the study.
