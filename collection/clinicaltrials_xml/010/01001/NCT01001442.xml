      This Phase I/IIa clinical study is to test safety and anti-tumor activity of BT062 to define
      the best dose in treating patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma with
      multiple doses of BT062.

             Group diagnostic criteria

          -  Relapsed or relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma

          -  Previous treatment with both an immunomodulator and a proteosome inhibitor therapy

          -  Age ≥ 18 years

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (Zubrod) ≤ 2

          -  Ability to understand and willingness to sign a written informed consent document

          -  Ability to adhere with the study visit schedule and other protocol procedures

          -  Life expectancy of ≥ 12 weeks

          -  Normal organ and marrow function

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 3 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C)
             prior to day 1 or those who have not recovered from AEs due to agents administered
             more than 3 weeks earlier

          -  Treatment with another investigational agent during the study or within 4 weeks
             before day 1

          -  Major surgery within 4 weeks before day 1 (this does not include placement of
             vascular access device or tumor biopsies)

          -  Antineoplastic therapy with biological agents within 2 weeks before day 1

          -  Known HAHAs, HACAs, or HAMAs in response to previous MAb therapy

          -  Previous treatment with BT062

          -  Malignancy within 3 years before day 1, other than the trial indication multiple
             myeloma and excluding treated non-melanoma skin cancer, superficial bladder cancer
             and carcinoma in-situ of the cervix

          -  Severe diseases of skin, colon, esophagus, or eye within 1 year before day 1, as
             judged by the Investigator

             period

             immunodeficiency virus (HBV, HCV, or HIV) or any other concurrent disease which, in
             the judgment of the investigator, would make the subject inappropriate for enrollment
             into this study

          -  Acute or relevant abnormalities in electrocardiogram (ECG), as judged by the
             Investigator. These abnormalities can be defined as recent myocardial infarction,
             uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmias and/or pronounced disturbances of the electrical
             conduction system of the heart.

             day 1), unstable angina, uncontrolled congestive heart failure, uncontrolled
             hypertension (recurrent or persistent increases in systolic blood pressure ≥ 180 mm
             Hg or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 110 mm Hg), uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmias, grade
             3 (Lown Criteria) or greater cardiac toxicity from prior chemotherapy

          -  Unwillingness or inability to adhere to the requirements of the study

          -  Concomitant therapy with corticosteroids (except as indicated in low dose for other
             medical conditions such as inhaled steroid for asthma, topical use, or as
             premedication for administration of certain medications (including BT062) or blood
             products and for treatment of infusion reactions if needed)

          -  Concomitant antineoplastic therapies including chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or
             biological agents during the study

          -  Any condition, including laboratory abnormalities, that in the opinion of the
             Investigator places the subject at unacceptable risk if he or she are included in the
             study

          -  Breast-feeding

          -  Unwillingness to use an effective contraceptive method during the study and at least
             3 months after administration of study drug - unless subject is naturally infertile.
             (Acceptable contraceptive methods include oral or injectable contraceptives,
             intrauterine devices (IUD), double-barrier method, contraceptive patch, surgical
             sterilization, or condoms).

          -  Positive serum or urine pregnancy test
