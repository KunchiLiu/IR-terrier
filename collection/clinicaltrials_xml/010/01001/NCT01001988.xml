    <textblock>
      This is a follow-up of Study JEC02 (NCT 00735644) designed to characterize the persistence
      of neutralizing antibodies in the five years after vaccination with Japanese encephalitis
      chimeric vaccine (JE-CV).

      Primary Objective:

        -  To describe the yearly persistence of humoral immune response to Japanese encephalitis
           after a single dose of JE-CV
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Immunogenicity persistence will be determined in a subset of participants that previously
      received a single dose of Japanese encephalitis chimeric virus vaccine at age 12 to 18
      months in Study JEC02 (NCT 00735644). No vaccination will be given in this study.
