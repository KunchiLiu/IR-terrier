  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the clinical characteristics and hemodynamic
      profiles that predict exercise induced pulmonary hypertension in 15 patients with systemic
      sclerosis. The study also aims to determine the effectiveness of Ambrisentan for subjects
      with exercise induced Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH) with scleroderma

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current literature addresses therapies for patients with resting PAH only, diagnosed by
      right heart catheterization. However, the World Health Organization (WHO) also recognizes
      and defines exercise induced pulmonary arterial hypertension (ex-PAH), which may precede the
      development of resting PAH. The natural progression of PAH, especially during exercise, has
      not been well delineated. An exercise hemodynamic study previously showed that in normal
      healthy subjects the mean pulmonary pressure does not exceed 30mmHg even at maximal cardiac
      outputs. A prior study evaluated exercise Doppler echocardiography systemic sclerosis
      patients with normal resting echocardiograms, finding an abnormal response which was defined
      as an estimated right ventricular systolic pressure greater than 40 mmHg. In the same study,
      6.6% of the patients progressed to resting PAH over the followup period of 12 months.
      Limited data is available regarding the prevalence of ex-PAH in systemic sclerosis using
      right heart catheterization.

               -  Diffuse

               -  Sine Scleroderma

          2. Patients must be willing and able to undergo right heart catheterization with lower
             extremity cycle ergometry

          3. Mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) &gt; 30mmHg with exercise; PCWP ≤ 15mmHg on RHC at
             rest

          4. Men and women, ages 18 years of age or older

          5. Standard adjunctive medications will be allowed concurrently in this study at the
             discretion of the treating pulmonologist and rheumatologist, including digoxin,
             diuretics, anticoagulants (e.g. warfarin), stable immunosuppression or other
             anti-fibrotic therapy for at least one month prior to enrollment

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Resting PAH (mPAP &gt; 25mmHg) on right heart catheterization

          2. Other known causes of PAH including prior venous thromboembolism, HIV infection,
             chronic liver disease with portal hypertension, left ventricular systolic dysfunction
             (e.g. LVEF &lt; 40%), and congenital causes of PAH

             enrolled in another active clinical study.

          6. Use of any prostacyclin or endothelial receptor antagonist (ERA) within 30 days
             before study entry.

          7. Bed or wheel chair bound or a baseline 6-Minute Walk distance (6MWD) less than 150
             meters.

          8. Childbearing capable women who are unwilling or unable to use an acceptable method to
             avoid pregnancy for the entire study period.

          9. New York Heart Association (NYHA) Classification: Class IV
