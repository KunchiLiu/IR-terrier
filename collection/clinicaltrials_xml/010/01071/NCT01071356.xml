      A Stage 2 randomized clinical trial (RCT) is proposed to test the efficacy of a promising
      9-session model of motivational interviewing (MI) for methamphetamine (MA) dependence. Stage
      1 pilot testing indicated the intervention could be easily learned and implemented with
      fidelity. The sample of 30 MA dependent individuals over 9 weeks showed large reductions in
      MA use, good retention and consistent attendance. The tailored treatment approach draws upon
      our previous conceptual papers on MI as well as our experience with a variety of MI
      protocols, including two Clinical Trials Network (CTN) studies of MI. An innovative feature
      of the &quot;Higher Dose Motivational Enhancement Therapy&quot; manual is that it comprehensively
      addresses the issues of clients who have achieved sustained sobriety as well as those still
      using substances. Thus, it is designed to facilitate treatment entry and engagement as well
      as maintenance of the gains made in treatment. We posit that a more intensive MI model is
      necessary to address MA dependent individuals because they frequently present more serious
      problems than individuals with other substance dependencies and are more prone to lose the
      gains they make in treatment. MA dependent clients (N=220) will be recruited from New Leaf
      outpatient treatment in Lafayette, California. This site has a long history of conducting
      research, including participation in a multi-site study assessing treatment outcome of MA
      dependence. Study participants will be randomly assigned to 1) a single session of
      Motivational Interviewing (MI) plus 8 hours of health/nutrition education, or 2) the
      intensive 9-session MI intervention. In addition to the study interventions, both groups
      will receive standard outpatient treatment services at New Leaf. Study participants will be
      assessed weekly during the first 9 weeks of treatment for MA use. More extensive assessments
      will be conducted at treatment entry and 2-, 4-and 6-month follow-ups. Two therapists will
      be &quot;crossed&quot; and treat clients in both conditions. Primary outcome measures will be the
      Timeline Follow Back (TLFB) for MA use, MA urinalysis results, and retention in treatment.
      Secondary outcomes will include Addiction Severity Index scales and the TLFB for alcohol and
      other drugs. Exploratory analyses will examine HIV risk behaviors, motivation, and service
      utilization. A mediation model will build upon MI research by Moyers et al. (2005) and our
      construct of &quot;supportive confrontation&quot; (Polcin, et al., 2006) by testing whether feedback
      enhanced with warnings about the potential harm of MA use facilitates the therapeutic
      alliance, and whether this in turn facilitates better outcome. The significance of the study
      is highlighted by a recent meta-analysis finding higher doses of MI were associated with
      better outcomes (Burke et al., 2003). Conversely, several recent studies of standard single
      session MI with drug dependent clients questioned its effectiveness, while other studies
      found improvement in retention but not substance use. Clients with MA dependence are good
      candidates for a more intensive dose of MI because of their severe medical and psychosocial
      problems. Thus, it is time to test this promising, 9-session MI manual as a useful extension
      of standard MI for clients with MA dependence.

      This proposal responds to PA-07-111, &quot;Behavioral &amp; Integrative Treatment Development
      Program&quot; issued by the National Institute on Drug Abuse. Based on promising pilot data, we
      propose to test the efficacy of a 9-session Motivational Interviewing (MI) manual for
      treating methamphetamine (MA) dependence (Galloway, Polcin, Kielstein, Brown &amp; Mendelson,
      2007; Polcin, Galloway, Palmer &amp; Mains, 2004; Polcin, Brown &amp; Galloway, 2005). (See Appendix
      A for a copy of the Intensive and Standard Manuals and Appendix B for our papers describing
      the rationale for its structure). The study builds upon a progression in our work from
      initial conceptualization of a more intensive model of MI (Polcin, et al., 2004), to
      development of the &quot;Higher Dose Motivational Enhancement Therapy Manual&quot; (Polcin, et al.,
      2005), to presentation of very promising stage 1 pilot data (Galloway, et al, 2007). The
      proposed study represents a logical next step in this research program.

      In a meta-analysis of MI studies, Burke, Arkowitz &amp; Menchola (2003) found that higher doses
      of MI were associated with better outcome. Based on this finding, they called for new
      studies to compare the effectiveness of standard low dose and more intensive MI. This
      proposal responds to that call. To date, no direct comparisons between high and low
      intensity MI have been published, and we are not aware of any intensive manuals other than
      the one presented here.

      Our proposal addresses the aims of the NIDA Program Announcement (PA-07-111) well because
      the announcement calls for innovations and refinements of behavioral therapies for
      understudied populations. Clients with MA dependence are specifically identified as an
      understudied population in need of behavioral therapy trials. MA use is rampant in the
      Western U.S. and is growing in other parts of the country as well as oversees (Anglin et
      al., 2007; Rawson &amp; Condon, 2007). Studies have shown MA dependent individuals frequently
      present serious medical and psychiatric conditions that complicate treatment efforts
      (Rawson, et al., 2000, 2004). Based on excellent retention of clients during our pilot
      testing (see Pilot Study outcomes in the Preliminary Studies section), we hypothesize
      intensive MI will be particularly useful in improving high treatment dropout rates and low
      engagement among MA dependent clients. Behavioral interventions are particularly needed
      because there are currently no evidence based pharmacological protocols for treating MA
      dependence (Vocci &amp; Appel, 2007).

      In this proposal, our &quot;standard&quot; MI condition is a single session of manual based MI
      (Martino et al., 2006) plus eight hours of health/nutrition education using a structured
      educational format (Harris, 2003, 2006). A copy of both MI interventions can be found in
      Appendix A and a draft version of the nutrition/health intervention can be found in Appendix
      D. Our &quot;intensive&quot; MI condition refers to our 9-session manual intervention. As detailed in
      the Preliminary Studies Section, the development of our manual, methods for stage 1 pilot
      testing, and procedures for training therapists have followed recommendations made by
      Rounsaville, Carroll, and Onken (2001) and Carroll et al. (2006). As a stage 2 behavioral
      trial, the study includes an assessment of dose-response relationships and has a high
      likelihood of illuminating potential mechanisms of action within a single data collection
      site. Positive findings here will lead to stage 3 applications examining the effectiveness
      of the intervention in community-based settings using multi-site designs that would allow
      broader generalization.

      MA dependent participants will be recruited from the New Leaf outpatient treatment program
      in Lafayette, California. This data collection site has a history of successfully recruiting
      MA dependent clients into research protocols (e.g., Galloway, et. al., 2000; Rawson et. al.,
      2004). In addition to receiving one of the MI interventions, all participants will receive
      standard outpatient treatment offered at New Leaf.

      The specific aims and hypotheses are detailed below. In addition to comparing treatment
      conditions on outcome measures, in an overlaid naturalistic design we will build upon MI
      research examining mediators of outcome conducted by Moyers, Miller &amp; Hendickson (2005). We
      propose to assess the impact of a modified definition of feedback on the therapeutic
      alliance and in turn on MA use. Our definition of feedback includes providing objective
      information and personalized feedback to clients, but we add to this our construct of
      supportive confrontation (Polcin, 2006a; Polcin, Galloway &amp; Greenfield, 2006; Polcin,
      Galloway, Bostrom &amp; Greenfield, 2007; Polcin &amp; Greenfield, 2006). This concept entails
      providing warnings to the client about potential harm that might result if action is not
      taken to address problem areas. Supportive confrontation is an integral part of feedback in
      our MI interventions and we provide data in our Preliminary Studies (see the Measuring
      Confrontation during Recovery subheading) indicating that this type of confrontation is
      experienced as supportive, accurate and helpful (e.g. Polcin et al., 2006). We also suggest
      that our findings are consistent with the work of Moyers, et al. (2005), who found some
      confrontational interventions were associated with an enhanced therapeutic alliance when
      they were delivered from therapists with a high degree of skill. To avoid destructive
      interactions that Miller, Benefield and Tonigan (1993) found to be counterproductive (e.g.,
      argumentation) therapists will &quot;roll with resistance&quot; when encountering clients who react
      defensively or reject confrontational statements.

      Aim 1. To compare MA use and retention in treatment among clients receiving intensive and
      standard MI.

      Hypothesis 1.1: The intensive MI condition will demonstrate longer retention in treatment,
      fewer days of MA use, and fewer positive urine tests than the standard MI condition during
      the first 9 weeks of treatment.

      Hypothesis 1.2: The intensive MI condition will demonstrate fewer days of MA use and fewer
      positive urine tests than the standard MI condition at the 2-, 4-, and 6-month follow-ups.

      Aim 2. To compare Addiction Severity Index (ASI) scales among clients receiving intensive
      and standard MI.

      Hypothesis 2.1: ASI scores for clients in the intensive condition will be significantly
      lower than scores in the standard condition at 2-, 4-, and 6-month follow-ups.

      Aim 3. To assess whether feedback enhanced with supportive confrontation directly impacts
      outcome and impacts outcome indirectly through a stronger therapeutic alliance.

      Hypothesis 3.1: Higher Frequency/Extensiveness and Skill Level of Feedback enhanced with
      supportive confrontation will decrease MA use.

      Hypothesis 3.2: Higher Frequency/Extensiveness and Skill Level of Feedback enhanced with
      supportive confrontation will enhance the therapeutic alliance, which will in turn impact MA
      use.

      Exploratory Analyses

        1. We will make repeated measures comparisons between the two treatment conditions for use
           of alcohol and other drugs in addition to MA. These will include self-report measures
           as well as urine screens and breathalyzer results.

        2. We will compare intensive and standard MI on services utilization, which assesses use
           of additional formal treatment and informal recovery services such as self-help groups.

        3. We will compare longitudinal measures of motivation between the two conditions and
           assess whether higher motivation is associated with better outcome. 4) We will compare
           HIV risk behaviors among clients receiving intensive and standard MI.
