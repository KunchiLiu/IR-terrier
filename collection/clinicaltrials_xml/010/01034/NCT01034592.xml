  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, single arm, open-label study of oral lenalidomide monotherapy
      administered to red blood cell (RBC) transfusion dependent adult subjects with
      Diamond-Blackfan Anemia (DBA).

      Primary Objective: To evaluate the erythroid response rate as measured by rate of red blood
      cell transfusion independence (MDS IWG 2000 Criteria will be applied) Secondary Objective:
      1)To evaluate the tolerability and safety profile of lenalidomide in patients with DBA and
      other inherited marrow failure syndromes 2) To correlate response to lenalidomide with
      biologic surrogates of DBA including ribosomal protein mutation status, ex vivo erythroid
      colony growth, and microarray gene expression

      This pilot study will utilize an intra-patient dose escalation design. Cycles are 28 days in
      length. Subjects will receive lenalidomide 2.5 mg weekly during days 1-21 of cycle 1 (dose
      level 1). If patients do not experience any grade &gt;3 hematologic or non-hematologic
      toxicity, the dose will be increased to 2.5 mg twice weekly on days 1-21 of cycle 2 (dose
      level 2). If patients do not experience any grade &gt;3 hematologic or non-hematologic
      toxicity, the dose will be increased to 5 mg twice weekly on days 1-21 of cycle 3 (dose
      level 3). If patients do not experience any grade &gt;3 hematologic or non-hematologic
      toxicity, the dose will be increased to 5 mg thrice weekly on days 1-21 of cycle 4 (dose
      level 4). Patients who experience grade &gt;3 hematologic or non-hematologic toxicity at dose
      level 1 will be discontinued from study. Patients who experience grade &gt;3 hematologic or
      non-hematologic toxicity at dose level 2, 3, or 4 will have the lenalidomide held and dose
      reduced according to protocol dose interruption/modification algorithms (section 5.5.3). If
      at least a minor erythroid response is not achieved at the end of 8 cycles of treatment,
      patients will be discontinued from study. If a minor or major erythroid response is achieved
      after completion of 8 cycles of treatment, patients can continue study drug on a maintenance
      phase until loss of erythroid response (return to baseline hemoglobin or transfusion
      requirement) or unacceptable toxicity.

    <description>The primary efficacy endpoint is red blood cell (RBC) transfusion independence (duration must be â‰¥ 2 months) based on MDS IWG 2000 criteria. RBC transfusion independence is defined as the continuous absence of the intravenous infusion of any RBC transfusion during any consecutive &quot;rolling&quot; 56 days during the treatment period, e.g. days 1 to 56, days 2 to 57, days 3 to 58, etc.</description>
