      Comparison of blood glucose levels in patients with Type 1 diabetes when they take a new
      basal insulin analog and when they take insulin glargine
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prestudy treatment for patients who enter this study will be once daily insulin glargine
      along with mealtime insulins. Patients will continue to use their mealtime insulins
      throughout the study. The study will consist of 16 weeks of treatment and 4 weeks of
      follow-up. The 16 weeks of treatment will consist of two 8-week periods (Periods 1 and 2)
      during which patients will receive insulin glargine for 8 weeks and LY2605541 for 8 weeks in
      a random sequence. During the 4-week follow-up period, patients will return to insulin
      glargine or another basal insulin recommended by the investigator.
