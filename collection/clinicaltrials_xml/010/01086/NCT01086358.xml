  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers want to learn about work productivity after treatment of a migraine headache
      with your usual migraine medication as compared to your work productivity after treatment
      with Treximet.

      During this research subjects will take Treximet to treat 3 workday migraine attacks. For a
      second part of the research subjects will take their usual prescribed medication for 3
      workday migraine attacks. The subjects will complete questionnaires after treating each
      migraine.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A subject who is identified for study participation will participate in the screening and
      enrollment visit which determines the migraine treatment arm to which the subject will be
      randomized first. The subject will have a physical exam, vital signs recorded, health and
      medication questions asked, questionnaires completed and a headache diary explained and
      dispensed to the subject. If the subject is randomized to the Treximet treatment arm during
      the first part of the study, Treximet will be dispensed for use in treating workday
      migraines.

      The subject will call the study coordinator after treating a workday migraine and will
      report information about the migraine to the coordinator. When the subject has treated and
      reported on 3 migraines, the interim visit will be scheduled. The subject will bring the
      study diary and Treximet containers (if this was the arm the subject completed)to this
      visit. The subject will be asked about adverse events and medication changes as well as
      confirmation and review of the completed questionnaires and diaries from the prior weeks of
      study participation. The subject will be given new diaries and questionnaires (and Treximet
      to use if usual prescribed triptan was the treatment in the first arm) and repeat the
      activities to treat 3 more workday migraines.

      When the subject has notified the study coordinator about treating the 3rd workday migraine
      in this part of the study, the subject will be scheduled for the final study visit. The
      subject will bring the completed migraine diaries, completed questionnaires (and Treximet
      bottles if used during this arm) to the study visit. The subject will have the diaries and
      questionnaires reviewed, be asked about adverse events and medication changes and complete
      the final study questionnaires at this visit.
