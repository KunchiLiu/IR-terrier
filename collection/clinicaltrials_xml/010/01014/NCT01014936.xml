    <textblock>
      This is a an open-label, dose-escalation, first-in-man (FIM) study designed to explore
      MSC2156119J, in subjects with advanced solid tumors who have not responded to previous
      therapies or for whom no other therapies are available.

      Subjects will be assigned to one of two dosing regimens:

        -  Regimen 2: MSC2156119J three times per week (e.g., Days 1, 3, and 5) for three weeks
           (21-day cycle)

        -  Regimen 3: MSC2156119J every day for three weeks (21-day cycle)
