  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Procedures for ablation of persistent or long lasting atrial fibrillation are frequently
      long and require extensive ablation. Some electrophysiologists administer the drug ibutilide
      during these procedures to help organize the fibrillatory activity of the left atrium with
      the hope that this may shorten the length of the procedure and duration of ablation needed.
      Currently there is no standardized approach of administering the drug ibutilide during these
      procedures, thus the investigators cannot be certain that administering this drug does in
      fact facilitate the procedure. The aim of the MAGIC-AF Trial is to see if administering a
      standard dose of the drug ibutilide at a standard time in the procedure can allow for a
      reduction in the ablation procedure time. The investigators hypothesize that administering
      ibutilide during these procedures will result in a reduction in the procedure and ablation
      time required.

      Definition: Patients with persistent atrial fibrillation will be enrolled in this trial. All
      patients will be required to be in atrial fibrillation on the day of the procedure. Standard
      pulmonary vein (PV) isolation will be performed. Patients will be enrolled in the trial if
      they remain in atrial fibrillation after bi-directional block is obtained in the left and
      right sided PVs. At this point, patients will be randomized to receive 0.25mg of IV
      ibutilide or a placebo (normal saline). Patients will then undergo additional ablation with
      areas of complex fractionate electrograms (CFE) being targeted. The duration of additional
      CFE ablation and use of additional non-PV ablation (i.e. placement of linear lesions) will
      be left to the discretion of the operator. Patients will be followed for 1 year. The primary
      outcome assessed will be freedom from AF at 1 year.
