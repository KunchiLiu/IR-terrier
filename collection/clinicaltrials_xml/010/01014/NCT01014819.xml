  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Dermacorder measures the electric field in the skin. Malignant skin lesions disrupt the
      skin's normal electric field and this abnormal electric field can be detected by the
      Dermacorder. Therefore the investigators are testing the hypothesis that the Dermacorder can
      provide useful data to guide in the diagnosis of skin disease.

    <textblock>
      The Dermacorder is a non-invasive medical device that scans a probe over the skin about 200
      microns away from it and detects the electric field in the skin using capacitative coupling.
      Measurements of hundreds of malignant melanomas in mice indicated that these lesions
      generate an electric field that is easily detected. One previous clinical trial at the VA
      Medical Center in Hampton VA indicated an 80% reliability in predicting malignant lesions by
      their electric field. We have improved the Dermacorder over the past two years by enhancing
      its sensitivity and stability and must now determine if these improvements have improved its
      ability to detect malignant lesions. If the Dermacorder provides a reliable diagnosis of
      malignant lesions, its use could dramatically reduce the number of biopsies performed and
      this would significantly improve the quality of life for hundreds of thousands of Americans
      seeking the advice of dermatologists regarding suspicious lesions each year
