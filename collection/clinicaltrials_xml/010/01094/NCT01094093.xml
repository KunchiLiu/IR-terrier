          -  Normal or clinically acceptable physical examination (PE), clinical laboratory
             values, and ECG; clinically acceptable PE includes evidence of moderate to severe

          -  Diagnosis of plaque PsO for at least 6 months

          -  Moderate to severe plaque PsO defined by:

          -  A minimum PASI score of ≥ 10

          -  Psoriasis involving ≥ 10% of the Body Surface Area (BSA)

          -  Additional inclusion criteria apply

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Parts A - Healthy Volunteers:

          -  History or evidence of a clinically significant disorder (including psychiatric),
             condition or disease that would pose a risk to subject safety or interfere with the
             study evaluation, procedures or completion;

          -  Recent or on-going infection(s)

          -  Underlying condition(s) that predisposes the subject to infections

          -  History of malignancy of any type, other than in situ cervical cancer or surgically
             excised non-melanomatous skin cancers in past 5 years

          -  Additional exclusion criteria apply

        Part B - Psoriasis Subjects:

          -  History or evidence of a clinically significant disorder (including psychiatric),
             condition or disease that would pose a risk to subject safety or interfere with the
             study evaluation, procedures or completion;

          -  Recent or on-going infection(s)

          -  Underlying condition(s) that predisposes the subject to infections

          -  Guttate, pustular, or other non-plaque forms of PsO

          -  Evidence of skin conditions other than PsO (eg, eczema) that would interfere with
             evaluations of the effect of investigational product on psoriasis

          -  History of malignancy of any type, other than in situ cervical cancer or surgically
             excised non-melanomatous skin cancers in past 5 years
