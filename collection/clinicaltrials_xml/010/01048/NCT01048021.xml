  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is being conducted to study lung function and movement of the major
      muscle involved in breathing (the diaphragm) after a brachial plexus nerve block (nerve
      &quot;freezing&quot;). The purpose of this study is to find out what effects (good and bad) ultrasound
      guided nerve freezing has on the movement of the patient's diaphragm and their lung
      function.

      The potential advantage of ultrasound guidance will be a lesser chance of freezing the
      nerves that innervate the diaphragm and thus having less of an effect on lung function.

    <textblock>
      The supraclavicular approach to brachial plexus blockade was first described by Kulenkampf
      in 1911. With classic &quot;blind&quot; techniques, an incidence of pneumothorax has been reported
      ranging from 0.5-6.0%, limiting its widespread use, despite the belief that the
      supraclavicular approach is the most consistent, effective technique for anesthetizing the
      brachial plexus. With the advent of ultrasound guidance and real time visualization this
      risk has been minimized and a resurgence in utilization of this approach has occurred.
      Increased block success, diminished performance times, and lower anesthetic volumes have
      been observed with this technique when compared to nerve stimulator techniques. Despite
      these advantages, brachial plexus anesthesia above the clavicle is associated with
      diaphragmatic dysfunction and caution must be demonstrated in patients with respiratory
      disease. Interscalene brachial plexus blockade has been widely documented to produce a 100%
      incidence of hemidiaphragmatic paresis and an associated 25% mean reduction in forced vital
      capacity (FVC) with local anesthetic volumes ranging from 20 - 45mL 8-10, these parameters
      for supraclavicular brachial plexus blockage are not as well defined. Previous
      investigations report an incidence of hemidiaphragmatic paresis of 1-75% with
      supraclavicular brachial plexus blockade. This study will address whether diaphragmatic
      function and respiratory mechanics can be preserved with lower anesthetic volumes in
      ultrasound guided supraclavicular brachial plexus blockade.

    <description>Baseline values of forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), and peak expiratory flow rates (PEFR) will be measured in both the sitting and supine position. Ultrasound-guided supraclavicular brachial plexus blocks will be performed in the supine position with a Pajunk 22g block needle and nerve stimulator. The patients will receive local anesthetic injection with 15 mL of 0.75% Bupivicaine. A maximum of 3 cc of 5% Dextrose will be utilized as contrast to confirm needle tip placement and fluid spread prior to injection of the local anesthetic.
At 60 minutes post-injection, FEV1, FVC, and PEFR measurements will be taken in the sitting and supine position.</description>
