      Primary Objective:

        1. To evaluate the safety of orally administered Lactobacillus plantarum strains 299 and
           299v, a probiotic, in patients undergoing allogeneic myeloablative HSCT, as measured by
           incidence of Lactobacillus plantarum bacteremia.

      Secondary Objectives:

        1. To investigate the feasibility of administering Lactobacillus plantarum 299 and 299v to
           children and adolescents undergoing HSCT.

        2. To describe the overall incidence of bacteremia in HSCT patients who have been
           administered Lactobacillus plantarum.

        3. To describe the overall incidence of acute GVHD in HSCT patients who have been
           administered Lactobacillus plantarum

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Myeloablative regimens are the backbone of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT)
      and are associated with prolonged periods of cachexia/anorexia, nausea/vomiting, mucositis,
      and compromised gut integrity (CGI). The toxicities associated with HSCT often lead to
      prolonged periods of poor oral intake and may result in overt malnutrition. CGI decreases
      oral tolerance to foods, reduces Quality of Life (QOL) and functional status, delays the
      transition from the hospital to home setting, and increases the risk of the development of
      gut-derived infections. Probiotics are nutritional supplements that contain a defined amount
      of viable microorganisms and upon administration confer a benefit to the host. Clinical
      trials in adults receiving organ transplants have found probiotics decrease the incidence of
      infection, the duration of antibiotic use, the incidence of multiorgan failure and systemic
      inflammation. Children and adolescents undergoing HSCT, experience similar clinical
      challenges suggesting probiotics may have a therapeutic value in the setting of HSCT. We are
      proposing to evaluate the safety and feasibility of administering probiotics to children and
      adolescents undergoing HSCT.

             mismatched for a single HLA locus (class I or II), unrelated marrow or peripheral
             blood stem cell donor, or unrelated cord blood at least 4/6 antigen match (Class 1 or
             II).

             previous bowel perforations; previous episode of Grade 4 neutropenic colitis or
             typhlitis.

          -  Patients with inflammatory bowel syndrome, short small bowel syndrome, Crohns
             Disease, Ulcerative Colitis, and patients with a history of bowel resections.
