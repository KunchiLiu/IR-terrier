    <textblock>
      The research trial is testing the experimental treatment MSC1936369B in combination with
      Gemcitabine, in subjects with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The study will be run in
      two parts:

      Safety Run-In: Will determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and the recommended Phase II
      dose of MSC1936369B, when combined with gemcitabine, in subjects with metastatic pancreatic
      adenocarcinoma.

      Phase II: Will assess the anti-tumor activity of MSC1936369B combined with gemcitabine
      compared to gemcitabine alone as first line treatment in subjects with metastatic pancreatic
      adenocarcinoma.

    <description>Two different dosing regimens of MSC1936369B will be tested. QD-5 On/ 2 Off Regimen: MSC1936369B dose escalation treatment will be given orally once daily on Days 1 to 5 and then no medication on Days 6 and 7, that means 5 days on, 2 days off. Patients will continue on Days 8 to 12, 15 to 19 and 22 to 26, and so on up to Day 56 (first cycle) or Day 28 (all other cycles).
BID - Continuous Regimen: MSC1936369B dose escalation treatment will be given orally twice-per-day as continuous daily dosing from Days 1 to 28. There will be no treatment breaks, unless required due to toxicity or adverse events.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject has provided signed informed consent. Fully understands requirements of the
             trial and willing to comply with all trial visits and assessments.

          2. Histologically or cytologically confirmed metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas
             and availability of tumor sample.

          3. Evidence of disease (not necessarily measurable disease). Complete tumor assessment
             including chest X ray, CT scan of abdomen and other scans as necessary to document
             all sites of disease performed within 28 days prior to trial entry/randomization.

          4. Age ≥ 18 years.

          5. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative blood pregnancy test at the
             screening visit. For the purposes of this trial, women of childbearing potential is
             defined as: &quot;All female subjects after puberty unless they are post-menopausal for at
             least two years, are surgically sterile or are sexually inactive.&quot;

          6. Female subjects of childbearing potential and male subjects with female partners of
             childbearing potential must be willing to avoid pregnancy by using an adequate method
             of contraception for 2 weeks prior to screening, during and four weeks after the last
             dose of trial medication. Adequate contraception is defined as two barrier methods,
             or one barrier method with a spermicide, or intrauterine device. The use of hormonal
             contraceptives should be avoided in female subjects of childbearing potential due to
             a possible drug-drug interaction.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Bone marrow impairment as evidenced by hemoglobin &lt; 9.0 g/dL, neutrophil count &lt; 1.5
             x 10^9/L, platelets &lt; 100 x 10^9/L.

          2. Renal impairment as evidenced by serum creatinine &gt; 1.5 x upper limit of normal
             (ULN), and/or calculated creatinine clearance &lt; 60 mL/min.

          3. Liver function abnormality as defined by total bilirubin &gt; 1.5 x ULN, or AST/ALT &gt;
             2.5 x ULN, for subjects with liver involvement AST/ALT &gt; 5 x ULN.

          4. Serum calcium &gt; 1 x ULN.

          5. History of central nervous system (CNS) metastases, unless subject has been
             previously treated for CNS metastases, is stable by CT scan without evidence of
             cerebral edema, and has no requirements for corticosteroids or anticonvulsants.

          6. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS) greater than 1.

          7. Significant cardiac conduction abnormalities, including QTc prolongation of &gt; 480 ms
             and/or pacemaker.

          8. Retinal degenerative disease (hereditary retinal degeneration or age-related macular
             degeneration), history of uveitis or history of retinal vein occlusion.
