    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to understand if a drug called mesalamine helps to control
      inflammation associated with chronic beryllium disease (CBD). We hypothesize that in CBD
      subjects treated with prednisone, mesalamine treatment will enhance the immunosuppressive
      effects of prednisone, and thus reduce the immune response to beryllium.

      The overall goal of this study is to understand the role of oxidative stress as a potential
      therapeutic target in the pathogenesis of chronic beryllium disease (CBD). CBD is an
      inflammatory hypersensitivity lung disease that occurs in an estimated 800,000
      beryllium-exposed workers in the United Sates. CBD is characterized by the presence of
      pulmonary non-caseating granulomas with accumulation of macrophages and beryllium specific
      CD4+ T cells (Newman et al. 1998). Upon beryllium stimulation in vitro, beryllium specific
      CD4+ T cells proliferate and produce Th1 cytokines (i.e. TNF-α, IFN-γ, and IL-2) at
      unusually high levels (Tinkle et al. 1997). The molecular mechanism(s) by which beryllium
      regulates the chronic production of these cytokines is unknown. Exciting preliminary studies
      indicate that beryllium alters the redox status of T cells which may adversely modulate the
      immune response in CBD. Based on these points, a novel hypothesis is proposed: 1) oxidative
      stress enhances the T cells response to antigen and this enhancement may explain both the
      excessive cytokine response and the pathogenesis of pulmonary granulomas in CBD and; 2) an
      inherent difference in T cell antioxidant status is a critical factor in the pathogenesis of
      CBD. This proposal is a pilot clinical trial examining an approved drug for the treatment of
      ulcerative colitis (5-amino salicylic acid, 5-ASA), which has anti-inflammatory and
      antioxidant properties, as a potential new approach for CBD treatment. In this clinical
      trial, 40 CBD subjects already treated with prednisone, will be treated with either placebo
      or 5-ASA to determine it effects on the beryllium stimulated immune response in the lung by
      undergoing bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage and in blood by undergoing venipuncture
      before and after 6 weeks of treatment with 5-ASA. As a secondary outcome, we will also
      assess subjects clinical response to this short course of 5-ASA using spirometry.
      Bronchoscopies are optional. Patients have the option to participate by undergoing
      venipuncture and lung function tests only.
