  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this research study we are looking to see how effective BIBW 2992 is at suppressing the
      development of the T790M mutation in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Epidermal
      growth factor receptors (EGFR) are proteins found on the surface of some cancer cells that
      promote a growth signal. Some cancer drugs for NSCLC work to block this signal from reaching
      its target on the cancer cells which in turn may slow or stop the cancer from growing.
      However, many times patients with EGFR mutations will stop responding to these cancer drugs
      and develop drug-resistance because they have developed a specific EGFR mutation called
      T790M. BIBW 2992 my prevent the T790M mutation from becoming active and therefore slow
      disease progression.

      -  Participants will take tables of BIBW 2992 once a day during each cycle. Each cycle is
           28 days (4 weeks).

        -  Participants will come to the clinic on Day 1, 8 and 15 of Cycle 1. For Cycle 2 through
           8, they woll need to come to the clinic on Day 1. After Cycle 8, they will have study
           visits every 2 months.

        -  The following tests and procedures will be performed at these clinic visits: physical
           examination, routine blood tests, research blood samples, EKG (every fourth cycle
           starting cycle 5), ECHO or MUGA (every fourth cycle starting cycle 5), an assessment fo
           the tumor by CT or MRI scan (every 8 weeks).

        -  Participants may continue to participate in this research study as long as their tumor
           does not grow and their disease does not worsen and they do not have any severe side
           effects.

        -  Participants will have a tumor biopsy performed at the end of their participation in
           this study if their tumor is growing or if they have a new tumor. The purpose of this
           biopsy is to assess for the presence or the absence of the mutation T790M.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants must have histologically or cytologically confirmed stage IIIB, IV or
             recurrent non-small cell lung cancer

          -  A somatic mutation in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) must be present as
             documented by a CLIA-certified laboratory

          -  There must be radiographic measurable or evaluable disease

          -  Participants must be willing, at the time of signing consent, to agree to a future
             biopsy of their tumor tissue at the time of disease progression, provided such a
             biopsy is safe and feasible at that time.

          -  Performance status must be 0, 1 or 2 on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group scale

          -  18 years of age or older

          -  Normal organ and marrow function as outlined in the protocol

          -  Women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception
