    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out the roles of two specific gene families (the
      chitinase gene family and the TGFB family). We hypothesize that chitinases and TGFb pathway
      genes will be differentially expressed in the airways of non-asthmatic subjects and subjects
      with asthma. We further hypothesize that genetic variants in CHIT1, AMCase, and TGFb pathway
      genes that show associations with asthma and related phenotypes will change the expression
      and/or function of the protein of these genes in the airway in several ways, including the
      transcript numbers for full length genes and splice variants and, for the chitinase genes,
      the levels of chitinase activity in airway secretions.

      This is a cross-sectional study in patients with asthma and healthy controls in which we
      will analyze how the expression or function of CHIT1, AMCase, and TGFb pathway genes in the
      asthmatic airway is affected by genetic variation in these genes. We propose detailed
      phenotyping of the asthmatic subjects and the healthy controls, including collection of
      induced sputum, exhaled air and detailed physiologic measures including measures of airflow,
      lung volumes, and methacholine responsiveness as well as collection of airway cells and
      tissues by bronchoscopy. We will determine the relative expression of CHIT1 and AMCase in
      specific lung compartments (large airways, small airways, epithelial cells, macrophages) and
      the effects of genetic variants in CHIT1 and AMCase on expression of splice variants and
      levels of chitinase activity in the airway. These human samples will also allow us to
      determine if any of the multiple TGFb pathway genes analyzed show differential expression in
      the lung in asthma.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  History of asthma

          -  No use of oral or inhaled corticosteroids for the treatment of asthma in the past 6
             weeks

          -  Hyperreactivity to methacholine (PC20FEV1 Methacholine â‰¤ 8.0 mg/mL).

          -  At least one of the following symptoms, beta agonist use, or FEV1 criteria:

               -  Asthma symptoms on at least two days per week, or

               -  Beta agonist use on at least two days per week, or

               -  FEV1 &lt; 85% predicted

          -  Subjects must be non-smokers (patients who have never smoked or patients who have not
             smoked for 1 year and have a total pack-year smoking history &lt; 10 packs).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Cigarette smoking: Subjects must be non-smokers. Non smokers are defined as subjects
             who have never smoked or who have not smoked for 1 year and have a total pack-year
             smoking history &lt; 10 packs.

          -  Pregnant women

          -  Subjects with a history of a medical disease which in the opinion of the investigator
             may put the subject at extra risk from study-related procedures or because the
             disease may influence the results of the study.

          -  Healthy control subjects must have no history of asthma or allergic rhinitis

          -  Upper respiratory tract infection in the 4 weeks prior to enrollment in the study
