      The investigators plan to investigate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of the opioid
      antagonist naltrexone in Pathological Gambling. We hypothesize that naltrexone will be
      superior to placebo in reducing gambling urges and behavior, when combined with adjuvant
      non-pharmacological treatment as usual.

      Pathological gambling (PG) is a significant public health problem that can cause significant
      devastation for the individuals affected and their families. Those afflicted may experience
      unemployment, considerable debt, marital problems, family dysfunction, legal troubles,
      incarceration, and mental health issues including suicidality. Prevalence estimates vary but
      most estimates put it at between 1% and 2%, with annual costs of over $5 billion in the
      United States alone. Thus, PG is costly not only for the affected individuals and their
      families, but also for society in general.

      The current treatment as usual for PG is limited to various types of counseling,
      psychotherapy (e.g. cognitive behavioral therapy), and self-help groups such as Gamblers
      Anonymous. However, such treatment modalities have not been shown to be particularly
      effective. High rates or relapse are common and treatment attrition is often a concern.

      Currently, no drugs are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment
      of PG. Pharmacological treatment studies are still in their infancy but show considerable
      promise. Several placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trials have been conducted, but
      results have been limited by small sample sizes, short durations, exclusion of individuals
      with co-occurring disorders, and heterogeneity in treatment response measures and diagnostic
      criteria used for inclusion.

      Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have shown mixed results in PG. Some studies
      have suggested a benefit of active drug over placebo while other studies have not. Mood
      stabilizers have not been extensively studied but some reports suggest that certain
      patients, such as those with co-morbid bipolar spectrum disorders, may benefit from this
      type of medication. Atypical antipsychotics have also been tried with limited success and
      may be more appropriate for patients with co-occurring psychotic disorders.

      Opioid antagonists such as naltrexone and nalmefene, possibly through their modulation of
      the mesolimbic dopamine system, have demonstrated preliminary efficacy superior to placebo
      in treating PG. As with substance use disorders (SUD), it has been suggested that opioid
      antagonists may exert their therapeutic benefit by helping to reduce the appetitive urges or
      cravings present in symptomatology of addiction.

      From the neurochemical perspective, the pharmacological action of opioid antagonists is to
      block the effects of endogenous endorphins on mu-opioid receptors and may inhibit dopamine
      release in the nucleus accumbens. The mu-opioid system is generally thought to be involved
      in the mediation of hedonic, rewarding and reinforcing behaviors. The mu-opioid and
      mesolimbic pathways have been implicated in PG. For example, problem gamblers have been
      shown to have elevated levels of the endogenous opioid β-endorphin during gambling
      (Shinohara et al 1999).

      Naltrexone, a pure opioid antagonist, is an FDA-approved medication with two labeled
      indications. Firstly, for the blockade of the effects of exogenously administered opioids.
      And secondly, for the treatment of alcohol dependence. However, it's labeling is clear that
      it has not been shown to provide any therapeutic benefit except as part of an appropriate
      plan of management for addiction. Naltrexone has been investigated in PG in part due to its
      proposed ability to modulate the mesolimbic dopamine pathway. In preliminary studies, it has
      shown efficacy superior to placebo. As with clinical trials of alcohol dependence, it
      appears that naltrexone targets craving and urge states. In fact, naltrexone has shown to be
      particularly effective in individuals with stronger urges to gamble at treatment onset.

      A double-blind, placebo-controlled twelve-week investigation of naltrexone in 83 subjects
      (of which 45 were used for analysis) has been described(Kim et al 2001). Doses were
      initiated at 25 mg/day and titrated to a maximum dosage of 250 mg/day, with an average final
      dose of 187.50 mg/day (SD=96.45). Naltrexone was superior to placebo and was associated with
      statistically significant improvement in various measures of gambling severity, both
      self-reported and clinician-administered. A post hoc analysis showed that naltrexone was
      more effective in gamblers who reported more severe urges.

      More recently, an eighteen-week double-blind, placebo-controlled study of naltrexone for PG
      was reported(Grant et al 2008). Following a single-blinded one-week placebo lead-in,
      seventy-seven PG subjects were randomized to daily doses of 50mg, 100mg, or 150mg
      naltrexone. Unlike the previous shorter naltrexone study, this group included subjects with
      a range of co-occurring disorders. Outcomes did not significantly differ among the three
      dosages. The three active arms of the study were combined and compared to placebo. Analyses
      showed that naltrexone was more effective than placebo in decreasing PG severity, gambling
      urges, gambling behavior, and psychological functioning.

      Nalmefene hydrochloride is a similar-acting opioid antagonist. Contrary to naltrexone,
      nalmefene is not associated with possible liver toxicity. A sixteen-week multicenter,
      randomized, dose-ranging, double-blind, placebo-controlled investigation was conducted at 15
      outpatient treatment centers in the U.S., including at Yale(Grant et al 2006). Two hundred
      and seven male and female subjects were randomized to either 25mg, 50 mg, 100mg per day or
      to an equivalent placebo. All three active arms began with a one-week course of 25mg per
      day. This study did not include individuals with co-occurring disorders. Subjects assigned
      to the active arms showed statistically significant reductions in gambling severity. The
      50mg and 100mg doses resulted in intolerable side effects. It appears that the lower 25mg
      dose was the most efficacious. In fact, the 25mg dose was unique in terms of demonstrating
      superiority to placebo based on overall response to treatment as measures by the Clinical
      Global Impression (CGI) improvement scale.

      Based on previous encouraging results both at Yale and elsewhere, this study will attempt to
      replicate and extend the safety, tolerability, and efficacy findings of opioid antagonists
      in the management of PG. In addition, this study will provide much needed information
      regarding pharmacotherapy in conjunction with treatment as usual for PG.
