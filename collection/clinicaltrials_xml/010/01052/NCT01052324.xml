  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Remifentanil provides analgesia, suppresses airway reflex, has little effect on cognitive
      function. It can be used for conscious sedation during awake nasotracheal fiberoptic
      intubation. Target-controlled infusion is more reliable technique for maintaining optimal
      infusion rate than manual controlled infusion. The aim of this study is to determine the
      effect site concentration of remifentanil for successful conscious sedation during awake
      nasotracheal fiberoptic intubation.

    <description>After topical airway anesthesia with 10 % lidocaine in nostril and oropharyx, 1.5~2.0 mg of IV midazolam is injected. Awake nasotracheal fiberoptic intubation is performed with target-controlled infusion of remifentanil. Initial effect site concentration is 3.0 ng/ml. Smooth intubation is defined as absence of persistent cough with head elevation and defensive movement of extremities. In case of smooth intubation, effect site concentration is decreased by 0.5 ng/ml for the subsequent case. If intubation is not smooth, effect site concentration is increased by 0.5 ng/ml for the subsequent case. EC50 of remifentanil is determined using Dixon's up-and-down method.</description>
