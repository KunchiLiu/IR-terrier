      The purpose of this study is to:

        1. Study the pharmacokinetics and safety of daptomycin in children on hemodialysis (HD)
           and peritoneal dialysis (PD).

        2. Determine urine, HD and PD clearance of daptomycin.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Infectious and sepsis events are one of the most common complications in children with
      chronic kidney disease. The incidence is highest in children with an access for dialysis,
      especially in those with catheters. Staphylococcal species account for more than 50% of
      access infections (ranging from 58-77%). Failure to clear the infection results in loss of
      dialysis access.

      Daptomycin is a new antibiotic that provides coverage against most gram positive bacteria
      including methicillin-resistant staphylococci, vancomycin-intermediate Staphylococcus
      aureus, and vancomycin-resistant enterococci. The pharmacokinetics of daptomycin in children
      on dialysis, a group of patients who may need the medication the most, remains unknown.

      Children on HD or PD with suspected or confirmed infections due to gram-positive bacteria
      and who are concurrently treated with standard of care antibiotics will be considered for
      this study. Each patient will be given a onetime dose of Cubicin (daptomycin). After
      receiving daptomycin, serial blood samples along with dialysis effluent and urine (obtained
      from non-anuric patients) will be collected to evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile of the
      drug.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Children who are between 12-17 years of age who are either on HD or PD and whom the
             Pediatric Nephrology Section of the OU Children's Physicians Clinics provide care.

          -  In addition to children on chronic HD and PD therapy, patients newly initiated on HD
             and PD will also be recruited for this study.

          -  Patients with suspected or confirmed cases of dialysis related infection from
             gram-positive bacteria and who are receiving standard of care antibiotics.

          -  Patients will be eligible for enrollment if they were admitted as an inpatient to the
             Children's hospital or as an outpatient to the dialysis clinic

          -  Having used daptomycin in the 30 days preceding study entry

          -  Participating in any experimental procedure in the 30 days preceding study

          -  A history of muscular disease or neurological disease

          -  Baseline creatine phosphokinase (CPK) values equal to or greater than 1.5 times the
