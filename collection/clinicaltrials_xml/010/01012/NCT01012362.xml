    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I study; dose escalating the combination of pazopanib when taken daily and
      ixabepilone when administered on day 1 of a 3 week treatment course.

      Treatment with ixabepilone will be given at an assigned dose as a 3 hour intravenous
      infusion on day 1 of a 21 day cycle. Treatment with pazopanib will be given at an assigned
      dose by mouth once a day, beginning on day 1 and continuing daily. Disease assessment will
      be done every 2 cycles (6 weeks) with treatment continuing until disease progression,
      unacceptable toxicity or patient refusal.

             such therapy Effective with the August 2011 version of the protocol, enrollment is
             limited to squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (refer to section 1.4 for
             rationale). Note: Patients with a primary diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma will
             be eligible for enrollment into dose level 1 or 2 only, provided they met all other
             inclusion/exclusion criteria - the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for pazopanib
