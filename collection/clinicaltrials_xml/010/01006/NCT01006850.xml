      Research question: In adult emergency department (ED) patients to whom the attending ED
      physician has decided to administer intravenous opioid pain control:

        1. What is the incidence of serious adverse events, defined as the use of naloxone, up to
           a total of 2 hours after infusion of 2 mg IV hydromorphone?

        2. What is the incidence of other side effects (respiratory depression, hypotension,
           oxygen desaturation, nausea, vomiting, and pruritus) at 5, 15, 30 and 120 minutes post
           infusion of 2mg IV hydromorphone?

        3. What is the speed of onset of 2 mg IV hydromorphone? This will be measured by asking
           the patient for his NRS pain score at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 minutes post infusion of 2 mg
           IV hydromorphone.

        4. What is the incidence of administration of rescue medications?

        5. For those patients who decline to enter the study, what are their reasons for refusal
           (e.g. fear of becoming addicted)? The investigators believe this is yet another barrier
           to providing adequate pain relief for patients with acute severe pain.

      Introduction and Background: Pain is cited as the most frequent reason for visits to
      emergency departments (EDs) (McCaig, 2001). It can be estimated from the National Hospital
      Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, an annual survey of a representative sample of visits to US
      EDs, that there are 17 million visits per year to US EDs for specific complaints of pain, 29
      million visits including &quot;back symptoms&quot; and &quot;injuries not otherwise specified&quot; as well as
      specific mentions of pain. However it is widely acknowledged that pain is seriously
      under-treated in the ED as well as in other health care settings (Ducharme, 1996; Selbst,
      1990; Wilson, 1989). The concern regarding under-treatment is reflected in new standards for
      pain management developed by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare
      Organizations (JCAHO) requiring assessment of pain at triage in the ED and referring to pain
      measurement as the &quot;fifth vital sign&quot; (Philips, 2000).

      Proper pain management is a tremendous challenge to ED physicians as pain is not only a
      noxious experience but also a symptom of injury and disease that needs to be understood and
      appropriately treated. Further complicating pain management is the large interpersonal
      variability in pain perception and expression reflecting cultural, contextual, and
      individual differences between people. Reasons for under-treating pain include concern over
      side effects of opioids, perception of pain complaints as possible drug-seeking behavior,
      under-staffing, concern that analgesics will mask symptoms or delay early diagnosis and
      treatment, and contribute to risks of tolerance and dependence in vulnerable patients.

      Morphine has long been considered the gold standard in pain control. Hydromorphone is
      another powerful opioid that has been used extensively for the management of post-operative
      pain and morphine-resistant cancer-related pain. A recent Cochrane review on the use of
      hydromorphone found 32 studies that focused on acute pain (Quigley, 2003). Of these 32
      studies, only 9 involved intravenous forms of hydromorphone (Coda, 1997; Collins, 1996;
      Deutsch, 1968; Jasani, 1994; Liu, 1995; Mahler, 1975; Rapp, 1996; Searle, 1994; Urquhart,
      1988). Of these 8 studies, 5 involved patient controlled analgesia, and only 1 study
      compared IV hydromorphone to IV morphine (Mahler, 1975). The Cochrane review concludes that
      there are substantial gaps in the understanding of the efficacy and potency of
      hydromorphone.

      We have recently completed a study in non-elderly adult patients (IRB 04-08-225) that showed
      that weight-based IV hydromorphone provides better pain relief than weight-based IV
      morphine. This result was both statistically and clinically significant. We also
      demonstrated in this same study that IV hydromorphone has a faster onset and also provided
      statistically significant improvement in pain relief at 5 minutes as compared to IV
      morphine.

      Although weight-based dosing of medications is common in pediatrics, most emergency
      physicians use whole integer amounts of pain medications. IV hydromorphone is more potent
      than IV morphine, so the dosages given are much smaller. We therefore wish to give a
      standard 2 mg dose of IV hydromorphone to all non-elderly adult patients weighing at least
      150 lbs presenting to the ED with acute severe pain. We wish to examine the safety and speed
      of onset of hydromorphone using such a protocol.

      Our general thought is that to develop more evidence based practice, we need to generate
      more practice based evidence. This study attempts to do this as it is practiced based and
      very practical. We wish to take the drug as it comes (2mg Dilaudid in an ampule) and use all
      of it, thus alleviating the need to waste the excess opioid (and alleviating the need to
      find a second person to witness the wasting). We also wish to use a weight cutoff that
      everyone can remember (150 lbs). We believe that this protocol will provide greater pain
      relief and help address the issue of inadequate pain treatment, or &quot;oligoanalgesia&quot;, that is
      prominent in the literature (Sobel 2002, Wilson, 1989, Goldfrank 2000).

      Finally, in our multiple studies of pain conducted in the ED, we have found a relatively
      high rate of refusal to receive pain medication. We think this may represent a component to
      the problem of oligoanalgesia that is widespread in the ED. We wish to investigate the
      reasons for patient refusal to receiving parental opioid medications (fear of addiction,
      side effects, etc).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age greater than 21 years: Patients under the age of 21 are automatically triaged to
             the Children's Hospital at Montefiore Emergency Department, and hence cannot be
             enrolled in this study.

          2. Age less than 65 years of age: Patients age 65 and over will be excluded in this
             study as the effects on opioids on the elderly may be different than in the
             non-elderly.

          3. Pain with onset within 7 days: Pain within seven days is the definition of acute pain
             that has been used in ED literature.

          4. ED attending physician's judgment that patient's pain warrants use of morphine: The
             factors that influence the decision to use parenteral opioids are complex and
             extensive. An approach that is commonly taken to address the issue of patient
             selection in drug trials is to use a specific condition (e.g., renal colic) or
             treatment (e.g., post-hysterectomy) that would generally be thought to be
             appropriately treated with an opioid analgesic, thereby eliminating individual
             judgment about eligibility for the study. However in order to assess the role of
             hydromorphone with the widest generalizability in the ED setting, we decided to
             enroll patients with a variety of diagnoses, all with a complaint of acute pain.
             Opioids are not an appropriate treatment for all patients who present with a
             complaint of pain (e.g., gastroenteritis, migraine). Therefore, unless there is a
             restriction to patients with a specific diagnosis, either a comprehensive list of
             diagnoses and situations in which opioids are indicated must be specified, or
             clinical judgment needs to be used. We have opted for the latter alternative.

             The use of patients with a variety of diagnoses, and therefore heterogeneous painful
             stimuli, risks masking a treatment effect because of large inter-individual
             variability. There are several design and analytic factors (detailed below) that
             attenuate this risk: 1) a sufficiently large number of patients will be randomly
             assigned to each group so that the variety of painful stimuli will be equally
             distributed between treatment groups; 2) change in pain intensity and pain relief
             will be analyzed rather than absolute pain intensity or pain relief therefore
             reducing variability.

          5. Normal mental status: In order to provide measures of pain experienced the patient
             needs to have a normal mental status. Orientation to person, place and time will be
             used as an indicator of sufficiently normal mental status to participate in the
             study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Prior use of methadone: the effect of methadone use on the perception of acute pain
             is unknown and suspected to be altered. We feel that the needs of patients on
             methadone may exceed the dosage ceiling of 2mg that will be used for this study.
             Similar to sickle cell patients and chronic cancer patients, patients on methadone
             usually require significantly higher doses of opioids to control their pain. Thus, we
             feel that it would be unethical to restrict the dose that this subset of patients can
             receive.

          2. Use of other opioids or tramadol within past seven days: to avoid introducing bias
             related to opioid tolerance that may alter the response to the study medication
             thereby masking the medication's effect.

          3. Prior adverse reaction to hydromorphone.

          4. Chronic pain syndrome: frequently recurrent or daily pain for at least 3 months
             result in alteration in pain perception which is thought to be due to down-regulation
             of pain receptors. Examples of chronic pain syndromes include sickle cell anemia,
             osteoarthritis, fibromyalgia, migraine, and peripheral neuropathies.

          5. Alcohol intoxication: the presence of alcohol intoxication as judged by the treating
             physician may alter perception, report, and treatment of pain.

          6. SBP &lt;90 mm Hg: Hydromorphone can produce peripheral vasodilation that may result in
             orthostatic hypotension or syncope.

          7. Use of MAO inhibitors in past 30 days: MAOs have been reported to intensify the
             effects of at least one opioid drug causing anxiety, confusion and significant
             respiratory depression or coma.

          8. C02 measurement greater than 46: In accordance with a similar study (04-12-360),
             three subsets of patients will have their CO2 measured using a handheld capnometer
             prior to enrollment in the study. If the CO2 measurement is greater than 46, then the
             patient will be excluded from the study. The 3 subsets are as follows:

               1. All patients who have a history of COPD

               2. All patients who report a history of asthma together with greater than a 20
                  pack-year smoking history

               3. All patients reporting less than a 20 pack-year smoking history who are having
                  an asthma exacerbation
