      RATIONALE: Veliparib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as temozolomide. work in different
      ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from
      dividing. Giving veliparib together with temozolomide may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of
      giving veliparib together with temozolomide and to see how well it works in treating
      patients with recurrent glioblastoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To define the maximum-tolerated dose of the combination of temozolomide and veliparib
           in patients with recurrent glioblastoma previously or not treated with temozolomide.
           (Phase I*)

        -  To determine the efficacy of the combination of temozolomide and veliparib (using a
           5-day vs 21-day schedule) as measured by the 6-month progression-free survival rate in
           patients with recurrent glioblastoma previously treated with temozolomide. (Phase II*)

      Secondary

        -  To characterize the safety profile of the combination of temozolomide and veliparib.
           (Phase I*)

        -  To determine the adverse event profile and tolerability of the combination of
           temozolomide and veliparib (using a 5-day vs 21-day schedule) in patients with
           recurrent glioblastoma. (Phase II*)

        -  To determine the efficacy of the combination of temozolomide and veliparib (using a
           5-day vs 21-day schedule) as measured by objective response in patients with measurable
           disease. (Phase II*)

        -  To determine the overall survival of patients with measurable disease treated with the
           combination of temozolomide and veliparib (using a 5-day vs 21-day schedule). (Phase
           II*) NOTE: *Phase I was closed and phase II was opened on 3/6/12.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, phase I* dose-escalation study followed by a phase II*
      randomized study. Patients enrolled in the phase II portion are stratified according to
      bevacizumab status (bevacizumab-naive vs bevacizumab-failure), age (&lt; 50 years vs ≥ 50
      years), Karnofsky performance status (70-80% vs 90-100%), and recent resection (yes vs
      no/biopsy only).

        -  Phase I:* Patients receive oral temozolomide once daily and oral veliparib twice daily
           on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
           unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Phase II:* Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

             -  Arm I: Patients receive temozolomide and veliparib as in phase I.

             -  Arm II: Patients receive oral temozolomide once daily and oral veliparib twice
                daily on days 1-5. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease
                progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 12 weeks for 1 year,
      every 26 weeks for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.

      NOTE: *Phase I was closed and phase II was opened on 3/6/12.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 240 patients (28 for phase I* and 212 for phase II*) will be
      accrued for this study.

      NOTE: *Phase I was closed and phase II was opened on 3/6/12.
