  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted in two parts. Part 1 will determine whether administration of
      MK1775 in combination with topotecan and cisplatin is generally well-tolerated and causes
      clinical objective responses in patients with cervical cancer. Part 1 will also define the
      recommended Phase 2 dose and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the combination of MK1775 with
      topotecan and cisplatin. Part 2 of the study will evaluate whether treatment with MK1775 in
      combination with topotecan and cisplatin causes an improvement in progression-free survival
      (PFS) compared to treatment with topotecan and cisplatin alone and will further evaluate the
      tolerability of the combination treatment.
