  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dysfunctional voiding is often associated with constipation. The association of constipation
      with urologic pathologic processes has previously been described since the 1950's, but it
      was only over the past decade that clinicians have paid more attention to this relationship
      and recognized it existence with the term dysfunctional elimination syndrome (DES). This
      term is used to reflect the broad spectrum of functional disturbances that may affect the
      urinary tract including that of functional bowl disturbances and can be classified as
      follows:

        -  Functional disorder of filling: overactive bladder, over distention of bladder or
           insensate bladder, which may be associated with fecal impaction or rectal distention
           with infrequent bowel movements

        -  Functional disorder of emptying: over-recruitment of pelvic floor activity during
           voiding causing interrupted and/or incomplete emptying also associated with defecation
           difficulties due to non- relaxation of the puborectalis muscle, dyssynergic defecation
           or pain with defecation Several different therapeutic options have been used for
           patients with dysfunctional voiding mainly to decrease bladder outlet obstruction.
           These treatments including, alpha adrenergic antagonists, and botulinum toxin are less
           than optimum. One possible explanation for these drug failures includes the inability
           of these medications to relax the striated muscles of the pelvic floor necessary for
           voiding.

      To date there has been no data to evaluate the role of baclofen on the striated muscle of
      the external anal sphincter, essential in the defecation process.

      Outcome Measure(s)

        1. Efficacy of baclofen vs. placebo on dysfunctional voiding as measured with uroflometry
           and EMG; patients' symptoms score questionnaires and diaries.

        2. Efficacy of baclofen vs. placebo on the external anal sphincter muscle dysfunction via
           patient symptoms and questionnaire.

      3. The safety of baclofen in patients with dysfunctional voiding (urinary and defecatory).
