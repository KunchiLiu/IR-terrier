  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Given the potential of skin cleansing with chlorhexidine as a safe, feasible, and
      cost-effective intervention for reducing neonatal death in developing country settings, this
      study follows a trial already underway in Nepal to test the impact of a single cleansing of
      the skin with baby wipes cotaining chlorahexidine.

      This study is designed to test the impact of a single cleansing of the skin with 0.25% or
      4.0% Chlorhexidine wipes on qualitative and quantitative skin flora and skin condition in
      newborn infants. The study takes place in the Special Care Nursery at Dhaka Shishu Hospital
      in Dhaka, Bangladesh.
