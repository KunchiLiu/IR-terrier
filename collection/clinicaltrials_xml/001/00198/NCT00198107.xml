      symptoms associated with autism in children.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Autism is a developmental disability that affects every child differently. A wide range of
      symptoms accompany autism, including self-injurious behavior, severe aggression, and
      irritability. Despite an improved ability to reduce these symptoms, existing drug treatments
      continue to be associated with adverse side effects. Also, there is no existing drug
      treatment that reliably improves social behavior, the core deficit in autism. Studies on
      drug treatment combinations that are designed to reduce self-injurious behavior, aggression,
      and irritability and improve social behavior in children with autism have yet to be
      conducted. This study will address the above-mentioned limitations by evaluating
      aripiprazole in reducing self-injurious behavior, aggression, and irritability and by
      evaluating the addition of D-Cycloserine in improving social behavior among children with
      autism.

      This study will include three phases and an add-on component for some children. Participants
      will be randomly assigned to receive either aripiprazole or a placebo treatment for 8 weeks.
      Assessments measuring irritability, behavior, and social skills will be conducted at the end
      of this first phase. Those patients who respond well to aripiprazole will continue to
      receive aripiprazole treatment for another 16 weeks. This second phase will determine
      whether aripiprazole is associated with long-term maintenance of symptomatic improvement in
      patients who respond well to short-term treatment. Assessments will again be conducted at
      the end of this 16-week period. Those patients whose symptoms have stabilized and continue
      to improve while on aripiprazole will be asked to participate in the final phase of this
      study. During the last phase, D-Cycloserine will be added to the treatment regimen. Patients
      will take both aripiprazole and D-Cycloserine for an additional 8 weeks to determine if this
      combination of drug treatments results in improved social behavior once patients' aggression
      and self-injurious behavior have been stabilized with aripiprazole. At the end of this
      8-week period, participants will be assessed for any changes in behavior, irritability, or
      social skills. Results from this study may aid in developing safer and more effective drug
      treatments for children and adolescents with autism.

      Add-study: The Effects of Aripiprazole on Brain Circuitry in Children and Adolescents with
      Autism

      The purpose of this added phase is to conduct a double-blind, placebo-controlled fMRI study
      of brain activation and connectivity patterns before and after aripiprazole treatment with
      20 subjects who enter Study phase A. Children must be able to comply with the fMRI scan and
      a facial affect processing task. The child must have the ability to lie still during the
      scanning procedures and to comply with instructions. The aim is to determine the effects of
      aripiprazole treatment on amygdalar activation in response to a negative facial emotional
      task vs. a neutral (control) task. We that hypothesize that compared to placebo,
      aripiprazole treatment will increase amygdalar activation in response to a negative facial
      emotion task. In addition we hypothesize that increases in amygdalar activation will
      positively correlate with improvement on behavioral rating scales.
