    <textblock>
      Eligible subjects will be randomized to receive VALTREX® tablet 1g or placebo once daily for
      60 days in a two-way crossover study with a washout period of 7 days between treatment
      periods.

    <measure>Mean percent days of subclinical shedding as determined by type-specific Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) assay for Herpes Simplex Virus Type 2 (HSV-2)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 60 of each treatment period (up to 160 days)</time_frame>
    <description>Percent of subclinical days with HSV-2 shedding was defined for each participant as the percent of subclinical days with PCR data for which HSV-2 shedding was detected by a positive PCR result, that is (i.e.), the number of subclinical days with HSV-2 PCR shedding divided by total number of subclinical days with PCR data, multiplied by 100. For each participant, each study day was classified by PCR as 'shedding' or 'no shedding'; additionally each day will be classified as 'clinical' (i.e., presence of genital lesions) or 'subclinical&quot; (i.e., no genital lesions). Genital/anal-rectal swabs was collected daily during each entire 60-day treatment period of each period and the washout period.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean percent days of total HSV-2 shedding</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 60 of each treatment period (up to 160 days)</time_frame>
    <description>The percent of days with total (clinical and subclinical) HSV-2 shedding was defined as the percent of all days with PCR data for which HSV-2 shedding was detected. Mean percent of days with total HSV-2 shedding was the statistic used to summarize this endpoint for each treatment group. For each participant, each study day was classified by PCR as 'shedding' or 'no shedding'; additionally each day will be classified as 'clinical' (i.e., presence of genital lesions) or 'subclinical&quot; (i.e., no genital lesions). The total shedding rate is defined for each participant as the proportion of all days (clinical and subclinical) on treatment during which shedding was detected by PCR. Genital/anal-rectal swabs was collected daily during each entire 60-day treatment period of each period and the washout period.</description>

    <measure>Number of participants with no shedding</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 60 of each treatment period (up to 160 days)</time_frame>

    <measure>Mean log HSV-2 DNA copy number per day on days with subclinical shedding</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 60 of each treatment period (up to 160 days)</time_frame>
    <description>Average log HSV-2 DNA copy number per day on days with subclinical shedding was defined as the daily maximum HSV-2 DNA copy number was log transformed and averaged over all subclinical shedding days.</description>

Participants were educated on recognizing signs and symptoms of genital herpes infection at the screening/randomization visit.
