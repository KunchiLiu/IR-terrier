  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GM-CSF is an immunostimulant and preliminary data suggests it may change the natural history
      of prostate cancer and melanoma. This study looks at ability of GM-CSF to alter disease
      progression in women who have recurrent but asymptomatic recurrence of their ovarian cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open labeled, single arm phase II study of GM-CSF delivered daily without a break
      in a population of healthy and fit women with evidence of recurrent but asymptomatic
      mullerian malignancy (such as ovarian cancer, fallopian tube cancer, or primary peritoneal
      cancer). The main goal is to determine the time to treatment termination due to disease
      progression or toxicity.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients must have a history of histologic or cytologic diagnosis of primary ovarian,
        primary peritoneal or tubal carcinoma.

        Patients must be asymptomatic from their cancer.

        Patients must have evidence of recurrent carcinoma, as determined by:

          -  A rising CA-125 serum level greater than 35 U/mL or two successive rising values with
             the most recent value at least 3 times the nadir value.

          -  Or evidence of evaluable or measurable disease by x-ray or CT scan. Patients may not
             receive concurrent antineoplastic therapy. All hormonal therapy used as a treatment
             modality (i.e. tamoxifen, arimidex, etc) must be stopped prior to treatment on
             protocol.

        Age &gt; 18 years. ECOG performance status&lt; 2

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Known severe hypersensitivity to GM-CSF Other coexisting malignancies or malignancies
        diagnosed within the last 5 years, with the exception of basal cell carcinoma or cervical
        cancer in situ or concurrent superficial or stage IB endometrial carcinoma Concomitant use
        of anti-neoplastic therapy Treatment with a non-FDA approved or investigational drug
        within 30 days before Day 1 of trial treatment Any unresolved chronic toxicity greater
        then CTC grade 2 from previous anticancer therapy (except alopecia) Serum creatinine level
        greater than CTC grade 2 (Â£ 1.5 x ULN) Pregnancy or breast feeding (women of childbearing
        potential) Severe or uncontrolled systemic disease (e.g., unstable or uncompensated
        respiratory, cardiac, hepatic, or renal disease) as judged by the investigator.

        Significant clinical disorder or laboratory finding that makes it potentially unsafe for
        the subject to participate in the trial as judged by the investigator.

        Patients currently receiving other investigational antineoplastic agents, on systemic
        chemotherapy or under radiation therapy treatment.

        Patients with clinical and/or radiographic evidence of current or impending bowel
        obstruction.

        Performance status &lt; 1 Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written
        informed consent document.
