  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate skin graft adherence and wound healing in
      burn patients to evaluate whether FS 4IU VH S/D is equivalent or superior to the current
      standard of care (staples). The primary endpoint is achievement of complete (100%) wound
      closure within 28 days.
