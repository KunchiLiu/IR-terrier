      Monoclonal antibodies, such as yttrium Y 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan, can block find cancer
      cells and either kill them or carry cancer-killing substances to them without harming normal
      cells. Giving monoclonal antibodies, low doses of chemotherapy, such as fludarabine
      phosphate, and low dose total-body radiation therapy before a donor peripheral stem cell
      transplant helps stop the growth of cancer cells and also stops the patient's immune system
      from rejecting the donor's stem cells. The donated stem cells may replace the patient's
      immune cells and help destroy any remaining cancer cells (graft-versus-tumor effect).
      Sometimes the transplanted cells from a donor can also make an immune response against the
      body's normal cells. Giving cyclosporine or mycophenolate mofetil after the transplant may
      stop this from happening

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the feasibility, safety, and potential efficacy of treating patients with
      B-Cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) with 90Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan, combined with HLA-matched
      related or unrelated donor hematopoietic cell transplantation.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive rituximab intravenously (IV) followed by, no more than 4 hours
      later, indium In 111 ibritumomab tiuxetan (for imaging) IV over 10 minutes on day -21.
      Patients undergo gamma camera imaging on day -19. Patients receive rituximab IV followed by,
      no more than 4 hours later, yttrium Y 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan IV over 10 minutes on day -14.
      Patients also receive fludarabine phosphate IV over 30-60 minutes on days -7 to -5 and
      undergo low-dose total-body irradiation (TBI) on day 0. After TBI, patients undergo
      allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) on day 0. Patients who undergo
      PBSCT from a related donor receive oral cyclosporine twice daily on days -3 to 56 followed
      by a taper to day 180 in the absence of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). These patients
      also receive oral mycophenolate mofetil twice daily on days 0 to 27. Patients who undergo
      PBSCT from an unrelated donor receive oral cyclosporine twice daily on days -3 to 100
      followed by a taper over 11 weeks in the absence of GVHD. These patients also receive oral
      mycophenolate mofetil three times daily on days 0 to 40 followed by a taper to day 96.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months, and
      then annually thereafter.
