  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Little is known about the best ways to help young people stop smoking. Bupropion (a
      medication marketed as Wellbutrin or Zyban) has proved helpful in treating adult smokers.
      The purpose of this study is to determine if bupropion is also effective in treating smokers
      between the ages of 12 and 25 years old. This study also compares the effectiveness of
      bupropion used as a supplement to behavioral treatment versus behavioral treatment used
      alone. In addition, the study evaluates whether hormonal response to stress measured prior
      to the start of treatment predicts whether individuals respond well to treatment with
      medication.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cigarette smoking and other forms of tobacco exposure are one of the leading preventable
      causes of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Most smokers begin smoking during
      adolescence, and though they seem motivated to quit smoking, they frequently fail. Although
      behavioral treatments are available, they have not been very successful in past studies.

      Depressed adults may have more difficulty quitting smoking than non depressed adults; this
      finding may also apply to depressed youth. The purpose of this study is to determine the
      effectiveness of bupropion in combination with standard behavioral treatment in helping
      young smokers quit, as compared to behavioral treatment alone. Finally, the study examines
      whether hormonal response to stress measured prior to treatment initiation predicts whether
      individuals respond well to treatment with bupropion.

      Participants in this double-blind study will be randomly assigned to receive either
      bupropion or placebo. Both groups will receive behavioral treatment. The trial will last for
      9 weeks, with weekly study visits. Study visits will last 30 minutes to 1 hour and will
      include medication monitoring, self-reported and biological measures of smoking, and
      behavioral treatment. Participants will have follow-up visits six months after completion of
      treatment and at yearly intervals for up to 4 years.
