  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomised phase III trial, to compare the efficacy and safety
      profiles of two types of adjuvant chemotherapy regimens for HER2 negative, node positive
      breast cancer patients.

      Control Arm: This includes 4 cycles of EC 90/600 mg/m2 day 1 every 3 weeks, followed by 4
      cycles of T 100 mg/m2 day 1 every 3 weeks.

      Experimental Arm: This includes 4 cycles of ET 90/75 mg/m2, day 1 every 3 weeks, followed by
      4 cycles of capecitabine 1250 mg/m2, twice a day, via oral intake, for 14 days, and then a
      one-week rest period.

      Premenopausal women with hormone receptor positive tumours must receive 5 years of tamoxifen
      after the end of chemotherapy.

      Postmenopausal women with hormone receptor positive tumours can receive tamoxifen or
      aromatase inhibitors (or both) after the end of chemotherapy.

      Patients may receive radiotherapy when clinically indicated. Estimation of the 5-year
      disease-free survival in the control arm is 72%. The experimental arm is expected to
      increase the 5-year disease-free survival by 7% (up to 79%). With an alpha error of 0.05 and
      80% power, 592 patients per arm are needed. Assuming a 17% post-randomization drop-out, 691
      patients per arm are needed.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Written informed consent.

          -  Histological diagnosis of operable invasive adenocarcinoma of the breast (T1-T3).
             Tumours must be HER2 negative. Time window between surgery and study randomization
             must be less than 60 days.

          -  Surgery must consist of mastectomy or conservative surgery with axillary lymph node
             dissection. Margins free of disease and ductal carcinomas in situ (DCIS) are
             required. Lobular carcinoma is not considered a positive margin.

          -  Positive axillary lymph nodes defined as at least 1 out of 10 nodes with presence of
             disease. If sentinel node technique is used, sentinel node can be the only node
             affected. Patients belonging to the following classifications are eligible: pN1a,
             pN2a, pN3a.

          -  Status of hormone receptors in primary tumour. Results must be available before the
             end of adjuvant chemotherapy.

          -  Patients must not present evidence of metastatic disease. Status of HER2 in primary
             tumour, known before randomization. Patients with immune histochemistry (IHC) 0 or +1
             are eligible. For patients with ICH 2+, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is
             mandatory and result must be negative.

          -  Age &gt;= 18 and &lt;= 70 years old.

          -  Performance status (Karnofsky index) &gt;= 80.

          -  Normal electrocardiogram (EKG) in the 12 weeks prior to randomization. If needed,
             normal cardiac function must be confirmed by left ventricular ejection fraction
             (LVEF).

          -  Laboratory results (within 14 days prior to randomization):

             pain, and/or alkaline phosphatase elevation, a bone scintigraphy is mandatory. This
             test is recommended for all patients. Other tests: as clinically indicated.
