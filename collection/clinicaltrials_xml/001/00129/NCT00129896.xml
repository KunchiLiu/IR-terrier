      This is an open-label study to assess the efficacy and tolerability of the combination
      Myocet®/Taxotere®/Herceptin® as primary treatment for HER2 positive breast cancer patients.
      HER2 status will be confirmed centrally by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH).

      Phase I: Initial doses will be:

      Myocet: 50-60 mg/m² day 1 every 3 weeks; Taxotere 60-75 mg/m² day 1 every 3 weeks; and
      Herceptin (4) 2 mg/kg weekly.

      Sample size will depend on the number of patients recruited during dose escalation. Three
      patients must be recruited in each dose level. If one out of three experiences a
      dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), 3 more patients must be recruited in the same dose level.
      Considering that there are 4 dose levels to be tested, the estimated number of patients is 9
      to 24. Patients receiving the recommended dose (RD) will be incorporated into phase II of
      the study.

      Phase II: The average pathological complete response rate reported in other trials is around
      11%. The investigators expect to achieve an increase of 14% on this rate; that is, they
      expect a pathological response rate of 25%. With a= 0.05 and β=0.2, 18 patients are
      initially needed. If at least 3 pathological complete responses are achieved, recruitment
      will continue to up to 53 patients. At least 10 pathological complete responses are needed
      to probe the hypothesis. Considering a 10% post-randomization drop-out rate, a total of 59
      patients must be recruited for the trial.
