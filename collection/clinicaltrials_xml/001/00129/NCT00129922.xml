  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The efficacy of adjuvant chemotherapy is limited in patients with a high risk of recurrence.

      Also, for axillary positive node patients, optimum chemotherapy regimens are still under
      discussion. Some previous studies suggest that, in the subset of node-positive patients,
      treatments based on sequential administration of anthracyclines and taxanes are more
      efficient. Paclitaxel dose-dense (weekly) administration renders an improved therapeutic
      index (activity/toxicity).

      The study is designed to compare 6 courses of FEC scheme (600/90/600), a combination of
      proven efficacy in node positive breast cancer patients, versus 4 FEC courses followed by 8
      weekly paclitaxel administrations (100mg/m2).

      The study hypothesis is that 5-year disease-free survival in the control arm will be 60%.
      The investigators expect to increase this by 8% with the experimental treatment. With an
      alpha error of 0.05, 80% power, and a post-randomization estimated drop-out rate of 10%,
      1250 patients are needed, 625 per arm.
