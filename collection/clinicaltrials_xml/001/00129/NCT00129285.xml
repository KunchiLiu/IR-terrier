    <textblock>
      Despite years of active research, there are still no approved medications for the treatment
      of cocaine dependence. The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of
      modafinil in treating cocaine-dependent individuals.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Modafinil is a glutamate-enhancing agent that blunts cocaine euphoria under controlled
      conditions. Due to its stimulant-like properties, modafinil is also likely to relieve severe
      cocaine withdrawal symptoms. In turn, this may lead to better clinical outcomes. The purpose
      of this study is to determine whether modafinil improves abstinence during early recovery
      from cocaine dependence.

      This 6-month, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial will enroll 210 participants with
      current DSM-IV diagnoses of cocaine dependence. Treatment will occur for 8 weeks.
      Participants will be randomly assigned to receive a single morning dose of low-dose
      modafinil (200 mg/day), high-dose modafinil (400 mg/day), or matching placebo tablets. In
      addition, each week participants will receive manual-guided cognitive behavioral therapy at
      the Treatment Research Center. At the end of the 8-week treatment period, modafinil or
      placebo will be abruptly discontinued. One week following, an end of medication evaluation
      will occur. In addition to this, two follow-up evaluations will take place 3 and 5 months
      after initial randomization. Efforts will be made to continue evaluation of subjects who
      decide to discontinue the modafinil treatment. Urine benzoylecgonine levels will be used to
      measure cocaine abstinence. Craving, withdrawal, retention, and adverse events will also be
      evaluated.
