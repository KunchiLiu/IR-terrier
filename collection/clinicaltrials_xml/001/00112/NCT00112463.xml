    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well depsipeptide (romidepsin) works in treating patients
      with metastatic or unresectable soft tissue sarcoma. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as
      depsipeptide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing
      the cells or by stopping them from dividing.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the response rates of metastatic or unresectable soft tissue sarcomas to
      single-agent depsipeptide.

      II. To estimate the time to progression of metastatic or unresectable soft tissue sarcomas
      to single-agent depsipeptide.

      III. To evaluate the scope and extent of acute toxicities associated with single-agent
      depsipeptide when given to patients with soft tissue sarcomas.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive depsipeptide (romidepsin) intravenously (IV) over 4 hours on days 1, 8, and
      15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients achieving a complete response (CR) receive 6 additional courses beyond
      documentation of CR.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 2 months.
