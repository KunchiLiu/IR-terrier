      RATIONALE: Vaccines made from a gene-modified virus may help the body build an effective
      immune response to kill tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well vaccine therapy works in treating patients
      with stage II, stage III, or stage IV ovarian epithelial, fallopian tube, or peritoneal
      cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the remission rate in patients with NY-ESO-1 or LAGE-1 expressing stage II-IV
           ovarian epithelial, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who are still in
           complete clinical remission 12 months after initial documentation of remission treated
           with vaccine therapy comprising vaccinia-NY-ESO-1 vaccine and fowlpox-NY-ESO-1 vaccine.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the NY-ESO-1 specific cellular and humoral immunity, by evaluating NY-ESO-1
           specific antibody and CD8+ T cells induced by this regimen, in these patients.

        -  Correlate time to treatment failure with vaccine-induced NY-ESO-1 antigen specific
           cellular or humoral immunity in these patients.

        -  Determine the safety of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label study.

      Patients receive vaccinia-NY-ESO-1 vaccine intradermally on day 1 and fowlpox-NY-ESO-1
      vaccine subcutaneously on days 29, 57, 85, 113, 141, and 169 in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 1 month, every 2 months for 1
      year, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 22 patients will be accrued for this study within 14-36
      months.
