  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate a formal curriculum for teaching basic procedures to
      pediatric interns at Children's Hospital, Boston. The incoming class of interns for the
      academic year '05-06 will be randomly assigned to participate in the curriculum or not. Four
      procedures including intravenous catheter insertion, venipuncture (blood drawing),
      bag-and-mask ventilation, and lumbar puncture (spinal tap) will be taught. Interns will then
      be tested on their ability to perform these skills on anatomic models and on live patients.
      Our hypothesis is that interns receiving the formal curriculum will be more confident and
      more successful in performing these procedures than those who do not.
