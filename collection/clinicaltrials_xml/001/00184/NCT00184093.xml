  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is first to establish what is the ideal dose of gemcitabine, a
      chemotherapy agent, when given in combination with radiation. In addition, the investigators
      want to determine the side effects and the effectiveness of this combination. The
      investigators will also study several markers to try to identify markers or tests that will
      predict which patients will benefit more from this treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with histologically confirmed bulky stage Ib or stage IIa cervical cancer.
             Bulky stage Ib disease is defined as tumor mass greater than 4 cms in diameter.

          -  Cervical lesion which is measurable by physical examination.

          -  No prior therapy for invasive cervical cancer.

          -  GOG performance status 0-2

          -  Signed informed consent

          -  Patients must have adequate:

               -  Bone marrow function: absolute granulocyte count &gt; or = to 1500, platelet count
                  &gt; 100,000.

               -  Renal function: creatinine &lt; or = to 1.8 mg/dl

               -  Hepatic function: bilirubin &lt; or = to 1.5 x normal, SGOT and alkaline
                  phosphatase &lt; or = to 3 x normal

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a history of prior malignancy, except adequately treated basal cell or
             squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, or other cancer for which the patient has been
             disease free for at least five years.

          -  Pregnant or lactating women. Women of reproductive age may not participate unless
             they have agreed to use an effective method of birth control.

          -  Patients with uncontrolled infection.

          -  Patients who are HIV positive

          -  Patients with psychiatric or social conditions that would interfere with consent or
             follow-up.

          -  Patients with any other severe concurrent disease, which, in the judgment of the
             investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study.
