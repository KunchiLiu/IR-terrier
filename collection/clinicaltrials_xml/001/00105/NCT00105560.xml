      RATIONALE: Specialized radiation therapy that delivers radiation directly to the area where
      a tumor was surgically removed may kill any remaining tumor cells and cause less damage to
      normal tissue.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well proton beam radiation therapy works in
      treating young patients who have undergone biopsy or surgery for medulloblastoma or
      pineoblastoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the 3-year incidence and severity of ototoxicity in young patients with
           medulloblastoma or pineoblastoma treated with adjuvant proton beam craniospinal and
           posterior fossa radiotherapy.

        -  Determine the incidence of primary hypothyroidism and other endocrine dysfunction
           (neuroendocrine and end organ) in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the incidence and severity of neurocognitive abnormalities in patients
           treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the acute side effects of this regimen, including esophagitis, upper and
           lower gastrointestinal tract disease, and weight loss, in these patients.

        -  Determine the 3-year progression-free survival rate of patients treated with this
           regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to risk (standard vs high).

      Patients receive proton beam craniospinal and posterior fossa radiotherapy once daily 5 days
      a week for 6-8 weeks*.

      NOTE: *Unless otherwise specified by a co-existing protocol.

      Patients undergo neurocognitive evaluation at baseline or within 3 months after completion
      of radiotherapy and then at 1, 3, and 5 years. Patients also undergo endocrine evaluation at
      baseline and then annually for 5 years; and audiology evaluation at baseline, before each
      course of cisplatin-based chemotherapy (if receiving this), and then annually for 5 years.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3-6 months for 2-5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients will be accrued for this study.
