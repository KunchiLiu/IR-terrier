      This study will determine the efficacy of escitalopram (LexaproÂ®), an anti-anxiety drug, for
      generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and the ways genetics affect response to treatment for
      GAD in elderly individuals.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      GAD is a serious public health issue; particularly among the elderly, prevalence of the
      condition is high, and functional burden on those with the illness is significant. GAD is
      associated with irregular levels of neurotransmitters, chemicals that carry messages across
      nerve endings. Serotonin is a neurotransmitter that helps regulate mood and emotions;
      increased levels of serotonin have been shown to reduce anxiety. Standard treatment for GAD
      typically involves selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), drugs that reduce
      serotonin re-entry into nerve cells. Escitalopram is an SSRI that is well tolerated and
      highly specific for the serotonin transporter (SERT). The primary aim of this study is to
      examine the efficacy of escitalopram in reducing anxiety symptoms among elderly GAD
      patients. Additional aims include examining the efficacy of escitalopram for improving
      function, quality of life, and neuropsychological functioning, and examining whether genetic
      variation in the SERT gene influences these participants' response to treatment.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either escitalopram or placebo for 12
      weeks (there is also a 12 week open label extension in which all participants will receive
      escitalopram). Participants will have weekly/biweekly study visits; during these visits,
      participants will complete self-report questionnaires on functional ability and anxiety
      symptoms. Blood collection and cognitive testing through various tasks will also occur.
