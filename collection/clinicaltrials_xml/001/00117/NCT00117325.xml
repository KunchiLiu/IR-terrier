    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of GW685698X
      100mcg once daily (QD) aqueous nasal spray with vehicle placebo nasal spray in adult and
      adolescent subjects (12 years of age and older) with vasomotor rhinitis (VMR).

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean change from baseline over the entire treatment period in daily reflective total nasal symptom score (rTNSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (4 days prior to randomization) and up to Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>The daily rTNSS was the average of the AM (morning) and PM (before bed time) rTNSS assessments. Each rTNSS assessment comprised the sum of the three nasal symptom scores for rhinorrhea, nasal congestion and postnasal drip where each symptom was scored on a scale of 0 (no symptoms) to 3 (severe symptoms). Change from baseline was calculated as endpoint value minus the baseline value. LS mean values have been reported.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean change from baseline over the entire treatment period in AM, pre-dose, instantaneous total nasal symptom scores (iTNSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and up to Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>The AM, pre-dose, iTNSS is the sum of the 3 individual nasal symptom score assessments for rhinorrhea, nasal congestion and postnasal drip performed at the moment immediately prior to taking their dose where each symptom was scored on a scale of 0 to 3. Change from baseline was calculated as endpoint value minus the baseline value.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of participants with overall evaluation of response to therapy</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Overall Evaluation of Response to Therapy was based on a 7-point categorical scale where the participants rated their perception of the change or lack of change in their VMR (Vasomotor rhinitis) symptoms at the end of the study. The 7 categories were: significantly improved, moderately improved, mildly improved, no change, mildly worse, moderately worse, and significantly worse.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean change from baseline over the entire treatment period in AM pre-dose rTNSS</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and up to Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>The rTNSS is a rating of the severity of symptoms over the previous 12 hours and is performed in the AM (AM rTNSS). Change from baseline was calculated as endpoint value minus the baseline value. LS mean values have been reported.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean change from baseline over the entire treatment period in PM rTNSS</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and up to Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>The rTNSS is a rating of the severity of symptoms over the previous 12 hours and is performed in the PM (PM rTNSS). Change from baseline was calculated as endpoint value minus the baseline value. LS mean values have been reported.</description>

    <measure>Onset of Treatment Effect and Time to Maximum Effect</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and up to Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>The onset of treatment effect was assessed by the mean change from baseline in AM iTNSS (Days 1 to 28), the mean change from baseline in daily rTNSS (Days 1 to 28), and mean change from baseline in AM rTNSS and PM rTNSS. The time to maximum effect was also evaluated by the mean change from baseline in daily rTNSS for Days 1 to 28.</description>
