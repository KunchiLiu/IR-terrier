      This is a drug metabolism study in one-year old children involving caffeine and
      dextromethorphan.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For many years, it has been considered dogma that drug biotransformation capability is
      limited at best in the fetus and newborn but increases over the first year of life to levels
      in toddlers and young children that generally exceed adult capacity. There are several
      situations where examination of clinical PK data has revealed discernable patterns of drug
      clearance that can be attributed to developmental differences in drug biotransformation. It
      has become apparent that there are developmental differences in expression among drug
      metabolizing enzyme families (cytochromes P450 or &quot;CYPs&quot;, etc.) Furthermore, individual drug
      metabolizing enzymes with in a family may have unique developmental profiles that influence
      the therapeutic response, desired or undesired, to a given agent.

      All subjects will have a single 5 ml venous blood sample taken upon admission to the study.
      All subjects will be given a single oral dose of caffeine and dextromethorphan. Patients
      will be allowed to consume their normal age appropriate diet around the time of study drug
      administration and through the sample collection periods. All spontaneously voided urine
      will be collected for a period of 12 hours following the caffeine and dextromethorphan
      administration

      The specific aim of this proposal is to extend the current longitudinal investigation into
      the preschool age group (1 to 5 years of age). The developmental profile of CYPs, 1A2, 2D6,
      and 3A4 will be determined by caffeine and dextromethorphan phenotyping procedures. The
      purpose of this study is to determine the age/developmental stage at which the CYP2 1A2, 2D6
      and 3A4 activities exceed adult activities.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy children 12 months of age at enrollment

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Height and weight ratio outside of the 5th to 100th percentile for adjusted age

          -  Historical and/or biochemical evidence of hepatic, renal, or hematopoetic dysfunction

          -  Historical or physical evidence of a neurologic disease/condition (excluding simple,
             febrile seizures)

          -  Historical or physical evidence of any disorder associated with swallowing and/or
             gastrointestinal function

          -  Concomitant therapy with drugs or other products known to alter the activity of
             hepatic or intestinal microsomal enzymes(e.g., inducers or inhibitors of CYPs 1A2,
             2D6, and/or 3A4), P-glycoprotein or potential competing substrates for the CYPs,
             under study within 7 days of a scheduled phenotyping evaluation

          -  Evidence of behavioral, developmental, or psychosocial conditions in the subjects
             and/or parents/caregivers that, in the opinion of the investigator, would have the
             potential to adversely impact the level of compliance required for successful study
             completion

          -  Evidence of geographic instability (i.e., moving of primary residence within last 24
             months) that would adversely influence compliance with repeated study visits
             necessary for completion of the protocol

          -  Lack of telephone access required to insure adequate subject contact/follow-up

          -  Inability to obtain written informed consent from the subject's parents/guardians
