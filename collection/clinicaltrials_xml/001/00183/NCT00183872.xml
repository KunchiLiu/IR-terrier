  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is for people with advanced gastric or gastroesophageal cancer. This study is
      being done to find out how long it takes tumors to grow after receiving treatment with the
      drugs irinotecan (also known as CPT-11) and docetaxel (also known as Taxotere). Irinotecan
      is a drug that has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Irinotecan has
      been approved for treatment of cancer of the colon and rectum. Docetaxel is another drug
      approved by the FDA. Docetaxel is approved for treatment of breast, prostate and lung
      cancer. However, the FDA has authorized the use of irinotecan and docetaxel in this study.
      This study will evaluate the effects of these drugs on participant's tumors. The side
      effects of the combination of irinotecan and docetaxel will also be evaluated. This study
      will also measure the levels of certain substances in participant's tumors. These
      substances, called genes (which are the cell's blueprint), affect how people's bodies react
      to the cancer drugs. Genes will also be measured in participant's blood. The researchers
      want to see if these substances can predict response to the study drugs.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have clinically documented unresectable or metastatic gastric cancer or
             gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma and histologic confirmation of the diagnosis with
             tumor.

          -  Patients must have received one prior chemotherapeutic regimen for metastatic or
             unresectable disease. Patients may not have received prior therapy with irinotecan or
             a taxane.

          -  Tissue from tumor must be available. This may be paraffin embedded tissue from
             previous biopsy/resection or if it is not available, a repeat biopsy must be
             performed.

          -  Patients must agree to have a 20 cc blood sample drawn in addition to routine labs
             with each cycle of chemotherapy.

          -  Patients must have measurable disease by clinical exam or radiologic studies, that is
             at least one lesion measurable in at least one dimension, measuring 10 mm or more on
             a spiral CT scan, or at least 20 mm by an exam or a non-spiral scan. If prior
             radiation therapy was administered, measurable disease must be outside the radiation
             field.

          -  Patients must have a Zubrod performance status of 0-2.

          -  Patients must have a predicted life expectancy of at least 12 weeks.

          -  Patients must have:

               -  a pre-treatment granulocyte count (i.e., segmented neutrophils + bands) of
                  &gt;1,500/mm3,

               -  a hemoglobin level of greater than or equal to 9.0 gm/dl, and

               -  a platelet count of &gt;100,000/mm3.

          -  Patients must have adequate renal function as documented by a calculated creatinine
             clearance &gt; 60.

          -  Patients must have adequate hepatic function as documented by a serum bilirubin less
             than or equal to the institutional upper limit of normal, regardless of whether
             patients have liver involvement secondary to tumor.

          -  No major surgery within 1 month of starting study drug.

          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test.

             treatment and for at least 3 months thereafter.

          -  Presence of clinically apparent central nervous system metastases or carcinomatous
             meningitis.

          -  Patients with a history of seizures are ineligible. Patients receiving phenytoin,
             phenobarbital, or other anti-epileptic prophylaxis are ineligible.

          -  Patients with any other severe concurrent disease, which in the judgment of the
             investigator would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study.

          -  Patients with a history of severe hypersensitivity reaction to docetaxel or other
             drugs formulated with polysorbate 80.
