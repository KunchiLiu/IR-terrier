  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with breast cancer receiving paclitaxel chemotherapy who have mild symptoms of
      peripheral neuropathy will receive glutamine or placebo to try and improve symptoms.

      1. Determine whether oral glutamine supplementation can reduce the symptoms and signs of
           peripheral neuropathy.

        2. Determine whether alterations in the symptoms and signs of peripheral neuropathy are
           correlated with an alteration of circulating nerve growth factor or insulin-like growth
           factor levels.

        3. Assess whether oral glutamine affects circulating nerve growth factor or insulin-like
           growth factor levels.

        4. Assess whether glutamine interferes with paclitaxel pharmacokinetics

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed breast cancer, Stage I,
             II, III or IV or other solid tumors.

          2. Patients must be receiving weekly paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel chemotherapy or have
             recently completed paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel chemotherapy and have at least a
             Grade I peripheral neuropathy (see Appendix A) because of therapy.

          3. Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the use of
             glutamine in patients &lt;18 years of age, children are excluded from this study but
             will be eligible for future pediatric phase 1 single-agent trials.

          4. ECOG performance status &lt;1 (Karnofsky &gt;90%).

          5. Life expectancy of greater than 3 months.

          6. Patients must have sufficient organ and marrow function so that paclitaxel treatment
             can be administered.

          7. The effects of glutamine on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason,
             women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and
             for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect
             she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating
             physician immediately.

          8. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent
             document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who have experienced prior neuropathies not associated with chemotherapy

          2. Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents.

          3. Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse
             events.

          4. There are no known allergies associated with glutamine.

          5. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness that render the patient ineligible to receive
             paclitaxel chemotherapy.

          6. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because there is an unknown but potential
             risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with
             glutamine. Breastfeeding should also be discontinued if the mother is treated with
             glutamine.

          7. Because patients with immune deficiency are at increased risk of lethal infections
             when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy, HIV-positive patients receiving
             combination anti-retroviral therapy are excluded from the study because of possible
             pharmacokinetic interactions with glutamine. Appropriate studies will be undertaken
             in patients receiving combination anti-retroviral therapy when indicated.

          8. Concurrent chemotherapy with another drug known to cause neuropathy (CDDP or CBDCA or
             oxaliplatin) are excluded.
