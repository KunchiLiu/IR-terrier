  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out how effective 177Lu -J591 is in the treatment of
      patients with metastatic, androgen-independent prostate cancer.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To determine the clinical activity of 177Lu -J591 for the treatment of patients with
      metastatic, androgen-independent prostate cancer.

      Patients will receive a single dose of J591 (total antibody of 20 mg) consisting of antibody
      chelated with 177Lu at a dose of 65 or 70 mCi/m2 with a specific activity of 12-15 mCi/mg
      plus non-radiolabeled antibody.
