      To compare a standard weight-based dose of intravenous (IV) hydromorphone (Dilaudid) to a
      standard weight-based dose of IV morphine in adults presenting to the ED with acute severe
      pain.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is widespread agreement that pain is under-treated in the ED (18). The current
      recommended treatment of acute pain in the ED setting is administration of an initial bolus
      of morphine followed by titration until adequate analgesia is achieved (19,20). Several
      studies have shown that even 0.1 mg/kg IV morphine (7-10 mg administered to the average
      70-100 kg patient) inadequately treats many patients’ acute pain (21,22). In spite of this,
      we have observed that many emergency physicians and nurses are hesitant to give 7-10 mg of
      morphine as an initial IV dose. In contrast, we observed that these same healthcare
      providers were not similarly reluctant to administer a roughly equianalgesic dose of
      hydromorphone (1-1.5 mg), perhaps because the more potent hydromorphone is given in much
      smaller milligram quantities than morphine, thus providing the illusion of substantially
      less opioid administered to the patient. Having repeatedly observed this phenomenon, we
      reasoned that if a smaller milligram dose of hydromorphone were shown to provide an
      efficacy, safety, and side-effect profile comparable or superior to a larger milligram dose
      of morphine, it would provide evidence supporting use of hydromorphone as an alternative
      first line opioid in the treatment of acute pain presenting to the ED. As a practical
      corollary to this, we reasoned further that the increased willingness of healthcare
      providers to use hydromorphone might contribute to reducing one component of the
      multifaceted problem of oligoanalgesia in the ED (18).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  adults between the ages of 21 and 65 who presented to the ED with acute pain (defined
             as pain less than 7 days in duration) (23) of sufficient severity in the judgment of
             the ED attending to warrant use of IV opioids.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  previous allergy to morphine or hydromorphone, systolic blood pressure less than
             90mmHg, alcohol intoxication as judged by the attending physician, use of other
             opioids within the past 7 days, use of an MAO-inhibitor, and patients with chronic
             pain syndromes (such as sickle cell disease or fibromyalgia)
