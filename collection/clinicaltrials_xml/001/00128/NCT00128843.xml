  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pivotal phase II, multicenter, open-label trial, designed to compare the efficacy
      of exemestane versus anastrozole as a first line treatment for advanced breast cancer. One
      hundred postmenopausal patients, with metastatic, positive hormone receptor breast cancer
      will be enrolled in this trial.

      The primary study endpoint is objective response rate. The study has been designed following
      Simon's test, with a p1-p0=0.15. p1 is the optimum level of activity of the experimental
      treatment (exemestane), and p0 is the minimum expected activity. In this study, p1 is 25%
      (25% of RR) and p0 is 10% (10% of RR). With an alpha error of 0.05 and a beta error of 0.1,
      Simon test establishes a first step of 21 patients per treatment arm. If at least 2
      objective responses are observed in exemestane arm, recruitment will continue until 100
      patients have been recruited. After this second recruitment phase, at least 7 objective
      responses must be observed to confirm the expected exemestane level of activity.

               -  Age &lt; 56 and &lt; 5 years of amenorrhoea: follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels
                  to confirm postmenopausal status.

          -  Measurable disease as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)
             criteria.

          -  Patients who have received adjuvant tamoxifen are eligible, if progression has been
             established at least 24 months since treatment start.

             months after end of treatment.

          -  Patients may have received a first line of chemotherapy for advanced disease, but
             treatment must have ended at least 4 weeks before enrolment, and all acute toxicities
             must be resolved. Previous treatment with Herceptin is allowed.
