  <brief_summary>

      This is a multicenter, open-label, phase II trial to assess the efficacy of the GAT
      neoadjuvant regimen in patients with stage III breast cancer, confirmed by true-cut or open
      biopsy.

      2 treatment cycles of chemotherapy (one cycle = 2 weeks) must be administered to each
      patient before breast surgery.

      The required number of patients has been calculated following Simon’s method. 43 patients
      will be enrolled in two phases: first, 29 patients must be enrolled, and at least 2
      pathological complete responses obtained. Patients recruitment will continue until 43
      patients have been enrolled. Assumptions are that there is a 95% probability to obtain a
      rate of pathological complete responses of at least 10%.

             open-biopsy.

          -  Ages between 18 and 75 years old. Patients older than 70 must have an adequate
             quality of life to be eligible.

          -  Patients cannot have received previous treatment with chemotherapy, hormone therapy,
             radiotherapy or immune therapy.

          -  Performance status of 0,1, 2 (ECOG).

          -  At least a 6 month life expectancy.

          -  Neutrophils &gt; 1500; platelets &gt; 100000; haemoglobin &gt; 10 mg/dL.

          -  Adequate renal and hepatic functions, with serum creatinine &lt; 1.2 mg/dl and total
             bilirubin &lt; 2 mg/dl.

          -  Adequate contraceptive methods during the study and up to 3 months after.

          -  Adequate cardiac function assessed by physical exam, electrocardiogram (EKG) and left
             ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &gt; 55%.

          -  Other neoplasms except for basal skin carcinoma or cervical in situ carcinoma
             adequately treated. Other previous neoplasms are allowed if diagnosed and treated
             more than 5 years before study registration.

          -  Concomitant serious disease provoking organ failure (heart, renal, hepatic,
             respiratory).

          -  Pre-existing motor or sensorial neuropathy &gt; grade 1.

          -  Inability for treatment compliance.
