  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of daptomycin
      in patients aged 2-17 years old who have a suspected or proven gram-positive infection for
      which they are receiving standard antibiotic therapy. The tolerability of a single dose of
      daptomycin in these patients will also be assessed.
