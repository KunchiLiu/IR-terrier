      This phase II trial studies how well giving combination chemotherapy and filgrastim together
      before surgery works in treating patients with human epidermal growth receptor 2
      (HER2)-positive breast cancer that can be removed by surgery. Drugs used in chemotherapy,
      such as doxorubicin hydrochloride, cyclophosphamide, and paclitaxel work in different ways
      to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from
      dividing. Giving combination chemotherapy before surgery may make the tumor smaller and
      reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed. Colony-stimulating factors,
      such as filgrastim, may increase the number of immune cells found in bone marrow or
      peripheral blood and may help the immune system recover from the side effects of
      chemotherapy. Giving doxorubicin hydrochloride, cyclophosphamide, and filgrastim together
      followed by paclitaxel before surgery may be an effective treatment for breast cancer

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the pathologic response rate in patients with operable breast cancer treated
      with a two part, neoadjuvant regimen consisting of weekly doxorubicin (doxorubicin
      hydrochloride) and daily oral cyclophosphamide given with G-CSF (filgrastim) support for 12
      weeks followed weekly paclitaxel for 12 weeks.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the clinical response rate in patients with surgically resectable breast cancer
      treated with weekly doxorubicin and daily oral cyclophosphamide given with G-CSF support for
      12 weeks.

      II. To assess the clinical response rate in patients with surgically resectable breast
      cancer treated with weekly paclitaxel for 12 weeks.

      III. To assess the relapse rate, overall and disease-free survival in patients with operable
      breast cancer treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy consisting of weekly doxorubicin and
      daily oral cyclophosphamide given with G-CSF support for 12 weeks followed weekly paclitaxel
      for 12 weeks and adjuvant chemotherapy with Xeloda (capecitabine), Methotrexate and
      Navelbine (vinorelbine tartrate) (XMN).

      IV. To assess the toxicity associated with these regimens. V. To assess whether the
      phenotype of breast cancer changes with treatment. VI. To assess whether phenotypic changes
      in breast tumors predict outcome.

      OUTLINE:

      PART I: Patients receive doxorubicin hydrochloride intravenously (IV) on day 1 of each week,
      cyclophosphamide orally (PO) once daily (QD), and filgrastim subcutaneously (SC) QD on days
      2-7 of each week. Treatment continues for 12 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      PART II: Patients* receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour on day 1 of each week. Treatment
      continues for 12 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Patients then undergo definitive surgical resection by partial mastectomy (lumpectomy) or
      mastectomy after completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

      PART III: Patients** unable to achieve complete pathologic response (pCR) or disease that
      has been down-staged to =&lt; 1 cm with no positive nodes following surgery receive
      capecitabine PO twice daily (BID) on days 1-14, methotrexate IV on days 1, 8 and 15, and
      vinorelbine tartrate IV over 6-10 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 3
      weeks for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      NOTE: *Patients with HER2/neu-positive disease also receive trastuzumab IV over 30-90
      minutes once weekly or every 3 weeks for 1 year beginning in Part II.

      NOTE: **Patients with hormone receptor-positive disease also receive tamoxifen PO QD for 5
      years (premenopausal) OR letozole PO QD or tamoxifen PO QD for 5 years (postmenopausal)
      beginning in Part III.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 3 years,
      every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.

    <description>Microscopic pCR: No evidence of microscopic invasive tumor at the primary site or in the regional lymph nodes at the time of definitive surgical resection. mCR: The examining pathologist cannot identify gross residual tumor mass in the surgical specimen. This differs from a pCR where the specimen must also be negative for invasive tumor by microscopy. For this study, we are using a definition of mCR that will make the trial more translatable to other institutions. For this study, mCR will be defined as no focus of invasive cancer &gt;= 1 cm.</description>
