    <textblock>
      Spinal cord injury (SCI) is one of the most disabling health problems facing adults today,
      with one of the consequences often being inability to walk or difficulty walking. Recent
      studies suggest that intensive step training on a treadmill using body-weight support and
      manual assistance that provides repetitive task-specific sensory cues to the neural axis can
      improve the recovery of walking for persons with incomplete SCI. More recently, robotics
      have been developed as an alternative to manually-assisted training. Robotic-assisted
      training may allow for increased intensity of training, improve the reproducibility and
      consistency of training, and reduce the personnel needed to implement the training. However,
      the effects of robotic-assisted training compared to manually-assisted training are not
      known. An improved understanding of these differential effects and the mechanisms of
      improvement in walking can facilitate continued advances in evidenced-based practice of
      neuro-rehabilitation, therefore improving the treatment of persons with SCI.

      The primary objective of this project is to assess and compare the effects of
      robotic-assisted versus manually-assisted locomotor training using the body-weight support
      (BWS) on sub-tasks of walking. Specifically, we believe that at least four sub-tasks of
      walking are differentially affected by the robotic-assisted training when compared to
      manually-assisted training (propulsion, transition from stance to step, stepping, and
      equilibrium). The investigators hypothesize that robotic-assisted training will have a
      greater effect on improving propulsion, transition and equilibrium. The effect of these two
      modalities on adaptability, a fifth sub-task of walking, is unclear; therefore, a
      development component of the pilot project will involve establishing a quantitative measure
      of adaptability and assessing differential effects of training. Participants will be
      randomized to one of two training groups: robotic-assisted or manually-assisted, and
      evaluated for performance on sub-tasks of walking.

          -  SCI at least 6 months since injury

          -  Motor I-SCI, upper motor neuron lesion only at cervical or thoracic levels

          -  A diagnosis of first time SCI including etiology from trauma, vascular, or orthopedic
             pathology

          -  SCI as defined by the American ASIA Impairment Scale categories C or D

          -  Medically stable condition that is asymptomatic for bladder infection, decubiti,
             osteoporosis, cardiopulmonary disease, pain, contractures or other significant
             medical complications that would prohibit or interfere with testing of walking
             function and training or alter compliance with the training protocol

          -  Documented medical approval from the participant's personal physician verifying the
             participant's medical status at time of enrollment

          -  Ability to walk a minimum of 30 feet with or without an assistive device,
             independently or with minimal assistance

          -  Over ground gait speed &lt; 0.8 m/s

          -  Persons using anti-spasticity medication must maintain stable medication dosage
             during the study

          -  Able to give informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Current participation in a rehabilitation program/research protocol that could
             interfere or influence the outcome measures of the current study

          -  History of congenital SCI (e.g. myelomeningocele, intraspinal neoplasm, Frederich's
             ataxia) or other degenerative spinal disorders (e.g. spinocerebellar degeneration,
             syringomyelia) that may complicate the protocol

          -  Inappropriate or unsafe fit of the harness or robotic trainer due to the
             participant's body size and/or joint contractures or severe spasticity that would
             prohibit the safe provision of either training modality
