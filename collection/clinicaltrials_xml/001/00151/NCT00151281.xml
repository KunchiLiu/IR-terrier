      Primary Objective:

      Evaluate the clinical activity of the RT-PEPC combination regimen (rituximab, thalidomide,
      and prednisone, etoposide, procarbazine, cyclophosphamide) in patients with relapsed mantle
      cell lymphoma. Specifically, response rate (RR) and time to disease progression (TTP) will
      be assessed.

      Secondary Objectives:

        1. Assess the toxicity profiles of RT-PEPC treatment in patients with relapsed mantle cell
           lymphoma.

        2. Prospectively characterize the angiogenic profile of patients with mantle cell lymphoma
           during treatment with RT-PEPC. The dynamics of the angiogenic profile will be
           correlated with clinical response to RT-PEPC therapy.

        3. Assess the quality of life of patients receiving RT-PEPC treatment

    <description>Induction phase (month 1-3)
PEPC daily (prednisone 20 mg/day, cyclophosphamide 50 mg/day, etoposide 50 mg/day, and procarbazine 50 mg/day) until expected drop in neutrophil count (ANC &lt; 3000), unless due to disease. After ANC returns to above 2,000/ul, PEPC resumes at alternate day or fractionated weekly basis.
Daily thalidomide at 50 mg/day for the first 8 weeks, then dose escalated as tolerated to a maximum of 100 mg/day.
Rituximab weekly x 4 (375 mg/m2/week) starting at week 1.
Maintenance phase (month 4-12)
Daily low dose thalidomide (50-100 mg/d)
PEPC QOD or fractionated weekly basis.
Rituximab (375 mg/m2/week) weekly x 4 administered every 4 months.
Post-Month 12 Maintenance phase (post-month 12 until disease progression)
Daily low dose thalidomide (50-100mg/d)
PEPC QOD or fractionated weekly basis
Rituximab (375 mg/m2/week) weekly x 4 administered every 4 months</description>
