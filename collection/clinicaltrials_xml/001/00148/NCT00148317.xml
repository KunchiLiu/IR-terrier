      PRIMARY STUDY OBJECTIVES

        -  To evaluate the efficacy of the combination of bortezomib, dexamethasone, with and
           without DOXIL, followed by high-dose cyclophosphamide as a therapy for two different
           subsets of multiple myeloma patients:

             1. Patients post first line therapy

             2. Patients with relapsed/refractory disease who are bortezomib-naïve

        -  To evaluate the safety of the combination of bortezomib and dexamethasone, with and
           without DOXIL, followed by high-dose cyclophosphamide as therapy for patients with
           multiple myeloma.

      SECONDARY STUDY OBJECTIVES

        -  To evaluate the role of the combination of bortezomib dexamethasone, with and without
           DOXIL, followed by high-dose cyclophosphamide on the ability to collect &gt; 10 x 106
           CD34+ cells/kg in &lt; 7 collections (for both subsets of multiple myeloma patients).

        -  To evaluate the survival of patients who receive the combination of bortezomib
           dexamethasone, with and without DOXIL, followed by high-dose cyclophosphamide (for both
           subsets of patients).
