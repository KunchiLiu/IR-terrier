        Inclusion Criteria:- Patients must have a histologically confirmed, bi-dimensionally
        measurable, recurrent or metastatic carcinoma of the breast that is progressive.

          -  All patients must be female and premenopausal. Premenopausal is defined as either:
             (1) last menstrual period within 3 months, or (2) post-hysterectomy without bilateral
             oophorectomy and with FSH in the premenopausal range, or, (3) if on tamoxifen within
             the past 3 months, a plasma estradiol in the premenopausal range.

          -  Patients must have either positive estrogen and/or progesterone receptor
             determination by IHC or competitive binding assay on metastatic disease, or if not
             performed on their metastatic disease a positive result on their primary breast
             cancer specimen.

          -  No prior treatment with an aromatase inhibitor or inactivator.

          -  No prior treatment with an LH/RH agonist/antagonist.

          -  No adjuvant chemotherapy within 6 months of study entry.

          -  Patients must have an ECOG performance status of 0, 1, or 2.

          -  Patients must have adequate bone marrow, hepatic, and renal function defined by the
             following:

               -  Granulocytes &gt; 1500/mm^3

               -  Platelets &gt; 100,000/mm^3

               -  SGOT &lt; 2.5x upper limit of normal

               -  Total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 mg/dL

          -  Patients with central nervous system metastasis or lymphangitic pulmonary metastasis
             are not eligible.

          -  Patients must not have received chemotherapy or hormonal therapy for at least 3 weeks
             prior to enrollment.

          -  Patients may receive irradiation to bony sites of disease for pain control or for
             prevention of fracture, but the irradiated site(s) will NOT be considered evaluable
             for disease response.

          -  Patients who are pregnant or lactating are ineligible. Must be using effective
             contraception or not be of childbearing potential.

          -  Patients must not have had an active malignancy other than breast cancer, in situ
             carcinoma of the cervix, or non-melanomatous skin cancers in the past 5 years.

          -  No active, unresolved infection.

          -  All patients must give signed written informed consent.
