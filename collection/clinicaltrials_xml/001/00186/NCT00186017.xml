      We will assess the effect of olanzapine compared to placebo added to prior treatment on
      CGI-S in a one-week randomized double-blind study. We will also assess the effect of
      olanzapine added to prior treatment on CGI-S in an eight-week open treatment study. In
      addition, we will assess the effect of olanzapine on Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS),
      Hamilton and Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scales (HDRS, and MADRS), and Hamilton
      Anxiety Rating Scales (HARS) in the above paradigms. We will also assess the influence of
      presentation severity (CGI-S) and polarity (mood elevation versus depression) on olanzapine
      response. Finally, we will assess safety and tolerability of olanzapine in the above
      paradigms.

      We hypothesize that in diverse mild syndromal and subsyndromal exacerbations of BD in
      outpatients, randomized double-blind flexibly dosed olanzapine added to prior treatment
      (including no treatment) will yield greater CGI-S improvement than placebo by the end of one
      week, and that such improvement will persist over one week of open continuation treatment.

    <textblock>
      Development and marketing of new therapies for bipolar disorders (BD) has typically entailed
      performing double-blind placebo-controlled trials in acute mania 1, 2, maintenance studies
      3, 4, and more recently acute depression studies 5. Such an approach addresses BD primarily
      in terms of episodes and has the strength of studying levels of pathology sufficiently high
      to permit detection of treatment effects, and guiding clinicians when they encounter
      syndromal mood episodes. However, this approach has the important limitation of not
      addressing an important unmet clinical need, namely the management of subsyndromal symptoms.
      Indeed, emerging data suggest that in BD subsyndromal symptoms compared to syndromal
      episodes are far more pervasive 6, 7. Also such an approach runs the risk of not paying
      sufficient attention to the disorder construct, in a sense permitting preoccupation with
      syndromal episodes to carry more importance than the disorder.

      Our group has published a novel open study of olanzapine in diverse exacerbations of BD 8.
      Twenty-five bipolar disorder [14 bipolar I (BPI), 10 bipolar II (BPII) and one bipolar
      disorder not otherwise specified (BP NOS)] outpatients received open olanzapine (15
      adjunctive, 10 monotherapy). Thirteen had elevated (11 syndromal, two subsyndromal) and 12
      depressed (four syndromal, eight subsyndromal) mood symptoms of at least mild severity, with
      Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S) scores of at least 3. Only one had psychotic
      symptoms. With open olanzapine (15 adjunctive, 10 monotherapy), overall symptom severity
      (CGI-S) as well as mood elevation (Young Mania Rating Scale), depression (Hamilton and
      Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scales), and anxiety (Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale),
      rapidly decreased (significantly by days 2-3). Patients with the greatest baseline severity
      (CGI-S) had the greatest improvement. Fifteen of 25 (60%) patients responded. Time to
      consistent response was bimodal, with five early (by 0.5 +/- 0.3 weeks) and 10 late (by 7.0
      +/- 1.9 weeks) responders. Early compared with late responders had 51% lower final
      olanzapine doses. Olanzapine was generally well tolerated, with sedation and weight gain the
      most common adverse effects. Thus, olanzapine appeared effective in diverse exacerbations of
      BD in outpatients. Controlled studies are warranted to further explore these preliminary
      observations.
