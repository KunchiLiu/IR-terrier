        significant head trauma with loss of consciousness for &gt;5 minutes; f. A true positive
        response to any question on the Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Adult Safety Screen
        questionnaire (see Attachment H) g. Lifetime treatment with more than 12 antidepressant
        medication trials, at any dose or duration, either monotherapy or combination therapy from
        the list summarized in Attachment I. h. ECT treatment within 3 months prior to the

        2 or higher) in this or any previous j. History of treatment with rTMS therapy for any
        disorder; k. History of treatment with Vagus Nerve Stimulation; l. Use of any
        investigational drug within 4 weeks of the randomization visit; m. Use of fluoxetine
        within 6 weeks of the randomization visit; n. Use of an MAOI within 2 weeks of the
        randomization visit; o. Use of any medication(s) listed on the Excluded Medication List
        (Attachment J) within 1 week of the randomization visit; p. Significant acute suicide

        medical treatment; or &gt;2 suicide attempts in the past 12 months; or Has a clear-cut plan
        for suicide and states that he/she cannot guarantee that he/she will call his/her regular
        psychiatrist or the Investigator if the impulse to implement the plan becomes substantial
        during the study; or in the investigator#s opinion, is likely to attempt suicide within
        the next 6 months. q. Cardiac pacemakers, implanted medication pumps, intracardiac lines,
        or acute, unstable cardiac disease; r. Intracranial implant (e.g., aneurysm clips, shunts,

        the head, excluding the mouth, that cannot be safely removed;s. Known or suspected
        pregnancy; t. If participating in psychotherapy, must have been in stable treatment for at
        least 3 months prior to entry into the study, with no anticipation of change in the
        frequency of therapeutic sessions, or the therapeutic focus over the duration of the rTMS
        trial; u. Positive urine drug screen. (A positive urine drug screen at screening may be
        repeated once prior to randomization); v. Clinically significant laboratory abnormality,
        in the opinion of the investigator; w. Women who are breast-feeding; x. Women of
        child-bearing potential not using a medically accepted form of contraception when engaging
