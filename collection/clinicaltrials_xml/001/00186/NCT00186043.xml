      1. The primary objective of this study is to examine the efficacy of quetiapine (Seroquel)
           in treatment of dysphoric hypomania in patients with Bipolar II disorder.

        2. To evaluate the utility of Seroquel add-on treatment to decrease mixed depressive and
           hypomanic symptoms.

    <textblock>
      Bipolar disorder is recognized as a severe and treatment-refractory illness. Recent work
      from multiple research centers in both Europe and the U.S. have found the percentage of
      patients experiencing hypomania that are also experiencing depressive symptoms is
      substantial. In a recent Stanley Foundation Bipolar Network study, it was found that 60% of
      all visits with at least moderate hypomania were associated with depressive symptoms. It is
      generally agreed that patients experiencing mixed states or combinations of mania with
      depressive symptoms are less responsive to older treatments such as lithium (Swann et al.,
      1997). We propose evaluating the response to Seroquel add-on versus placebo add-on for those
      patients experiencing hypomania and depressive symptoms, either simultaneously or closely
      juxtaposed within a 2-3 day period.

      Bipolar II (BDII) patients make up a substantial percentage of patients with bipolar
      disorder, estimated conservatively at 0.5% of the US population and, with somewhat more
      liberal definitions of hypomania minimum duration, in Europe at 1% or greater. Importantly,
      few to virtually no recent treatment trials of high quality have been undertaken in BDII.
      Treatment guidelines and algorithms for bipolar disorder have been unable to specify defined
      treatments for BDII due to the lack of studies. Juxtaposed to the limits of controlled data,
      preliminary case series and clinical experience support atypical antipsychotics will be
      helpful for BDII patients. Thus the impact is high for a placebo controlled study of
      Seroquel in BDII.

      We believe that this study is important to undertake because of the limited controlled data
      available for the treatment and management of patients with bipolar II disorder in
      outpatient settings. Numerous placebo-controlled monotherapy studies have been completed in
      inpatient settings for bipolar I, many leading to FDA submissions for registration.
      Maintenance trials are underway or are being developed for bipolar I disorder. There are no
      medications specifically approved for use in bipolar II patients at this time.

      Additionally, the initial trials for the registration of Seroquel for bipolar disorder did
      not include patients with mixed symptoms. Clear cut-offs were provided in order to minimize
      the likelihood that patients with mixed symptoms would enter these trials. Thus, the trial
      proposed will provide data useful to the clinician in a real world setting, as well as
      provide data in an area not previously covered by the trial registration studies. We
      hypothesize that Seroquel will be effective to treat such symptoms in patients with BDII.

      A clinically important and ground breaking aspect of the proposed trial is the focus on
      patients with bipolar II disorder. There is a paucity of data available to evaluate the use
      of atypical antipsychotics in patients with bipolar II disorder. Preliminary data of any
      sort in this area will be clinically useful, set the stage for larger more definitive
      trials, and translate readily into practice.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Must meet criteria for DSM-IV TR diagnosis of bipolar II disorder, as assessed by the
             structured clinical interview mood modules (SCID) (First et al., 1996).

          -  Must be hypomanic as rated by a &gt;12 on the YMRS on two consecutive visits 1-3 days
             apart. And meet DSM IV TR criteria for hypomania

          -  Must be experiencing depressive symptoms as rated by &gt; 14 on the MADRS rated at two
             consecutive visits 1-3 days apart and experiencing depressive symptoms for at least a
             seven-day period.

          -  Must be on stable medication regimens for at least two weeks, or on no medication at
             study entry.

          -  Must be men or women age 18-65 years of age.

             tubal ligation. Oral hormonal contraception is allowed as long as no other
             medications are being used that could decrease hormone levels and put the patient at
             risk for developing pregnancy.

             within the past month.

          -  History or evidence of unstable medical condition or known clinically significant
             abnormal laboratory results.

          -  Known or suspected chronic infectious disease including HIV or hepatitis.
