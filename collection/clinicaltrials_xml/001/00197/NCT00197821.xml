  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare the relative immunogenicity and reactogenicity of the existing 23 valent plain
      pneumococcal vaccine and a 7 valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in healthy UK adults aged
      50-80 years, and subsequent antibody persistence and response to boosting.
