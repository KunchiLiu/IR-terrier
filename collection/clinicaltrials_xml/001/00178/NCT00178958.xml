      The aim of this study is to evaluate the utility of continuous Holter ECG recording with
      automated, computerized data analysis for measuring antipsychotic-related QTc prolongation
      during a 24-h period under clinical conditions

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects will be males or females between 18 - 65 years of age.

          2. Patient subjects will have a definite diagnosis by DSM-IV criteria, schizophrenia,
             schizoaffective disorder, or bipolar disorder.

          3. Patient subjects are currently under treatment with any antipsychotic, any mood
             stabilizer, any antidepressant or any combination of the above at the therapeutic
             dose for at least 3 months.

          4. Patients have a history of taking the medications listed in item 3 as prescribed.

          5. The subjects must be able to provide written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects with a DSM-IV diagnosis of substance dependence as defined by DSMN within
             three months prior to selection.

          2. Subjects who are currently taking other medications that have been shown to prolong
             the QTc, including tricyclic antidepressants (e.g. amitriptyline, imipramine,
             maprotiline), fluroquinolones, or antiarrhythmics (e.g. quinidine, procainamide,
             amiodarone, sotalol).
