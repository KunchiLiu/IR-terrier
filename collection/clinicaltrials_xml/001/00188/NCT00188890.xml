    <textblock>
      Occupational exposure to asbestos is known increase the risk of developing cancer of the
      lungs (bronchogenic carcinoma) or of the pleura (mesothelioma). Symptoms are subtle and
      non-specific, diagnosis is often late and the prognosis consequently is dismal. Currently
      there is no accepted non-invasive tool for the early diagnosis of mesothelioma or lung
      cancer in asbestos-exposed subjects. In the last decade, low-dose computed tomography (LDCT)
      has been successfully developed and validated for the early diagnosis of lung cancer in
      high-risk smokers. Malignant mesothelioma might, in an early stage, resemble a benign
      pleural plaque, which is a common finding after asbestos exposure. We target to develop
      low-dose CT as a tool to serially image the pleural plaques, quantify their individual and
      overall volume, compute the growth rate with time, and, as such, identify the presence of
      mesothelioma early, before symptoms occur.

      Background and Purpose:

      Asbestos exposure may result in several different diseases to the lung and to the lining of
      the lung, the so-called pleura. Mostly they are benign, but there are two common malignant
      diseases in people with prior asbestos exposure, the so-called mesothelioma - which
      originates from the pleura - and cancer of the lung. Symptoms of any of these malignant
      diseases generally do not appear for 10-35 years after the first asbestos exposure, and
      include shortness of breath, chronic or new cough, coughing of blood, chest pain or weight
      loss. Unfortunately, these symptoms are most often causes by very advanced diseases, when
      patients can no longer be cured. Currently there is no accepted tool for the early diagnosis
      of mesothelioma or lung cancer in asbestos-exposed subjects available. Standard of care
      includes regular chest radiographs, which are not sufficient to show mesothelioma or lung
      cancer in an early stage.

      A screening CT examination, also called CAT scan, of the lungs will be performed without
      intravenous contrast. The CT examination as such is not an experimental procedure, CAT scans
      are performed routinely since decades. However, in this particular case, this albeit
      standard examination is performed for the purposes of research only, it is not part of
      standard of care. The screening CT examination of the lungs takes less than 10-20 minutes to
      perform.

      If no abnormalities are found on the initial examinations, you will be examined with one
      repeat screening CT of the chest after one year.

      If pleural plaques or a nodule in the lungs is seen on your baseline CT, this will lead to
      further testing. Quite likely (approximately 1 in 3 chance), you will be invited for a
      follow-up CT 3 or 6 months. Further investigations will be chosen according to standard of
      care and will be explained to you at the time. These will be coordinated by your physician
      with Dr. Marc de Perrot, Department of Thoracic Surgery.

      Secondly, there is evidence in other types of cancers such as cancers of the prostate and
      ovary, that analysis of blood may reveal protein markers that indicate the presence of
      cancer in the body. A companion blood analysis study is being undertaken in an effort to
      discover such markers for lung cancer and mesothelioma, so that the accuracy of CT-scan
      diagnosis for lung cancer may be further improved.

      Both at the time of your baseline screening CT and at your annual follow-up screening CT,
      you will be asked to provide 5 ml (approximately 2 teaspoons full) blood sample through a
      needle stick. A blood-taking technician employed by the University Health Network or a
      certified nurse will carry out this procedure. Purpose of this study is to search in the
      blood for so-called &quot;markers&quot;, substances in the blood which indicate that there is a cancer
      in the lungs or pleura.

      Most of these markers are still in development, thus your blood will be stored and analyzed
      at a future date.
