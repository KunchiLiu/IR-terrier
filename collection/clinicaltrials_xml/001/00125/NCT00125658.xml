    <textblock>
      The results of this study will provide sound, scientific evidence of physiologic mechanisms
      responsible for upper-extremity weakness; evidence of the processes involved in
      neuromuscular adaptation; and will elucidate the relationship between impairment and motor
      disability in post-stroke hemiparesis.

      This proposal extends the work accomplished in our initial study (project #B2405R, 'Effects
      of Strength Training on Upper-limb Function in Post-stroke Hemiparesis'). In the present
      study we will conduct a double-blind, randomized clinical trial of staged rehabilitation for
      the upper-extremity involving sequential delivery of functional therapy and high intensity
      resistance training. Therefore, this proposal directly compares the effects of functional
      and resistance training delivered individually. The researchers' previous work investigated
      a hybrid therapy of functional and resistance training against functional training alone.
      All subjects will participate in a 5 week run-in period of no treatment. This no-treatment
      block will afford multiple baseline measurements and, in addition, will provide information
      regarding the rate and magnitude of any spontaneous recovery without treatment. Following
      the second baseline measurement, all subjects will be randomized to receive either 10 weeks
      of functional training followed by 10 weeks of high-intensity resistance training or
      resistance training followed by functional training. Re-evaluation will occur following each
      block of treatment, and retention effects will be evaluated after 6 and 12 months with no
      additional treatment. Subjects will be evaluated with: outcome measures used broadly in
      Clinical Neurology and Rehabilitation, a battery of biomechanical performance measures
      including strength, muscle activation, reflex modulation and motor coordination, and with
      kinematics of free reaching movements. The researchers will investigate persons in the
      intermediate phase of recovery which they define as between 6 and 18 months
      post-cerebrovascular accident (CVA), having completed all inpatient and outpatient
      therapies, with continued experience of residual motor deficits.

    <description>Following an initial testing session, you will complete a 5 week no training period. At the end of this period you will then participate in a 20 week therapy program - 10 weeks of activity practice and 10 weeks of resistance exercise. Each 10 week block has 30 therapy sessions for a total of 60 sessions, each lasting approximately 1-1/2 hours. Follow up evaluations will be scheduled at 6 months and 12 months after completion of the 20 week therapy program.</description>
