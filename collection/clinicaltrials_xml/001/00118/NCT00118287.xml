  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies how well giving azacitidine together with etanercept works in
      treating patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as
      azacitidine, works in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing
      the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Chemoprotective drugs, such as etanercept, may
      protect normal cells from the side effects of chemotherapy

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the frequency of hematologic responses in patients with MDS to 5-aza
      (azacitidine) plus etanercept.

      II. Determine the efficacy of 5-aza combined with etanercept in patients with low or
      intermediate (int)-1 risk who fail to respond to anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) plus
      etanercept and for the purpose of this trial are considered as having progressive or &quot;more
      advanced&quot; disease.

      III. Correlate results of ex vivo/in vitro studies on phenotypic, cytogenetic and functional
      disease characteristics with in vivo treatment responses, to identify parameters that are
      associated with a high probability of response.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive etanercept subcutaneously (SC) twice weekly during weeks 1 and 2 and
      azacitidine SC or intravenously (IV) over 10-40 minutes on days 1-7. Treatment repeats every
      28 days for at least 3 courses. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

    <description>A two-stage Simon design for phase II trials will be followed. The operating characteristics of this design yield a 90% chance of declaring a treatment ineffective if they true response rate is 0.30. If the true response rate is 0.50, there is an 80% chance of reaching the threshold of 13 responses out of 32 patients.</description>
