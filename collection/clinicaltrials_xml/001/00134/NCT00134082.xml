    <textblock>
      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab, can block cancer growth in different
      ways. Some block the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Others find cancer cells
      and help kill them or carry cancer-killing substances to them. Drugs used in chemotherapy,
      such as cyclophosphamide, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells either
      by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Vaccines made from another person's
      cancer cells may help the body build an effective immune response to kill cancer cells.
      Giving rituximab together with chemotherapy and vaccine therapy may kill more cancer cells

      PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying how well giving rituximab together with
      cyclophosphamide and vaccine therapy works in treating patients with relapsed Hodgkin
      lymphoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of rituximab and high-dose cyclophosphamide
           followed by vaccine therapy comprising an allogeneic vaccine that expresses Hodgkin's
           tumor antigens and sargramostim (GM-CSF) (KGEL vaccine) as salvage therapy in patients
           with relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma.

        -  Determine the immunologic response to this vaccine in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the 3-year relapse-free and overall survival of patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  Determine the patterns of cellular immune reconstitution in patients treated with this
           regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label study.

      Patients receive rituximab IV on days -10 and -7 and then on days 29, 36, 43, and 50 (weeks
      4-7) and high-dose (transplant-dose) cyclophosphamide IV on days -3 to 0 without stem cell
      rescue. Patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously once daily beginning on day 6 and
      continuing until blood counts recover. Patients also receive vaccine therapy comprising an
      allogeneic vaccine that expresses Hodgkin's tumor antigens and sargramostim (GM-CSF) (KGEL
      vaccine) intradermally on day 1, and weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, and 24.

      After completion of high-dose cyclophosphamide, patients are followed every 3 months for 3
      years, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 25 patients will be accrued for this study.
