  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Imatinib is a member of a new class of drugs known as signal transduction inhibitors. The
      purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of imatinib in
      the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in combination with methotrexate in patients who do
      not respond satisfactorily to standard treatment, e.g. methotrexate.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  With a diagnosis of RA classified by ACR 1987 revised criteria with symptoms for at
             least 6 months

          -  Functional status class I, II, III according to the ACR 1991 revised classification
             criteria

          -  Patients have to have been treated with MTX at the maximum tolerated dose for at
             least 3 months, and be on a stable dose and route of administration for at least 2
             months prior to study entry

          -  Disease activity criteria of minimum 6 out of 28 tender and swollen joints at
             baseline

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  With current use of DMARDs other than MTX. DMARDs include but are not limited to:
             biologic agents, thiolates (D-penicillamine, thiopronine), sulfasalazine, gold
             compounds, antimalarials, cyclosporine A, azathioprine, leflunomide and alkylating
             agents such as cyclophosphamide

          -  With any DMRAD treatment used in combination with methotrexate within 1 month prior
             to study entry. In case of infliximab and leflunomide, a washout period of 2 months
             is required

          -  With any therapy by intra-articular injection, including intra-articular
             corticosteroid use within 1 month prior to study entry

        Other protocol-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.
