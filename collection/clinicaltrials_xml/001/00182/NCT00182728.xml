      RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Giving radiation
      during surgery may be an effective treatment for breast cancer.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well radiation therapy works in treating older
      women who are undergoing surgery for invasive breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the feasibility of intraoperative partial breast radiotherapy prior to
           surgical resection in older women with low-risk early stage primary invasive ductal
           carcinoma of the breast.

        -  Determine the rate of good/excellent cosmesis, as measured by the RTOG cosmetic rating
           scale, in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Compare the cosmetic outcome in patients treated with this regimen with that of
           patients treated with partial breast brachytherapy in clinical trial RTOG-9517.

        -  Determine the incidence of grade 3-4 toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the rate of ipsilateral breast recurrence, including recurrence within the
           tumor bed as compared to elsewhere in the breast, in patients treated with this
           regimen.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the radiation-induced activation of receptors and signal transduction
           pathways involved in radiation response in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a non-randomized study.

      Patients undergo intraoperative lymphatic mapping and sentinel lymphadenectomy OR standard
      level I, II axillary dissection to evaluate the lymph nodes followed by intraoperative
      breast ultrasonography to define the tumor target volume. Patients then undergo
      intraoperative single-dose partial breast radiotherapy followed by segmental mastectomy
      (i.e., lumpectomy) of the tumor. Patients with 1 or 2 tumor-involved surgical margins may
      undergo repeat segmental mastectomy. Patients with &gt; 2 tumor-involved surgical margins
      undergo mastectomy. Patients determined to have a tumor size &gt; 3 cm or an extensive
      intraductal component on final pathology evaluation undergo standard external beam
      radiotherapy after surgery.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every
      6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 71 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 to 3
      years.
