      The purpose of this study is to continue the work from the previous review study and
      determine the effectiveness of Botox in treating patients with idiopathic clubfoot by
      comparing outcomes of subjects treated with manipulation and casting plus Botox (treatment
      group) to those treated with manipulation and casting plus placebo (control group).

      The null hypothesis is that manipulation and casting plus Botox is not an effective
      treatment for idiopathic clubfoot. The alternate hypothesis is that manipulation and casting
      plus Botox is an effective treatment for idiopathic clubfoot.

      The study timeline is divided into five phases which have been defined based on experiences
      with the previous review and with clubfoot treatment in general. These phases are as
      follows: 1) study treatment (Botox injection versus placebo); 2) post-treatment manipulation
      and casting; 3) bracing and full-time maintenance; 4) intent-to-treat intervention for
      management of first-time non-responders (NR1) and first-time recurrences (Rec1) post-study
      treatment; and 5) rescue intervention for management of second-time non-responders (NR2) and
      second-time recurrences (Rec2) post intent-to-treat intervention.

      We will utilize a double-blind randomized control trial to assess the efficacy of Botox in
      the treatment of idiopathic clubfoot. Patients, parents, both participating surgeons, and
      members of their clinical and research teams (physiotherapist, occupational therapist,
      orthopaedic technologist, orthotist, research assistant) will be blinded to the study group
      (Botox group versus control group) each subject belongs in. The pharmacist preparing the
      syringes for injection will not be blinded.

      Subjects will be randomly assigned to receive either Botox (Treatment group) or placebo
      injection (Control group). Subjects in the treatment group will receive Botox injections
      dosed at 10 IU/kg prepared by diluting 100 IU of Botox in 1cc of unpreserved saline. If the
      child has bilateral clubfoot, the contents will be divided equally for injection into each
      gastrocnemius. Placebo injections for the control group will contain unpreserved saline at
      0.1cc/kg (such that a 4.5 kg subject will receive 0.45cc).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. children presenting with idiopathic clubfoot at BC Children's Hospital and Hospital
             for Sick Children

          2. children ranging in age from 1 day to 2 months old

          3. children who have reached hindfoot stall

          4. children with complete pre-study data *From protocol, hindfoot stall is defined:
             &quot;following initial manipulation and casting of clubfoot, when the forefoot can be
             abducted beyond 60 degrees but hindfoot equinus persists, requiring need for further
             intervention to correct the clubfoot deformity&quot;
