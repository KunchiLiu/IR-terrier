      The purpose of this study is to:

        1. Determine changes in levels of tumor bioactivity upon treatment with atorvastatin.

           Secondary objective:

        2. Determine validity of tumor bioactivity as a biologic endpoint by correlation with
           clinical response.

        3. Determine whether administration of atorvastatin is tolerable and safe in low grade NHL
           patients. We do not anticipate any significant toxicity since this dose of atorvastatin
           has been FDA approved for patients with hypercholesterolemia.
