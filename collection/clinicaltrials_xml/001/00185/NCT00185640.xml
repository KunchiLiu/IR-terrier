        Inclusion Criteria:

        (A) Any patient with one of the following hematolymphoid malignancies or syndromes in whom
        allogeneic NST is warranted. Specific disease categories include: indolent advanced stage
        Non-Hodgkin Lymphomas, Mantle Cell Lymphoma, Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia, Hodgkin
        Disease, Acute Leukemias in complete remission, Aplastic Anemia, Paroxysmal Nocturnal
        Hemoglobinuria, and, Myelodysplastic and Myeloproliferative Syndromes. Patients with other
        selected malignancies/disorders may also be considered but must be approved by the
        transplant team and the Principal Investigator.

        (B) Patient age &gt; 50 years, or for patients &lt;50 years of age but because of pre-existing
        medical conditions or prior therapy are considered to be at high risk for regimen-related
        toxicity associated with conventional myeloablative transplants.

        (C) A fully HLA-identical sibling or matched unrelated donor is available. Patients with
        one antigen mismatched donors can be considered but only after discussion with the
        transplant team and the Principal Investigator.

        (D) Patient must be competent to give consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        (A) Patients with progressive hematolymphoid malignancies despite conventional therapies,
        or acute leukemias not in complete remission.

        (B) Uncontrolled CNS involvement with disease

        (C) Fertile men or women unwilling to use contraceptive techniques during and for 12
        months following treatment

        (D) Females who are pregnant

        (E) Organ dysfunction defined as follows:

          -  Cardiac function: ejection fraction &lt;30% or uncontrolled cardiac failure

          -  Pulmonary: DLCO &lt;40% predicted

          -  Liver function abnormalities: elevation of bilirubin to &gt; 3 mg/dl and/or
             transaminases &gt;4x the upper limit of normal

          -  Renal: creatinine clearance &lt;50 cc/min (24 hour urine collection)

        (F) Karnofsky performance score &lt; 60%

        (G) Patients with poorly controlled hypertension on multiple antihypertensives

        (H) Documented fungal disease that is progressive despite treatment

        (I) Viral infections: HIV positive patients. Hepatitis B and C positive patients will be
        evaluated on a case by case basis

        (J) Psychiatric disorders or psychosocial problems which in the opinion of the primary
        physician or Principal Investigator would place the patient at unacceptable risk from this
        regimen.
