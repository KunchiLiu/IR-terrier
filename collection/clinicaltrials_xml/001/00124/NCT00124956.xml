  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol is designed to obtain detailed information on the impact of body composition
      on the pharmacokinetic behavior of doxorubicin after a single intravenous dose in children
      21 years of age or younger. There is no efficacy component. Approximately 9 children will be
      enrolled at Children's Hospital Boston. The information gained from this study could be very
      important in developing dosing strategies for doxorubicin in the obese patient population.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Eligible patients will be &gt; 1 and ≤ 21 years old.

          -  All patients must be receiving chemotherapy that includes doxorubicin administered as
             an infusion of any duration &lt; 24 hours, on either a 1-day or 2-day schedule. This
             includes bolus and all short infusion schedules.

          -  All patients or their parents/legal guardians will provide informed consent/assent
             (as required by law) indicating their awareness of the investigational nature and the
             risks of this study according to the informed consent process.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Women who are known to be pregnant or lactating

          -  Patients with significant uncontrolled systemic illness

          -  Serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT/AST), serum glutamic pyruvate
             transaminase (SGPT/ALT) &gt; 3 times the upper limit of normal tested within 14 days
             prior to infusion

          -  Bilirubin &gt; the upper limit of normal tested within 14 days prior to infusion

          -  Patients whose dose of doxorubicin is based on ideal body weight

          -  Patients who weigh &lt; 12 kilograms at time of screening
