  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine whether treatment with sulodexide is effective in
      reducing the level of urine albumin excretion in patients with early diabetic kidney disease
      expressed as microalbuminuria.

    <textblock>
      Diabetic nephropathy is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with
      either type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus. The pathogenesis and natural history of diabetic
      nephropathy is characterized initially by microalbuminuria followed by a progressive decline
      in glomerular function. An emerging body of evidence supports the notion that glomerular
      capillary wall and mesangial alterations in diabetic nephropathy involve pathobiochemical
      alterations of glycoproteins in these structures. Evidence, in experimental animals rendered
      diabetic, reveals that the administration of heparin and other anionic glycoproteins (GAG)
      can effectively prevent the biochemical alterations which are responsible for albuminuria.
      Sulodexide, an orally active agent which does not have anticoagulant properties associated
      with its oral dose range, is comprised of three naturally occurring glycosaminoglycan (GAG)
      polysaccharide components isolated from porcine intestinal mucosa. Small clinical studies
      employing sulodexide, have shown that albuminuria is significantly diminished in patients
      with diabetic nephropathy, even when these patients are receiving angiotensin II receptor
      blockers (ARB) or angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), agents already proven to
      reduce albuminuria and slow progressive diabetic nephropathy.

      This study is designed to evaluate whether sulodexide is safe and effective in treating
      subjects with type 2 diabetic nephropathy. Subjects with type 2 diabetes and
      microalbuminuria (defined as a urinary albumin to creatinine ratio,(ACR)in men 35-200 mg/G
      and in women 45-200 mg/G) who are also receiving either irbesartan 300 mg/day, losartan 100
      mg/day, or a maximum approved dose of an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) or angiotensin
      converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) will be enrolled in the study. The study will consist of
      the following periods:

        -  Screening: of 1-2 weeks for assessing basic eligibility/exclusion criteria

        -  Run-in: of up to 16 weeks on maximal dose of ARB or ACE with stable blood pressure
           control

        -  Qualifying visit: qualifying patients are on maximal dose of ARB or ACE for a minimum
           of 4 months with stable BP control, SBP &lt;150 mmHg, DBP &lt;90 mmHg and albumin to
           creatinine ratio, (ACR) between in men 35-200 mg/G and in women 45-200 average of 3
           first morning voids

        -  Randomization: patients are randomized to sulodexide 100 mg or matching placebo
           administered orally twice a day.

        -  Maintenance: 26 week maintenance period, with 4 visits to monitor safety and ACR

        -  Washout Period: 8 week washout period, with 2 visits to monitor safety and ACR
