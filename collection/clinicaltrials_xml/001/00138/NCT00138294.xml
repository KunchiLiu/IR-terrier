  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to learn if influenza vaccines (live attenuated and
      inactivated influenza vaccines), when given to school-aged children 4 to 18 years of age,
      can stop or lessen the influenza (flu) outbreak in the community. Another purpose is to show
      that vaccination of these children will significantly reduce breathing problems (in the
      vaccinated children and unvaccinated people they come in contact with in the community) that
      require a visit to the doctor for treatment. Another purpose is to continue to collect
      safety and flu protection information on live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV or FluMist)
      given to children. The study investigators believe that vaccination of healthy school-aged
      children is an effective plan for preventing many people in the community from catching the
      flu. Children will take part in the study for 5 to 10 months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this renewal application (2008-2012), the study goal is to control epidemic influenza
      through active immunization of healthy school-aged children with the cold-adapted,
      trivalent, live, attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV)and at-risk children with the
      inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) through a school-based vaccination program. The
      hypothesis is that universal vaccination of healthy school-aged children is an alternative
      and effective strategy for the control of epidemic influenza, and will serve as a model for
      the control of pandemic influenza and biodefense. The specific aims of the study are: to
      control the spread of influenza to susceptible adults 35 years of age or older by
      vaccination of school-aged children 4-18 years of age; to control the spread of influenza to
      susceptible children and young adults less than 35 years of age by vaccination of
      school-aged children 4-18 years of age; to develop a school-based vaccination program for
      rapid and timely delivery of LAIV and IIV to children 4-18 years of age; to demonstrate in
      school-aged children the direct and total effectiveness of influenza vaccines to reduce the
      rates of medically attended acute respiratory illness (MAARI) in LAIV and IIV recipients
      during influenza epidemics; and to capture safety information on LAIV post-licensure. This
      is an open-label, up to four year community-based study. In each of the first three study
      years, school-aged children (4 through 18 years of age) who receive medical care at the
      Scott &amp; White Clinics (SWCs), Temple-Belton area, Texas, will be asked to participate in
      this study. Study participants will receive LAIV or IIV according to their health status.
      Other children from Temple-Belton area who do not receive medical care at the SWC will be
      invited to participate in the study and may receive LAIV or IIV. A comparable population
      enrolled in the SWCs in Waco/McLennan County area and Bryan/College Station will serve as
      comparison groups. In the fourth and final year of the study, LAIV will not be provided
      through the study. However, influenza surveillance will continue and MAARI data will be
      collected to assess continued protective benefit of influenza vaccines. The final year will
      also be devoted to completion of data analysis and preparation of manuscripts. Children 4
      years through 8 years who have not previously been vaccinated with an influenza vaccine will
      be offered a second dose 4 to 6 weeks after the first dose. The influenza vaccines will
      contain the three influenza virus strains chosen by the FDA. Each subject will receive by
      nasal spray a 0.2 ml dose (0.1 ml in each nostril) of the LAIV or 0.5 ml intramuscularly.
      The duration of each study year is approximately five to ten months, from the time of
      enrollment (August to January, at the discretion of the investigators) depending on vaccine
      availability and the timing of influenza activity, to the end of the influenza season (May).

Serious adverse events (SAEs) and MAARI adverse events within 42 days post vaccination will be captured in seasonal (CAIV-T and IIV-T) and pandemic vaccinated study subjects.</description>
