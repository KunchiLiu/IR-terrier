      Cervical metastasis is the single most important prognostic factor in head and neck cancers.
      Appropriate management of the neck is therefore of paramount importance in the treatment of
      these cancers. While it is obvious that the positive neck must be treated, controversy has
      always surrounded the clinically node negative neck with respect to the ideal treatment
      policy.The situation is difficult with regards to early cancers of the oral cavity (T1/T2).
      These cancers are usually treated with surgery where excision is through the per-oral route.
      Elective neck dissection in such a situation is an additional surgical procedure with its
      associated costs, prolonged hospitalization and may be unnecessary in as high as 80% of
      patients who finally turn out to be pathologically node negative. Should the neck be
      electively treated or there be a wait and watch policy? Current practice is that the neck is
      always addressed whenever there is an increased propensity to cervical metastasis or when
      patient follow-up is unreliable.

      There is clearly a need therefore for a large randomized trial that will resolve the issue
      either way once and for all.

      Primary Objective:

      To demonstrate whether elective neck dissection (END) is equal or superior to the wait and
      watch policy i.e.

      therapeutic neck dissection (TND) in the management of the clinically No neck in early T1
      /T2 cancers of the oral cavity.

      Secondary Objective:

        1. Does Ultrasound examination have any role in the routine initial workup of a node
           negative patient?

        2. How are patients ideally followed up -does sonography have a role or is clinical
           examination sufficient.

        3. Is assessment of tumor thickness by the surgeon at the time of initial surgery accurate
           -Is there a correlation

        4. Identify histological prognostic factors in the primary that may help identify a
           sub-set of patients at an increased risk for cervical metastasis.

      ELECTIVE VERSUS THERAPEUTIC NECK DISSECTION IN THE TREATMENT OF EARLY NODE NEGATIVE SQUAMOUS
      CELL CARCINOMA OF THE ORAL CAVITY

      INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND INFORMATION:

      Cervical metastasis is single most important prognostic factor in head and neck cancers.
      Appropriate management of neck is therefore of paramount importance in treatment of these
      cancers. Should neck be electively treated or there be a wait and watch policy? Current
      practice is that neck is always addressed whenever there is an increased propensity to
      cervical metastasis or when patient follow-up is unreliable. This is usually case with large
      T staged cancers (T3/T4) and also when the neck is entered at time of surgery for primary.

      Situation is however different with regards early cancers of oral cavity (T1/T2). These
      cancers are usually treated with surgery where excision is through per-oral route. Elective
      neck dissection in such a situation is an additional surgical procedure with its associated
      costs, prolonged hospitalization , morbidity and may be unnecessary in as high as 80% of
      patients who finally turn out to be pathologically node negative. There is considerable
      debate whether to treat neck electively world over and there is no definite evidence to
      support either policy of wait and watch or elective neck treatment. Proponents of elective
      neck treatment cite fact that in those patients whose necks are observed, nodal recurrences
      are detected at an advanced stage which is detrimental to ultimate outcome of patient.

      Major draw back of all trials apart from retrospective nature is fact that total numbers of
      patients in majority of them are very small (none more than 150, majority less than 100) and
      over different time spans to draw meaningful conclusions. It would therefore be attractive
      to prove this point conclusively in a prospective randomized trial.

      To date there have been three prospective trials conducted to address this issue, two were
      inconclusive while one showed a benefit towards elective neck dissection. First and most
      widely cited study was from Institute Gustave- Roussy in 75 patients with oral cavity
      cancers who had either elective or salvage RND.In this study, both groups of patients had
      similar survival rates . Fakih et.al. ,reported similar findings in a study from our
      institution where 100 patients were randomized into two groups, elective neck dissection
      versus wait and watch. Only 70 of these were evaluable. Disease free survival (median
      follow-up 20 months) was 52 % versus 63% in patients who underwent hemiglossectomy alone and
      those who underwent hemiglossectomy and radical neck dissection, respectively. This
      difference though slightly in favor of elective neck dissection was not statistically
      significant . Finally a prospective trial conducted by Kligerman and co-workers in Brazil
      randomized 67 patients with T1-2 N0 SCC of floor of mouth or oral tongue to receive
      resection of primary alone or resection and elective neck dissection. Occult disease was
      seen in 21% of those who had received END and recurrence was seen in 24% of patients in this
      group. By comparison recurrence rate was 42% in resection only group. This translated into a
      3.5-year disease free survival group of 49% in resection only arm versus 72% in arm that
      received END (7). It is obvious from above that major shortcoming in all three studies as in
      retrospective studies was relatively small number of patients recruited in these trials (75,
      100 &amp; 63).

      Thus there is clearly a need for a large randomized trial that will resolve issue either way
      once and for all. Origin of such a trial from West is difficult due to relative lack of such
      cancers in that part of world. At Tata hospital itself on conservative estimate 100-150
      patients would be eligible for enrollment each year on such a trial. Moreover trial design
      and treatment arms are simple and this is ideal for a multicentre trial in India as
      standardization and uniformity would be easily achievable across all participating centers.

      Presently there is no global consensus on management of early T1/T2 cancers with a
      clinically negative neck. As a consequence current practice world over includes:

        1. Elective neck dissection as a staging procedure . Clinical assessment of lesion with
           respect to size and depth of infiltration.

        2. Assessment of neck with ultrasound or ultrasound guided FNAC or CT / MRI.

        3. Wait and watch policy (in belief that neck dissection is unnecessary in up to 80% of
           patients)

        4. Interval neck dissection

        5. Sentinel node biopsy. trial proposed will help answer all above questions except last.
           AIMS OF STUDY

      Primary Objective:

      To demonstrate whether elective neck dissection (END) is equal or superior to wait and watch
      policy i.e.therapeutic neck dissection (TND) in management of clinically No neck in early T1
      /T2 cancers of oral cavity.

      Secondary Objective:

        1. Does Ultrasound examination have any role in the routine initial workup of a node
           negative patient?

        2. How are patients ideally followed up -does sonography have a role or is clinical
           examination sufficient.

        3. Is assessment of tumor thickness by the surgeon at the time of initial surgery accurate
           -Is there a correlation

        4. Identify histological prognostic factors in the primary that may help identify a
           sub-set of patients at an increased risk for cervical metastasis.

      Stratification criteria:

        1. Size

        2. Sex

        3. Site

        4. Sonography

      Ethical Concerns:

      1. Should patients with ultrasonography findings suggestive of metastasis be removed from
      randomization

        -  Ultrasonography is a simple and often used method to detect neck metastasis.
           Sensitivity ranges from 50-75%. These figures are much higher in centers that routinely
           practice sonography to detect neck metastasis as in some centers in Europe. However it
           is not an accepted standard of care world over including USA and in India in initial
           management of a patient with a node negative neck. Moreover an accurate ultrasound of
           neck is extremely operator dependent and whether its routine use can be recommended
           particularly in a country may be difficult.

        -  Specificity of ultrasonography in clinically node negative neck is only 50-70%. This
           can be increased by addition of fine needle aspiration cytology of enlarged nodes.
           Doing this procedure routinely in all patients will be difficult or next to impossible
           given expertise required both by sonologist as well as pathologist particularly in our
           country.

        -  Costs- Even though ultrasound is relatively inexpensive there are significant costs and
           waiting periods involved given number of patients with oral cancers in country.

        -  There is no evidence in literature that sono detection of occult metastasis and
           immediate surgery translates into better control or survival.

        -  Interval neck dissection was performed in Vandenbrooks prospective series where primary
           was treated with radiotherapy and patients randomized to either neck dissection or wait
           and watch six weeks later.

      Protocol amendment details:

      Protocol amendment was accepted by Scientific ethics committee/Instititional Review board on
      29/12/2008 as follows:

      All patients will undergo a pre randomization ultrasonography of neck. If USG report
      suggests metastasis patients would be treated according to merit to avoid ethical concerns
      and if USG report is normal or indeterminate, patients would be randomized for trial. This
      protocol amendment is done in view of following 2 reasons.

      Very often patients are uncomfortable to give consent when they are explained that initial
      ultrasonography report will be blinded and findings will not be considered in deciding
      patient's treatment plan. This resulted in lower recruitment of patients and it also raised
      ethical issues when blind was not adequately maintained especially if sonography suggested
      metastasis.

      To overcome a difference of opinion amongst examining clinicians about a clinically
      significant node.

      However, breaking blind would have no bearing on outcome / impact of this study.

      Randomization (I): All patients will be randomly allocated into one of two arms: wait and
      watch policy group or elective neck dissection group. Both arms will have similar wide
      excision of primary tumor in oral cavity per oral route.

      Randomization (II): Following surgery and after complete recovery prior to discharge,
      patients will be randomized a second time for follow-up into two arms namely clinical
      examination versus clinical examination and ultrasonography of neck.

      SURGICAL PROCEDURE:

      Primary: tumor will be excised after proper exposure via per-oral route.

        -  Emphasis will be to achieve a wide clearance with tumor free margins to obviate need of
           subsequent radiotherapy to primary, which would otherwise act as a confounding factor.

      Neck: Patients randomized to neck dissection will undergo a standard supra-omohyoid neck
      dissection that will involve clearance of nodal Levels I, II, and III.Completion MND will be
      done as and when required. Patients who develop metastatic adenopathy on follow-up will
      undergo a modified neck dissection/radical neck dissection depending on size of metastatic
      disease. Those who have nodes suggestive of metastasis on follow-up sonography, will undergo
      a supraomohyoid dissection, frozen section followed by a modified neck dissection if
      positive.

      Depth of tumor infiltration though probably most important individual prognostic factor in
      deciding likelihood of cervical metastasis, is unfortunately only available to clinician
      with final histopathology report. Had this parameter been present at time of surgery patient
      with an increased likelihood of metastasis could have undergone an elective neck dissection
      while those with a lower incidence could have been saved an unnecessary operation .This
      study would help find out accuracy of correlation between gross assessments of thickness by
      surgeon, on frozen section with final thickness on histopathology and would be of importance
      in a country like ours where oral cancers are very common and facilities of frozen as well
      as expertise to measure accurately tumor thickness at histopathology may be unavailable.

      POST OPERATIVE RADIOTHERAPY:

      Standard accepted criteria will be followed. Patients receiving post operative radiotherapy
      for primary will not be included in main analysis but will be analyzed separately (Escape
      clause).

      END POINT OF STUDY:

      The primary end point will be overall survival and secondary end point will be DFS. The
      patients will be followed up until death or study close whichever is earlier. Since overall
      survival is the primary endpoint, patients will be followed up until death. telephonic or
      mail contact is acceptable.

      Local failures, distant metastasis and second primary will be documented.

      DATA COLLECTION, QUALITY CONTROL &amp; ANALYSIS:

      All data will be collected and kept at Trial Office in Clinical Research Secretariat. Data
      will be collected on separate protocol sheets (clinical, radiological, and pathological) and
      kept in trial office along with source documents. Trial coordinator will be responsible for
      upkeep of data.

      Assuming baseline overall survival of 60%, for expected improvement in treatment arm of 10%
      no. of patients required will be is 710 (355 in each arm) with α=0.05 (one sided) &amp; power of
      80% (β=20). An interim analysis is planned at 250 events (death) occur.

      Ultrasound in routine follow-up of all patients will be labor intensive. However median
      follow-up to recurrence in all studies both retrospective/prospective has been 9 months on
      an average (range 6 months- 13months). It will therefore be important to follow patients
      every vigilantly in first 12 months from primary treatment. Follow-up schedules will be:
      First visit: 4 weeks;First 6 months: 4-6 weeks; 6-12 months: 6-8 weeks; 12 months- 2 years:
      8-12 weekly; Thereafter: 3 monthly.

      Patients will be encouraged and counseled to come for check up on earlier date within range
      allowed. All patients will be followed up by one of investigators and entry made both in
      source document as well as central registration cell at CRS with study coordinator. At each
      examination patients will undergo a through head and neck examination as well as an
      ultrasound if randomized to that arm.
