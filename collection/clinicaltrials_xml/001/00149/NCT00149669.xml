  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomized study is planned over 5 years to evaluate the effectiveness of the Therapeutic
      Workplace in promoting naltrexone ingestion and abstinence in unemployed opiate-dependent
      injection drug users. Participants will be offered an opioid detoxification and naltrexone
      induction. Participants who complete the naltrexone induction will be randomly assigned to
      one of three groups. All groups will be invited to work in the Therapeutic Workplace and
      prescribed naltrexone for 26 weeks. The groups will differ in the contingencies imposed to
      work and earn salary. Work Plus Naltrexone Contingency participants will be required to
      ingest naltrexone to work, and will receive a brief pay decrease for missing a dose. Work
      Plus Naltrexone and Abstinence Contingency participants will be required to ingest
      naltrexone to work, and will receive a brief pay decrease for missing a dose of naltrexone
      or for providing an opiate or cocaine positive urine sample. Work Plus Naltrexone
      Prescription participants will be prescribed naltrexone, but will not be required to ingest
      it to work. This study will provide a rigorous evaluation of a novel employment-based
      intervention, the Therapeutic Workplace, to promote naltrexone ingestion and drug abstinence
      in a population of injection drug users who are at considerable risk of spreading or
      contracting HIV infection. Hypotheses being tested in this study are: Naltrexone ingestion
      will be maintained in the two groups exposed to the employment-based naltrexone treatment
      significantly more than the group exposed to usual-care treatment package. Opiate abstinence
      will be maintained in the two groups exposed to the employment-based naltrexone treatment
      significantly more than the group exposed to usual-care treatment package. Cocaine
      abstinence will be increased in the group reinforced for cocaine abstinence significantly
      more than the group not exposed to abstinence reinforcement.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  CDU patients will be invited to participate in the study if they: a) self-report
             injection drug use; b) have observable injection track marks; c) provide
             opiate-positive urine at intake to the CDU; d) provided cocaine-positive urine at
             intake to the CDU; e) meet DSM IV criteria for Opiate Dependence; f) are unemployed;
             g) are between the ages of 18 and 65 years old; h) are medically approved to take
             naltrexone treatment; i) report no interest in methadone treatment; j) live within
             reasonable commuting distance to the Therapeutic Workplace (e.g, all Baltimore City
             zipcodes and the following Baltimore County zipcodes will be included: 21221, 21220,
             21222, 21236, 21237, 21234, 21204, 21212).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients will be excluded if they a) have current major axis I disorders (e.g.,
             Bipolar Disorder, Schizophrenia, Psychosis NOS, Schizophreniform Disorder,
             Schizoaffective Disorder); b) if they are pregnant or breastfeeding; c) if serum
             aminotransferases results are over three times normal; d) or if the need for opioids
             to treat an identified medical problem is anticipated; e) if physical limitations
             would prevent them from working (e.g., has a cast on their hand preventing them from
             using fingers to type). In addition, the patients with active tuberculosis are not
             kept on the CDU, so those individuals will not participate in this research. These
             criteria should maintain sample homogeneity, thereby minimizing the impact of
             potential confounding variables while insuring patient safety and ability to provide
             informed consent.
