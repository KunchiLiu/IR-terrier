  <brief_title>Safety and Efficacy of a Genetically Engineered Herpes Simplex Virus NV1020 to Treat Colorectal Cancer Metastatic to Liver</brief_title>
  <official_title>A Phase I/II, Open-Label Study (With a Sequential Dose Escalation Stage Followed by an Expansion of a Selected Dose Cohort), to Evaluate the Safety and Anti-Tumor Effects of NV1020 Administered Repeatedly Via Hepatic Artery Infusion Prior to Second-Line Chemotherapy, in Patients With Colorectal Adenocarcinoma Metastatic to the Liver</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is an open-label study. It has two stages. Stage 1 is a dose escalation phase of
      the study to determine and evaluate the safety and tolerability of repeated treatments with
      a genetically engineered herpes simplex virus NV1020 administered locoregionally to the
      liver.

      Stage 2 is to evaluate the dose found in Stage 1 to be &quot;optimally tolerated&quot;. Stage 2 is to
      assess the efficacy of the optimally tolerated dose of NV1020 by itself and in combination
      with second-line chemotherapy.

      Assignment to Stage 1 or Stage 2 of the study is determined by when the patient enters the
      study.
