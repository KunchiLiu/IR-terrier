  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phase Ib/IIa study to determine the safety and efficacy of inhaled SLIT Cisplatin
      administered every other week to patients with Osteosarcoma who have disease that has spread
      to the lung.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Osteosarcoma, preferentially metastasizes to the lung. The presence of lung metastases has a
      major impact on the prognosis of patients with osteosarcoma. Upon surgical removal of the
      tumor in the lung, new pulmonary metastases often recur within months suggesting
      micro-metastatic disease resistant to systemic chemotherapy.

      The Sustained release lipid inhalation targeting (SLIT) technology offers the potential
      ability to attain a prolonged therapeutic effect of cisplatin in the lung by sustained
      release. The ability to give SLIT Cisplatin by inhalation directly to the lung permits high
      drug levels at the site of disease with low systemic exposure.

      Patients will receive SLIT Cisplatin by inhalation for a 14-day treatment cycle in this
      phase Ib/IIa, two-center, open-label, study designed to characterize the maximum tolerated
      dose. Clinical efficacy endpoints will be included and compared to historical controls, in
      addition to pharmacokinetics characterization. Efficacy will be evaluated after at least 2
      cycles of therapy. Safety data, including laboratory parameters and adverse events will be
      collected to determine the qualitative and quantitative toxicity, and reversibility of
      toxicity, of SLIT Cisplatin. Pulmonary function tests will be performed at baseline, prior
      to each course and at off-study.
