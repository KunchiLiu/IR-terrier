  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nitrous oxide is a standard part of most anaesthetic breathing mixtures. It has often been
      assumed that it reduces the amount of oxygen reaching the lower parts of the lung. However
      the results of previous studies and of some computer modelling suggests the opposite may be
      true, and that oxygen levels in the blood are actually higher with nitrous oxide. This study
      seeks to determine whether nitrous oxide increases or decreases blood oxygen levels in
      anaesthetized patients.

      The concentrating and second gas effects of nitrous oxide (N2O) uptake have been well
      described, and are produced by rapid uptake of N2O during the first several minutes of an
      inhalational anesthetic. This significantly increases alveolar and arterial O2 partial
      pressure. Theoretical modelling of alveolar gas exchange has predicted that these effects
      may not be transient but may be a persisting phenomenon. However, N2O is known to promote
      absorption atelectasis in poorly ventilated lung units.

      This study, carried out pre-cardiopulmonary bypass in 20 patients undergoing coronary artery
      surgery, measures change in PaO2 after a minimum of 30 minutes of relaxant general
      anesthesia with a FIO2 of 30%. Patients are randomised to two groups. The intervention group
      has N2O introduced following baseline blood gas measurements, while the control group
      continued breathing an identical FIO2 in N2. The change in PaO2 in the two groups is the
      primary endpoint for comparison.
