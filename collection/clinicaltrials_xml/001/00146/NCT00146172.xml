  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability as well as find the
      maximum tolerated dose for HKI-272. In addition, this study will examine the effects of the
      study drug on your tumor, and how your body uses and eliminates HKI-272.
