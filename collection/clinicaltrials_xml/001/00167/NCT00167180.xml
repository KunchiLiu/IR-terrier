  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that a pre-infusion preparative regimen
      of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine will improve the effectiveness of DLI in patients with
      blood cancers.

      When cancer relapses after donor bone marrow transplantation, regular dose chemotherapy
      offers little hope of prolonged survival. However, there is evidence that lymphocytes can
      attack cancer cells. There is considerable evidence that this immune attack on cancer cells
      is associated with graft-versus-host disease. Although graft-versus-host disease can cause
      problems, this immune reaction may, in part, be the way that bone marrow transplantation
      cures cancer. In this study we hope that infusion of immune cells from the subject's bone
      marrow donor plus a chemotherapy regimen of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine will activate
      the subject's immune system to attack their cancer.

    <description>The percentage of people in a study or treatment group who are alive for a certain period of time after they were diagnosed with or treated for a disease, such as cancer. Also called survival rate.
Overall survival will be defined as time from date of enrollment to date of death or censored at the date of last documented contact for patients still alive.</description>

    <measure>Disease-free Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>1 Year</time_frame>
    <description>The length of time after treatment ends that a patient survives without any signs or symptoms of that cancer or any other type of cancer. In a clinical trial, measuring the disease-free survival is one way to see how well a new treatment works.</description>

    <measure>Complete Remission</measure>
    <time_frame>one year</time_frame>

    <measure>Bone marrow aplasia</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 100</time_frame>
    <description>Aplastic anemia is a disorder in which the bone marrow greatly decreases or stops production of blood cells.
In aplastic anemia, the basic structure of the marrow becomes abnormal, and those cells responsible for generating blood cells (hematopoietic cells) are greatly decreased in number or absent. These hematopoietic cells are replaced by large quantities of fat.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients (age &gt; or = 1 years) with a diagnosis of relapse after related or unrelated
             allogeneic stem cell transplantation for a hematological malignancy.

          -  For CML, relapse will be defined as any cytogenetic evidence of a Philadelphia
             chromosome or persistence of BCR/ABL rearrangements by molecular testing on at least
             two measurements over a 6 month interval. If cytogenetics are normal and there is PCR
             evidence of a BCR/ABL fusion, patients will be eligible if they have evidence of a
             quantitative increase in CML measured either by quantitative PCR or by fluorescent in
             situ hybridization (FISH).

          -  For non-CML, relapse will be defined based on disease specific morphologic criteria
             from a bone marrow biopsy and aspirate or recurrence of disease specific
             cytogenetics. For disease specific definition of relapse, see appendix 3. Relapse can
             be determined morphologically with less than 5 percent blasts if definitive relapse
             can be determined. Equivocal results for relapse should result in a repeated test
             after an appropriate time interval (suggested 1 month) to determine eligibility.

        Post-transplant lymphoproliferative diseases (often referred to as EBV-associated
        lymphomas) are NOT eligible for this protocol.

          -  For Chronic Phase CML patients only

          -  - must have failed (no response in 3 months or incomplete response at 6 months) or
             refused treatment with Gleevec

          -  - if no prior DLI, CML patients will first have DLI- if relapse occurs after DLI, DLI
             with chemotherapy per this protocol will be offered

          -  Patients must be within one year of identification of relapse or if beyond that time
             period, must have at least 10% donor DNA by RFLP or cytogenetics.

          -  Same allogeneic donor (sibling or URD) used for transplantation is available for
             lymphocyte donation.

          -  No severe organ damage (by laboratory or clinical assessment) as measured by:

          -  - blood creatinine ≤ 2.0 mg/dL

          -  - liver function tests &lt; 5 x normal

          -  - left ventricular ejection fraction &gt; 40% (testing required only if symptomatic or
             prior known impairment).

          -  - pulmonary functions &gt; 50% (testing required only if symptomatic or prior known
             impairment). Oxygen saturation (&gt;92%) can be used in child where PFT's cannot be
             obtained.

          -  - chest x-ray without evidence of active infection

          -  Off prednisone and other immunosuppressive agents (given for any reason) for at least
             3 days prior to DLI infusions.

          -  Performance status ≥ 60%

          -  Women must not be pregnant or lactating. The agents used in this study may be
             teratogenic to a fetus and there is no information on the excretion of agents into
             breast milk All females of childbearing potential must have a blood test or urine
             study within 2 weeks prior to registration to rule out pregnancy

          -  Women of childbearing potential and sexually active males are strongly advised to use
             an accepted and effective method of contraception

          -  Patient must given written informed consent indicating understanding of the nature of
             the treatment and its potential risks

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Concurrent signs of acute or chronic graft-versus-host disease requiring ongoing
             treatment at the time of relapse will be ineligible.

          -  Patients being treated for GVHD with prednisone, cyclosporine, Imuran or other
             immunosuppressive medications are not eligible until these medications are
             discontinued for at least 2 weeks without a flare of GVHD.

          -  Active CNS leukemia

          -  Active fungal infection or pulmonary infiltrates (stable prior treated disease is
             allowable)

          -  HIV positive
