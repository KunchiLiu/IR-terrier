      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether radiosurgery, along with standard
      chemotherapy, immunotherapy (the treatment of cancer by modulating the immune system and
      immune response), or hormonal therapy, affects the quality and length of life. The standard
      therapy is surgery, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy alone or in any combination. A second
      purpose of this study is to determine if the levels of a special type of protein (called
      cytokines) found in the blood are related to the quality of life while on this treatment.

      Before treatment begins, you will have a physical exam and blood tests. Physical evaluations
      and blood tests will be done each week while you are receiving treatment, and at follow-up
      visits. You will be seen for follow-up evaluations 4 weeks after treatment is completed, and
      every three months thereafter. You will be asked to fill out a Quality of Life
      questionnaire, which should take 5-10 minutes to complete. This will be done prior to
      treatment and at your follow-up visits. You will receive high dose radiation therapy
      directed at the site of metastasis. This treatment will be given once a day, 5 times a week
      (Monday through Friday) for one to four weeks depending on the location and size of the
      disease to be treated.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age: no limit

          -  Karnofsky performance status (KPS) â‰¥ 70

          -  No more than 5 metastatic sites involving one or more different organs (liver, lung
             or bone).

          -  The size of the lesion must be such that it can be safely treated to sterilizing
             radiation doses according to the rules in the protocol.

          -  Previously treated lesions are not eligible unless the prescribed dose can be safely
             delivered.

          -  Concurrent therapy is allowed and recommended. The chemotherapy protocol type and
             schedule are at the discretion of the medical oncologist.

          -  Informed consent must be obtained.

          -  Pregnancy test must be negative for women of child bearing potential

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Inability of patient to be followed longitudinally as specified by protocol.

          -  Technical inability to achieve required dose based on safe dose constraints required
             for radiosurgery.

          -  Women who are pregnant or nursing.

          -  Failure to meet requirements in Inclusion Criteria

          -  Contraindications to radiation.
