      The purpose of the study is to see if a blood transfusion changes how fast blood flows to
      the intestines of a premature baby. Blood flow is measured by an ultrasound test. The
      investigators also look to see if the blood flow to the intestines depends on whether the
      baby feeds or doesn't feed during the blood transfusion.

      Currently a disparity exists among the NICU staff at Magee-Womens Hospital regarding whether
      premature infants should be fed during a blood transfusion. The effects of a blood
      transfusion on superior mesenteric artery blood flow velocity and the post-prandial
      hyperemia are not known.

      We hypothesize that the post-prandial change in mesenteric blood flow velocity (BFV) will be
      the same before as after a packed red blood cell (PRBC) transfusion among anemic premature
      infants.

      Sixty anemic infants (25-32 weeks GA, feeding &gt;= 60 cc/kg/day) will undergo pre- and
      post-feed superior mesenteric artery Doppler studies both before and after a blood
      transfusion. Infants will be stratified by current weight into two groups (&lt; 1250 grams and
      &gt; 1250 grams). In each weight stratum the infants will be randomized to feeding or NPO
      during the PRBC transfusion. Randomization will be by block design, with block sizes ranging
      from two to six infants. The investigator performing the Doppler studies will remain masked
      to the feeding assignment of the infant.

      The primary outcome for the study is the superior mesenteric artery blood flow velocity
      response to feeding between anemic and non-anemic states among premature infants. Our
      secondary outcome is the effect of feeding on BFV between anemic and non-anemic states in
      these infants. Statistical analysis will include paired and unpaired Student t-tests and
      regression analysis.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Singleton infants born at 25-32 weeks gestation who are &lt; 38 weeks post-conceptual
             age at enrollment

          2. First infant of twin gestation born at 25-32 weeks gestation who requires a blood
             transfusion; if both infants require transfusion on the same day the larger infant
             will be enrolled.

          3. Receiving bolus enteral feeds [PO (bottle) and/or PE (feeding tube)] of at least 60
             cc/kg/day

          4. A planned packed red blood cell transfusion, as per the clinical team, for anemia

          5. Infant is very likely to require a blood transfusion according to the attending
             neonatologist.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Known congenital anomalies of the heart, brain, kidneys or intestine

          2. Chromosomal abnormality

          3. Intrauterine growth restriction at &lt; 3% for weight at birth since this has been shown
             to alter mesenteric BFV and the post-prandial hyperemia

          4. Twin to twin transfusion sequence

          5. Higher order multiples

          6. Patent ductus arteriosus known to be present or currently being treated

          7. History of definite necrotizing enterocolitis Bell Stage 2 or greater

          8. Concurrent treatments with antibiotics or steroids

          9. Feeding intolerance, defined as gastric aspirate &gt; 30% of feed volume on 3 sequential
             feeds

         10. Concurrent enrollment in another randomized trial

         11. Infants discharged or transferred to another facility without having received a PRBC
             transfusion will be excluded post-hoc.
