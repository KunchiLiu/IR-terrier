  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study tests the clinical outcomes of one of two preparative regimens (determined by
      available donor source) in patients with non-malignant hemoglobinopathies. The researchers
      hypothesize that these regimens will have a positive effect on post transplant engraftment
      and the incidence of graft-versus-host-disease.

      Regimen A2 has replaced Regimen A in this study. Two patients were treated on Regimen A but
      did not have evidence of initial engraftment thus triggering the stopping rule for that arm
      of this study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prior to transplantation, subjects will receive either:

      Cyclophosphamide, Fludarabine, Campath, Total body irradiation (TBI)

      Or

      Busulfan, Cyclophosphamide, antithymocyte globulin (ATG), granulocyte colony-stimulating
      factor (GSCF)

      These drugs (and the radiation) are being given to help the new stem cells take and grow. On
      the day of transplantation, subjects will receive stem cells transfused via intravenous (IV)
      catheter.

      After stem cell transplantation, subjects will be given cyclosporine-A and mycophenolate
      (MMF)/or Methylprednisone/or Methotrexate to reduce the risk of graft-versus-host disease,
      the complication that occurs when the donor's stem cells react against the patient.
