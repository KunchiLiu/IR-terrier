    <textblock>
      This study tests the clinical outcomes of a preparative regimen of fludarabine (FLU),
      anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG)/or Campath, and melphalan; followed by hematopoietic stem cell
      transplant, and a post transplant regimen of Cyclosporin A (CsA) in patients with
      immunologic or histiocytic disorders. The researchers hypothesize that this regimen will
      have a positive effect on post transplant engraftment and the incidence of
      graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD).

      Patients will be randomized biologically into one of 3 arms based upon donor availability:
      (a) human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genotypic matched sibling donor, (b) HLA phenotypic
      matched unrelated peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) donor, (c) two HLA 0-2 antigen
      mismatched unrelated cord blood donors (double cord).

      Prior to transplantation, subjects will receive Melphalan, Fludarabine and Anti-Thymocyte
      Globulin (ATG) or Campath. These three drugs are being given to subjects to help the new
      stem cells take and grow. On the day of transplantation, subjects will receive stem cells
      transfused via intravenous (IV) catheter.

      After stem cell transplantation, subjects will be given Cyclosporin A (CsA) and
      mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) to reduce the risk of graft-versus-host disease, the
      complication that occurs when the donor's stem cells react against the patient.
