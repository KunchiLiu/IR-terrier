  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of oral 17B-estradiol (estrogen) on the
      progression of early (subclinical) atherosclerosis and cognitive decline in healthy
      postmenopausal women.

  <detailed_description>

      The primary hypothesis to be tested is that 17B-estradiol (estrogen) will reduce the
      progression of early atherosclerosis if initiated soon after menopause when the vascular
      endothelium (lining of blood vessels) is relatively healthy versus later when the
      endothelium has lost its responsiveness to estrogen. Ultrasonography will be used to measure
      the rate of change in the thickness of the carotid artery and cardiac computed tomography
      (CT) will be used to measure coronary artery calcium and coronary artery lesions. The second
      hypothesis to be tested is that 17B-estradiol (estrogen) will reduce the progression of
      cognitive decline if initiated soon after menopause when healthy brain tissue remains
      responsive to estrogen versus later when brain tissue has lost its responsiveness to
      estrogen.

      A total of 643 (actual)(504, initially proposed) postmenopausal women were randomized
      according to their number of years since menopause, less than 6 years or 10 years or more,
      to receive either oral 17B-estradiol 1 mg daily or a placebo. Women with a uterus will also
      use vaginal progesterone gel 4% (or a placebo gel) the last ten days of each month. The
      vaginal progesterone will be distributed in a double-blind fashion along with the randomized
      treatment so that only women exposed to active treatment will receive active progesterone.
      As initially proposed, participants will undergo ultrasonography at baseline and every 6
      months throughout the 2 to 5 years (average 3 years) of randomized treatment. Participants
      will also undergo cognitive testing at baseline and after 3 years of randomized treatment.
      The trial has been extended for an additional 2 to 2.5 years of randomized treatment
      (overall average randomized treatment of 5 years and range of 2 to 8.5 years).
      Ultrasonography will continue to be collected every 6 months and upon completion of
      randomized treatment, participants will undergo cardiac CT for coronary artery calcium and
      coronary artery lesion measurements. Participants will also undergo a third cognitive
      testing at the completion of randomized treatment.
