  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This compound, GR270773, is a lipid based compound being developed to treat Sepsis. Lipids
      are broken down in the body by the liver. This study is designed to see whether the effect
      of the drug in people with poorly functioning livers is any different to the effect on
      healthy adults.
