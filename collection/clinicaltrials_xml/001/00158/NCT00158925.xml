      This is a prospective, single-armed, multi-center U.S., Australian, Canadian, and European
      clinical investigation, designed to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the EASYTRAK
      EPI lead in humans.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who meet the EASYTRAK EPI indications

          -  Patients who are age 18 or above, or of legal age to give informed consent specific
             to state and national law

          -  Patients who are willing and capable of providing informed consent, undergoing a
             device implant, participating in all testing associated with this clinical
             investigation at an approved clinical investigational center and at the intervals
             defined by this protocol

          -  Patients who meet any one of the following three conditions:

               -  Meet current indications for cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) and
                  epicardial placement of a pace/sense lead on the left ventricle is preferred
                  over an endocardial lead

               -  Meet current indications for a cardiac pacing system and have documented
                  evidence that an endocardial lead cannot be used

               -  Meet current indications for a cardiac pacing system and a concurrent cardiac
                  surgical procedure is taking place where no additional surgical procedures are
                  required to provide access to the epicardial surface of the heart

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who meet the EASYTRAK EPI contraindications

          -  Patients who have had a myocardial infarct, unstable angina, or percutaneous coronary
             intervention during the preceding 30 days prior to enrollment

          -  Patients with a documented life expectancy of less than 6 months or expected to
             undergo heart transplant within the next 6 months

          -  Patients enrolled in any concurrent study, without Guidant written approval, that may
             confound the results of this study

          -  Women who are pregnant or plan to become pregnant
