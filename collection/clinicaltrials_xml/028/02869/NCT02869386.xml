  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prehospital stroke care in specialized ambulances increases thrombolysis rates, reduces
      alarm-to-treatment times, and improves prehospital triage. Preliminary analyses suggest
      cost-effectiveness. However, scientific proof of improved functional outcome compared to
      usual care is still lacking. The objective of this trial is to show improved functional
      outcomes after deployment of the Stroke Emergency Mobile (STEMO) compared to regular care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a pragmatic, prospective, multi-center trial with blinded outcome assessment of
      treatment candidates three months after stroke. Treatment candidates will be defined as
      patients with final discharge diagnosis of cerebral ischemia, and onset-to-alarm time ≤4
      hours, symptoms not resolved at time of ambulance arrival, and able to walk without
      assistance prior to emergency. These patients will be included if their emergency call from
      a predefined catchment area in Berlin, Germany, caused a stroke alarm at the dispatch center
      during STEMO hours (7am-11pm, Monday-Sunday). About 45% of STEMO dispatches will be handled
      by regular ambulances since STEMO will be already in operation creating the quasi-randomized
      control group.

      B_PROUD uses data from the B-SPATIAL registry. The B-SPATIAL registry has started
      recruitment in January 2016. However, B_PROUD recruits patients with symptom onset October
      1st, 2016 or later (because data access at the dispatch center had to be established first).
