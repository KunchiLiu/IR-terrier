    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the onset and maintenance of effect of
      benralizumab on lung function, blood eosinophils, asthma control metrics and quality of life
      during 12-week treatment in patients with uncontrolled, severe asthma with eosinophilic
      inflammation. A subset of patients will take part in body plethysmography substudy to
      further investigate the effect on lung function.
