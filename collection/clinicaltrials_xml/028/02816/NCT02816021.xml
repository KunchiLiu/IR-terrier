    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if oral azacitidine (CC-486) and
      pembrolizumab (MK-3475) can help to control melanoma. The safety of this drug combination
      will also be studied.

      Study Drug Administration:

      Each study cycle is 3 weeks.

      Participant will take azacitidine by mouth 1 time each day on Days 1-15 of each cycle.

      Participant will receive pembrolizumab by vein over about 30 minutes on Day 1 of each cycle.

      Study Visits:

      On Day 1 of Cycles 1-3:

        -  Participant will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2½ teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  During Cycle 1 only (if it was not done at screening), blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be
           drawn to learn if the study drugs have affected the disease.

        -  During Cycle 3 only, participant will have 4 core needle tumor biopsies.

        -  If participant can become pregnant, part of the above routine blood sample or urine
           will be collected for a pregnancy test.

      On Day 1 of Cycle 4:

        -  Participant will have a physical exam.

        -  Participant will have an MRI or CT scan.

        -  Blood (about 4 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to learn if the study
           drugs have affected the disease.

        -  If participant can become pregnant, part of the above routine blood sample or urine
           will be collected for a pregnancy test.

      On Day 1 of Cycle 5:

        -  Participant will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2½ teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  Participant will have 4 core needle tumor biopsies.

        -  If participant can become pregnant, part of the above routine blood sample or urine
           will be collected for a pregnancy test.

      On Day 1 of Cycles 6 and beyond:

        -  Participant will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (up to 3½ teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests. During Cycle 7, this blood
           will be used to learn if the study drugs have affected the disease.

        -  During Cycle 7 only, if participant can become pregnant, part of the above routine
           blood sample or urine will be collected for a pregnancy test.

      On Day 1 of Cycle 8 and then every 4 cycles after that (Cycles 12, 16, 20, and so on),
      participant will have an MRI or CT scan.

      Length of Study:

      Participant may continue taking the study drugs for as long as the doctor thinks it is in
      participant's best interest. Participant will no longer be able to take the study drugs if
      the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if participant is unable to
      follow study directions.

      End-of-Treatment Visit:

        -  Blood (about 4 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine testing and to learn how the study
           drug has affected the disease.

        -  Participant will have an MRI or CT scan.

        -  If participant stops treatment because the disease got worse, participant may have 4
           core needle tumor biopsies.

        -  If participant can become pregnant, part of the above routine blood sample or urine
           will be collected for a pregnancy test.

      Follow-Up:

      If participant stopped taking the study drug for any reason other than the disease getting
      worse, participant will have an MRI or CT scan every 6 weeks. After 1 year, participant will
      have these scans every 9 weeks.

      If the disease appears to get worse during this time, participant may be eligible to be
      re-treated with pembrolizumab for an additional year (described below).

      Re-Treatment:

      If the disease got worse during follow-up and participant is still eligible, participant may
      be able to receive up to 1 year of additional treatment with pembrolizumab. If participant
      continues to receive pembrolizumab, participant will receive it at the same dose and
      schedule as described above. Participant will also continue to have study visits as
      described above.

      Safety Follow-Up Visit:

      About 30 days after participant's last dose of study drugs or before participant starts a
      new anti-cancer treatment (whichever happens first), participant will have a safety
      follow-up visit. At this visit, participant will have a physical exam and participant will
      have an MRI or CT scan.

      This may mean that participant has 2 safety follow-up visits if participant receives an
      additional year of pembrolizumab.

      Long-Term Follow-Up:

      After follow-up, participant will be called every 12 weeks by a member of the study staff to
      learn how participant is doing. This call should last about 5 minutes.

      This is an investigational study. Azacitidine is FDA approved and commercially available for
      the treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia. Pembrolizumab is
      FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of melanoma. It is considered
      investigational to use this drug combination to treat melanoma.

      The study doctor will explain how the study drugs are designed to work.

      Up to 71 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.
