    <textblock>
      This study investigates the clinical and neural effects of MBSR for young adults with
      childhood adversity. The investigators will recruit 60 young adults (19-35 years old) who
      will be randomized into a mindfulness based stress reduction(MBSR) program or a cognitive
      psychoeducation (CPE) program, both of which are 8 weeks long. MRI and psychological
      assessments will be acquired from all subjects before and after the intervention programs in
      order to investigate changes in clinical symptoms (such as depression, anxiety and stress)
      and hippocampus structure and function as well as other neural changes.
