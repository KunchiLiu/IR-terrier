  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Detrusor hyperactivity is an urodynamic observation defined by involuntary detrusor
      contractions during the vesical filling. Within neurological bladders childs, especially
      related to spinal dysraphisms, this hyperactivity, associated or not with vesical compliance
      disorders, can involve a urinary incontinence obstructing social integration and possibly
      vesical pressure rise in the intra- potentially generating the high urinary tract lesions.
      Anticholinergic drugs possibly associated with a vesical draining constitute the treatment
      of first intention. In approximately 15 to 20% of the cases, intradetrusor iterative
      injections of type A Botulinum Toxin are proposed fault of satisfactory results. Largely
      used according to the European consensus of 2008 without AM, actual studies remain realized
      on small numbers with low level of proof. Posology remains discussed between pharmaceutical
      laboratories (derivative of the effective maximum amount per adult kg of weight) and weaker
      amounts used with clinical results.

      The main aim of the study is to so determine dosages with mid--amount of TBA would make it
      possible to anticipate not-inferiors results with full posology and to determine the benefit
      ratio/risk improvement. This could lead to an important reduction of the treatment costs.
      This study also aims to better identy the &quot;non responders&quot; patients in order to refine the
      indications. Thanks to the participation of a French urologic paediatric surgery centers,
      the study hope to homogenize practices and to use standardized common criteria of judgement.

      Lastly, this study should appreciate if it is possible not to more bring back posology to
      the weight of the child, but on detrusor surface allowing a more precise estimation of the
      amounts to be managed.

      A complementary study on the quality of life of these children before and after treatment
      will be carried out thanks to Child Health Questionnaire (CHQ 50). The diagram of the study
      is a randomized therapeutic test controlled not-inferiority aiming at comparing an amount
      full versus an half-amount with TBA.

      The population of the study will be made up children from 3 to 15 years treated for detrusor
      hyperactivity, confirmed by an aurodynamic assessment according to the criteria of
      International the Society Continence, origin neurological, and resistant to the medical care
      associated with the usual accompanying measures.
