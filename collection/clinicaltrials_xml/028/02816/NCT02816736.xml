      The primary objective of the study is to determine whether, in patients with symptomatic,
      advanced heart failure due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction, treatment with LCZ696
      for 24 weeks will improve Pro-B-type Natriuretic Peptide (NT-proBNP) levels, which reflect
      hemodynamic and clinical status, compared to treatment with valsartan.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with advanced heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) have extremely
      high morbidity and mortality with 1 year outcomes of death and hospitalization of
      approximately 50%. For the most advanced heart failure patients, the evidence base for
      medical treatment is limited with consensus guidelines recommending consideration for either
      cardiac transplant or ventricular assist device, or palliative care.

      The PARADIGM-HF trial showed that LCZ696, which consists of the neprilysin inhibitor
      sacubitril and the ARB valsartan, improved morbidity and mortality in patients with chronic
      HFrEF in comparison to enalapril. However, limited experience with advanced heart failure
      patients was gained from patients enrolled in the trial. Because the information on the
      effects of sacubitril/valsartan in patients with NYHA class IV heart failure is limited, the
      updated 2016 ACC/AHA/HFSA guidelines for the treatment of heart failure do not yet endorse
      the use of sacubitril/valsartan in patients with NYHA class IV heart failure. Accordingly,
      experience is needed on the use of, and outcomes with LCZ696 in patients unable to tolerate
      target doses of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI)/ angiotensin receptor blocker
      (ARB).

      This study will be a randomized, double-blinded trial of advanced heart failure subjects
      with 1:1 randomization to either LCZ696 (sacubitril and valsartan) or valsartan. Study drug
      will be administered in a double-dummy fashion, in which subjects take active (LCZ696 or
      valsartan) and placebo. Approximately 400 subjects will be randomized into the study.

      Subjects will have an initial screening evaluation, including baseline laboratory tests as
      well as an assessment of left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction, at which time preliminary
      subject eligibility will be determined. The LV ejection fraction may have been obtained
      within the prior 3 months by 2-D echocardiogram, LV angiogram or radionuclide scintigraphy.
      Willing subjects meeting entry criteria will be consented. Those who meet all entry criteria
      and are interested in study participation will be enrolled.

      Enrolled subjects will complete baseline assessments and undergo a run-in period of 3-7 days
      with LCZ696 50 mg (equivalent to Entresto™ 24/26 mg) po BID prior to randomization. For
      subjects taking an ACEI, the ACEI will be withheld for ≥ 36 hours prior to first dose of
      LCZ696.

      Subjects who tolerate the run-in period with LCZ696 will be randomized 1:1 to LCZ696 or
      valsartan.

      Study treatment will be titrated to the target dose of 200 mg LCZ696 (equivalent to
      Entresto™ 97/103 mg) as two 100 mg LCZ696 and 2 placebo tablets po BID or valsartan 160 mg
      (two 80 mg valsartan and 2 placebo tablets) po BID.*

      Randomized subjects will receive the first dose of study drug as follows:

        -  For subjects not previously taking ACEI or ARB, previously taking ACEI or ARB at a low
           dose*, or subjects who have an eGFR &lt; 30 mL/min/1.73m², the starting dose of valsartan
           will be 40 mg po BID and the starting dose of LCZ696 will be 50 mg po BID.

        -  For subjects taking an ARB at greater than low dose†, the starting dose of valsartan
           will be 80 mg po BID and the starting dose of LCZ696 will be 100 mg po BID.

        -  For subjects taking an ACEI at greater than low dose†, the ACEI will be withheld for ≥
           36 hours prior to randomization. The starting dose of valsartan will be 80 mg po BID
           and the starting dose of LCZ696 will be 100 mg po BID.

      Per package insert, the valsartan compounded in Entresto™ is more bioavailable than the
      valsartan in other marketed formulations. The dose equivalence for valsartan compounded in
      Entresto™ compared to valsartan prepared alone (Entresto™ dose = marketed valsartan dose) is
      as follows: 26 mg=40 mg, 51 mg=80 mg, 103 mg=160 mg.

      † Low dose is defined as 24 hour dose of ≤ 10 mg lisinopril, ≤ 5 mg ramipril, ≤ 50 mg
      losartan, ≤ 10 mg olmesartan, or other dose equivalent.

      Dose adjustments will be performed every 2 weeks by doubling the dose of LCZ696 or valsartan
      up to the target maximum dose. The doses of LCZ696 are 50 mg (one 50 mg active and 1 placebo
      tablet), 100 mg (one 100 mg active and 1 placebo tablet) and 200 mg (two 100 mg active and 2
      placebo tablets). These doses are equivalent to 24/26 mg, 49/51 mg, and 97/103 mg commercial
      Entresto™, respectively. The doses of valsartan are 40mg (one 40 mg active and 1 placebo
      tablet), 80 mg (one 80 mg active and 1 placebo tablet), and 160 mg (two 80 mg active and 2
      placebo tablets). The criteria for doubling the dose will be based on systolic blood
      pressure (a SBP &gt; 90 mmHg is required for up titration), changes in renal function (maximum
      serum creatinine of 2.0 mg/dL), and the absence of symptoms of hypotension. For those not
      tolerating the current dose of study drug, the dose will be down-titrated to the previous
      tolerated dose. Subjects will return to clinic for follow-up visits at 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24
      weeks after randomization.

      Assessments at the follow-up visits include some or all of the following: medical history,
      review of medications, physical examination with the New York Heart Association (NYHA) class
      assessment, Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) quality of life questionnaire,
      local laboratory testing (creatinine, Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN), electrolytes), Core
      laboratory testing (Cystatin C, NT-proBNP), adherence and tolerance assessment, and adverse
      event monitoring.

      Follow-up phone calls will be made at 10, 16, and 20, weeks after randomization to assess
      dosing compliance, record the occurrence of applicable adverse events and events of
      interest, and remind the subject of the date and time of their next in-person visit.

      A final phone visit is conducted 2 weeks after the last dose of study drug (26 weeks after
      randomization) to assess clinical stability and any applicable adverse events.

      During the consent process, subjects will be asked if interested in donating samples and
      data for research purposes via a biorepository and/or genetic study. Based on site and IRB
      preference, this optional part of the study may be incorporated into the main consent or may
      be a separate consent and Institutional Review Board (IRB) application.
