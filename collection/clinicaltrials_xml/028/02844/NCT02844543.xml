  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the effects of exercise and non-concussive bodily contact on
      eye-tracking scores collected by the EYE-SYNC eye-tracking device.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to prospectively study a cohort of 18-25-year-old athletes.
      Athletes will be tested with the EYE-SYNC eye-tracking device prior to the start of an
      athletic practice or competition (pre-test) and then after the conclusion of the
      practice/competition (post-test). The investigators hope to understand if eye-tracking
      scores are effected by exercise and non-concussive bodily contact commonly incurred during
      athletic play.

    <description>The EYE-SYNCÂ® portable eye-tracking system. The eye tracker is a handheld isolated display environment with embedded eye tracking sensors. The eye tracker is connected to a high-performance Windows tablet though a customized docking station. Included accessories with EYE-SYNC are a U.S. tablet power supply adapter and disposable sanitary masks. Participants are asked to follow a dot with their eyes, as the dot moves on the screen of the EYE-SYNC device.</description>

    <description>Eye movements are recorded with an eye tracking system with up to 1000 Hz temporal resolution. The target stimulus is presented on a computer screen approximately 50 cm from the participant. Participants are asked to follow a dot with their eyes, as the dot moves on the monitor screen of the desk-top eye-tracking device.</description>
