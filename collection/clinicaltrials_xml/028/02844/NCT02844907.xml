  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the interaction of GLP-1 and GIP to regulate
      insulin secretion in nondiabetic subjects. The first part of this aim will determine the
      threshold plasma concentration of GLP-1 that increases insulin secretion to test the
      hypothesis that fasting levels of circulating GLP-1 are insufficient to mediate β-cell
      secretion. The second part of the aim will determine whether the insulin response to
      specific amino acids is dependent on the α-cell release of GLP-1.

      The study will enroll up to 40 healthy overweight participants and while it is anticipated
      that the screening blood draw will yield a number of screen failures, it is estimated that
      12 subjects will complete the entire study protocol. Enrolled participants will be asked to
      complete five study visits including the consent visit and four infusion study visits that
      will include hyperglycemic clamps. Each infusion procedure will last 4 hours.

      The primary outcome for visits 2-3 will be insulin secretion in response to hyperglycemia
      and GLP-1. Data will be analyzed using 2-way ANOVA for repeated measures using time and
      treatment as the two factors. Post-hoc comparisons will be used to determine the stage when
      intact GLP-1 levels exceed fasting levels and the stage when insulin secretion exceeds that
      of the clamp alone. The primary outcome for visits 4-5 will be arginine-stimulated insulin
      secretion with and without GLP-1r blockade. The mean increment of ISR above baseline in the
      15 minutes after arginine stimulation will be used to integrate insulin secretion, the
      primary outcome measure, and two-way analysis of variance with fasting/hyperglycemia, and
      Ex-9/saline as the two factors; post-hoc comparisons among the 4 insulin responses will be
      made if a significant interaction is present.

    <description>During the 4-hour procedure, a variable infusion of 20% dextrose and blood glucose will be clamped at basal + 3mM. Participants will receive an infusion of synthetic GLP-1 between the 60-160 minute time-points of the clamp. The amount of GLP-1 infused will begin at 10ng/kg/h and will increase to 20, 30, 40 and 50 ng/kg/h in 20-minute intervals.</description>

    <description>Following baseline blood sampling, participants will begin an infusion of Exendin-9 (Ex-9) (750 pmol/kg/min) for 180 minutes. One hour (time-point 60) into the infusion study, participants will receive an IV bolus infusion of 5g arginine (a simple amino acid) over 1 minute followed by frequent blood sampling over 30 minutes. Upon removal of these blood samples, a hyperglycemic clamp will begin and continued for 90 minutes. At the 150 minute time-point, a second arginine bolus will be given with frequent blood sampling (3.5ml) over the ensuing 30 minutes.</description>
