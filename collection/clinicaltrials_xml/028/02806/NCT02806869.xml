  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an in vivo study designed to acquire human gastrointestinal (GI) physiology data
      from healthy subjects under fasting and fed conditions which are necessary for mechanistic
      absorption model development. Up to 30 subjects will be enrolled into this study. Each
      subject will be asked to complete two GI tube insertion procedures. Subjects will complete
      this study twice under the same conditions of the GI tract, either fasting state or fed
      state, in order to provide intra-subject variability. A minimum of 7 days will separate each
      GI tube insertion procedure. The objectives of this study are, as follows: Objective #1: To
      acquire human GI physiology data including GI motility, pH of GI fluids, and GI fluid volume
      under fasting and fed conditions; Objective #2: To measure drug concentration and calculate
      drug dissolution in the GI tract in vivo under fasting and fed conditions; Objective #3: To
      monitor plasma drug concentration and evaluate pharmacokinetics of administered drug during
      GI tube insertion studies under fasting and fed conditions. These in vivo results will be
      used to validate in vitro dissolution methods and to support computational and mathematical
      modeling efforts, in order to develop an oral drug product optimization process that may be
      applied to future drugs to maximize oral drug safety and efficacy.
