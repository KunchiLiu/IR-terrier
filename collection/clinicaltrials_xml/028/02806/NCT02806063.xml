  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic prosthetic joint infection (PJI) is a devastating complication of arthroplasty and
      its treatment continues to fuel the debate on how to manage it appropriately.

      One stage and two stage exchange surgery both are the conventional surgical procedures for
      chronic PJI commonly used to date.

      Two stage surgery disadvantages (major surgery, anesthesia and nosocomial risks, functional
      impairment between surgeries and a high socio-economic coast) encouraged many surgical teams
      to adopt one stage exchange surgery which provides equivalent or better outcomes. However
      one stage surgery encounters a major conceptual difficulty when it comes to implant the new
      prosthesis in a surgical site microbiologically undetermined and potentially contaminated.

      Investigators suppose the new prosthesis is implanted in a contaminated setting regardless
      of bacteria type and antibiotic therapy duration before arthroplasty.

      The total lack of data answering this question motivated the conception of this prospective
      study in order to describe the microbiological setting where is implanted the new prosthesis
      with one stage exchange surgery after surgical excision and antibiotic therapy initiation in
      chronic PJI.

    <description>In routine care procedure for prosthetic joint infection (PJI), at least, five per-operative samples are taken before debridement and prosthesis removal in order to identify the causative organism. For the purpose of this study three additional per-operative samples will be performed after debridement and antibiotic initiation and prior prosthesis implantation.</description>
