    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and quality of life in postmenopausal
      women with advanced breast cancer (locally advance inoperable or metastatic adenocarcinoma
      of the breast), HR+ / HER2-, who are treated with letrozol as baseline therapy in
      combination with palbociclib (PD0332991)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, open-label, multi-center, single arm, non-comparative phase II study
      in postmenopausal women with HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer receiving palbociclib in
      addition to letrozole. The study will take place in two countries, Austria (5 study centers)
      and Germany (40 study centers).

      In total, 120 patients will be enrolled in this study. The study seeks to recruit 60 (58-62)
      patients for first-line treatment (Enrollment Group 1) and 60 (58-62) patients for second-
      or later-line treatment (Enrollment Group 2) with palbociclib and letrozole. Recruitment
      will be centrally monitored to allow closure of a respective group as soon as 60 (58-62)
      patients have been enrolled.

      Treatment will be continued until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, death or any
      other reason. In case letrozole is discontinued, palbociclib has to be discontinued. In case
      treatment with palbociclib is stopped, letrozole can be continued according to
      investigator's discretion. Irrespectively of letrozole, the discontinuation of palbociclib
      is defined as end of treatment (EOT) in this study. After EOT, the patient enters the
      follow-up period.

      Primary end point is clinical benefit response 24 weeks after the first study treatment of
      the patient.

      A study independent, decentral, &quot;virtual&quot; biobank will be established. All patients will be
      asked to give consent for their tumor samples to be used for future investigational
      research. Study sites will inform the local pathologists about the patient's consent and ask
      for the tissue sample to be reserved for future analyses. The site is requested to collect
      contact details of the pathologist storing the tumor sample, the sample's identification
      number(s), and to document these in the eCRF.

      The decision to perform subsequent investigational research studies on collected samples
      will be based on outcome data from this study or from new scientific findings related to the
      drug class or disease, as well as reagent and assay availability.
