  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Difficult weaning from ventilation and extubation failure are major issues in intensive
      care, concerning 30% and 12% of patients respectively. These can be partly explained by the
      lack of accuracy of spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) failure criteria to predict extubation
      failure. The investigators performed a pilot study to evaluate transcutaneous carbon dioxide
      pressure (tcPCO2) monitoring during SBTs. The results showed that the difference between
      maximum and initial tcPCO2 (or ΔtcPCO2) was significantly higher in the group of patients
      who failed SBTs according to the usual criteria. Moreover, the results suggested that
      ΔtcPCO2 could be an accurate and early criterion for SBT failure. The size of the study
      could not examine ΔtcPCO2 regarding extubation failure. Therefore, the main objective of
      this study is to determine if Δ tcPCO2 during SBTs is associated with extubation failure.
