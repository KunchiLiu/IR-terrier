      This is a cohort study in which patients who survive Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) during
      intensive care unit (ICU) admission are recalled at 3-6 months and renal function tests are
      performed.

      The purpose of the study is describe renal function in AKI survivors at follow up .

      Additional aims are to determine how well admission values of renal function markers perform
      as predictors of renal function at follow-up and whether estimates of renal function at
      follow-up differ depending on which renal function marker is used.

      Type of study: Cohort study with prospectively collected clinical data which is
      cross-matched with local &amp; national databases.

      Source population: Patients suffering from AKI on a mixed intensive care unit, at the
      Karolinska University Hospital, Solna.

      Setting: Single centre, Central Intensive Care unit (CIVA) Karolinska University hospital,
      Solna Stockholm from September 2008 and May 2011.

      Inclusion Criteria:

      All adults patients with AKI (according to RIFLE criteria) who survive to 3 month follow-up.

      Admission during the above time period and when study staff were in post.

      Exclusion:

      Children (patients under 18 years) Patients refusing consent or unable to give consent.
      Admission during a time when study staff not working. Death during ICU admission or during
      the first 3 months after admission.

      Exposure: AKI on ICU and grade of AKI according to the RIFLE criteria. Intervention: none

      Outcome: Renal function 3 months after ICU discharge according to creatinine and Cystatin C
      measurements.

      Parameters: Co-morbidities, ICU diagnoses, disease severity score, daily physiological and
      laboratory parameters, medications administered, interventions (Renal replacement therapy)
      RRT, mechanical intervention, inotropes, surgery.

      Data is crossmatched with national registries including the Swedish cause of death register
      (to obtain dates of death), the Swedish renal register (to obtain details of patients
      receiving chronic dialysis and with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) diagnoses. Data is also
      cross matched with a large local ICU register (Clinisoft) to obtain physiological
      parameters&amp; intervention details. Clinisoft is also used to obtain risk of death for all ICU
      patients and all AKI patients (from the source population) (ethical approval Stockholm REPN
      2010/1780-31-2 + 2001-408-32).

      Aims:

        1. Describe the incidence of renal dysfunction (GFR &lt;60ml/min/173mÂ²) at 3-6 months
           follow-up after AKI. According to serum Cystatin C and Creatinine values.

        2. Compare the ability of admissions values of Creatinine &amp; Cystatin C to predict renal
           function at follow-up three months after AKI.

        3. Compare how estimates of Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) differ when using creatinine
           and Cystatin C values obtained at follow-up.

        4. Produce a predictive model using comorbidities and admission data to predict renal
           function 3-6 months after AKI in intensive care patients.
