      There may be a relationship between heart function and the metal ION levels in patients
      having undergone total hip replacement. The idea is to use results from a clinical cardiac
      MRI to assess heart function in a sample of 20 patients whom have also undergone
      metal-on-metal hip replacement to determine whether having undergone this procedure may be
      impacting heart function. In addition to the clinically used parameters, the images will
      also be retrospectively assessed using special software to assess amount of fibrosis and
      early changes affecting cardiac muscle contraction which may be indicative of impaired heart
      function. With these values we will compare to known, and previously collected, hip
      replacement and function data to determine whether there is any differences in how the heart
      works in those having had a hip replacement relative to a normal population.

      There has been some recent concern regarding possible systemic health effects resulting from
      elevated blood cobalt concentrations in patients with cobalt containing hip implants (1). To
      date there are no blood cobalt criteria to help guide physicians when evaluating an
      individual hip implant patient's risk of developing systemic health effects because
      historically there was little or no concern about systemic cobalt toxicity in implant
      patients. Included within this is heart function, for which investigators see a need to use
      this novel software to analyze heart function relative to Hip status and Metal Ion levels.

      Patients with metal on metal hip prosthesis are subject to local and systemic release of
      cobalt and chromium ions which may increase the potential for locally aggressive ion-induced
      local tissue reactions such as pseudotumours, a type of Adverse Reaction to Metal Debris
      (ARMD) (2). Although there have been reports of local toxicity as well as cases of cobaltism
      (as seen during outbreak in Quebec of so called 'cobalt beer drinkers' cardiomyopathy)
      leading to cardiac and ototoxicity, it is unclear if chronic exposure to these ions can lead
      to impaired cardiac function (cardiotoxicity) in a well-functioning prosthesis.

      The majority of the blood cobalt concentrations reported for hip implant patients appear to
      range from approximately 0.2 to 10 µg/L, and based on our review of the available
      literature, should not pose an increased risk for the development of systemic health
      effects.

      The concern for systemic health effects is for the small number of patients with
      cobalt-containing hip implants with markedly elevated blood cobalt concentrations.

      Extensive evaluations of these 'cobalt beer drinkers' have found that poor nutrition and
      underlying disease states caused by severe alcoholism were likely significant contributing
      factors to heart disease in this particular population. However, there remains a significant
      concern that cardiac function could be affected in the long term. This is especially
      relevant as the majority of these implants are put in patients less than 50 years age.

      Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) is the gold standard method to assess cardiac
      function in patients at risk of cardiotoxicity. In addition to assessing cardiac function,
      CMR enables imaging of inflammation, and fibrosis (which may be secondary to the ion
      deposition) in the heart which may provide more specific information about the mechanism of
      injury in these patients.

      The purpose of this study is to look at cardiac function in patients with a metal on metal
      hip prostheses.

      Recruitment: 20 patients in total (10 unilateral and 10 bilateral) will be recruited which
      should provide indication of relationship both between either instances and heart function,
      as well as compared to one another. All patients will be undergoing clinical cardiac MRI and
      have previously undergone Metal on Metal hip arthroplasty. All patients will have extra
      images collected during their MRI and these images will be analyzed to determine any
      relationship between heart function and the possible metal ion levels from the hip implant.
      As part of the scan analysis they will be required to also have a 5mL vial of blood
      collected. Ultrasound values will be retrospectively collected, for analysis of soft tissue
      reaction, from a previous clinically ordered Ultrasound of the affected joint.
