  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In 1965, Emile Letournel and Robert Judet reported their experiences on acetabular fractures
      at the 5th day of the Raymond Poincaré Hospital in Garches. Classification Letournel is
      still relevant and in use today.

      Many studies have sought to determine if the treatment had to be surgical or orthopedic.
      Although the standard treatment of displaced fractures of the acetabulum is the reduction
      and osteosynthesis, some advocate the THA in elderly patients with comminuted fracture of
      the acetabulum, impaction of the femoral head or acetabular impaction affecting more than
      40% of the articular surface and including bearing zone. All these treatments and those
      supported have been studied in the literature.

      However the study of the laying of total hip remote trauma after acetabular fracture
      osteosynthesis or treated conservatively, is not rich in literature. Only a few articles
      have been published in recent years.

      Indeed, a recent review of the literature are nearly 11 series focusing on the results
      remotely hip prostheses for treatment of acetabular fracture. These two prospective series
      with between 21 and 63 patients. All authors report rates well above those reported
      complications for primary arthroplasty, with a revision of rates ranging between 0 and
      26.5%.

      Fractures of the acetabulum are covered in our service by one operator using the same
      release technique based on the stiffening. The objective of this study is to determine
      whether the systematic surgical treatment of these patients by an experienced operator
      reduces the high complication rate.

      II. objectives:

        1. Evaluation of the rate and type of complications intraoperative and postoperative, and
           revision rates.

        2. Evaluation of clinical results based on surgical strategies.

      III. Methodology

      This is a single-center retrospective study single-operator regarding the evaluation of
      surgical practice cited in goal.

      Patients were aware of the potential use of their data for medical research through oral
      information provided by the doctor at the signing by the patient's consent related to the
      surgery.

      IV. Nature of the data collected

      The data is anonymous and unidentifiable.

      Data collected include:

        -  The characteristics of the patient, as well as its history,

        -  The particular technical operating data,

        -  The nature of possible post-operative complications

        -  The clinical and radiological assessment at follow: AP pelvic radiograph, Harris score
           and score Postel Merle D'aubigné.
