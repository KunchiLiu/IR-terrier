      A new NMT module from Mindray (Mindray Co. Shenzhen, People's Republic of China.) claims to
      measure 3 directional accelerography. The aim of the study is to compare the neuromuscular
      block of rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg (twice the 95% effective dose, ED95) monitored by the NMT to
      that monitored by the Relaxometer mechanomyograph, and to clinically evaluate the new system
      for its diagnostic accuracy.

      Mechanomyography (MMG) is regarded as the standard method for precise quantification of
      neuromuscular block. The conventional MMG measures the exact force of muscle contraction in
      response to electric stimulation of the ulnar nerve. MMG quantifies the neuromuscular
      function by measurement of the force displacement. However the equipment is rather bulky,
      takes time to set up, requires a rigid support of the arm in an often-crowded operating
      room. This limits its clinical use in the daily anesthesia practice. On the other hand
      several stand-alone or modules integrated in anesthesia machines, neuromuscular monitoring
      devices such as the TOF-Guard (Organon, Oss, The Netherlands), TOF-Watch (Organon, Oss, The
      Netherlands), ParaGraph (Vital Signs, Totowa NJ, USA), or the AS/5 M-NMT (GE, Helsinki,
      Finland) based on the acceleration of a piezo-electrode or quantification of the bending of
      a piezo-wafer are currently available. Versatility and mobility comes at the expense of
      accuracy as these monitors were shown not to accurately correlate to mechanomyography as
      they are based on physiologically different phenomenon than the force displacement of the
      MMG, and compared to MMG it is well documented that the methods could not be used
      interchangeably. This is because these monitors are based on physiologically different
      phenomena than the force displacement of the MMG. Thus the techniques currently available
      have several pitfalls; MMG devices are not commercially available, whereas the methods that
      are available seem to be less reliable than MMG.
