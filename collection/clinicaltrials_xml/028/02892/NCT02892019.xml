  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to explore lung function effects of two doses of indacaterol acetate,
      75 μg and 150 μg, in pediatric asthma patients 6-11 years old, and to compare the systemic
      exposure to indacaterol in plasma with historical data in adults, to identify an appropriate
      dose to Phase III evaluation.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and female children ≥ 6 years and &lt; 12 years with confirmed diagnosis of asthma
             for at least 1 year prior to study enrollment.

          -  Written informed consent by parent(s)/legal guardian(s) and depending upon their age
             and local requirements a consent or assent for the patient.

          -  Patients receiving daily treatment with a stable low dose Inhaled Corticosteroid
             (ICS) (with or without additional controller), or patients receiving daily treatment
             with a stable mid-dose ICS (monotherapy or together with LTRA) for at least 4 weeks
             prior to Screening, and able to tolerate fluticasone propionate 100 μg b.i.d. inhaler
             starting at Visit 1 (or soon after).

          -  Patients with a pre-bronchodilator FEV1 ≥ 50% and ≤ 90% of the predicted normal value
             for the patient at the start and end of Run-in (Visits 101 and 199).

          -  Patients who demonstrate an increase in FEV1 of 12% within 30 minutes after
             administration of 400 μg salbutamol/360 μg albuterol (or equivalent dose) at Visit
             101. All patients must perform a reversibility test at Visit 101.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients taking a mid-dose ICS (per GINA guidelines) in combination with LABA or any
             patient taking high-dose ICS.

          -  Evidence of unstable disease within 4 weeks prior to Screening (Visit 1).

          -  Patients who have had an asthma attack/exacerbation requiring systemic steroids (SCS)
             or hospitalization or emergency room visit within 3 months prior to Visit 1
             (Screening) or more than 3 separate exacerbations in the 12 months preceding Visit 1.

          -  Suspected or documented bacterial or viral infection of the upper or lower
             respiratory tract, sinus or middle ear that is not resolved within 4 weeks of
             Screening (Visit 1).

          -  Prior intubation for asthma.
