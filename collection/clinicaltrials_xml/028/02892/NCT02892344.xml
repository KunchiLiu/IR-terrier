    <textblock>
      The purpose of the trial is to evaluate efficacy and safety of QMF149 150/80 microgram o.d.

      delivered via Concept1 compared to MF 200 microgram o.d., delivered via Twisthaler® in terms
      of lung function and symptom control in poorly (ie inadequately) controlled asthma patients.
      This study will assess contribution of LABA as an add-on therapy to low dose ICS
      monotherapy.

      The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate the superiority of QMF149 150/80
      microgram o.d. (in the evening) delivered via Concept1 compared with MF 200 microgram o.d.
      (in the evening) delivered via Twisthaler® in terms of trough FEV1 after 12 weeks of
      treatment in adults and adolescents. The key secondary objective of this study is to
      demonstrate the superiority of QMF149 150/80 microgram to MF 200 microgram o.d. in terms of
      ACQ-7 after 12 weeks of treatment.

             study.

          -  Patients with a history of chronic lung diseases other than asthma, including (but
             not limited to) COPD, sarcoidosis, interstitial lung disease, cystic fibrosis,
             clinically significant bronchiectasis and active tuberculosis.

          -  Patients with Type I diabetes or uncontrolled Type II diabetes.

          -  Patients with narcolepsy and/or insomnia.

          -  Patients on Maintenance Immunotherapy (desensitization) for allergies or less than 3
             months prior to Visit 101 or patients on Maintenance Immunotherapy for more than 3
             months prior to Visit 101 but expected to change throughout the course of the study.

          -  Patients with diagnosed rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp
             lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption or with known intolerance to
