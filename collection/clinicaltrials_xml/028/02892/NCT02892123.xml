      To evaluate the maximal tolerated dose (MTD), optimal biological dose (OBD) or other
      recommended dose (RD), and overall safety and tolerability of ZW25, a humanized bispecific
      monoclonal antibody targeting the extracellular domain of HER2, in patients with locally
      advanced (unresectable) and/or metastatic HER2-expressing cancers.

      This study has 2 parts. In the first part of the study, patients with any HER2-expressing
      cancer that is either HER2 1+, 2+ or 3+ by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and has progressed
      after all standard of care therapies will receive escalating doses of ZW25 in order to
      identify either the highest dose of study drug possible that will not cause unacceptable
      side effects or the dose of study drug which is thought to be associated with optimal
      biologic activity.

      In the second part of the study, patients will be enrolled into one of the below cohorts
      based the level of HER2 expression and cancer type.

        -  Cohort 1: HER2 IHC 2+/FISH negative breast cancer

        -  Cohort 2: HER2 IHC 3+ or HER2 IHC 2+/FISH positive breast cancer

        -  Cohort 3: HER2 IHC 2+/FISH negative gastric/ GEJ cancer

        -  Cohort 4: HER2 IHC 3+ or HER2 IHC 2+/FISH positive gastric/GEJ cancer

        -  Cohort 5: Any other HER2 IHC 2+ or 3+ or FISH positive cancer

      Patients will receive the dose of study drug identified in Part 1 of the study. These
      patients will be followed to further evaluate the safety of ZW25 as well as to explore
      anti-tumor activity.
