    <textblock>
      The size of the infarct is particularly important prognostic marker. It is clearly
      established that the extent of the infarct is not only correlated to mortality, but also
      long-term adverse events. The evaluation of the infarct size at the acute phase of the
      disease is therefore an essential clinical tool to adapt the immediate treatment and
      follow-up of patients. It is therefore crucial to have techniques that are effective,
      precise, reproducible, and easily performed during the acute phase to quantify the size of
      the infarct following angioplasty. Myocardial scintigraphy and cardiac MRI have been the
      standard examinations for the evaluation of infarct size. However, these exams are difficult
      to perform during the acute phase of the infarct owing to difficulties in monitoring
      unstable patients and the limited availability of the apparatus. It is for this reason that
      the investigators would like to investigate the rotational angiography (RA), which is
      comparable to a scanner in its mode of action but does not require transfer of patients as
      performed using the same apparatus that used for diagnostic coronarography and therapeutic
      angioplasty. RA is a radiological technique that uses the system employed for coronagraph,
      and consists rotating the fixed C-Arm around the patient and acquisition of a series of
      images that are then reconstituted. The investigators propose to evaluate the size of the
      infarct using RA in comparison with cardiac MRI (standard examination) performed as soon as
      possible after RA and the investigators hope to demonstrated that RA allows the measurement
      of an infarct as precisely as cardiac MRI.
