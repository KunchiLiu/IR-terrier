      To investigate if low level ozone exposure will cause measurable inflammation in nasal
      cells.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Air pollutants including ozone have been implicated in affecting health outcomes. In
      particular, high level ozone exposure has been shown to affect pulmonary function and cause
      pulmonary inflammation. Troubling community-based work has implicated high ozone levels as
      being correlated with increased pediatric asthma ED visits. Because of adverse health
      effects, EPA standards for safe ozone levels have been set, currently at 0.07 ppm. Still, it
      is estimated that 100 million Americans live in areas where ozone levels periodically remain
      above the EPA standard. And while this EPA standard had been set based on available data, it
      remained unclear at the time whether naturalistic low-level ozone exposure, such as
      fluctuations between 0.06-0.08 ppm throughout the day, might affect health as well.

      This group previously examined lung function and inflammatory response in adults exposed to
      low-level ozone, 0.06 ppm exposure for 6.6 hours, while undergoing intermittent moderate
      exercise. The investigators found that in response to low-level ozone exposure (0.06 ppm)
      with exercise, lung function declines and neutrophilic airway inflammation is observed. What
      remains unclear, is whether low-level ozone alone - without exercise - will cause similar
      health effects.

      To mimic exposure to ozone on a typical summer day in a polluted city, the investigators
      will expose subjects to a varying level of ozone, form 0.06 ppm to 0.08 ppm, rather than a
      constant 0.07ppm. The variation from 0.06ppm to 0.08ppm, then back to 0.06ppm will occur
      each hour.

    <description>Heart rate variability will be obtained by Fourier transformation analysis of continuous ECG readings. HRV is generally thought of as an ECG reflection of sympathetic and parasympathetic tone and ability of the heart to respond to physiologic stress. The change in HRV will be calculated to determine the effect of ozone on sympathetic and parasympathetic tone.</description>

    <description>Left ventricular mechanics will be assessed by measuring global longitudinal strain using speckle tracking echocardiography. The change in global longitudinal strain will be calculated to determine the effect of ozone on left ventricular contractility.</description>
