        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject is ≥18 years of age.

          2. Subject must be HCV treatment naive. Subject is willing and able to understand and
             provide written informed consent prior to participation in this study.

          3. Documented HCV infection (PCR positive), HCV RNA levels &gt; 10x4 IU/ml.

          4. Documented HCV genotype 1 and 4.

          5. Documented HIV and HBV negative

          6. A female is eligible to enter and participate in the study if she is of:

             non-childbearing potential (i.e., physiologically incapable of becoming pregnant,
             including any female who is post-menopausal); or,

          7. Child-bearing potential, has a negative pregnancy test (serum β-HCG) at screen and
             agrees to an acceptable barrier and/or hormonal method of contraception (any
             contraception method must be used consistently and correctly, i.e., in accordance
             with both the approved product label and the instructions of a physician):
             Sterilization (female subject or male partner of female subject). Male and female
             subjects must agree to 7 months post-treatment contraception if taking ribavirin.

          8. Stable attender in the site of enrolment.(receiving OAT at least 3 months before
             enrolment and were at least 80 % adherent to OAT appointments)

          9. Venous access available for blood monitoring.

         10. Fibroscan indicating disease activity per HSE Hepatitis C Advisory Group guidelines.

         11. Safety bloods done prior to study including a HGB &gt; 9.5g/dL, platelets &gt; 75,000, AST
             &lt; 10x ULN, albumin levels &gt; 30g/L.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Child Pugh B or below

          2. HCV non-G1/G4

          3. History of decompensated liver disease

          4. Laboratory exclusions include platelet count &lt;75,000, albumin &lt;30gm/L, Alanine
             aminotransferase (ALT) &gt;10 times the upper limit of normal (ULN).

          5. Subject is enrolled in one or more investigational drug protocols, which may impact
             on assessment of HCV treatment with Zepatier (+/_ ribavirin).

          6. Subject is, in the opinion of the investigator, unable to complete the study dosing
             period and protocol evaluations and assessments.

          7. Patients with alcohol and drug use problems that in the view of investigator will
             compromise adherence to compliance with the study will be excluded.

          8. Subject is either pregnant or breastfeeding.

          9. Subject suffers from any serious medical condition (such as pancreatitis, diabetes,
             congestive heart failure, cardiomyopathy or other cardiac dysfunction), which in the
             opinion of the Investigator, would compromise the safety of the subject.

         10. Subject has a pre-existing mental, physical, or substance abuse disorder that, in the
             opinion of the Investigator, may interfere with the subject's ability to comply with
             the dosing schedule and protocol evaluations and assessments.

         11. Subject has a history of inflammatory bowel disease or intestinal malignancy,
             intestinal ischemia, malabsorption, or other gastrointestinal dysfunction, which, in
             the opinion of the Investigator, may interfere with drug absorption or render the
             subject unable to take oral medication.

         12. Subject has any acute laboratory abnormality at screening, which, in the opinion of
             the Investigator, would preclude the subject's participation in the study of an
             investigational compound. If subjects are found to have an acute Grade 4 laboratory
             abnormality at screening, this test may be repeated once within the 45-day screening
             window. Any verified Grade 4 laboratory abnormality would exclude a subject from
             study participation.

         13. Subject has received treatment with radiation therapy or cytotoxic chemotherapeutic
             agents within 28 days prior to Screening, or has an anticipated need for these agents
             within the study period.

         14. Subjects who require treatment with any contraindicated medications (as outlined in
             the SPC) within 14 days of commencement of investigational product, or an anticipated
             need during the study.

         15. Subject has a history of allergy to any of the treatment products or any excipients
             therein.
