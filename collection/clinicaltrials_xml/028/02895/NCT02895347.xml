      The goal of our project is to define the optimal learning environment and protocol for dvSS®
      simulation activities using medical students as robotic-naïve research participants. We
      propose to accomplish this goal through the following aims:

      Specific Aim #1: to investigate the total training time and the total number of repetitions
      required for participants to achieve proficiency (as defined on the dvSS® as 91%) for each
      of the selected exercises in selected dVSS activities.

      Specific Aim #2: to measure the transferability of skills acquired through a robotic
      simulation to live porcine models compared to nonintervention controls. Our study will
      compare the effect of training with the dVSS to similar nonintervention controls by grading
      a suturing procedure on a live porcine model.

      Findings generated from this study will provide new insight into the efficacy of the dVSS as
      a simulation- based training tool for medical practitioners. Collectively, this work will
      build upon the narrow knowledge base on how to develop a nationally accredited
      simulation-based robotics curriculum.

      Our study undoubtedly furthers the GWU SMHS mission of education, research, and healing. The
      study seeks to understand the learning curve students can achieve by simulation-based
      training and then to directly apply that training to a safe in vivo model in order to
      determine training interventions that can inform a robotic curriculum both locally at GWU
      and throughout the country. Additionally, our study is innovative in that it is the first of
      its kind to correlate skills acquired on a robotic-simulation gynecology based tool to a
      live porcine model. Our study seeks to enhance the current GWU GYN robotics- curriculum and
      assist with the development of a specific curriculum within the next year. Although our
      immediate goal is for planning toward a gynecology robotic curriculum, results of this study
      could also inform development of robotic programs in other disciplines such as general
      surgery and urology. Considering, the limited development of simulation-based robotics
      curriculum, further refining the curriculum would allow GWU to continue &quot;to be globally
      recognized as a medical center that embraces the challenge of…transforming health care, and
      expanding research to enrich and improve the lives of those we serve.&quot; It also serves to
      &quot;leverage the SMHS brand to enhance opportunities for recognition, distinction..&amp;
      marketing.&quot; Preparing a generation of well-trained and confident gynecologic surgeons will
      allow us to provide safe care to women.
