      This study to find out more about how patients take their anticancer medications and
      challenges related to taking cancer medications.

      120 patients with Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) who are currently prescribed an oral
      anti-cancer agent from up to 6 CCDR NCORP sites to complete a brief interviewer administered
      survey to assess medication adherence and related factors.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Demographic and Health Behaviors Questionnaire</measure>

    <description>Questions will be asked about the participants demographic background and health behaviors.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Brief Medication Questionnaire (BMQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Study 1 day Visit</time_frame>
    <description>A self-report tool for screening adherence and barriers to adherence. The tool includes a 5-item Regimen Screen that asks patients how they took each medication in the past week, a 2-item Belief Screen that asks about drug effects and bothersome features, and a 2-item Recall Screen about potential difficulties remembering.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Single Item Adherence Measure 1</measure>
    <time_frame>Study 1 day Visit</time_frame>
    <description>This is a single question. This measure was developed to serve as simple means of identifying sub-optimal adherence which could help identify at-risk patients for interventions.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Single Item Adherence Measure 2</measure>
    <time_frame>Study 1 day Visit</time_frame>
    <description>This single item was developed to evaluate self-report adherence to medication and has demonstrated low patient burden and the ability to predict adherence-related clinical outcomes as good or better than other adherence measures.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>REALM-SF</measure>
    <time_frame>Study 1 day Visit</time_frame>
    <description>The REALM-SF offers researchers a simplified, validated, and efficient instrument for assessing patient literacy in clinical setting. It can be used to investigate the relationship between literacy and specific health outcomes such as medication adherence and health care utilization.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Medications Adherence Reasons Scale (MARS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Study 1 day Visit</time_frame>
    <description>This questionnaire is designed to identify potential risk factors associated with medication-related non-adherence.</description>

        Conducting brief structured interviews, to further understand potential patient
        characteristics and barriers associated with non-adherence of medication. With this
        knowledge of identified patient barriers, interventional strategies can be designed to
        improve CML care, monitoring and adherence.
