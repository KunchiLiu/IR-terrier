      This clinical trial studies nivolumab and ipilimumab in treating patients with rare tumors.
      Monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab and ipilimumab, may interfere with the ability of
      tumor cells to grow and spread.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 overall
      response rate (ORR) in subsets of patients with advanced rare cancers treated with
      ipilimumab plus nivolumab combination immunotherapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate toxicities in each cohort. II. To estimate overall survival (OS),
      progression-free survival (PFS), clinical benefit rate; and to estimate immune-related ORR
      (irORR), and immune-related PFS (irPFS) by unidimensional immune-related response criteria.

      III. To collect specimens for banking for use in future correlative biomarker research
      studies.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1, 15, and 29 and
      ipilimumab IV over 60 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 42 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 10 years from
      registration.
