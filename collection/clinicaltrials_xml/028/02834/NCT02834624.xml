  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Premature infants frequently have trouble breathing after birth. If the respiratory disorder
      is caused by surfactant deficiency or dysfunction, the disease is treated with a medication
      called surfactant that is given to the infant through a tube inserted into the windpipe.
      This study will compare the safety of two of the commonly used surfactants, poractant and
      calfactant,in the United States. Poractant has added chemicals called phospholipids which
      are known to cause inflammation and irritation in the body of premature infants. The
      investigators will compare this to another similar surfactant that does not contain these
      chemicals by looking at samples from the windpipe, while the tube is in place, and from
      blood tests in the first few days of life.

      The investigators are hoping to learn whether calfactant is a safer therapeutic agent to
      treat respiratory distress syndrome in preterm infants compared to poractant.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      30 infants were randomized to receive either poractant or calfactant for Respiratory
      Distress Syndrome.

      Tracheal aspirates were obtained to look for increase in macrophage and blood samples were
      drawn to look for markers of inflammation.
