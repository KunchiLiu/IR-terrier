  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Young Black men who have sex with men (MSM) and transwomen in the US are affected by HIV at
      severely disproportionate rates. A key component of HIV prevention for communities at risk
      is diagnosing HIV infections through regular HIV testing. A significant proportion of young
      Black MSM and transwomen have not tested in the prior year. This research study seeks to
      address low HIV testing rates among young Black MSM and transwomen by testing a brief
      Internet-based HIV testing intervention optimized for mobile devices. The intervention takes
      advantage of the variety of HIV testing options now available, including the HIV self
      testing, couples-based HIV counseling and testing and traditional clinic-based testing and
      will provide men and transwomen with a tailored recommendation of their optimal HIV testing
      approach. The investigators are conducting a pilot randomized study among young Black MSM
      and transwomen followed for 6 months to estimate the intervention's potential efficacy in
      increasing HIV testing.
