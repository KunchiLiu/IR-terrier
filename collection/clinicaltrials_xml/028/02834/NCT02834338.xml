      Randomized Controlled Trial to monitor and increase the postoperative mobilization of the
      patients undergoing major visceral surgery by giving a continuous autofeedback of the step
      count using activity tracking wristbands.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing elective open and laparoscopic surgery of colon, rectum, stomach,
      pancreas and liver for any indication will be included. Further inclusion criteria are: age
      between 18-75 years, ASA score &lt; 4, and a signed informed consent. Patients are stratified
      into two subgroups (laparoscopic and open surgery) and will be randomized 1:1 for an
      autofeedback of their step-count using an activity tracker wristband or for the control
      group without autofeedback. Sample size (n = 29 patients in each of the four groups, overall
      n = 119) is calculated on an assumed difference in step-count of 250 steps daily
      (intervention versus control group). The primary study endpoint is the step-count during the
      first five postoperative days; secondary endpoints are the percentage of patients in the two
      groups, who master the predefined mobilization (step-count) targets, the assessment of
      additional activity data from the devices, the assessment of the preoperative mobility,
      length of hospital and intensive care unit stay, number of patients who receive
      physiotherapy, 30-day mortality, and the overall 30-day morbidity.

    <description>The intervention group receives an unblinded wristband. The handling of the activity trackers is explained to the patients and a predefined mobilization end-point (step-count) for the first five PODs is targeted. The target step-count was set at the 85% quartile obtained from a previous pilot study. The patients are assessed and monitored two times daily between 9 and 11 o'clock AM and between 3 and 5 o'clock PM by a surgical fellow or a study nurse throughout their hospital stay for read-out of the step count, assurance of the proper use and functioning, and for communication of the autofeedback.</description>
