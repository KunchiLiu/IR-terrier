      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended
      Phase 2 dose, safety and efficacy of TAK-659 in combination with nivolumab in participants
      with advanced solid tumors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested is TAK-659.This study will look at the determination of the MTD/RP2D
      and efficacy measured by ORR in participants who take TAK-659 in combination with nivolumab.
      The study will include a dose escalation phase (Part 1) and a dose expansion phase (Part 2).

      The study will enroll approximately 120 participants, approximately 9-12 in the dose
      escalation phase and approximately 36 in each of the 3 dose expansion cohorts. Participants
      will be assigned to 1 of the 4 treatment groups:

        -  Part 1: Advanced Solid Tumors

        -  Part 2: Metastatic TNBC

        -  Part 2: Metastatic NSCLC

        -  Part 2: Metastatic HNSCC

      All participants will be asked to take the tablets of TAK-659 at the same time each day
      throughout the study. Participants will also receive intravenous infusion of nivolumab
      (within 30 minutes after the TAK-650 dose) once every 2 weeks. This multi-center trial will
      be conducted globally. The overall time to receive treatment in this study is approximately
      12 months. Participants will be assessed for disease response and PD during the PFS
      follow-up of 6 months (for participants who discontinue due to reasons other than PD) and OS
      follow-up of 12 months from the last dose of study drug.

         14. Treatment with high-dose corticosteroids for anticancer purposes within 14 days
             before the first dose of TAK-659; daily dose equivalent to 10 mg oral prednisone or

         17. Active secondary malignancy that requires treatment. Participants with nonmelanoma
             skin cancer or carcinoma in situ of any type are not excluded if they have undergone
             complete resection and are considered disease-free at the time of study entry.

         18. Any clinically significant co-morbidities, such as uncontrolled pulmonary disease,
             known impaired cardiac function or clinically significant cardiac disease (specified
             below), active central nervous system disease, active infection, or any other
             condition that could compromise the participant's participation in the study.
