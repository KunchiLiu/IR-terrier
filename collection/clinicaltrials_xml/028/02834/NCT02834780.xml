    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and
      recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of H3B-6527 (Part 1), and to assess the safety and
      tolerability of H3B-6527 as a single agent administered orally (Part 2) in participants with
      advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

    <description>H3B-6527, a Fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 (FGFR4) inhibitor, will be supplied as capsules and will be administered orally once daily, continuously in 21-day cycles with sequential escalating dose cohorts in the Dose Escalation part (Part 1). In the Expansion part (Part 2), participants will receive the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) established during Part 1 of the study. In the Extension Phase, participants will continue to receive the same treatment and dose they received during the Treatment Phase, provided termination criteria are not met.</description>
