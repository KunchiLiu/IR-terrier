      This is a pilot study that will determine the endoscopic recurrence of Crohn's disease 12
      months after curative, resective ileal or ileocolonic surgery in patients receiving
      post-operative vedolizumab (Entyvio) or placebo. The investigators hypothesize that the
      administration of post-operative vedolizumab will decrease the endoscopic recurrence of
      Crohn's disease.

    <description>During a follow up colonoscopy, the Rutgeerts' score will be used to assess for endoscopic remission. An endoscopy score of i0 or i1 will be considered endoscopic remission and a score of i2 or higher denotes endoscopic recurrence. The endoscopic scoring system is as follows: Grade 0 normal distal ileum, Grade 1 up to 5 small aphthous ulcers, Grade 2 six or more aphthous ulcers with skip areas either at the ilocolonic anastomosis or proximal to it, Grade 3 diffuse aphthous ileitis with diffusely inflamed mucosa and Grade 4 diffuse inflammation with larger ulcers, nodules, and/or narrowing.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Are men or women &gt; 18 years of age at screening.

          2. Curative resection and ileocolonic anastomosis for Crohn's disease. Patients with
             isolated fibrostenotic (non-inflammatory) or minimal (not clinically significant)
             disease elsewhere in gastrointestinal that is not resected will also be included.

          3. Participants who have received pre-operative vedolizumab therapy may be included.

          4. Concomitant medications: All concomitant medications at the time of the surgery will
             be discontinued post-operatively.

          5. Men and women of childbearing potential must use adequate birth control measures
             (e.g., abstinence, oral contraceptives, intrauterine device, barrier method with
             spermicide, implantable or injectable contraceptives or surgical sterilization) for
             the duration of the study and should continue such precautions for 6 months after
             receiving the last infusion).

          6. Antibiotics for the treatment of Crohn's disease (eg. ciprofloxacin and
             metronidazole) are allowable but must be discontinued within 12 weeks after surgery.
             Antibiotics for the treatment of a concomitant infection are allowable throughout the
             duration of the study as long as the primary purpose of antibiotic therapy is not for
             the primary treatment of Crohn's disease.

          7. Screening laboratory tests must meet the screening criteria (Hemoglobin ≥ 8.5 g/dL,
             White blood cell (WBC) count ≥ 3.0 x 109/L, Neutrophils ≥ 1.0 x 109/L, Platelets ≥
             100 x 109/L, Lymphocyte count ≥ 0.5 x 109/L and SGOT (AST-aspartate aminotransferase)
             -&lt; 3 times upper normal limit).

          8. Are capable of providing written informed consent, and the consent must be obtained
             prior to conducting any protocol-specified procedures.

          9. Are willing to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol requirements.

         10. Participants who require a temporary diverting ileostomy and then takedown will be
             included. These would be participants who undergo resective surgery and primary
             ileocolonic anastomosis but require a temporary diverting ostomy proximal to the
             anastomotic site. Participants will be eligible for the study upon takedown of the
             diverting ileostomy

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Participants with greater than 10 years of Crohn's disease requiring their FIRST
             resection of a short (&lt;10cm) fibrostenotic stricture. The rationale for excluding
             these participants is that historically this group of participants is at a very low
             risk of recurrence and therefore, would not be a group targeted for postoperative
             medical therapy.

          2. Macroscopically active disease at the anastomosis at the time of surgery.

          3. Presence of a stoma.

          4. Prior severe infusion reaction to vedolizumab, i.e. anaphylaxis, bronchospasm, or
             hypotension.

          5. History of anaphylaxis to other chimeric proteins.

          6. Any of the following medications taken within 12 weeks of surgery: cyclosporine,
             tacrolimus, sirolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, or other investigational drugs.
             Patients who have taken these medications more than 12 weeks prior to surgery will be
             allowed in the study

          7. At the time of screening participants with a positive stool culture for enteric
             pathogens, pathogenic ova or parasites, or Clostridium difficile toxin and have
             clinically significant signs of an enteric infection, i.e. diarrhea, fever, abdominal
             pain. participants will be eligible for enrollment if stool cultures are positive but
             do not have clinically significant signs or symptoms or infection and receive
             appropriate antibiotic treatment. A repeat stool culture will be obtained at the
             completion of antibiotic treatment.

          8. Women who are pregnant, nursing, or planning pregnancy during the trial or within 6
             months after the last infusion (this includes father's who plan on fathering a child
             within 6 months after their last infusion).

          9. Have or have had an opportunistic infection (eg, herpes zoster [shingles],
             cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis carinii, aspergillosis, histoplasmosis, or mycobacteria
             other than TB) within 6 months of screening.

         10. Have a chest radiograph within 3 months prior to screening that shows evidence of
             malignancy, infection, or any abnormalities.

         11. Documentation of seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

         12. Documentation of a positive test for hepatitis B surface antigen or a history of
             documented hepatitis C.

         13. Have current signs or symptoms of systemic lupus erythematosus, or severe,
             progressive, or uncontrolled renal, hepatic, hematologic, gastrointestinal,
             endocrine, pulmonary, cardiac, neurologic, or cerebral diseases.

         14. Presence of a transplanted solid organ (with the exception of a corneal transplant &gt;
             3 months prior to randomization).

         15. Have any current known malignancy other than the condition being treated or have a
             history of malignancy within 5 years prior to screening (except for squamous or basal
             cell carcinoma of the skin that has been fully excised with no evidence of
             recurrence).

         16. Have a history of lymphoproliferative disease including lymphoma, or signs or
             symptoms suggestive of possible lymphoproliferative disease such as lymphadenopathy
             of unusual size or location (eg, nodes in the posterior triangle of the neck,
             intraclavicular, epitrochlear, or periaortic area), or splenomegaly.

         17. Have had a known substance abuse (drug or alcohol) or dependency within the previous
             3 years, history of noncompliance to medical regimens, or other
             condition/circumstance that could interfere with the subject's adherence to protocol
             requirements (eg, psychiatric disease, lack of motivation, travel, etc).

         18. Are unable to or unwilling to undergo multiple venipunctures because of poor
             tolerability or lack of easy access

         19. Have had a chronic or recurrent infectious disease including, but not limited to,
             chronic renal infection, chronic chest infection (eg, bronchiectasis), sinusitis,
             recurrent urinary tract infection (recurrent pyelonephritis or chronic nonremitting
             cystitis), open, draining, or infected skin wound, or ulcer.

         20. Have had a serious infection (eg, hepatitis, pneumonia, or pyelonephritis), have been
             hospitalized for an infection, or have been treated with intravenous (IV) antibiotics
             for an infection within 2 months prior to randomization. The exception being
             participants whose infection is a direct consequence of their Crohn's disease and
             will be completely resolved with surgery, e.g. participants with an abscess related
             to penetrating Crohn's disease of the terminal ileum who have no sign of infection
             after surgery. Less serious infections (eg, acute upper respiratory tract infection,
             enteric infections without signs or symptoms or simple urinary tract infection) need
             not be considered exclusions at the discretion of the investigator.

         21. Have a serious concomitant illness that could interfere with the subject's
             participation in the trial.

         22. Current use of prescription doses or chronic and frequent use of over-the-counter
             doses of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), except low-dose aspirin for
             prevention of heart attacks, unstable angina, or transient ischemic attacks.

         23. Have ulcerative colitis.

         24. Are participating in another investigative trial during participation in this trial.

         25. Use of any investigational drug within 30 days prior to randomization or within 5
             half-lives of the investigational agent, whichever is longer.
