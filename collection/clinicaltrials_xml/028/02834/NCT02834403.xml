  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase Ib study assessing the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting
      toxicities of L-NMMA when combined with docetaxel in refractory locally advanced or
      metastatic triple negative breast cancer patients. The study will be conducted in two
      stages. Stage 1 of the study will determine the MTD of L-NMMA when combined with 75 mg/m2
      docetaxel. Stage 2 of the study will determine the MTD of L-NMMA when combined with 60 mg/m2
      docetaxel. Five dose levels of L-NMMA (5, 7.5, 10, 12.5, and 15 mg/kg) will be investigated
      in stage 1. The starting dose of L-NMMA will be 7.5 mg/kg. As patients are accrued, a
      standard Bayesian model averaging continual reassessment method (CRM) approach will be used
      to determine the appropriate L-NMMA dosage. In stage 2, the starting dose will be one dose
      level above the MTD determined in stage 1. Again the CRM will be used to determine the
      appropriate L-NMMA dosage.

      This is a Phase Ib study assessing the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting
      toxicities (DLT) of L-NMMA when combined with docetaxel in refractory locally advanced or
      metastatic triple negative breast cancer patients. The study will be conducted in two
      stages. Stage 1 of the study will determine the MTD of L-NMMA when combined with 75 mg/m2
      docetaxel. Stage 2 of the study will determine the MTD of L-NMMA when combined with 60 mg/m2
      docetaxel. Five dose levels of L-NMMA (5, 7.5, 10, 12.5, and 15 mg/kg) will be investigated
      in stage 1. The starting dose of L-NMMA will be 7.5 mg/kg. As patients are accrued, a
      standard Bayesian model averaging continual reassessment method (CRM) approach will be used
      to determine the appropriate L-NMMA dosage. In stage 2, the starting dose will be one dose
      level above the MTD determined in stage 1. Again the CRM will be used to determine the
      appropriate L-NMMA dosage. Patients will receive up to 6 (21-day) cycles of the L-NMMA and
      docetaxel combination. L-NMMA will be administered via 2-hour intravenous infusion on Days
      1-5 of each cycle. Docetaxel will be administered via 1-hour intravenous infusion
      approximately 15 minutes after the Day 1 L-NMMA infusion. For L-NMMA-induced hypertension,
      amlodipine (10 mg) will be orally administered for 6 days at each cycle. Amlodipine
      administration will start 24 hours before the first dose of L-NMMA. For docetaxel-induced
      leukopenia, pegfilgrastim (6 mg) will be administered via subcutaneous injection
      approximately 24 hours after every dose of docetaxel. In addition to MTD and DLT assessment,
      this study will also determine the recommended phase 2 dose, antitumor activity, and
      pharmacokinetics of the L-NMMA as well as explore tissue and blood-based markers of
      treatment response and toxicity.

    <description>Stage 1: L-NMMA at a starting dose of 7.5 mg/kg will be administered intravenously on Days 1-5. Depending on DLT occurrence, L-NMMA dose will de-escalate (5 mg/kg) or escalate (10, 12.5, or 15 mg/kg) in 2.5-mg/kg increments. Docetaxel at a dose of 75 mg/m2 will be administered intravenously 15 min after the Day 1 L-NMMA infusion. Amlodipine (10 mg) will be orally administered daily for 6 days starting 24 hours before the first L-NMMA dose. Pegfilgrastim (6 mg) will be administered subcutaneously 24 h after docetaxel. The maximum number of cycles will be 6 (21 days).
Stage 2: The starting dose of L-NMMA will be one dose level above the stage 1 MTD. Depending on the occurrence of DLTs, L-NMMA dose will de-escalate or escalate as described for stage 1. Docetaxel dose will be fixed at 60 mg/m2.</description>

    <ipd_description>Data and materials on human subjects will be shared with other eligible investigators through appropriate means in accordance with the NIH policy on Sharing Research Data (NIH Guide, February 26, 2003). Data will be also shared with the funding agency and regulatory agencies as required. Data will be shared with other investigators within the limits of HIPAA and other patient confidentiality requirements. This will generally require removal of all patient identifiers for all source documents and the use of arbitrarily assigned one-way identifiers. In some cases, requestors will be asked to sign a formal data sharing agreement that will provide for a commitment to use data only for research purposes and not to identify individuals, keep the data secure, and destroy or return data after analyses are complete. Prior approval will be obtained from collaborating investigators, research sponsors, and/or other stake-holders before sharing if proprietary information or products are involved.</ipd_description>
