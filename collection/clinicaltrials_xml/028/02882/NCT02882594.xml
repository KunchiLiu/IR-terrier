  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of the study is to improve the experience for pediatric patients
      undergoing anesthesia inductions. The specific objective for this proposal is to establish
      whether the CIBA tool demonstrates inter-rater reliability and concurrent validity with the
      Induction Compliance Checklist.

      The proposed research study will assess the reliability and validity of a new tool that is
      being used in the Department of Anesthesia (The Child Induction Behavioral Assessment tool)
      to grade the difficulty of patient behaviors exhibited during anesthesia inductions. The
      Child Induction Behavioral Assessment (CIBA) tool is more succinct than previously validated
      tools for assessing behavioral responses to inhalation inductions, making it practical for
      use in a busy clinical practice setting. Having clinicians document a patient's behavioral
      response to induction using the CIBA tool is useful because this information can help to
      optimize subsequent induction plans if the patient returns. Additionally, population data
      may be collected using electronic data reports for QI purposes. Prior to using data from the
      CIBA tool in QI initiatives, it is important to assess whether this tool is reliable and
      valid.
