    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to use a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study
      design to comprehensively investigate the impact of 8-weeks of dietary nitrate
      supplementation on skeletal muscle blood flow, mitochondrial function, and exercise capacity
      in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D).

    <time_frame>Pre and post 8 weeks of dietary nitrate supplementation</time_frame>
    <description>A 12-lead ECG, symptom limited cardiopulmonary exercise testing with gas exchange measurements will be performed on a cycle ergometer using a ramp protocol to determine peak aerobic capacity (VO2peak) and exercise efficiency.</description>

    <measure>Change in skeletal muscle perfusion during exercise</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre and post 8 weeks of dietary nitrate supplementation</time_frame>
    <description>Forearm blood flow will be determined using Doppler ultrasound during rhythmic forearm exercise</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in skeletal muscle mitochondrial function</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre and post 8 weeks of dietary nitrate supplementation</time_frame>
    <description>Muscle biopsies will be obtained from the vastus lateralis using a Bergstrom needle with suction under local anesthesia, which will yield ~200-250mg of tissue. Mitochondrial function will be assessed as follows: Fiber bundles will be chemically permeabilized with saponin and mitochondrial respiration will be analyzed by in situ high-resolution respirometry at 37Â°.</description>
