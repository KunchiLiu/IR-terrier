  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn about the safety of giving mesenchymal
      stem cells (MSCs) to patients who have ARDS. Researchers also want to learn if these cells
      can help control ARDS when given with drugs that are routinely used to treat ARDS.

      In this study, all participants will receive standard of care treatment for ARDs, and some
      participants will receive standard of care treatment and MSCs.

      The MSCs:

      MSCs are a type of stem cell that can be removed from bone marrow and grown into many
      different cell types that can be used to treat cancer and other diseases. The MSCs used in
      this study were collected from healthy donors and are stored and grown in a laboratory at MD
      Anderson. The product participant will receive is from a healthy donor that is not related
      to participant.

      Study Groups:

      If participant is found to be eligible to take part in this study, participant will be
      randomly assigned (as in the flip of a coin) to 1 of 2 study groups and participant will
      have an equal chance of being in either group. This is done because no one knows if one
      study group is better, the same, or worse than the other group.

        -  If participant is in Group 1, participant will receive MSCs and standard of care drugs
           for ARDS.

        -  If participant is in Group 2, participant will receive standard of care drugs for ARDS.

      MSC Administration:

      If participant is in Group 1, participant will receive MSCs by vein over about 1-2 hours 1
      time on Day 1.

      Both groups will also receive standard of care drugs and treatment for ARDS. The study
      doctor will tell participant which drugs participant is taking, their risks, and when
      participant should take them.

      Study Visits:

      On Days 1 and 3:

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, to check participant's
           heart, kidney, and liver function, and for biomarker testing.

        -  Blood (about ½ teaspoon) will be drawn to check the oxygen level in participant's
           blood.

      On Days 14 and 28:

      °Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, to check participant's heart,
      kidney, and liver function, and for biomarker testing.

      On Days 30 and 60:

      °Participant will be checked for possible reactions to participant's treatment, including
      graft-versus-host disease (GVHD - a reaction of the donor's immune cells against
      participant's body). This will be checked by physical exam, by the doctor reviewing
      participant's side effects, and blood from standard of care blood draws.

      At Months 6 and 12:

        -  Participant will have a physical exam.

        -  Participant will be checked for possible reactions to participant's treatment,
           including graft-versus-host disease (GVHD - a reaction of the donor's immune cells
           against participant's body). This will be checked by physical exam, by the doctor
           reviewing participant's side effects, and blood from standard of care blood draws.

        -  Participant will have lung function tests.

      Length of Study:

      Participation on this study will end after the Month 12 study visit. Participant will be
      taken off study early if participant is not able to receive the MSC infusion(s), if
      intolerable side effects occur, if the doctor thinks it is in participant's best interest,
      or if participant is unable to follow study directions.

      This is an investigational study. MSC infusions for the treatment of ARDS is
      investigational.

      Up to 50 participants will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.
