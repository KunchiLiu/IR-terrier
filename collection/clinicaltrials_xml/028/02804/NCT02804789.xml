      Brain changes associated with Alzheimer's disease may precede symptoms of Alzheimer's
      Dementia by over 20 years. The Investigators hope to be able to identify Alzheimer's disease
      at its very earliest stages when in theory treatments are most likely to be successful in
      preventing further spread of the disease in the brain and causing dementia. The aim of EPAD
      programme is to develop new treatments more quickly to prevent Alzheimer's dementia. A major
      component of the EPAD programme is the EPAD Longitudinal Cohort Study which can provide
      subjects for the EPAD trial as well as data to improve understanding of disease before
      dementia develops.

      The Investigators will approach a broad range of people over the age of 50 who have
      previously taken part in various research studies and consented to being recontacted for
      further research. Participants will be asked questions to assess their memory and other
      cognitive function. The participants will also undertake a brain scan, provide a sample of
      spinal fluid, blood, urine and saliva to look at markers in these bodily fluids that may
      change in Alzheimer's disease. The Investigators will then follow these participants until
      December 2019 repeating these tests annually. This will be called the EPAD Longitudinal
      Cohort Study (EPAD LCS). The main reasons for EPAD developing a cohort are to help the
      Investigators understand more about what happens to people before dementia develops, and to
      help recruit people more quickly into the EPAD trials of new medications or other
      interventions expected to prevent dementia.

      People in the EPAD LCS may be invited to take part in the EPAD Proof of Concept prevention
      studies to see if interventions can modify the probability of developing dementia or
      cognitive problems (this will be subject to separate ethics approval and consent). Together
      EPAD LCS and EPAD PoC make up the full EPAD Programme.

      The EPAD project has been established to overcome the major hurdles hampering drug
      development for secondary prevention of AD dementia, by conducting the EPAD LCS (fed from
      existing Parent Cohorts (PC) across Europe) in alignment with the adaptive design EPAD PoC
      trial. Both EPAD LCS and EPAD PoC trial will be run in an exclusive network of highly
      selected, expert Trial Delivery Centres (TDC) that will be selected on the basis of strictly
      applied criteria to ensure the highest possible data quality, successful recruitment and
      adherence to the EPAD principles.

      While interventions must start early in the course of AD, accurate disease models covering
      the entire course of AD before dementia onset are lacking. Estimating with reasonable
      confidence an individual's overall probability of developing AD dementia over a defined time
      period must take into account multiple dimensions simultaneously (e.g. cognition,
      biomarkers, traditional risk factors - genetic and environmental). This will allow any given
      individual to be placed somewhere on a probability spectrum from negligible probability to
      high probability. Because individuals with similar overall probability may have very
      different contributions from various components in each dimension, flexible algorithms are
      needed instead of simple cut-offs to identify a probability-spectrum population adequate for
      both disease modelling and for providing a sufficient number of potential trial participants
      (especially in adaptive trials with multiple arms testing drugs with different mechanisms of
      action).

      EPAD LCS is designed to address the dual need for development of accurate longitudinal
      models for AD covering the entire disease course, and development of adequate infrastructure
      for facilitating identification of research participants and clinical trial recruitment.
      EPAD LCS will have a probability-spectrum population selected from already existing PCs
      across Europe to facilitate fast recruitment. Different types of PCs will be considered
      (e.g. memory clinic-based, population-based). Due to the variety of PCs, some EPAD LCS
      research participants will be e.g. memory clinic patients without dementia, while others
      will be e.g. participants without dementia from the general population. The variety of PC
      settings will ensure that the EPAD LCS probability-spectrum population can cover the entire
      continuum of probability for AD dementia development. Regular EPAD LCS follow-up with
      clinical, cognitive and biomarker assessments will provide a well-phenotyped
      probability-spectrum population, generating high-quality data for updating disease models,
      for easier identification of individuals suitable for trial inclusion, and for use as trial
      run-in data and reference for evaluating intervention efficacy.

      The flow of research participants from the population at large to the trial is divided into
      the following stages: firstly, EPAD will engage existing PCs from across Europe who may have
      eligible research participants for the EPAD LCS. The next step is drawing research
      participants from the PCs into the EPAD LCS to maintain a suitable population of
      approximately 6,000 research participants. Finally, research participants in the EPAD LCS
      who fulfil trial inclusion criteria (approximately 1,500 research participants), will be
      invited to enter the EPAD PoC (PoC) trial for evaluation of treatment for secondary
      prevention of AD dementia. This trial is a standing, adaptive, PoC trial that could involve
      multiple arms running concurrently. Successful graduation through PoC into phase 3
      confirmatory trials of single or combinatorial interventions will be based on success
      against an intermediary, target specific biomarker and then success against a cognitive
      measure.

      Once recruitment is completed, at any given time there should be approx. 6,000 research
      participants in the EPAD LCS and approx. 1,500 in the EPAD PoC, hence the need to replenish
      each from PCs as participants are lost through attrition. EPAD LCS will initially run until
      the end of December 2019, and extension of consent will be sought after 4 years.

        Research participants will be recruited from existing Parent Cohorts across Europe. In the
        UK these will be observational research cohorts.

        PCs considered for EPAD are: active cohorts including research participants without
        dementia aged at least 50 years; the PC PI is willing to provide research participants for
        EPAD LCS and EPAD PoC trial; and there is existing consent from research participants for
        re-contact by PC team or possibility to obtain consent to re-contact by PC team.

        Potential EPAD Longitudinal Cohort Study research participants will be identified for each
        Parent Cohort team based on data in their own Parent Cohort, using a flexible search
        algorithm adapted to the types of data available in each Parent Cohort.

          6. Cancer or history of cancer in the last 5 years (excluding cutaneous basal or
             squamous cell cancer resolved by excision).

          7. Any conditions affecting safe engagement in potential clinical trials, e.g.
             symptomatic cardiovascular disease (including re-vascularisation procedures within
             the previous year), severe renal or hepatic failure, any clinically relevant
             abnormalities in blood parameters included in local TDC routine assessments, severe
             loss of vision, hearing or communicative ability, conditions preventing co-operation
             as judged by the study physician.

          8. Contraindications for MRI/Positron emission tomography (PET) Scan.

          9. Contraindications for Lumbar Puncture.

         10. Evidence of intracranial pathology which may affect cognition including but not
             limited to brain tumours (benign or malignant), aneurysm or arteriovenous
             malformations, territorial stroke (excluding smaller watershed strokes), recent
             haemorrhage (parenchymal or subdural), or obstructive hydrocephalus. Research
             participants with a MRI scan demonstrating markers of small vessel disease (e.g.
             white matter changes or lacunar infarcts) judged to be clinically insignificant, or
             microbleeds are allowed.

         11. Participation in a clinical trial within the last 30 days.

         12. Diminished decision-making capacity/ not capable of consenting (If at a subsequent
             annual EPAD LCS visit health professionals suspect diminished consent capacity
             according to local TDC routine procedures, a formal assessment of the research
             participant's capacity to consent will be conducted. The participant will be offered
             the opportunity to continue in the EPAD LCS under suitable local regulations
             regarding capacitous participants who have consented to enter a longitudinal study
             who subsequently loose capacity. Capacity will be assessed at each study visit using
             the correct legal framework).
