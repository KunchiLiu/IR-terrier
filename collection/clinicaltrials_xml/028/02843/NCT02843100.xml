    <textblock>
      The modified-Exclusive Enteral Nutrition (mEEN) is an open label randomized controlled pilot
      trial in mild to severe Crohn's Disease patients. The purpose of this study is to determine
      whether induction of remission and maintenance of remission can be achieved with a new
      dietary strategy that involves only 2 weeks of Exclusive Enteral Nutrition (EEN) with
      Modulen and 12 weeks of an exclusion diet involving selected table foods. This novel
      approach will be compared to the gold standard dietary regime involving 8 weeks of EEN.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rational: Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) is an established but difficult to perform
      method for induction of remission and cannot be used for maintenance of remission. It
      entails drinking only liquid formula for 8 weeks. Refusal to use or to adhere to this
      therapy is not uncommon and leads to use of other non- dietary strategies in children
      including steroids and immunosuppression. The Crohn's Disease Exclusion Diet (CDED) with
      partial enteral nutrition has been shown to be effective for children with mild to moderate
      disease. The investigators have developed a maintenance strategy using the CDED.

      Objectives: To prove that induction of remission and maintenance of remission can be
      achieved with a new dietary strategy that involves only 2 weeks of EEN with Modulen and 12
      weeks of an exclusion diet involving selected table foods.

      Methods: Open label randomized controlled pilot trial comparing two weeks of EEN followed by
      the CDED and Partial Enteral Nutrition (PEN), to 8 weeks of EEN followed by PEN with free
      diet. The study will include a control group of healthy children for microbiome studies.

      Population: Age 8-18 years with mild to severe active Crohn's disease defined as
      15&lt;Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI)&lt;47.5.

      Time frame: The induction of remission phase will last 8 weeks followed by maintenance phase
      for a period of 24 weeks.

      Expected outcomes and significance: If this method proves to be equivalent to EEN, the
      duration of use of EEN will be only two weeks, allowing more patients access to dietary
      therapy. More importantly, this study will also evaluate two maintenance strategies and will
      be the first to evaluate re-biosis.
