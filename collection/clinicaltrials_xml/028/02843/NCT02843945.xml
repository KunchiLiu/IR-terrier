      Initial study to evaluate local control and the preferred method of attachment of the
      CivaSheet in the setting of suspected close or positive margins at the time of surgical
      tumor removal.

      This is a Feasibility study to determine the safety and efficacy of a new brachytherapy
      device that provides unidirectional radiation which utilizes active components
      (Palladium-103) of standard devices in a novel configuration.This pilot study may benefit
      pancreatic cancer patients by reducing the radiation dose to adjacent critical structures,
      while giving a therapeutic dose to diseased tissue, such as at a surgical margin. The
      appropriate dose and local control rate will be recorded the primary endpoint in order to
      provide an efficacy assessment.

    <description>Patients undergoing a whipple procedure for pancreatic cancer will receive an implant at the time of surgery of the new CivaSheet directional brachytherapy device. The directonal nature of the FDA cleared CivaSheet is expected to allow physicians to increase the radiation dose given to the surgical margin safely, reducing risk of recurrence without increasing radiation side effects.</description>

    <description>The FDA Cleared CivaSheet Directional Pd103 Brachytherapy Source is a planar radiaiton source which utilizes gold shielding in its construction. This device is radioactive on one side only, and is capable of safely delivering high doses of radiation to target areas even when placed directly adjacent to sensitive, healthy tissue or critical structures.</description>
