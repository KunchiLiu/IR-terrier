  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to assess the safety and tolerability of atezolizumab when given in
      combination with radium-223 dichloride in participants with metastatic CRPC who have
      progressed after treatment with an androgen pathway inhibitor. An adaptive design is planned
      to first investigate the tolerability with concurrent administration (both treatments to
      begin in Cycle 1). However, if the combination is not tolerated, additional cohorts may be
      enrolled to evaluate the tolerability of radium-223 dichloride (to begin in Cycle 1) with
      delayed atezolizumab (to begin in Cycle 2 and/or 3).

    <description>Participants will receive concurrent radium-223 dichloride and atezolizumab for a single-cycle, 28-day dose limiting toxicity (DLT) assessment. If the combination is initially found to be safe and tolerable, additional participants may be randomized to compare concurrent versus staggered administration of atezolizumab and radium-223 dichloride for the full treatment period (anticipated up to 36 months).</description>

    <description>If the combination tested in Cohort 1 is not tolerated, radium-223 dichloride will begin during Cycle 1 and atezolizumab will be delayed to begin 28 days later in Cycle 2. If tolerability is favorable during the 28-day DLT assessment in Cycle 2, additional participants may receive the same staggered administration of atezolizumab and radium-223 dichloride for the full treatment period (anticipated up to 36 months).</description>
