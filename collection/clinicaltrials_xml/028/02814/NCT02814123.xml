  <brief_title>Effect of Basal-Bolus Closed-Loop Co-Administration of Insulin and Pramlintide on Improving the Glycemic Control in Type 1 Diabetes</brief_title>
  <official_title>A Double-blinded, Randomized, Two-way, Crossover Study to Assess the Efficacy of Insulin-plus-placebo Closed-loop Delivery and Insulin-plus-pramlintide Closed-loop Delivery in Regulating Glucose Levels Over a 24-hour Period in Adults With Type 1 Diabetes in Inpatient Settings.</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The closed-loop delivery system is composed of an insulin pump, a continuous glucose sensor
      and a dosing algorithm that calculates the insulin dose to infuse based on sensor readings.
      Pramlintide is a drug and an analog of amylin, a hormone that is co-secreted with insulin in
      healthy individuals, and is deficient in people with type 1 diabetes. Co-injection of
      pramlintide with insulin at meal times improves glucose control in type 1 diabetes.

      The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of 2 strategies to control your
      day-and-night glucose levels: 1) insulin-plus-placebo closed-loop delivery and 2)
      insulin-plus-pramlintide closed-loop delivery.

      The hypothesis is that a basal-bolus infusion of insulin-plus-pramlintide in the closed-loop
      system will improve blood glucose control compared to insulin-plus-placebo infusion.

      The closed-loop delivery system is composed of an insulin pump, a continuous glucose sensor
      and a dosing algorithm that calculates the insulin dose to infuse based on sensor readings.
      Pramlintide is a drug and an analog of amylin, a hormone that is co-secreted with insulin in
      healthy individuals, and is deficient in people with type 1 diabetes. Co-injection of
      pramlintide with insulin at meal times improves glucose control in type 1 diabetes.

      The aim of the study is to assess the efficacy of the simultaneous, closed-loop, basal-bolus
      infusion of pramlintide and insulin with fixed ratio (i.e., mimicking co-formulation) in
      controlling glucose levels compared to insulin-plus-placebo closed-loop infusion.

      The investigators aim to conduct a double-blinded, randomized, crossover trial to compare
      the efficacy of insulin-plus-placebo closed-loop delivery and insulin-plus-pramlintide
      closed-loop delivery in regulating glucose levels over a period of 24 hours in a study of
      adults in inpatient settings. At a minimum of ten days prior to the closed-loop
      interventions, pramlintide or a placebo will be initiated (basal and bolus) using a second
      pump.

      The hypothesis is that a basal-bolus infusion of insulin-plus-pramlintide in the closed-loop
      system will improve blood glucose control compared to insulin-plus-placebo infusion.

    <description>Subjects will be admitted at the research facility at 7:00. A cannula will be inserted into an arm or a hand vein for blood sampling purposes. Each 24-hour intervention visit includes 3 standardized meals (8:00, 12:00, and 17:00), an evening snack (21:00) and an overnight stay. The glucose level as measured by the real time sensor will be entered manually into the computer every 10 minutes. The insulin and pramlintide or placebo pumps' infusion rates will then be changed manually based on the computer generated recommendation, while still maintaining the ratio. The computer generated recommendations are based on a predictive algorithm.</description>

Subjects will be served a standardized meal (8:00) and at 9:30 will perform a supervised 60-minute exercise. A snack will be served 10 minutes prior to the exercise. The subjects will be asked to perform the exercise at 60% heart rate reserve target. The glucose level as measured by the real time sensor will be entered manually into the computer every 10 minutes.
