  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, parallel group, placebo-controlled study designed to
      investigate the potential effect of a fixed dose of benralizumab administered subcutaneously
      (SC) on antibody responses following seasonal influenza virus vaccination
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to investigate the potential effect of benralizumab on the antibody
      response to the seasonal influenza virus vaccine in patients 12-21 years of age with asthma.
      Benralizumab will be given subcutaneously (SC) at Weeks 0, 4, and 8 weeks, at which time
      benralizumab levels will reach steady state. Patients will then receive 1 dose of
      intramuscular (IM) seasonal influenza virus vaccine at Week 8 and samples drawn at Week 8
      and Week 12 to measure the antibody response to the influenza virus
