      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the effects of treatment with daclizumab
      on the proportion of participants relapse-free at 6 months in Relapsing-Remitting Multiple
      Sclerosis (RRMS) participants, who switched from treatment with natalizumab to daclizumab
      due to safety concerns. The secondary objectives of this study in this study population are
      to evaluate the effects of daclizumab on the following: 1) Multiple Sclerosis (MS) relapse
      activity including the annualized relapse rate (ARR) and the proportion of participants
      experiencing relapses requiring hospitalization and/or steroid treatment; 2) MS-related
      outcomes measured using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); 3) Safety and tolerability in
      participants previously treated with natalizumab.

        Key Inclusion Criteria

          -  Must have documented diagnosis of RRMS (McDonald 2010 Criteria) at screening [Polman
             2011].

          -  Must have been treated with natalizumab for at least the 12 months prior to screening
             and have not missed 2 or more consecutive scheduled doses.

          -  Must be naïve to daclizumab and other forms of daclizumab such as Zenapax® prior to
             enrollment.

          -  Must have a confirmed Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score of 0 to 5.5,
             inclusive, at screening.

             from Day -1 and be willing and able to continue contraception for duration of the
             study.

        Key Exclusion Criteria

          -  Current participation in another investigational study.

             hematologic, hepatic, immunologic, metabolic, urologic, pulmonary, neurologic (other
             than MS), dermatologic, psychiatric, and renal, or other major disease, as determined

          -  The participant is using another MS therapy concomitantly.

          -  Known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

          -  Positive test result for Hepatitis C virus (test for hepatitis C virus antibody [HCV
             Ab]) or hepatitis B virus (test for hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg] and/or
             hepatitis B core antibody [HBcAb]).

          -  The participant has been treated with immunosuppressive or immunomodulating
