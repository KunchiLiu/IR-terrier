    <textblock>
      This study involves the treatment of cognitive impairment secondary to moderate to severe
      brain injury using central thalamic deep brain stimulation. Although all patients will
      receive stimulation continuously through an implanted pacemaker-like device, half of the
      patients will have the device deactivated during a blinded assessment phase. The device will
      be reactivated following this assessment and patients will have the option to continue
      stimulation in an open-label continuation.

      This preliminary safety study evaluates the use of the Medtronic Activa PC+S system and
      Medtronic Nexus-E system for central thalamic deep brain stimulation (CT-DBS) in the
      treatment of cognitive impairment secondary to traumatic brain injury (TBI). The proposed
      study, if successful, will provide supporting evidence for the development of a novel
      therapeutic approach utilizing CT-DBS to improve these enduring cognitive impairments
      arising in persons with multi-focal structural brain injuries. This research will address
      the critical gap of the lack of any available treatments. CT-DBS targets well-defined
      neuronal populations within the central thalamus that have known anatomical and
      physiological specializations, which not only provide a key role in arousal regulation
      during cognitively-mediated behaviors, but also exhibit a particular vulnerability to
      dysfunction in the setting of multi-focal, non-selective brain injuries.

      Our proposed study aims to support development of CT-DBS as a novel therapeutic avenue for
      accessing cognitive reserve in patients with acquired brain injuries. In the proposed
      feasibility study of 6 subjects at a single investigational site, we will test the safety of
      CT-DBS in the severe traumatic brain injury (STBI) population with GOSE 6-7 level recovery
      and collect data to establish the translation of preclinical studies into human application
      of CT-DBS.
