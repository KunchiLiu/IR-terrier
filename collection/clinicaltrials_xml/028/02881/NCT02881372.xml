    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, prospective, pilot clinical trial in which children ages 5-17 years
      with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) who have a known food that triggers EoE flares receive
      oral desensitization with that specific food antigen, followed by reintroduction of that
      food into the diet.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a clinicopathologic disorder of the esophagus triggered by
      food and/or environmental allergens and is characterized by symptoms of esophageal
      dysfunction and eosinophilia of the esophagus. Current therapy is centered on controlling
      inflammation with steroids and/or food antigen avoidance. Such treatment options have
      significant side effects and reduce quality of life, especially in children. The purpose of
      the study is to discover a way for flare-provoking foods to be reintroduced into the child's
      diet without the need for medical therapy.

      The study would involve children ages 5-17 years with biopsy-proven EoE who have a known
      flare-inducing food trigger. Following baseline blood work and esophagogastroduodenoscopy
      (EGD), the investigators will initiate oral desensitization treatment in which the child
      swallows a spray solution containing his or her specific food allergen extract in
      systematically increasing concentrations twice daily for 5 months. This desensitization
      phase would be followed by repeat blood work and EGD. If the child has more than a 50%
      increase in the peak esophageal eosinophil count from baseline, they will be withdrawn from
      the study. The next phase of the study would involve reintroduction of the actual food for 4
      weeks followed by repeat blood work and EGD. Success would be defined by having a peak
      eosinophil count &lt;15 per high power field on the final esophageal biopsy.

      Oral food desensitization has been well-studied in patients with food allergies but never in
      patients with pre-existing EoE. In those studies, the adverse events included mild
      reactions, such as watery eyes, rhinitis, sneezing, throat pruritus, transient erythema and
      abdominal pain. These reactions usually did not require stopping desensitization and were
      well controlled by antihistamines and steroids. Benefits include children having a less
      restricted diet and eliminating the need for steroid therapy. This study should yield
      valuable information regarding the management of EoE, thereby improving the current
      understanding of its pathogenesis.
