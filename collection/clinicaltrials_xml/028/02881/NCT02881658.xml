  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a local, single-center, two-arm, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
      clinical trial that examines the LDL-C-lowering effect of the consumption of a soya beverage
      enriched with plant sterol for 3 weeks. This study also examines if there is other
      health-benefits by consuming the plant sterols fortified soya beverage in terms of serum
      total triglyceride, total and HDL cholesterol, other cardiometabolic risk factors and
      musculoskeletal-related traits including handgrip strength, gait speed, peak expiratory flow
      rate, bio-impedance and body balance.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the third commonest cause of deaths in Hong Kong and
      accounting for 14.4% of all deaths in 2012. Robust data attest the causal role of
      low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in the development and progression of CVD.
      Reduction of LDL-C levels achieved by pharmacological agents in conjunction with diet change
      has been demonstrated to significantly reduce CVD morbidity and mortality. Moreover, it has
      been frequently reported that dietary incorporation of plant sterols/stanols could reduce
      blood LDL-C level in both healthy and dyslipidaemic individuals with great inter-individual
      variability of LDL-C response. Therefore, functional food enriched with plant
      sterols/stanols not only may provide additional LDL-C lowering benefit in dyslipidaemic
      patients as an adjunct to traditional pharmacologic therapy, but also play a role in primary
      prevention of CVD in the general population.
