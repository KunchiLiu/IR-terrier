    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to compare standard, single chamber transvenous ICD to
      sub-cutaneous ICD in occurrence of perioperative and long term device related complications
      and failed appropriate clinical shocks and arrhythmic death.

    <measure>Provincial healthcare payer health economics analysis</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months post-ICD implantation</time_frame>
    <description>A formal health economics analysis will be completed as part of this study, using the perspective of a provincial healthcare payer. Procedural costs will be obtained from the Ontario schedule of benefits and the cost of device-implantation will be taken from existing, local case-costing data. The cost-effectiveness analysis will take into consideration any differences in survival, complication rates and resource utilization. Sensitivity analyses will be done, varying the price of the S-ICD, in order to generate cost-acceptability curves.</description>
