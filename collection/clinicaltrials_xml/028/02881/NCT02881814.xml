  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The physiotherapist in the ICU is involved in taking patient's respiratory load, especially
      in the treatment of ventilation disorders, swallowing disorders, weaning from mechanical
      ventilation, aerosol therapy, oxygen therapy and the establishment noninvasive ventilation
      (NIV).

      The choice of one or more techniques, defining the modalities of treatment in respiratory
      physiotherapy, is at the end of a systematic, focused and disciplined. Patient evaluation is
      necessary to determine the indication for respiratory physiotherapy, choose the method of
      treatment and monitor patient progress and evaluate the effectiveness of the treatment.

      When the physical therapist patient assessment usually used clinical examination, blood
      gases, auscultation and thoracic imaging. However, the diagnostic accuracy of chest
      radiograph and auscultation is weak with regard to the pathologies which may indicate
      respiratory physiotherapy in the ICU: pulmonary consolidation, pleural effusion, atelectasis
      or interstitial syndrome. Thoracic CT remains the gold standard in the evaluation of lung
      parenchyma but requires patient transport, exposed to radiation and is more expensive.
      Compared to CT, lung ultrasound has greater sensitivity and specificity than the radiography
      in the diagnosis of these pathologies. It also assesses the diaphragm with greater accuracy
      and reproducibility than the tools Routine measurements (Maximum inspiratory pressure,
      P0.1). Ultrasound can diagnose dysfunction in intensive care with excellent sensitivity and
      specificity compared to the measurements of transdiaphragmatic pressures.

      The French physiotherapist is authorized to perform an ultrasound as part of its balance
      sheet (4), pulmonary and diaphragmatic ultrasound could allow the therapist to clarify the
      indication for respiratory physiotherapy and avoid unnecessary or inappropriate treatments.
      This provision of information may also change the therapeutic management of the
      physiotherapist. Given its relatively recent appearance, the interest of the use of
      pulmonary and diaphragmatic ultrasound respiratory physiotherapy has never been evaluated.
      Xirouchaki et al. evaluated the impact of lung ultrasound on the physician's clinical
      decision among ICU patients and showed that it significantly influenced the medical
      diagnosis and modified the therapeutic management. A ur knowledge, no study has evaluated
      the impact of the information provided by ultrasound in the clinical decision-making in
      respiratory physiotherapy in patients hospitalized in intensive care or not

      Main objective / secondary Primary objective The main objective of this study is to evaluate
      the impact of using the results of pulmonary and diaphragmatic ultrasound in the clinical
      decision-making in respiratory physiotherapy in patients hospitalized in intensive care.

      secondary objectives

      Secondary objectives are to:

        -  Determine if the ultrasound has an impact on clinical decision process chest
           physiotherapy when a CT scan is less than 12 available;

        -  Determine the level of agreement between the clinical diagnosis of the physiotherapist
           and ultrasound diagnosis, and overall clinical hypothesis;

        -  Determine the frequency change of the physical therapy treatment modalities Respiratory
           after reading the ultrasound results, overall and by assumption clinical;

        -  Determine if pulmonary and diaphragmatic ultrasound provides information when
           additional clinical examination does not conclude that disability;

        -  Determine whether the use of ultrasound data changes the frequency of choice to treat
           the patient with chest physiotherapy;

        -  Determine whether the use of ultrasound data changes the frequency of choice not
           indicate respiratory physiotherapy;

        -  Determine whether the use of ultrasound data changes the frequency of choice by the
           physiotherapist to use medical advice resuscitator;

        -  Determine whether the use of ultrasound data modifies the frequency of diaphragmatic
           dysfunction is suspected;

        -  Determine which originally sonographic signs of a change therapeutic choice when the
           diagnosis of disability is not changed by ultrasound data
