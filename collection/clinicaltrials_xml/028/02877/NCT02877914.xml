    <textblock>
      This study will use a two-stage random sampling design to create a nationally representative
      sample of patients with heart failure (HF) in China. The investigators sought to describe
      the clinical profiles, to assess treatment patterns and in-hospital outcomes for HF, and to
      identify targets for care quality improvement.

      This study will use a two-stage random sampling design to create a nationally representative
      sample in China, and randomly sample patients with HF as a primary diagnosis, and were
      admitted to hospital from January 1st, 2015 to December 31st, 2015. The sample size is
      estimated to be 10,000.

      The investigators will collect photocopies of the sampled medical records and centrally
      abstract detailed information, which included demographic characteristics, medical history,
      clinical features, diagnostic tests, in-hospital procedures, lab tests, treatments, and
      in-hospital outcomes. Data abstraction quality was monitored by random auditing of 5% of the
      medical records, with overall variable accuracy exceeding 98%.

      Analyses will examine patient characteristics, diagnostic testing patterns, in-hospital
      treatments, in-hospital outcomes, and variation in results across regions and hospitals.
      Practical guidelines, quality evaluative system, and risk model will be established based on
      the findings, to improve patient outcomes for HF in the future.
