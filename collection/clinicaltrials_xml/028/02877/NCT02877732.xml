      This is a prospective multi-center cohort feasibility and exploratory study.

      Investigators propose to prospectively study a cohort of 18-25-year-old athletes to
      establish the reliability of EYE-SYNC data and the utility of the EYE-SYNC eye-tracking
      device as a sideline concussion assessment tool. The clinical research study will be
      conducted to 1) determine if eye-tracking, assessed on the sideline by EYE-SYNC eye-tracking
      device, is a potential marker of injury that can be used in conjunction with other sideline
      evaluations to inform decisions regarding removal of athletes from play and 2) to use the
      EYE-SYNC goggle data as a post- injury recovery monitor.
