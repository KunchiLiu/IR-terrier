  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Miscommunications are a leading cause of serious medical errors in hospitals, contributing
      to more than 60% of sentinel events, the most serious adverse events reported to the Joint
      Commission. Efforts to improve patient safety in hospitals have centered on improving
      communication between providers. While provider-focused communication interventions have led
      to reductions in patient harm, patients and families have been notably absent from most
      interventions to improve patient safety. This proposal seeks to develop and investigate the
      effectiveness of a family safety engagement intervention aimed at reducing harm in
      hospitalized children.
