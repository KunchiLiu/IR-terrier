    <textblock>
      CARMEN is a clinical registry of all incident adult Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) patients
      in the Midi-Pyrenees region (South of France). It is aimed at describing ITP clinical
      features, assessing several second-line treatments (SLTs) benefit-to-risk balance and
      adherence to guidelines for ITP management.

        Adult ITP case recording in the Midi-Pyrénées region, South of France. ITP patients are
        treated by internal medicine and hematology practitioners actually spread in one tertiary
        hospital (located in Toulouse and including one hematology and six internal medicine
        departments) and 14 peripheral public or private hospitals. All these practitioners take
        actively part to the network of the Midi-Pyrénées.

        Competence Center for Autoimmune Cytopenias located in Toulouse and coordinating the
        CARMEN project.
