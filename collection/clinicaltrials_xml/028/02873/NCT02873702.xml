      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of dexlansoprazole compared to
      lansoprazole in healing erosive esophagitis (EE) in Chinese participants.

      The drug being tested in this study is called dexlansoprazole. Dexlansoprazole is being
      tested to treat people who have EE. This study will look at erosive esophageal healing in
      people who take dexlansoprazole.

      The study will enroll approximately 450 participants. Participants will be randomly assigned
      to one of the two treatment groups with 1:1 ratioâ€”which will remain undisclosed to the
      patient and study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent medical need):

        -  Dexlansoprazole 60 mg

        -  Lansoprazole 30 mg

      After 8 weeks of treatment, participants will be evaluated to assess esophageal healing. If
      the EE is healed participants will be randomly assigned to one of two different treatment
      groups with 1:1 ratio:

        -  Dexlansoprazole 30 mg

        -  Placebo (dummy inactive pill) - this is a capsule that looks like the study drug but
           has no active ingredient.

      All participants will be asked to take one capsule at the same time each day throughout the
      study.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in China. The overall time to participate in this
      study is up to 39 weeks. Participants will make 7 visits to the clinic, and will be
      contacted by telephone 5 to 10 days after last dose of study drug for a follow-up
      assessment.

    <description>Healing of EE will be assessed by endoscopy. EE will be graded according to the Los Angeles (LA) Classification of Esophagitis Grading System, based on the extent of visible mucosal breaks seen in the esophagus according to the following: - Grade O: no mucosal breaks; -Grade A: Greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 1 mucosal break less than or equal to (&lt;=) 5 mm that does not extend between the tops of 2 mucosal folds; -Grade B: &gt;=1 mucosal break more than (&gt;) 5 mm that does not extend between the tops of 2 mucosal folds; -Grade C: &gt;=1 mucosal break that is continuous between the tops of 2 or more mucosal folds, but involves less than (&lt;) 75% of the circumference; -Grade D: &gt;=1 mucosal break which involves &gt;=75% of the circumference. Healing is defined as LA Grade O.</description>
