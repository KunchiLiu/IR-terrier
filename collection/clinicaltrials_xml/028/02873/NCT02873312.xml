    <textblock>
      Approximately 10 US Study Sites will participate over total 18 months Study population will
      consist of adults age 22 or over, reporting overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms for at least 3
      months.

      Primary Study Objective

        1. To assess efficacy of the StimRouter stimulation therapy in improving OAB symptoms of
           urgency and frequency as measured by Patient Voiding Diary when targeting the posterior
           tibial nerve

        2. To assess safety of the StimRouter therapy

      Secondary Study Objective

      To evaluate:

      Efficacy of the StimRouter stimulation therapy in decreasing specific OAB symptoms of
      urgency, frequency, and urinary urge incontinence as measured by the Global Response
      Assessment (GRA) and 7-day Patient Voiding Diary

      Study Design is prospective, multi-center, randomized, double-blinded

      Primary Endpoint The primary efficacy endpoint will be the difference between the
      investigational and control groups in proportion of responders, defined as a return to
      normal voiding (7-day average in voids/leak episodes &lt; 8) OR &gt; 50% improvement in average
      voiding frequency above 8 that patient had at baseline OR &gt; 50% improvement in average
      number of moderate to severe urgency episodes at approximately three months after
      programming as measured by 7-day Patient Voiding Diary.

      Primary Outcomes:

        1. Proportion of responders based on Patient Voiding Diary

        2. Adverse Event Reports

      Secondary Endpoints:

      The secondary efficacy endpoint will be the difference in specific OAB symptoms of urgency,
      frequency, and urinary urge incontinence as measured based on (1) the difference in
      proportion of subjects in the investigational and control groups who have moderately or
      markedly improved overall response on a 7 level Global Response Assessment (GRA) at
      approximately three months after programming; and (2) the difference in responses on the
      7-day Patient Voiding Diary between the baseline visit and approximately three months after
      programming.

      Secondary Outcomes:

        1. Global Response Assessment (GRA)

        2. Urgency, frequency, and urinary urge incontinence as measured by Daily Patient Voiding
           Diary

    <textblock>
      Approximately 120 subjects will be enrolled in the Percutaneous Tibial Nerve Stimulation
      (PTNS) for Overactive Bladder study. After signing the informed consent and completing the
      screening visit, eligible candidates will be asked to (1) stop any OAB medications
      (including but not limited to anti-muscarinic medication or tricyclic antidepressants (TCA)
      as well as stabilize dosage and frequency of any concomitant medications for 3 weeks, if
      applicable, and then (2) complete a daily Patient Voiding Diary for 7 days .

      Subjects will then return to the office for baseline review. If all screening and baseline
      criteria are met, the subject will be enrolled, randomized in a 1:1 ratio into either the
      &quot;control group&quot; or the &quot;investigational group&quot; and scheduled for implant with the StimRouter
      device.

      After approximately 3 weeks for healing post-implant, study participants will be programmed
      according to their randomization assignment. All subjects will be instructed to apply
      stimulation at least 3 days/week for at least 30 minutes/day (i.e., the minimum protocol
      requirements for device use) for 6 months and to apply stimulation when they anticipate OAB
      events. Patient Voiding Diaries will be completed by the participants for 7 days prior to
      each follow-up visit and provided to the office at each follow-up visit. Follow-up visits
      will occur at Month 1, Month 2, Month 3, Month 5 and Month 6. Each follow-up visit will
      include the review of subject voiding diaries and the completion of other subject
      questionnaires for measuring OAB and quality of life assessments. Final follow-up
      evaluations for all subjects will occur at Month6.

    <description>The daily Patient Voiding Diary is a self-reported record and it includes how frequently the patient intentionally urinates during the day (frequency) and is awakened to urinate at night (nighttime void frequency), amount voided, number of urgency episodes, voids with moderate to severe urgency, urinary urge incontinence episodes and the degree of urgency to urinate. The 7-day daily Patient Voiding Diary will be assessed at baseline and at approximately 3 months after programming to measure total number of voids (frequency) and voids with moderate-to-severe urgency.The average for each of the seven-day periods will be calculated and compared.</description>

    <description>The Global Response Assessment (GRA) is a 7-level assessment tool with specific GRA subset symptom components (urgency, frequency and urinary urge incontinence). The 7-level GRA measures bladder symptoms ranging from &quot;Markedly-Worsened&quot; to &quot;Markedly-Improved&quot; (Peters et al., 2008). The GRA score will be assessed approximately 3 months after programming to determine overall OAB symptom changes with StimRouter therapeutic treatment as compared to control group sensory level treatment.</description>
