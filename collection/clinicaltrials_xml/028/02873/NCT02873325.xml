      DESIGN:

      Disease registry - non-interventional.

      INDICATION: Patients failing first or subsequent line treatment for adenovirus and / or
      cytomegalovirus reactivation post allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

      In this disease registry, data on approximately 120 allo HSCT patients who have received
      salvage treatment (second or later line) with any antiviral therapy for ADV and / or CMV
      post allogeneic HSCT will be documented; of these 120, at least 40 patients will have been
      treated with Cell Medica's immune reconstitution ACT as salvage therapy. The patients will
      be consented prospectively or retrospectively for collection of data. Data will be collected
      at baseline, 6 months and 1 year after commencement of salvage treatment. Retrospective data
      collection (for patients who underwent HSCT in 2010 or later) is permitted.
