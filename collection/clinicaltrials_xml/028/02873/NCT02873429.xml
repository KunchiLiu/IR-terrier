      This project focuses on whether nonspecific factors as well as patient characteristics
      contribute to treatment outcome differences. The project uses assessment instruments,
      computerized adaptive tests (CATs), from the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement
      Information System (PROMISÂ®). The research team has recently developed and tested (using
      PROMIS methods) a set of instruments to assess non-specific factors in healing from the
      patient's perspective. These instruments, the Healing Encounters and Attitudes Lists (HEAL)
      assess the Patient-Provider Connection, Treatment Expectancy, views of the Healthcare
      Environment, Positive and Negative Attitudes, Spirituality, and Attitude toward
      Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM). HEAL CAT's, like other PROMIS CATs, are brief,
      easy to use and understand, and are designed to apply to a broad spectrum of treatments and
      health conditions. In this project, the investigators aim to 1) evaluate whether HEAL
      predicts chronic pain treatment outcomes, 2) examine heterogeneity of treatment effects
      based upon HEAL and PROMIS scores in integrative and conventional medicine settings, and 3)
      interview patients and their clinicians regarding the utility of HEAL, PROMIS and a Pain Log
      for enhancing communication. The investigators will administer HEAL CATs and other PROMIS
      CATs (depression, anxiety, sleep disturbance, fatigue and physical function) to 200 patients
      who are starting treatment for chronic pain in integrative medicine and conventional
      medicine settings. Follow-up assessments will be completed 2 and 4 months after baseline
      testing. The investigators will evaluate factors that may predict which patients judge
      themselves to be improved, the same, or worsened. Some of the possible factors that may
      contribute to improvement include HEAL scores, emotional distress, or the preference for CAM
      or conventional treatment. The investigators are also interested in learning whether
      patients find the assessments to be clear and useful. A subset of 50 patients and
      approximately 10 clinicians will complete interviews about the HEAL and PROMIS questions,
      and about the Pain Log developed by a patient advocacy group partner, the American Chronic
      Pain Association. By interviewing patients and their healthcare providers, the investigators
      hope to determine the clarity and acceptability of the HEAL and other assessments, and to
      learn whether HEAL and PROMIS summaries enhance patient-provider communication in the
      clinical partnership.
