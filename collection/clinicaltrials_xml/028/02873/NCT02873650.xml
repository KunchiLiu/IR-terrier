             evaluations

          -  Subjects must have a BMI between 18.0 kg/m2 and 36 kg/m2, with a body weight of at
             least 50 kg and no more than 120 kg

          -  Additional criteria for hepatic impairment subjects: Subjects must have stable
             Child-Pugh status in the past 28 days prior to dosing

          -  Additional criteria for healthy matched subjects: Matched to at least 1 hepatic
             impairment subject by age (+/-10 years), gender and weight (+/-10%)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Significant acute illness within the two weeks prior to dosing

          -  History or presence of clinically significant ECG abnormalities or a family history
             or presence of prolonged QT-interval syndrome

          -  History or current diagnosis of cardiac disease indicating significant risk of safety
             for subjects participating in the study such as uncontrolled or significant cardiac
             disease

          -  Any surgical or medical condition which might significantly alter the absorption,
             distribution, metabolism or excretion of drugs.

          -  History of malignancy of any organ system, treated or untreated, within 5 years,
             regardless of where there is recurrence or metastases.

          -  Healthy subjects: History of drug or alcohol abuse within 6 months prior to dosing or
             evidence of such abuse as indicated by laboratory values at screening or baseline.

        Additional exclusion for hepatic impairment subjects:

          -  History of drug or alcohol abuse within 1 month prior to dosing or evidence of such
             abuse as indicated by laboratory values at screening or baseline.

          -  Subject has received a liver transplant

          -  Encephalopathy Grade 3 or worse within 28 days of dosing

          -  Subjects requiring tapping more than every 3 months for the management of ascites

          -  History of surgical portosystemic shunt

          -  Subjects with clinically significant abnormal findings, not consistent with clinical
             disease, upon physical examination, ECG or laboratory evaluation.

        Other protocol-defined inclusion/exclusion may apply.
