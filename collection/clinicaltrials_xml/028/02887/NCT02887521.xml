  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study funded by the National Institute of Health. The rationale for the need of
      this research is the lack of any well proven risk-reducing intervention that may decrease
      the morbidity of lung cancer resection in patients with COPD or that may improve their
      quality of life trajectory, a meaningful outcome in the overall disease progression. The
      proposed intervention is unique as it combines exercise and behavioral interventions that
      were pilot tested in a randomized single-blinded controlled design in the proposed
      population and proved feasible and potentially effective. The aim is to test the effect of
      the proposed rehabilitation on length of stay, pulmonary complications and quality of life
      trajectory.

      Prospectively, 194 patients will be randomized to either ten sessions of preoperative
      pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) vs. standard care at a number of healthcare centers throughout
      the United States. This study will be open for 36 months. Randomization will be stratified
      by three variables: very severe lung function (yes vs. no), prior neo-adjuvant chemotherapy
      for this operation (yes vs. no) and open thoracotomy vs. video assisted thoracoscopy. The
      primary and secondary objectives are provided below.

      Primary Objective:

      To prospectively determine the effect of 10 sessions of customized preoperative PR on the
      length of hospital stay in patients that undergo a lung cancer resection and have COPD
      compared to a matched control group. Hypothesis: Ten sessions of customized preoperative PR
      will significantly reduce the length of hospital stay.

      Secondary Objectives:

        1. To prospectively determine the effect of 10 sessions of customized preoperative PR on
           the number of postoperative complications in patients that undergo a lung cancer
           resection and have COPD compared to a matched control group.

             -  Hypothesis: Ten sessions of customized preoperative PR will significantly reduce
                the number of postoperative pulmonary complications.

        2. To prospectively determine the effect of a 10-session preoperative PR on the trajectory
           of quality of life at 3 and 6 months after the curative resection compared to a matched
           control group.

             -  Hypothesis: Ten sessions of customized preoperative PR will significantly and
                meaningfully (more than the minimal clinically important difference) improve
                quality of life after surgery compared to a control group.

      Patients will be followed at 3 and 6 months post-surgery.

    <description>Patients will receive 10 in-clinic sessions of preoperative Pulmonary Rehabilitation (PR) two weeks prior to surgery. Patients will receive a Participant Manual demonstrating and explaining the rehabilitation process. Patients will also receive a log for recording their efforts and notes for every day until the day of surgery. A video recording of the intervention from start to finish will be provided to all patients. The video recording should be played in all 10 sessions at the registering site. The PR sessions will include breathing awareness, upper and lower extremity exercise, instructions for inspiratory muscle training using the PFlex valve, practice at home and goal setting. Patients undergo surgery and will be followed until 6 months following surgery. Patients complete follow up questionnaires at 3 and 6 months after discharge.</description>

    <description>Patients will receive a pedometer to monitor their daily steps and a pamphlet with exercises plus the standard course of care for patients undergoing lung resection surgery. The patients will not be asked to return the pedometer. The local institutional coordinator will go over the use of the pedometer and the exercise materials with the patient. The patients will be asked to keep a log of their pre-operative steps and mail the log to the registering site. Patients undergo surgery and will be followed until 6 months following surgery. Patients complete follow up questionnaires at 3 and 6 months after discharge.</description>

             (Calculated by multiplying the number of packs of cigarettes smoked per day by the
             number of years the person has smoked. For example, 1 pack-year is equal to smoking
             20 cigarettes (1 pack) per day for 1 year, or 40 cigarettes per day for half a year,
             and so on).
