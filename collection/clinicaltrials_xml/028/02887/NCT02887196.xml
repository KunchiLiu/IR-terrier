    <textblock>
      Twenty-five women will be followed through their breast cancer treatment. The women will be
      asked to provide their opinions and desires for lifestyle intervention at different times
      throughout treatment. In addition, basic clinical data will be collected . The primary goal
      of this pilot study is to investigate the physical and behavioral changes that occur in
      patients receiving treatment for breast cancer.

      In this cross sectional, longitudinal, observational study, 25 women will be followed
      through their treatment for stage I-III breast cancer. The women will be asked to provide
      their opinions and desires for lifestyle intervention at four timepoints throughout
      treatment. In addition to qualitative data, basic clinical data will be collected
      (anthropometrics, vital signs, dietary intake, and physical activity). The primary goal of
      this pilot study is to investigate the anthropometric and behavioral changes that occur in
      patients undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer.

      Aim 1: To better understand patients' attitudes toward and perceived barriers to nutrition
      and physical activity interventions during neoplastic treatment.

      Hypothesis: Patients' reported attitudes, motivation, and perceived barriers will change
      throughout treatment.

      Aim 2: To measure the physical and metabolic changes that occur throughout neoplastic
      treatment for breast cancer.

      Hypothesis: Over 50% of the participants will gain body weight during treatment and
      metabolic parameters will trend with body weight change.
