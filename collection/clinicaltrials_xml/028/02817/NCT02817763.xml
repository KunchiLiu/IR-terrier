    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study is to evaluate the clinical, aesthetic and patient-centered
      parameters of connective tissue graft associated or not with partial resin composite (RC)
      for the treatment of gingival recession with NCCL, performed before the surgical procedure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a prospective, parallel and controlled clinical trial.

      - Group CTG (control n = 20) - patients who received connective tissue graft to treat
      gingival recession associated with non-carious cervical lesion. Group CTG+RC (test n = 20) -
      patients who received connective tissue graft plus partial resin composite restoration to
      treat gingival recession associated with non-carious cervical lesion.

      The surgeries, as well as all postoperative follow-up, were performed at the dental clinic
      of Institute of Science and Technology (ICT), State University of São Paulo (UNESP). For
      those recessions allocated to CTG group, two horizontal incisions were made at right angles
      to the adjacent interdental papillae, without interfering with the gingival margins of
      neighboring teeth. Two oblique vertical incisions were extended beyond the mucogingival
      junction, and a trapezoidal mucoperiosteal flap was raised up to the mucogingival junction.
      After this point, a split-thickness flap was extended apically, releasing the tension and
      favoring coronal positioning of the flap.The exposed root surface was gently scaled and
      planed until it became smooth in the CTG group. Afterwards, a thin and small connective
      tissue graft was removed from the palatal site and sutured over the root surface. Then, the
      flap was coronally positioned and sutured to completely cover the graft. For those
      recessions allocated to CTG+RC group, firstly a sterile rubber dam was placed to isolate the
      operative field and the coronal zone of the non-carious cervical lesion restoration was
      performed with a nanocomposite resin, following the manufacturer's instructions. The apical
      margin of the restoration was place 1 millimeter apically to the cemento-enamel junction
      estimation. In the following session the CTG+RC received the surgical procedure as described
      above where a thin and small connective tissue graft was removed from the palatal site and
      sutured over the root/restoration surface. Then, the flap was coronally positioned and
      sutured to completely cover the graft.

      Clinical parameters were assessed at baseline and 3 and 6 months post-operatively.

    <description>After local anesthesia, the surgical procedure performed was the trapezoidal-type of Coronally advanced flap (CAF).

Then, the flap was coronally positioned and sutured to completely cover the graft.</description>
