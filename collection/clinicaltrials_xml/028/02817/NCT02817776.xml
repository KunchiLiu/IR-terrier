  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the THERMOCOOL
      SMARTTOUCH® SF catheter in the treatment of drug refractory symptomatic persistent atrial
      fibrillation (PsAF) following standard electrophysiology mapping and RF ablation procedures.
