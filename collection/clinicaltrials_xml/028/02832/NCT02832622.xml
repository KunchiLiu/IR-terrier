    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multicenter, non-randomized registry/observational study. The study
      will enroll up to 2,000 patients with successful St. Jude Medical (SJM) Cardiac
      Resynchronization Therapy (CRT) MP device implant from up to 140 centers undergoing CRT
      implantation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Any patient who received a market approved SJM Quadra Allure MP, Quadra Assura MP, or newer
      SJM CRT MP device is eligible for enrollment in the study. MultiPoint Pacing (MPP)
      programming guidance will be specified in the protocol. Patients will be followed for 12
      months after implant. Data will be collected at Baseline (within 30 days prior to implant),
      Post-Implant (within 30 days following successful CRT device implant), 3, 6, 12 months and
      during any unscheduled follow-up visit.
