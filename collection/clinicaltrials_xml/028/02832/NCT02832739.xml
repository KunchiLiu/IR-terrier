    <textblock>
      The aim of the USECARE AAL project is to improve and test SENACA, an ICT-based
      self-management support system for chronically ill patients and informal caregivers. 96
      end-users will be instructed to use SENACA for approx. 3 months (in Israel, Norway and
      Switzerland). Amongst others, clinical and behavioural outcomes will be recorded.
      Additionally, SENACA's usability will be evaluated to determine its potential future
      scalability.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Switzerland, SENior health ACAdemy (SENACA, www.senaca.ch) has been developed by the
      European Medical Network EMN.

      SENACA is a structured self-management support system with several interacting components,
      combining tele-monitoring devices and a solution for personalised health plans. This online
      support system's usability, the behaviour change techniques it builds on, modes of delivery
      and its effects on health-related behaviour, clinical and Quality-of-Life outcomes will be
      established in a larger group of end-users.

      Testing the usability of SENACA and practical effectiveness of this intervention is the goal
      of this multi-national EU-funded ambient assisted living (AAL) project USECARE
      (www.usecare.eu).

      SENACA will be implemented in three countries (Israel, Norway and Switzerland) via field
      test with community-dwelling older adults living with chronic conditions (i.e. diabetes,
      COPD, chronic heart failure) and their informal caregivers.

      Key element of USECARE AAL is a field-test including a study based upon pre-experimental
      design with three time point measurements and a pre-usability round. Multiple methods will
      be used to evaluate the usability and to observe clinical and process parameters before,
      during and after the implementation of the enhanced SENACA prototype.

      All of the results combined will provide an insight into the end-user experience, usage
      pattern, usability perception and potential added value of the enhanced SENACA prototype for
      chronic disease management in the participating countries.
