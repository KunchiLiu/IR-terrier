      In this study researchers will test pupil near response(PNR)in patients in unresponsive
      wakefulness syndrome(UWS)and compare the favourable prognostic difference between patients
      with PNR and patients without PNR.

      Behavioral assessment is regarded as the gold standard on current evaluation of
      consciousness and prognostic prediction in patients with disorders of
      consciousness.(DOC)However,it relies on examiners' subjective interpretation to
      patients'behavior and is not applicable to patients without motor function. Previous studies
      suggest pupil near response has relationship with consciousness which are the inspiration of
      this study.In this study,the prognostic value of pupil near response to DOC patients will be
      tested on patients in unresponsive wakefulness syndrome(UWS,a new name for vegetative
      state).If the result is encouraging,it suggests these patients with PNR have been in
      minimally conscious state(MCS)already in the first CRS-R assessment.Moreover,for PNR can be
      objectively measured and needs no activation of skeletal muscle,it will be the solution to
      the problems of current evaluation of consciousness in DOC patients as mentioned above.

      A PNR test will be conducted on patients who have been diagnosed as UWS by Coma recovery
      scale-revised assessment to see if their PNR is positive.(CRS-R)According to the results of
      this test,patients will be divided into 2 groups,one including patients with PNR,the other
      one including patients without PNR.3 months later,a follow up will be conducted to obtain
      their prognosis in the form of another CRS-R assessment.Patients diagnosed as MCS will be
      considered as favourable prognosis,patients diagnosed as UWS or dead will be considered as
      unfavourable prognosis.Their favourable prognostic difference(difference between each
      group's proportion of MCS patients diagnosed by CRS-R in the follow up)will then be compared
      to see if PNR has relationship with consciousness. And for they will not be able to show
      conscious visual behaviors (visual behaviors in CRS-R which indicate MCS) in the first CRS-R
      and might have been misdiagnosed for this reason,their difference between recovery of
      conscious visual function (difference between each group's proportion of patients showing
      conscious visual behavior diagnosed by CRS-R in the follow up) will be compared to see if
      PNR is applicable to patients without motor function.

      Researchers expect to see the group including patients with PNR has greater proportion in
      both comparison.
