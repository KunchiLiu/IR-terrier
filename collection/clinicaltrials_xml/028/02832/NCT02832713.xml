  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In France, osteoarthritis affects about 10 million people and knee osteoarthritis represents
      35% of cases. It is thought that more than 2.5 million people older than 65 years have knee
      osteoarthritis.

      Currently, osteoarthritis management is based on three major axes:

        1. Non-pharmacological means, such as patient education, loss of weight and physical
           activity

        2. General pharmacological treatments: mainly paracetamol and then schedule II and III
           painkillers as well as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent.

        3. Intra-articular pharmacological treatments:

             1. Intra-articular injections of corticosteroids: they are recommended during
                hydarthrotic flare-ups

             2. Intra-articular injections of hyaluronic acid (HA) (viscosupplementation) in the
                absence of intra-articular effusion. However, their efficacy is questioned by most
                experts in the case of symptomatic knee osteoarthrosis.

        4. Sometimes, surgery is the only therapeutic option. However, besides the fact of
           exposing patients, who are sometimes frail, to several peri- and post-operative
           complications, the recovery rate (variable according to the prosthesis type and ranging
           from 5% to 25% at 9 years) in an ageing population justifies waiting as much as
           possible before surgery. Therefore, it is important to test new therapeutic options for
           symptomatic osteoarthrosis that will allow postponing the surgical treatment.

        5. The use of botulinum toxin (BoNT-A) could thus represents an interesting alternative.
           BoNT-A is habitually used by intra-muscular injection for its myorelaxant effect in the
           management of painful reactive periarticular muscle contractures. However, BoNT-A has
           also antalgic activity independently of the myorelaxant effect. This allows explaining
           in part the antalgic effect of intra-articular BoNT-A injection. In the literature, six
           randomized controlled studies (RCS) have compared BoNT-A and intra-articular injections
           of corticosteroids, hyaluronic acid, or placebo. Only two RCS concerned knee
           osteoarthritis and compared BoNT-A to corticosteroids and a placebo, respectively, with
           a significant antalgic effect only in the groups treated with BoNT-A. No study has
           compared yet the intra-articular injection of BoNT-A to the viscosupplementation by HA
           in knee osteoarthritis and this is the aim of this trial.
