  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of dual-mode non-invasive brain
      stimulation (NIBS) with high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS)
      over the primary motor cortex of the lower leg and anodal transcranial direct current
      stimulation (tDCS) over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex compared with rTMS alone in
      patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) with freezing of gait (FOG).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients in the dual-mode group underwent five consecutive daily sessions of dual-mode NIBS
      with simultaneous high-frequency rTMS and tDCS, whereas patients in the rTMS group underwent
      high-frequency rTMS with sham tDCS. Assessments of FOG, motor, ambulatory and cognitive
      function were performed three times: at baseline before NIBS, immediately after NIBS, and
      one week after cessation of NIBS.
