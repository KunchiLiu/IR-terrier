  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study plans to treat patients with pembrolizumab and thus blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 axis
      would render tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in the tumor parenchyma more functional
      as a consequence of BRAF inhibition, such that T cell activation by BRAFi would not be
      dampened by the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction. This combination would reverse dysfunction among T
      cells in the tumor parenchyma, maximizing T cell mediated immune anti-tumor efficacy.
      Progression free survival (PFS) with pembrolizumab in KEYNOTE-001 was 57% at 6 months, and
      46.4% in the more recently reported phase III trial. PFS with vemurafenib treatment in
      BRIM-3 was ~50% at 6 months. Combined treatment with pembrolizumab and vemurafenib for BRAF
      mutant melanoma is hypothesized to be safe and to improve the PFS compared to these recent
      historical controls. Because this combination has not yet been tested, and because the
      primary objective is to assess safety, the investigators are staging accrual in the first
      phase of the trial. The study aims to accrue up to 50 patients to the mTPI design of this
      study with the expectation that there will be at least 30 patients treated at RP2D. In case
      there are less than 30 patients on the RP2D, additional patients will be accrued. Patients
      will continue to receive treatment with pembrolizumab and vemurafenib until disease
      progression or toxicity. Patients with treatment response and no dose limiting toxicity may
      receive treatment with pembrolizumab for up to 24 months.

      Pembrolizumab will be given at a dose of 200 mg q3 weeks (this is the standard dosage, ),
      and vemurafenib will be given at 480 mg twice daily, 720 mg twice daily, or 960 mg twice
      daily. Treatment with pembrolizumab and vemurafenib will commence on the same day. One cycle
      of treatment will be defined as one dose of pembrolizumab and 3 weeks of vemurafenib.
