      The broad objective of this investigation is to assess the safety and efficacy of oral
      therapy with dexmedetomidine for the induction and maintenance of restful sleep.

      Sleep is a basic human function that occupies approximately one-third of our lives. Much of
      what is known about the benefits of sleep in humans has been obtained from studies of
      patients with insomnia, the most common sleep disorder with a reported prevalence of 10 to
      15%. Unfortunately, insomnia is an independent risk factor for acute myocardial infarction,
      coronary heart disease, heart failure, hypertension, diabetes, and death. More so, sleep
      disturbances lead to neurocognitive deficits such as delirium and psychosis. However, the
      principal medications (i.e. benzodiazepines, zolpidem) currently used to treat insomnia are
      associated with side effects such as daytime sedation, delirium, anterograde memory
      disturbance, and complex sleep-related behaviors. We recently found that a nighttime
      intravenous bolus administration of dexmedetomidine was associated with normal sleep
      architecture comprising of rapid eye movement (REM) and non-REM (N1, N2, N3) sleep, with
      improved next-day psychomotor vigilance performance compared to zolpidem. Presently,
      dexmedetomidine is only available in an intravenous formulation. The goal of this project is
      to develop dexmedetomidine, an alpha-2 receptor agonist, into an oral and sublingual sleep
      therapeutic with a neurocognitive sparing profile.

      Sleep is crucial for maintaining normal health and well-being. Insomnia, which is a disorder
      of sleep onset or maintenance, is prevalent in approximately 10-15% of the population.
      Insomnia is largely treated with medications that similar to anesthetics, target
      gamma-amino-butyric acid A (GABAA) receptors throughout the brain to globally inhibit
      activity and cause sedation. Sedation with GABA receptor modulating anesthetics and insomnia
      medications are associated with beta (13-25 Hz) oscillations a relatively fast oscillatory
      dynamic that is not associated with natural sleep. Rather, this oscillatory dynamic, which
      results from interneuron antisynchrony, is associated with amnesic drug effects. Our
      objective in this investigation is to evaluate the efficacy of biomimetic sleep in reducing
      the incidence and severity of delirium in extubated CSICU patients.
