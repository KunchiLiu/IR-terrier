  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ARPEGE project fits within the general framework of maintaining functional autonomy in the
      frail elderly. The early identification of elderly people at risk of frailty is essential to
      be able to make corrective actions to maintain a quality of life desired by the person.
      ARPEGE offers tracking and monitoring based on a corpus mobile evaluation of frailty, that
      could be used in various environments (home, prevention center, office of the general
      practitioner, geriatric consultation), and manipulated intuitively by professionals not
      specialists.

      This four-year project spearheaded by the University of technology of Troyes in partnership
      with the University of Reims Champagne-Ardenne also brings a set of partners and experts in
      the region and outside, so that the proposed solution has the qualities necessary for its
      deployment in terms of value diagnostic, use, acceptability and perfectly controlled ethics.

      The Region has made &quot;longevity aging&quot; theme one of its priorities. This image of driver of
      innovation in this area can only be enhanced by a program like ARPEGE. Beyond the scientific
      and technological results expected, one can imagine the potential socio-economic benefits if
      this tracking solution is deployed on a large scale.
