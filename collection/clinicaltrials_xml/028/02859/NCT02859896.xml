      Primary Objective:

      Evaluate the effect of Hectorol® capsules in reducing elevated levels of intact parathyroid
      hormone (iPTH).

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  Evaluate the safety profile of Hectorol® capsules versus Rocaltrol® (calcitriol)
           capsules.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetic profile of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D2 after administration
           of Hectorol®.
