        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Signed Informed Consent

          2. Target Population: Healthy subjects as determined by no clinically significant
             deviation from normal in medical and surgical history, physical examination, vital
             sign measurements, 12-lead ECG measurements, , and clinical laboratory test results.
             Body mass index (BMI) of 18.0 to 32.0 kg/mÂ².

          3. Subject Re-enrollment: This study permits the re-enrollment of a subject that has
             discontinued the study as a pre-treatment failure (i.e., subject has not been
             randomized/ has not been treated). If re-enrolled, the subject must be re-consented.

          4. Age: Males and Females, ages 18 or age of majority to 50 years, inclusive.

          5. Reproductive Status: Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative
             serum/urine (urine test not allowed at screening and Day -1 of Period 1) pregnancy
             test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of human chorionic
             gonadotropin) within 24 hours prior to the start of study drug. Women must not be
             breastfeeding. Women of childbearing potential must agree to follow instructions for
             method(s) of contraception (Appendix 1) for the duration of treatment with study drug
             plus 5 half-lives of study drug (60 hours) plus 30 days (duration of ovulatory cycle)
             for a total of 33 days post-treatment completion. Males who are sexually active with
             WOCBP must agree to follow instructions for method(s) of contraception for the
             duration of treatment with study drug plus 5 half-lives of study drug (60 hours). In
             addition, male subjects must be willing to refrain from sperm donation during this
             time. Azoospermic males are exempt from contraceptive requirements. Women of
             childbearing potential who are continuously not heterosexually active are also exempt
             from contraceptive requirements, and still undergo pregnancy testing as described in
             this section.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Medical History and Concurrent Diseases: History of any chronic or acute illness,
             gastrointestinal disease, gastrointestinal surgery within less than 4 weeks of
             dosing, blood donation within 4 weeks of dosing, blood transfusion within 4 weeks of
             dosing, smoking within less than 12 months prior to dosing, alcohol abuse, inability
             to tolerate oral medication, or inability to be venipunctured. Any other sound
             medical, psychiatric and/or social reason as determined by the investigator.

          2. Physical and Laboratory Test Findings: Evidence of organ dysfunction or any
             clinically significant deviation from normal in physical examination, vital signs
             measurements, ECGs, or clinical laboratory determinations beyond what is consistent
             with the target population.

          3. Exposure to any investigational drug or placebo within 4 weeks of study drug
             administration.
