        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy male and female volunteers who gave their written consent by signing the
             Informed Consent Form

          -  Subjects in the age between 18 and 55 years old with normal weight as determined by a
             body mass index (BMI) between 18 and 30 kg/m^2, with a body weight of at least 50 kg
             for male subjects or 45 kg for female subjects

          -  Subject has clinical laboratory test results within the reference ranges of the
             testing laboratory (including normal renal and liver function) or test results that
             are outside the specified ranges and that are deemed as clinically non-significant

          -  Subjects has blood pressure (BP) and pulse within normal range in a supine position
             after 5 minutes rest

          -  Subject's electrocardiogram (ECG) is considered 'normal' or 'abnormal' but clinically
             non-significant

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has any medical or psychiatric condition that, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, could jeopardize or would compromise the subject's ability to
             participate in this study: Subject has any acute or chronic illness which, in the
             opinion of the Investigator, may place the subject at risk because of participation
             in the study. Subject has any clinically relevant abnormal findings in physical
             examination, laboratory tests, vital signs, or ECG, which, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, may place the subject at risk because of participation in the study.

          -  Tests positive for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-1 or-2 antibodies, Hepatitis B
             Virus (HBV) surface antigen, or Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) antibody

          -  Hepatic impairment

          -  Renal impairment

          -  Any of the following hematological function tests at the Screening Visit: Hemoglobin
             &lt;111g/L (for women) or &lt;113g/L (for men); Absolute neutrophil count &lt;1.5x10^9/L
