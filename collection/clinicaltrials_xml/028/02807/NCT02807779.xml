  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multicenter, randomized trial to determine the mechanisms of vascular
      healing. The study will evaluate subjects with peripheral artery disease (PAD) who require
      an endovascular intervention of the femoro-popliteal (SFA) artery to restore blood flow to
      the leg.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral artery disease (PAD) affects at least 12 million Americans annually with more
      than half a million patients undergoing an endovascular or surgical revascularization
      procedure in order to treat the disease. Unfortunately, about two-thirds of patients still
      have blockages in the leg arteries, even after these procedures.

      Advances in Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offer promise for understanding the mechanism
      of failure through insights into vessel wall composition, remodeling, and inflammation.
      Restenosis has a known relationship to inflammation. Advances in micro-catheter technologies
      offer the ability to deliver anti-inflammatory medications such as Dexamethasone (DEX)
      directly to the adventitia and advances in drug delivery on balloon surfaces to deliver
      paclitaxel to the intima of the artery.

      This study aims to investigate if patient-specific parameters affect angioplasty outcomes,
      if DEX has a biological effect on the vessel wall, and if this effect is through the
      reduction of inflammation.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Screening:

          1. Male or non-pregnant female ≥ 35 years of age

          2. Atherosclerotic, infrainguinal PAD

          3. Rutherford Clinical Category 2-6

          4. Stenosis detected by radiology that in the clinicians opinion is the reason for the
             PAD symptom

          5. Patient is willing to provide informed consent and comply with the required follow up
             visits, testing schedule, and medication regimen

        Procedural Criteria:

          1. Successful angioplasty of the target lesion or portion of the target lesion defined
             as ≤30% residual lumen stenosis compared with adjacent non-diseased lumen diameter,
             without flow-limiting dissection

          2. De novo atherosclerotic lesion qualifying for angioplasty

          3. &gt;50% diameter stenosis between the superficial femoral and/or popliteal artery
             (between the profunda and tibioperoneal trunk)

          4. Reference vessel diameter ≥3 mm and ≤ 8mm

          5. Successful wire crossing of lesion

          6. A patent artery proximal to the index lesion. Concomitant inflow procedures including
             open femoral artery endarterectomy or stenting of the iliac arteries is permissible.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Screening Criteria:

          1. Any contraindication to receiving an MRI

          2. Pregnant, nursing, or planning on becoming pregnant in &lt; 2yrs

          3. Life expectancy of &lt; 1 yr

          4. History of solid organ transplantation

          5. Patient actively participating in another investigational device or drug study

          6. History of hemorrhagic stroke within 3 months

          7. Previous or planned surgical or interventional procedure within 30 days of index
             procedure

          8. Chronic renal insufficiency with eGFR &lt; 45

          9. Prior bypass surgery, stenting, atherectomy or angioplasty of the target lesion

         10. Inability to take required study medications

         11. Contra-indication or known hypersensitivity to dexamethasone sodium phosphate,
             contrast media, gadolinium, or aspirin or Plavix

         12. Systemic fungal infection

         13. Acute limb ischemia

         14. Prior participation of the index limb in the current study (contralateral treatment
             is allowed)

         15. Patient is receiving long-term oral steroids for unrelated condition. This does not
             include inhaled steroids for bronchial diseases.

        Procedural Criteria:

          1. Lesions extending into the trifurcation or above the profunda. Note the outflow can
             be treated concomitantly. Similarly the common femoral artery can be treated
             concomitantly with either an open endarterectomy and patch angioplasty or by
             endovascular methods. However the index lesion cannot be contiguous with either the
             CFA or the trifurcation.

          2. Circumferential calcification at index lesion, which in the judgment of the
             investigator would prevent penetration of the microinfusion catheter needle through
             the vessel wall

          3. Inadequate distal outflow defined as absence of at least one patent tibial artery (no
             lesion &gt;50% stenosis) with flow into the foot. The outflow vessel can be established
             at the time of primary treatment

          4. Use of adjunctive therapies other than angioplasty. The Chocolate balloon and other
             scoring balloons are allowed however stay below reference diameter.
