      Introduction: Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most prevalent
      mental disorders in children and is associated with important negative functional outcomes
      throughout development. The first signs and symptoms become apparent in preschool age.
      Therefore, early interventions in this population have the potential of limiting the
      disorder's negative impact and preventing future impairments in affected individuals. The
      first-choice medication for treating ADHD is methylphenidate, which has evidence of efficacy
      and safety in preschool children. However, non-evidence based worries and pressure from the
      media placed parent training as the first-line treatment for ADHD in clinical guidelines.
      Parent training is a behavioral intervention implemented with the parents, with weekly
      sessions for 8 to 12 weeks, adequate for treating ADHD dysfunctional symptoms and behaviors.
      However, the level of evidence for this intervention is reduced. Furthermore, the need of
      trained therapists in the public health system, added to the difficulties on adherence and
      comprehension from parents, limit its generalization and raise questions regarding its
      indications. Until now, no study has compared pharmacological treatment with methylphenidate
      to parent training in preschool children with ADHD regarding their clinical efficacy and
      cost-effectiveness. Moreover, no study has evaluated the impact of pharmacological
      intervention and psychotherapy on neurobiological mechanisms of ADHD, which is crucial for
      determining their impact on neurodevelopment.

      Objectives: This is a double-blind randomized clinical trial that aims to evaluate the
      efficacy, tolerability and acceptability of treatment with methylphenidate compared to
      parental training and placebo in preschool children with ADHD. Furthermore, the
      investigators propose the use of advanced neuroimaging techniques for the assessment of
      changes in brain connectivity from the institution of treatment.

      Methods: This study will be a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, evaluating two
      active interventions and placebo control group. One hundred and fifty children aged 3 years
      and 11 months and 5 years and 11 months, diagnosed with ADHD, will be randomized to receive
      treatment with methylphenidate and information (50 children), parental training and
      treatment with placebo medication (50 children) or belong to active control group with
      educational information for parents and placebo treatment with no treatment (active control,
      50 children). The treatment will last eight weeks, the neurobiological outcomes will be
      assessed before and after treatment and clinical outcomes will be assessed at weeks 0, 4 and
      8 will also be evaluated 50 children with typical development in relation to neurobiological
      measures.

      Implications: This study proposes an innovative and relevant analysis, which will enable the
      field to advance the knowledge of biological mechanisms related to ADHD and to treatment
      response. Also, the study will expand the evidence to guide early prevention strategies and
      early intervention.
