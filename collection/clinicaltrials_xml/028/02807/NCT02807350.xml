  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objectives of this randomized trial comparing overminus lens treatment to
      non-overminus (spectacles without overminus or spectacles with plano lenses) are to
      determine:

        -  The long-term on-treatment effect of overminus treatment on distance intermittent
           exotropia (IXT) control score.

        -  The off-treatment effect of overminus treatment on distance IXT control score
           (following weaning and 3 months off treatment).

      The main objectives of this randomized trial comparing overminus lens treatment to
      non-overminus (spectacles without overminus or spectacles with plano lenses) are to
      determine:

        -  The long-term on-treatment effect of overminus treatment on distance IXT control score.

        -  The off-treatment effect of overminus treatment on distance IXT control score
           (following weaning and 3 months off treatment).

      The recently completed IXT3 pilot study (NCT02223650) addressed the question of whether
      overminus lens therapy has an initial short-term therapeutic effect for IXT while wearing
      overminus spectacles. There have been no rigorous studies that address the following
      important questions related to overminus lens therapy:

        -  Does overminus lens therapy have a long-term therapeutic effect for IXT while wearing
           overminus spectacles (over many months or years)?

        -  Does overminus lens therapy have a long-term therapeutic effect for IXT when overminus
           spectacles are discontinued?
