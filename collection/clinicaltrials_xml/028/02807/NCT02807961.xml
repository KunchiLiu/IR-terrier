  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is the first study in humans of ELX-02, an advanced synthetic aminoglycoside optimized
      as a translational read-through drug (TRID) for the treatment of genetic conditions caused
      by nonsense. mutations. This is a classical Phase 1a study designed as a randomized,
      double-blinded, placebo-controlled, single dose escalation to evaluate the safety,
      tolerability and pharmacokinetics of ELX-02 in healthy adult volunteers.

             of the study and their family members, site staff members otherwise supervised by the
             Investigator, or subjects who are the Sponsor employees directly involved in the
             conduct of the study.

          2. Participation in another clinical trial within 6 months prior to dosing (calculated

             female subjects of childbearing potential who are unwilling or unable to use a highly
             effective method of contraception as outlined in this protocol for the duration of
             the study and for at least 14 days before and 28 days after the last dose of study
             medication.

             or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the administration of study
             medication. As an exception, acetaminophen/paracetamol may be used at doses of ≤2
             g/day. Limited use of non-prescription medications that are not believed to affect
             subject safety or the overall results of the study may be permitted on a case-by-case
