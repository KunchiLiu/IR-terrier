      Undernutrition is the result of energy and protein deficiency and / or catabolic. These
      phenomena are observed daily in patients awaiting lung transplantation.

      After lung transplantation that undernutrition is growing (on average 11% weight loss after
      the first observations in the continuing care of the University Hospital of Strasbourg). In
      other words the non-malnourished patients become. Hence the importance to reach every
      patient awaiting transplant, mainly to patients already malnourished before surgery.

      Several studies have shown that early nutritional support has a direct effect on reducing
      comorbidities and the average length of stay. In the course of care of these patients it is
      necessary to intensify the dietary management to give them the best chance for early
      rehabilitation.
