      [INTRODUCTION]

      The success of combination HIV prevention efforts, including HIV treatment as prevention,
      hinges on universal, routine HIV testing with linkage to care and antiretroviral treatment
      initiation after HIV diagnosis. The proposed study will evaluate the comparative
      effectiveness and sustainability of innovative incentive strategies, informed directly by
      behavioral economics and decision psychology, to promote HIV testing among men and HIV and
      treatment among HIV-infected adults in rural Uganda.

      [OBJECTIVES]

      AIM 1: Adult men living in the study communities in rural Uganda (N=3,000) will be
      randomized to one of three (fixed, loss aversion, and lottery) incentive approaches and
      different incentive amounts that encourage HIV testing. The hypothesis is that lottery and
      loss aversion incentives will result in significantly higher testing uptake than fixed
      incentives. The investigators also hypothesize that the proportion of testers in each arm
      who are HIV-infected (secondary outcome) will be highest with lottery-based incentives. In
      sub-samples of men who do and do not test, the investigators will conduct in-depth
      interviews to assess perceptions, attitudes and preferences related to incentives that may
      affect how incentives influence testing.

      AIM 2: Adult men and women living in the study communities (N=400) who obtained an
      HIV-positive result at a community health campaign will be randomized into one of two
      incentive approaches that encourage HIV treatment adherence. The investigators hypothesize
      that a financial incentive will be more effective than no incentive in promoting HIV
      virologic suppression (a measure of success in ART adherence and navigation of the HIV
      treatment cascade) as incentives capitalize on present bias by drawing attention to a
      salient, immediate benefit of initiating and/or maintaining treatment, and leverage loss
      aversion by generating implicit loss as a result of delaying the decision to initiate ART.

      AIM 3: The investigators will examine the extent to which incentives in one year (Aim 1)
      affects participation in subsequent testing efforts without incentives. Investigators will
      also assess effects of the Aim 2 intervention on viral suppression 6 months after incentives
      are discontinued, i.e. at 12 months. This will reveal whether incentives increase or
      decrease men's motivation for future HIV testing. Investigators will also calculate the
      incremental cost of incentives per additional person tested and enrolled in care as well as
      the cost per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted. The overall objective is to
      generate evidence on how best to use low-cost incentives to promote HIV testing among adult
      men and maximize the benefits of ART among HIV-infected adults in rural Uganda, and to
      critically evaluate the sustainability of such interventions.

    <intervention_name>Fixed Incentive</intervention_name>
    <description>Men are informed that if they come for HIV testing, they will receive a specific prize (gain framing). The prize will be an item worth the same amount in US dollars as loss aversion and the expected value of a lottery prize. This gain-framed incentive resembles the form that incentives usually take in most studies and serves as a comparison to the lottery-based and loss-framed incentives.</description>

    <intervention_type>Behavioral</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Loss Aversion</intervention_name>
    <description>The prizes are worth approximately the same amount (in US dollars) as the fixed incentive and expected value of a lottery prize. At the time of randomization, study staff will inform the participant that he has won a prize. Staff will ask the participant to choose a specific prize from several choices, and then provide an opportunity for the participant to see the prize. Study staff will then tell participants that they will lose the prize if they do not participate in HIV testing. In this way, the incentive is framed as a loss rather than a gain, thereby leveraging loss aversion while not requiring men in very low-income settings to experience an actual loss.</description>

    <intervention_type>Behavioral</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Lottery</intervention_name>
    <description>Men are entered in a lottery that offers a chance to win high-value prizes after testing for HIV at a community health campaign. Staff will emphasize that only those who come for HIV testing will be entered into the lottery and that not everyone will win a prize. Participants were informed at enrollment about the list of prizes and corresponding probabilities of winning them, in terms that are understandable to men with low numeracy (e.g., &quot;1 in 20&quot; rather than 5%). The probabilities of winning prizes varied between 1-5%, with higher value prizes having lower probability.</description>
