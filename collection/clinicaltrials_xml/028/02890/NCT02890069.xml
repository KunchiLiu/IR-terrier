    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to combine the PDR001 checkpoint inhibitor with several agents
      with immunomodulatory activity to identify the doses and schedule for combination therapy
      and to preliminarily assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacological and clinical activity
      of these combinations.
