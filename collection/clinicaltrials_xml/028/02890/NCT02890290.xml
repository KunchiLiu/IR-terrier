  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a marine protein hydrolysate given as a
      supplement to meals with low protein content can prevent age related loss of muscle mass and
      improve physical function in frail elderly. The study will recruit elderly living at home
      with help from municipal health care services, and a secondary goal of the study is to
      describe food habits, seafood intake and nutritional status in this group of patients.

      The overall objective in this project is to study how nutrition influences frailty and
      physical function in home-dwelling elderly.

      The study will seek to answer the following hypotheses (RCT):

        1. Sarcopenia as measures by SPPB, grip strength, estimated leg muscle volume and gait
           speed is significantly associated with nutritional status and intake of protein in
           frail elderly.

        2. A supplement of 3000mg of marine peptides pr. day in 12 months in the intervention
           group will improve the score on SPPB and other sarcopenia-related outcomes like grip
           strength, estimated leg muscle volume or gait speed compared to the placebo group.

      To supplement the results of the RCT, interviews will be performed with selected
      participants to answer the following question:

      - How do frail elderly describe their own nutritional status and need of help from municipal
      health care service related to nutrition? The data collection will be made in the
      participants' home at baseline and after 6 and 12 months. The patients will complete the
      Short Physical Performance Test (SPPB), Grip Strength measurement and anthropometric
      measurements (weight, height, calf circumference and leg muscle volume estimation using
      skinfold calipers). Assessment of nutritional status will be made by Mini Nutritional
      Assessment (MNA). Seafood intake and protein intake will be assessed by a food frequency
      questionnaire based on previously used and validated questionnaires. Daily energy intake
      will be estimated by a 24-hour multiple pass recall of food intake. Health related quality
      of life will be assessed by the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire (EuroQol). In addition, the
      participants will be asked to take blood tests to be analyzed for vitamin D, nutritional and
      inflammation markers.

      Sample size and statistical power calculation The main outcome of this study is physical
      performance, measured on a 12 point ordinal scale; the SPPB. In accordance to previous
      studies, a clinical meaningful change in score on this scale is 0,4 - 1,5 points. Based on
      mean values and SD from the mentioned study, power was computed with SPSS (IMB) Power Sample
      for t-test of independent samples. The criterion for significance (alpha) has been set at
      0,050 and the test is 2-tailed. With a sample size of 39 in each of the two groups, the
      study will have a power of 80% to yield a statistically significant result. This computation
      assumes a difference between groups of 0.9 points. As the participants are frail and of old
      age, we expect a dropout/missing frequency of 20 %, thus we should have 50 participants in
      each group.

      Statistical analyzes The null hypothesis is that there is no difference between intervention
      and control group, in change of physical performance across multiple test attempts. As the
      SPPB score is a ordinal scale, the investigators will use non-parametric multifactorial
      methods like Friedman`s test to detect differences in treatments across multiple test
      attempts. ANOVA test may be used to assess secondary outcomes with numeric scales, e.g. grip
      strength, muscle volume and gait speed. Pearson or Spearman rank correlation will be used to
      explore the relationship between continuous variables.

      In-depth interviews Interviews will provide a deeper understanding of potential results in
      the RCT. Fifteen to twenty participants will be selected to the interviews by purposeful
      recruitment, based on results from the RCT study. The interviews will be transcribed and
      analyzed using qualitative content analysis.

      Ethical consideration This project was approved by the Regional Committee in Ethics in
      Medical Research in Mid- Norway. The investigators do not anticipate this project causing
      any harm or discomfort to the participants, and will make sure that our participants
      participate in the study voluntarily. Participants will be given both oral and written
      information about the study twice before they give their consent to participate. First, they
      will receive information from their home care nurse, and if they agree to receive a call or
      visit from the researcher, they will have the opportunity to ask questions before signing
      the written consent. Furthermore, they will be informed about the possibility to withdraw
      from the study without any consequences at any time.

      The project will have considerable benefits for this patient group. Increased knowledge of
      the nutritional status and protein intake in the patient group may facilitate nutritional
      interventions to prevent loss of physical function, potentially leading to increased
      independence and delayed need of residential institution. Results from the RCT may be
      transferable to other patient conditions where muscle atrophy is expected, e.g. inactivity
      after injuries, bed rest after surgery, or in intensive care units.
