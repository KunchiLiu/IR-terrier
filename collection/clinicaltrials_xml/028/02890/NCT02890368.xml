  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, phase 1 study that is being done to test intratumoral
      injections of TTI-621 in subjects that have relapsed and refractory percutaneously
      accessible solid tumors or mycosis fungoides.

      The study will be performed in two different parts. Part 1 is the Dose Escalation phase and
      Part 2 is the Dose Expansion phase.

      The purpose of this study is to characterize the safety profile of TTI-621 and to determine
      the optimal dose and delivery schedule of TTI-621.

      This is a multicenter, open-label, phase 1 study that is being done to test intratumoral
      injections of TTI-621 in patients that have relapsed and refractory percutaneously
      accessible solid tumors or mycosis fungoides.

      The study will be performed in two different parts: Dose Escalation and Dose Expansion.

      During the escalation part of the study, TTI-621 will be studied at 3 different dose levels
      and at different dosing frequencies to characterize safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics,
      and to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD).

      During the expansion part of the study, TTI-621 will be studied in an expanded group of
      patients at the dose and frequency which had acceptable level of side effects during the
      escalation part of the study. The expansion phase will further define safety and
      characterize efficacy.

      The purpose of this study is to characterize the safety profile of TTI-621 and to determine
      the optimal dose and delivery schedule of TTI-621.

    <description>TTI-621 (SIRPαFc) is a soluble recombinant fusion protein created by directly linking the sequences encoding the N-terminal CD47 binding domain of human SIRPα with the Fc domain of human immunoglobulin (IgG1). TTI-621 acts by binding human CD47 and preventing it from delivering an inhibitory &quot;do not eat&quot; (antiphagocytic) signal to macrophages.</description>
