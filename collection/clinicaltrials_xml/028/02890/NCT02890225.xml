    <textblock>
      The treatment of renal calculus by retrograde intrarenal surgery(RIRS) isn't able to
      eliminate stone completely,previous studies have proved that the application of External
      Physical Vibration Lithecbole(EPVL) treatment can effectively promote the discharge of renal
      residual stones after RIRS, improve the stone free rate(SFR) .However, when is the the best
      time of performing EPVL , and with the least complication, there is still no
      conclusion.Therefore, researchers purpose to evaluate the effectiveness of EPVL in treatment
      of residual fragments in different time (3 days ,7 days and 14 days) after RIRS by
      prospective study of clinical trial, which will determine the best time for performing EPVL
      treatment.

      To evaluate the efficacy and safety of external physical vibration lithecbole for the
      treatment of residual stone in different time (3 days ,7 days and 14 days) after the
      operation of RIRS，thereby improving stone clearance rate. Investigators will do a
      multi-centers randomized controlled trial(RCT)，and investigators plan to perform this study
      in 7 hospitals，which are the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University of
      China, Department of Urology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University of
      China, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Tongji Hospital,Hubei provincial people's Hospital,the
      People' Hospital of Huzhou，The First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University of
      China.

      Investigators plan to beginning their study August 2016 and end July 2017. three hundred and
      fifty seven patients with postoperative residual stone after RIRS will be enrolled in this
      study. By simple random sampling technique, all the patients will be assigned to the group
      A(EPVL performed in 3 days after RIRS), group B(EPVL performed in 7 days after RIRS),and
      group C(EPVL performed in 14 days after RIRS)，compared three groups of patients with stone
      clearance rate and complications.By this study, investigators hope to determine the best
      time to perform EPVL , improve stone clearance rate after RIRS，and provide better guidance
      for clinical.

      The principle of extracorporeal physical vibration lithecbole:

      A Simple harmonic motion technology in multi-direction was applied. The Lateral acceleration
      was provided by the physical vibration device in the base through the harmonic vibration
      wave in the horizontal direction, which induces the urinary stone separate with the kidney
      or ureter, and expands a moving space for the stone. Meanwhile, an axial effect was produced
      to push the stone by the physical vibration device in the handle through the harmonic
      vibration wave in the multi- direction. Finally, with the help of changing the position and
      direction of the extracorporeally physical vibration machine, the urinary stone was
      discharged from the urinary collecting system.

      Number:

      357cases(119 cases respectively in group A, B, C)

      Grouping methods:

      In this trial, investigators use equilibrium randomization methods that generate random
      numerical code table, according to the table, patients are randomly assigned to different
      groups.

      Evaluating indicator Stone-free rate in 4 weeks after RIRS. Incidence rate of complications
      and adverse reactions after EPVL(fever, hematuria,etc).

      Trial method:Cases selection and grouping: in 2 days after RIRS, the imaging KUB(abdominal
      plain film), patients with radiolucent calculus need to be examined by CT demonstrate the
      presence of residual fragments, and the cases that meeting inclusion criterion are randomly
      assigned to groups, and the ureteral stent should be removed in 4 weeks;

      Laboratory testing: blood routine, urine routine, renal function , coagulation function;
      Strat the treatment of EPVL before the removal of ureteral stent.

      Methods of three groups:

      Group A:EPVL performed in 3 days after RIRS; Group B:EPVL performed in 7 days after RIRS;
      Group C:EPVL performed in 14 days after RIRS; Preparation before EPVL: the amount of fluid
      intake is about 1000-2000ml, start the treatment of EPVL when patient's bladder is filling;

      Record: patients' information; Start the treatment of EPVL;

      Patients should follow the measures below:

      the amount of fluid intake is more than 2000ml/d; increase physical activity; rest in
      position on uninjured side, patients with lower renal calyx calculus need to invert body;
      Whenever follow-up, all patients undergo the treatment of EPVL. At the last time of
      follow-up,patients should undergoing EPVL first,then remove stent,reexamined by KUB.

      Follow up timing: in group A and group B,patients reexamined in 1,2 and 4 weeks after
      RIRS;In group C,patients reexamined in 2 and 4 weeks after RIRS.

      Follow up project Laboratory testing: routine urinalysis; Imaging examination: KUB or kidney
      CT scan (radiolucent calculus) Complications and adverse reactions. Data gathering Fill in
      follow up table data; Radiological images; IVP(intravenous pyelography) or kidney CT scan;
      Reexamined by KUB (radiopaque calculus) or CT (radiolucent calculus).If stones have been
      eliminated completely ,follow-up is over.
