    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the long term effects of E. coli strain Nissle 1917 (EcN-Suspension)
      probiotic bacteria administration on the number of both, bacterial and viral infections
      during the first 24 months of infant's life. Half of study participants will receive
      EcN-Suspension, while the other half will receive placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the course of the present trial the participants will be observed during the first 24
      months of life, starting right after birth.

      All newborns meeting all inclusion criteria and non-fulfiling any exclusion criteria will be
      included into the trial. Each participant of this clinical trial will be randomly allocated
      to one of the two trial arms, by using the method of randomly permuted blocks.

      The newborns will be primarily treated during the first three weeks of life and re-treated
      after 6 and 12 months according to trial interventional plan.

      Data on the efficacy and safety will be recorded during control visits after first month, 6,
      12, 18 and 24 months.
