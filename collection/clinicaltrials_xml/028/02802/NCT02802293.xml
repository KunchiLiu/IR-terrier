  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the clinical effects (if any) of
      connectivity-guided repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in the treatment of
      major depressive disorder (MDD) to provide clues about the ideal neural networks to target
      for more robust clinical outcomes, and to identify potential biomarkers of treatment
      response including changes in brain network connectivity.

      The investigators propose a randomized, double-blind, 4-week trial of rTMS to the left
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) for subjects with MDD all of whom are concurrently
      receiving pharmaceutical and psychotherapeutic interventions. Arm 1 delivers active rTMS to
      the left DLPFC using the standard aiming strategy. Arm 2 delivers active rTMS to the left
      anterior DLPFC using connectivity-based, image-guided aiming. Arm 3 delivers active rTMS to
      the left posterior DLPFC using connectivity-based, image-guided aiming. In all three arms,
      rTMS is administered in an image-guided, robotic manner to ensure therapist blinding and
      equivalent subject experiences across arms. In all three arms, the following stimulation
      protocol will be used: 10 Hz rTMS delivered in 4 sec trains with 26 sec inter-train
      intervals, 37.5 minutes/session (i.e. 3,000 pulses/session), 5 sessions/week, for 4 weeks.
      Neuroimaging will be used both for treatment planning and to characterize any rTMS-induced
      network plasticity using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) at
      week 4 of each treatment arm. Clinical assessments and neuropsychological tests will be
      administered weekly throughout treatment (weeks 1-4).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Males or females with MDD receiving treatment at the Laurel Ridge Treatment Center
             (LRTC) between the ages of 18-65 years.

          2. Meeting the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
             Disorders (DSM-V) criteria for MDD as determined using the Mini-International
             Psychiatric Interview (MINI).

          3. Meeting the Montgomery-Ashberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS&gt;18) criteria for
             treatment resistance in MDD despite completing at least one adequate trial of an
             Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI) or Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake
             Inhibitor (SNRI) at an FDA-recommended dose for at least 6-8 weeks.

          4. Subjects on SSRIs or other antidepressants, hypnotic medications including modulators
             of Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid (GABA)-A receptor function, trazodone, atypical
             neuroleptic or other psychotropic medications such as prazosin may enter the study if
             they are deemed to be on a stable dose of their medication.

          5. Able to provide written informed consent.

          6. Able to read and write English.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects with a diagnostic history of bipolar disorder, schizophrenia or
             schizoaffective disorder or currently exhibiting psychotic features as confirmed by
             MINI.

          2. Serious, active suicidal risk as assessed by evaluating psychiatrist. Serious active
             suicidal risk is determine as imminent risk of suicide reflected in a subject having
             a plan and intent to end his or her life. History of suicidality in itself is not
             exclusion for participation in this protocol so long as the evaluating psychiatrist
             determines that there is an absence of serious active suicidal risk and the means to
             keep subjects safe.

          3. Substance use disorder during the 3 months prior to screening; except for Mild or
             Moderate Alcohol Use Disorder according to DSM-5 V criteria.

          4. Any history or signs of serious medical or neurological illness including seizure
             disorders. Except for seizures, a subject with a clinical abnormality may be included
             only if the study clinician considers the illness will not introduce additional risk
             and will not interfere with the study procedures.

          5. History of traumatic brain injury (TBI) with loss of consciousness for 20 minutes or
             more as determined by the Brief Traumatic Brain Injury Screen (TBI Screening Tool).

          6. Positive urine pregnancy test at screening.

          7. Any history or signs of metal objects (e.g. surgical clips, cardiac pacemakers, metal
             implants, etc.) in the body at the time of screening. MRI can have risks for persons
             with foreign bodies implanted in their body.
