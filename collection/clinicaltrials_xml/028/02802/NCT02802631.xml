  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single and multiple
      ascending dose study of the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of Minocin®
      (minocycline) for injection in healthy adult subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to collect safety, tolerability, and PK data on ascending dose
      regimens of Minocin® (minocycline) for Injection. The safety, tolerability, and PK data will
      support the compound as a potential clinical candidate in Europe and allow recommendations
      of dose levels to be used in future Phase 2/3 studies.

    <description>Minocin (minocycline) for Injection will be supplied as a sterile lyophilized powder in single-use 10-mL glass vials. Each vial contains 108 mg of minocycline hydrochloride equivalent to 100 mg of minocycline. Each cohort receives one of the following dosages of Minocin (minocycline) for Injection: 100 mg, 200 mg, 300 mg, 400 mg, or 500 mg. Within each cohort, subjects will receive a single dose on Day 1, followed by 7 days of multiple-doses (Days 4-10, given every 12 hours), followed by a single dose on Day 11.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. A signed informed consent form, the ability to understand the study conduct and tasks
             that are required for study participation, and a willingness to cooperate with all
             tasks, tests, and examinations as required by the protocol, whether in the research
             unit or after discharge, for the duration of the study;

          3. Subject has a body mass index (BMI) &lt; 45 kg/m2;

          4. Subject is in good health based on medical history and physical examination findings
             and has no clinically meaningful safety laboratory abnormalities (Haematology, blood
             chemistry, and urinalysis) or 12-lead ECG results, as assessed by the Principal
             Investigator (PI);

          5. Vital signs (BP, pulse and temperature) measured at screening/baseline must be within
             the following ranges: SBP ≥90 to ≤150 mm Hg, DBP ≥45 to ≤90 mm Hg; Heart Rate ≥ 45 to
             ≤90 bpm (taken after resting in a supine position for at least 5 minutes);

          6. Expectation that intravenous access will be sufficient to allow for ease of study
             drug infusion, and for all protocol required blood sampling to take place;

          7. Subject commits to remaining admitted in the research unit for the course of the
             study;

          8. Female subject is surgically sterile, postmenopausal, or if of childbearing

             contraceptive patch, intrauterine device, barrier methods, etc.) or male partner
             sterilization alone, between randomization and for 7 days after the completion of the
             study.

             the Screening Visit;

          5. Males who are unwilling to practice abstinence or use an acceptable method of birth
             control during the entire study period (i.e., condom with spermicide, where locally
             available);

          6. Presence of known raised intracranial pressure;

          7. Use of isotretinoin;

          8. History of significant hypersensitivity or allergic reaction to tetracycline
             antibiotics;

          9. Receipt of any investigational medication or investigational device during the last
             30 days prior to randomization;

         10. Treatment with any prescription or OTC drugs, within 2 weeks or five half-lives,
