      EPOgen and Restrictive Transfusions in Patients Undergoing Cardiac Surgery (EPORT)
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigator proposes a study investigating the use of restrictive transfusion triggers
      and administration of single preoperative high dose shot of epoetin alfa (rhEPO) in a young
      (age &lt; 65 years of age) population undergoing cardiac surgery. The investigator believes
      that participants can tolerate a lower Hemoglobin (Hgb). Therefore, the control group will
      benefit from a restrictive transfusion trigger and experimental group will benefit from EPO
      providing a synergistic stimulus for erythropoiesis. This proposed study has potential to
      reduce overall transfusion utilization in cardiac surgery and improve standard of care.
