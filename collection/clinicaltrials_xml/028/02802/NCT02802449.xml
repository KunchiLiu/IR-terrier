      DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF STUDY PROCEDURES Three hundred thirty (330) overweight,
      pre-hypertensive/controlled hypertensive, African-American participants will be enrolled in
      a 8 week study to assess the effect of two administrations of Vitamin D3 on Vitamin D serum
      responsiveness as a function of clinical, biologic and genetic factors. The investigators
      anticipate that at least 300 participants will complete this study.

      Written, signed and dated informed consent to participate in the study will be given by the
      participant or a legally acceptable representative, in accordance with the International
      Conference on Harmonization (ICH) Good Clinical Practice (GCP) Guideline E6 and applicable
      regulations, before completing any study-related activities/procedures. The original signed
      and dated consent will be kept in the subject's research file and a copy given to the
      subject. A copy will also be placed in their medical record.

      Blood Pressure Control Controlled High blood pressure is entry criteria, but not an outcome.
      However, the investigators want to exclude potential participants who are likely to have
      poor BP control during the study. Therefore, although patients with pre-hypertension or
      hypertension are eligible to be entered into the study, the protocol only allows enrollment
      of participants with well-controlled hypertension as defined by SBP≥ 120 mmHg or DBP ≥ 80
      mmHg if not on treatment, and SBP &lt;160 mmHg or DBP &lt; 100 mmHg regardless of whether on
      treatment or not. BP care will be managed by the participants' primary or other provider.
      All participants being actively treated for hypertension with pharmacotherapy will receive
      direction to adhere to their medication and to follow-up with their Primary Care Physician.
      Patients with poorly controlled diabetes as defined by hemoglobin A1c &gt; 8.5% or advanced
      kidney disease as defined by eGFR &lt; 45 ml/min are excluded. After the study is concluded,
      all participants will be encouraged and supported to address issues of diet and exercise
      that may reduce their risk for hypertension. If BP medications need to be adjusted,
      participants will be referred back to their Primary Care Physician.

      Visit 1 SCREENING The screening period will allow for the determination of appropriateness
      of each subject's inclusion in the study. Written informed consent from the subject or their
      legally authorized representative would have been obtained prior to any study-related
      procedures being performed. In addition to sign the general informed consent, subjects who
      agree to participate the sub-study with fat biopsy will sign the second informed consent.

      The subject will be assigned a screening number and will be contacted regarding eligibility
      once all screening procedures have been performed and laboratory results received.

      The following evaluations and assessments will be performed during Screening:

      inclusion/exclusion criteria, medical history (including demographics and concomitant
      medications, including prescription, herbal/vitamins, and all over-the-counter medications),
      vital signs (sitting BP, heart rate), and a mini physical examination (which will include
      height (cm), weight (kg), and waist circumference (cm) from which body mass index (BMI) will
      be calculated and a clinical heart/lung examination. Blood will be drawn (15 cc) for full
      biochemistry panel with glucose (mg/dl), complete blood count, HbA1c (%), calcium (mg/dl),
      phosphorus (mg/dl), albumin (mg/dl), pregnancy test and 25(OH)D (ng/ml) levels. After
      screening information is reviewed and deemed to be appropriate for inclusion in the study,
      eligible subjects will be given an appointment and preparatory instructions for Visit 2
      (Baseline/Randomization/Dose#1) which include not to smoke (if they smoke), eat, or drink
      caffeine for at least 8 hours prior to the Baseline Visit. If participants are taking
      prescribed medications they will be asked to bring them but will be advised to take them as
      prescribed.

      Visit 2 BASELINE/ RANDOMIZATION/ STUDY DRUG DOSE#1 ADMINISTRATION If subject meets all of
      the inclusion/exclusion criteria they will be randomized. The participant will be asked
      about any adverse events and changes in medications, including prescription, herbal/vitamin,
      and over-the-counter medications. Vital signs (sitting BP, heart rate) will be obtained and
      a nutritional survey administered. Blood will be drawn (45 cc) for serum calcium (mg/dl),
      phosphorus (mg/dl), albumin (mg/dl), iPTH (pg/ml) and 1-84 PTH/7-84 PTH ratio, pregnancy
      test, 25(OH)D (ng/ml) levels; and samples stored for bio-markers (e.g.
      pro-inflammatory/pro-thrombotic/fibrotic, insulin sensitivity, and vitamin D receptor
      polymorphisms). Spot urine sample (30cc) will be collected for calcium/creatinine and
      albumin/creatinine ratios as well as sodium and isoprostanes. The fat biopsy will be
      performed on those that agree to be part of the subgroup. Participants undergoing the fat
      biopsy will be given post biopsy instructions including a return appointment in 7-10 days.

      Visit will last about 30-60 minutes for most participants. At the end of the visit,
      participant will be randomized then either given two 50,000 IU tablets of oral Vitamin D3
      [also known as cholecalciferol or 25 hydroxy-Vitamin D3 or 25 (OH) D3] or two tablets of
      Placebo (microcrystalline cellulose) to take under direct observation. All the participants
      will be given an appointment and preparatory instructions for Study Visit 3. They will be
      also given an introduction of avoiding any other vitamin D supplements during study period.

      Visit 3 STUDY DRUG DOSE#2 ADMINISTRATION (2 weeks after baseline) Visit will last about 15
      minutes for most participants. Participant will be asked about any adverse events and
      changes in medications, including prescription, herbal, and over-the-counter medications.
      Vital signs will be obtained. Participant will be given their second dose of either two
      50,000 IU tablets of oral Vitamin D3 or two tablets of Placebo to take under direct
      observation. All the participants will be given an appointment and preparatory instructions
      for Study Visit 4 (Week 6).

      Visit 4 (Week 6) During this visit participant will be asked about any adverse events
      including possible symptoms of vitamin D overdose and changes in medications, including
      prescription, herbal, and over-the-counter medications. In addition, the following
      evaluations and assessments will also be performed: vital signs (sitting BP, heart rate).
      Blood will be drawn (3 tablespoon or 45 cc) for full biochemistry panel, with glucose
      (mg/dl), HbA1c (%), complete blood count, calcium (mg/dl), phosphorus (mg/dl), albumin
      (mg/dl), iPTH (pg/ml) and 1-84 PTH/7-84 PTH ratio, and 25(OH)D (ng/ml) levels; and stored
      samples for bio markers (e.g. pro-inflammatory/pro- thrombotic/fibrotic, insulin
      sensitivity, and vitamin D receptor polymorphisms). Spot urine sample will be collected for
      calcium/creatinine and albumin/creatinine ratios as well as sodium and isoprostanes. Urine
      pregnancy test will also be done. Participants undergoing the fat biopsy will be given post
      biopsy instructions and will have an additional 7-10 days of follow-up.

      Visit 5 End of Study (Week 8) At the End of Study visit (EOS), participant will be asked
      about any adverse events including possible symptoms of vitamin D overdoes. In addition, the
      following evaluations and assessments will also be performed: vital signs which include
      sitting BP and heart rate. The results of the lab from the previous visit will be discussed
      and if there are any abnormal lab values, participant will be referred to primary care
      physician for further management.

    <measure>Plasma PTH Level</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Building upon our hypothesis above, this aim exploits the fact that the nuclear Vit-D Receptor (VDR) regulates parathyroid hormone (PTH) gene transcription. Therefore the plasma PTH level serves as a sensitive biomarker of the Vit-D nutri-genomic response. This aim will define the multivariate determinants (covariates such as age, BMI, baseline Vit-D level and dietary calcium) of the Vit-D-PTH level relationship (the primary outcome variable) in African-Americans. It is anticipated that the Vit-D supplementation trial will document a wide variance of Vit-D-PTH level relationships that will identify patients at the upper and lower quartiles of the distribution that are either 'nutrient-responsive' or 'nutrient-resistant'. These studies should help identify the 'clinical' characteristics of the sub-set of African-Americans that exhibit the poorest response to Vit-D supplementation.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Biomarkers of Inflammation: C-reactive protein, IL-6 and Adiponectin</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This aim will focus on defining the molecular determinants of the Vit-D response of immune cells of African-Americans. Recent studies have documented that the VDR and other elements of Vit-D metabolism are expressed in a wide spectrum of tissues. Moreover, Vit-D has pleiotropic effects on a variety of cellular pathways that extend beyond PTH-calcium metabolism. Specifically, it has been shown that immune cells are capable of metabolizing Vit-D. Furthermore, Vit-D has been shown to exert a potent anti-inflammatory influence on leukocyte biology. The tissue-level response to Vit-D supplementation in African-Americans remains poorly defined. In accordance with the parent grant, the supplementary study will also test the working hypothesis by examining the effect of Vit-D supplementation on circulating biomarkers of inflammation (i.e. C-reactive protein, IL-6, and Adiponectin) as well as gene expression</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Vitamin D Receptor Polymorphism</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This study will extend the outcome 2 by conducting an in-depth genomic analysis of immune cells derived from the 'extreme phenotypes' of 'nutrient-resistant' vs 'nutrient-sensitive' African-Americans treated with Vit-D supplementation. Our working model predicts that immune cells derived from our sample of overweight African-Americans will exhibit a 'pro-inflammatory' state at the pre-treatment baseline. This sub-aim will test the hypothesis that immune cells derived from individuals with the 'nutrient-resistant' phenotype will exhibit a 'pro-inflammatory' gene expression profile that persists despite Vit-D supplementation compared to immune cells from 'nutrient-sensitive' individuals.</description>
