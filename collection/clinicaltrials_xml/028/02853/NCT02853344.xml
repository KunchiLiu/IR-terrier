      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of monotherapy pembrolizumab
      (MK-3475) in participants with renal cell carcinoma (RCC). There will be two cohorts in this
      study: Cohort A will consist of participants with clear cell (cc) RCC and Cohort B will
      consist of participants with non-clear cell (ncc) RCC.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Cohort A (clear cell RCC cohort) participant must have histologically confirmed
             diagnosis of clear cell RCC or RCC with clear cell component (with or without
             sarcomatoid features).

          -  Cohort B (non-clear cell RCC cohort) participant must have histologically confirmed
             diagnosis of non-clear cell RCC (with or without sarcomatoid features). Participants
             with tumors that have a component of clear cell histology are not eligible for
             inclusion in Cohort B.

          -  Has locally advanced/metastatic disease, i.e., Stage IV RCC per American Joint
             Committee on Cancer (AJCC) or have recurrent disease.

          -  Has measurable disease per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by BICR.

          -  Has received no prior systemic therapy for advanced RCC.

          -  Must provide adequate tissue for biomarker analysis for Cohorts A and B from an
             archival tissue sample or newly obtained core or excisional biopsy of a tumor lesion
             not previously irradiated.

          -  Participants receiving bone resorptive therapy (including but not limited to
             bisphosphonate or RANK-L inhibitor) must have been on stable doses for ≥4 weeks prior
             to treatment allocation.

          -  Has Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) ≥70%, as assessed within 10 days prior to
             treatment allocation.

          -  Demonstrates adequate organ function.

          -  Female participants of childbearing potential must be willing to use an adequate
             method of contraception for the course of the study through 120 days after the last
             dose of study drug.

          -  Male participants of childbearing potential must agree to use an adequate method of
             contraception starting with the first dose of study drug through 120 days after the
             last dose of study drug.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Is currently participating in or has participated in a study of an investigational
             agent or using an investigational device within 4 weeks prior to allocation, has had
             major surgery within 4 weeks prior to allocation or radiation therapy within 2 weeks
             prior to allocation, or who has not recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or to Baseline) from
             AEs due to prior treatment.

          -  Had prior treatment with any anti-programmed cell death 1 (anti-PD-1), or
             anti-programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1), or PD-L2 agent or an antibody targeting
             any other immune-regulatory receptors or mechanisms. Examples of such antibodies
             include antibodies against indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), PD-L1, interleukin 2
             receptors (IL-2R), glucocorticoid-induced tumor necrosis factor receptor-related
             protein (GITR).

          -  Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving systemic steroid therapy or any
             other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of
             study treatment, except in the case of central nervous system (CNS) metastases (see
             below).

          -  Has an active autoimmune disease requiring systemic treatment within the past 3
             months or a documented history of clinically severe autoimmune disease, or a syndrome
             that requires systemic or immunosuppressive agents.

          -  Has a known additional malignancy that has had progression or has required active
             treatment in the last 3 years. Note: Participants with basal cell carcinoma of the
             skin, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin that has undergone potentially curative
             therapy or carcinoma in situ are not excluded.

          -  Has known active CNS metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis.

          -  Has a history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids or current
             pneumonitis.

          -  Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy.

          -  Has a known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection.

          -  Has known active Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C.

          -  Has received a live virus vaccine within 30 days of treatment allocation.

          -  Has had a prior solid organ transplant.

          -  Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the
             projected duration of the study, starting with the screening visit through 120 days
