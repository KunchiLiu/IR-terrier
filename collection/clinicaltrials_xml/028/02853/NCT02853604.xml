  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High-risk locally advanced carcinoma of the cervix (HRLACC) following concurrent
      chemotherapy and radiation therapy. This is a group of patients with a significant unmet
      need. The estimated probability of disease recurrence or death within 4 years of diagnosis
      is 50% and the prognosis is very grave for those who experience a recurrence.

      The purpose of the study is to compare the disease free survival (DFS) of ADXS11-001 to
      placebo administered following CCRT with curative intent in subjects with HRLACC.

      This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized study of ADXS11 001 administered in
      the adjuvant setting after completion of cisplatin-based CCRT in subjects with locally
      advanced cervical cancer at higher risk for recurrence (HRLACC), or death. All eligible
      subjects will have received CCRT administered with curative intent according to
      institutional/national guidelines as well as meeting the minimum standards defined in the
      protocol. Subjects must initiate the Screening period within 10 weeks after the completion
      of CCRT. Baseline radiographic assessments and clinical laboratory assessments must be
      completed no longer than 28 days prior to and 3 days prior to the first study treatment
      infusion, respectively. Eligible subjects will be randomized 1:2 to receive either placebo
      or ADXS11-001. Subjects will receive 1 infusion of study treatment administered every 3
      weeks for 3 doses for the first 3 months. Thereafter, subjects will receive study treatment
      every 8 weeks for a total of 5 doses or until disease recurrence. Subjects will receive a
      7-day course of an oral antibiotic or placebo starting 72 hours following the completion of
      study treatment administration.

      An interim analysis will be performed when there is at least one-half the number of DFS
      events required for full maturity of the study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must have a biopsy confirmed diagnosis of squamous cell, adenocarcinoma, or
             adenosquamous carcinoma of the cervix. Histologic confirmation of the original
             primary tumor is required.

          -  Subjects must have received definitive therapy with curative intent, which consist of
             at least 4 weeks of treatment with cisplatin and a minimum of 40Gy external beam
             radiation therapy (EBRT).

          -  Have performance status of 0 or 1 on the GOG performance scale

          -  Demonstrate adequate organ function

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Has not achieved disease-free status after completion of CCRT administered with
             curative intent.

          -  Has FIGO Stage IVB

          -  Has histologies other than squamous cell, adenocarcinoma, or adenosquamous carcinoma
             of the cervix.

          -  Has implanted medical device(s) that pose a high risk for colonization and/or cannot
             be easily removed (e.g., prosthetic joints, artificial heart valves, pacemakers,
             orthopedic screw(s), metal plate(s), bone graft(s), or other exogenous implant(s)).

          -  Has a contraindication (sensitivity or allergy) to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and
             ampicillin.

          -  Has undergone a previous hysterectomy defined as removal of the entire uterus or will
             have a hysterectomy as part of their initial cervical cancer therapy. NOTE: Women who
             have had a partial/subtotal hysterectomy are eligible to participate in the study
