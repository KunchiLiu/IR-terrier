  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is a minimally invasive procedure for older
      adults with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis who are considered high risk for surgical
      aortic valve replacement. Despite symptomatic and survival benefits, many patients
      experience functional decline after TAVR. This pilot study aims to test the feasibility of a
      home-based exercise intervention targeting endurance, strength, and balance as well as
      cognitive behavioral intervention to improve physical functioning and disability after TAVR.

    <description>A study physical therapist will make home visits, beginning within 1 week of discharge, to deliver an individualized exercise program that focuses on mobility, endurance, lower body strength, and balance in their home environment. In addition to exercise, cognitive behavioral interventions will be implemented to improve self-efficacy, self-control, and outcome expectation.</description>

    <intervention_name>Home-based exercise program</intervention_name>
    <description>Exercises will target balance, flexibility, strength, and endurance (source: https://go4life.nia.nih.gov/). Home visits will take place twice a week for week 1 and 2; once a week for week 3 and 4; every other week for week for week 5 through week 8. Participants are instructed to do prescribed exercises for 30-45 minutes daily. The following cognitive-behavioral strategies will be employed: 1) enhance positive beliefs about exercise through discussion of benefits of exercise; 2) discussion of barriers to exercise; 3) individualized goal setting and self-monitoring progress using exercise calendar; 4) develop a detailed exercise plan on how, what, when, and where to conduct exercise; 5) $10 rewards for achieving 70% compliance for each week (5 of 7 days).</description>

    <description>A health care professional will call the participant weekly for a period of 8 weeks to teach general tips about exercise and diet (source: https://go4life.nia.nih.gov/). No recommendations for a specific exercise program will be made, except for walking 30 minutes daily or as tolerated. Each telephone session will last approximately 20 minutes and will cover one of the following 8 topics (4 exercise tips alternating with 4 healthy eating tips).</description>
