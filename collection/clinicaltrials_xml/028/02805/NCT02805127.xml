      This is a feasibility observational study which aims to evaluate the possibility of using
      data from a capnography device to assess obstructive airway severity in both COPD and Asthma
      patients. The study will include adults asthma and COPD patients (age &gt;18) that arrive at
      the Emergency Department (ED). Patients will be enrolled on a continuous basis and will be
      monitored by a capnograph and an oximeter before, during and after lung function assessment
      and medical treatment.
