      Introduction: There are many cross-sectional studies in children and adults indicating that
      low vitamin D levels in asthmatic patients are correlated with poorer asthma control, poorer
      lung function, decreased response to glucocorticoids and more frequent exacerbations.
      Moreover, as there is a significant group of asthmatic patients having insufficient control
      of their disease, despite high doses of inhaled corticosteroids, we have investigated new
      treatment alternatives, which include vitamin

      Objective: To determine the efficacy of vitamin D supplementation in asthmatic patients with
      vitamin D deficiency in degree of asthma control.

      Materials and methods: A prospective, controlled, randomised, triple-blind study was
      conducted with a follow-up of 6 months. The patients recruited were over 18 years of age
      with a medical diagnosis of bronchial asthma and serum 25(OH)D3 levels &lt; 30 ng/ml. Patients
      were excluded if they had a smoking habit ≥ 10 pack-years, taking vitamin D supplements,
      kidney disease (creat. &gt; 2 mg/dl), hypercalcaemia (corrected with proteins &gt; 10.5 mg/dl), a
      repeat episodes of renal colic, any gastrointestinal disease that might interfere with
      vitamin D absorption, or severe psychosocial problems, or were pregnant or breast-feeding.
      The randomisation process assigned patients to one of two groups: a group that received
      vitamin D (in the form of calcifediol (Hidroferol®) in 16,000-IU ampoules taken weekly by
      the oral route) and another group that received placebo in a presentation with an identical
      appearance and the same administration regimen. Demographic, clinical, spirometry and
      laboratory endpoints were collected. The primary endpoint was degree of asthma control as
      determined by the internationally validated Asthma Control Test (ACT). The secondary
      endpoints were asthma exacerbations, dose of inhaled corticosteroids and quality of life as
      measured using the Mini-AQLQ (Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire).
