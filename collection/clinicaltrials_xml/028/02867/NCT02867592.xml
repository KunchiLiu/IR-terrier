  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well cabozantinib-s-malate works in treating younger
      patients with sarcomas, Wilms tumor, or other rare tumors that have come back, do not
      respond to therapy, or are newly diagnosed. Cabozantinib-s-malate may stop the growth of
      tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for tumor growth and tumor blood vessel
      growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the objective response rate (complete response + partial response) of
      cabozantinib-s-malate (XL184) in children and young adults.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To further define XL184 related toxicities in pediatric, adolescent and young adult
      patients.

      II. To further define XL184 pharmacokinetics in the pediatric and adolescent patients.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate 1-year time to progression, progression free survival (PFS) and overall
      survival for each stratum, and if feasible to compare to historical controls.

      II. To assess the effect of XL184 on patients' immune cell subsets. III. To obtain tumor
      tissue (snap frozen, formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded [FFPE] blocks, or unstained
      slides) from diagnosis, recurrence, or both, for possible future studies.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive cabozantinib-s-malate orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Courses
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, every 6 months for
      1 year and then annually for up to 5 years.

          -  Patients who in the opinion of the investigator may not be able to comply with the
             safety monitoring requirements of the study are not eligible

          -  Patients with active bleeding are not eligible; specifically, no clinically
             significant gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, GI perforation, intra-abdominal abscess
             or fistula for 6 months prior to enrollment, no hemoptysis or other signs of
             pulmonary hemorrhage for 3 months prior to enrollment; patients with evidence of an
             acute intracranial or intratumoral hemorrhage on CT or MRI are not eligible (patients
             with evidence of resolving hemorrhage will be eligible); in patients with CNS tumors,
             an MRI with ECHO gradient sequences would be required to exclude presence of
             petechial hemorrhages

          -  Patients who have had or are planning to have the following invasive procedures are
             not eligible:

               -  Major surgical procedure, laparoscopic procedure, or open biopsy within 28 days
                  prior to enrollment

               -  Central line placement or subcutaneous port placement is not considered major
                  surgery but must be placed at least 3 days prior to enrollment for external
                  lines (e.g., Hickman or Broviac catheter, peripherally inserted central catheter
                  [PICC]) and at least 7 days prior to enrollment for a subcutaneous port

               -  Core biopsy within 7 days prior to enrollment

               -  Fine needle aspirate within 7 days prior to enrollment

               -  Surgical or other wounds must be adequately healed prior to enrollment

               -  NOTE: For purposes of this study, bone marrow aspirate and biopsy are not
                  considered surgical procedures and therefore are permitted within 14 days prior
                  to start of protocol therapy

          -  Patients who have had significant traumatic injury within 28 days prior to enrollment
             are not eligible

          -  Patients with any medical or surgical conditions that would interfere with
             gastrointestinal absorption of the study drug are not eligible
