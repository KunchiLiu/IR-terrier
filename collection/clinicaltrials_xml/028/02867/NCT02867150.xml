    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether red light therapy using LED 635nm red
      light for body contouring of the waist, hips and thighs is as effective as red light therapy
      using Laser 635nm red light.

    <textblock>
      Red light laser therapy using 635nm red light laser technology has previously been shown to
      cause lipolysis in subcutaneous fat as a non-surgical method to promote weight loss and body
      contouring. This study hypothesizes that red LED light therapy using 635nm red light LED
      (light emitting diode) technology produces similar results to the laser device (red LASER
      635nm) when performed using a specified treatment protocol.

      Furthermore, it is hypothesized that the UltraSlim Cold Light therapy program achieves the
      results after a single 32-minute treatment. The predicate 635nm laser device (Zerona by
      Erchonia) achieves its results after six treatments combined with a diet and exercise
      regimen.

      UltraSlim Cold Light® is a patented process using the Photonica Professional device for fat
      removal using LED red light therapy. This multi-site study reviews results from 58 randomly
      selected patients after a single treatment using the Photonica Professional device (i.e.
      UltraSlim Cold Light®).
