    <textblock>
      This is an open label, phase I/II, dose-escalation study in the initial phase I followed by
      a phase II.

      The primary objective of the phase I is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and
      dose limiting toxicity (DLT) of the combinations of TGR-1202 and carfilzomib in participants
      with relapsed and refractory (R/R) non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). The
      safety and toxicity of this combination will be evaluated throughout the entire study.

      If the combination of TGR-1202 and carfilzomib is found to be feasible and an MTD is
      established, the phase II part of the study will be initiated.

      Phase II will consist of a 2-stage design of the combination of TGR-1202 and carfilzomib for
      participants with R/R NHL.

      Dysregulated c-Myc is associated with resistance to chemotherapy and poor survival in
      aggressive lymphomas. Novel strategies that target this biology could markedly improve the
      outcome of these participants. To date no drugs that directly target Myc have been approved
      for cancer treatment. Recent results by Deng et al. (Blood. 2017 Jan 5. PMID: 27784673)
      described a highly synergistic regimen discovered in preclinical models, through combining
      TGR-1202, an investigational drug that inhibits PI3K delta, and carfilzomib, a drug approved
      by the FDA for multiple myeloma. Importantly, the combination of TGR-1202 and carfilzomib
      acts by potently silencing the translation of c-Myc and inducing apoptosis in many cell
      lines and primary lymphoma cells representing broad histological subtypes of lymphoma. These
      results suggest that TGR-1202 and carfilzomib may be highly effective in relapsed and
      refractory lymphoma where c-Myc plays a key pathological role.
