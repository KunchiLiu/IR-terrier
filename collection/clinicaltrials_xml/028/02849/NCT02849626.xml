      This is an open-label, multicenter study with an extension phase to evaluate the safety and
      tolerability of an perampanel oral suspension when administered as an adjunctive therapy in
      children (ages 4 to &lt;12 years) with inadequately controlled partial onset seizures (POS) or
      primary generalized tonic clonic seizures (PGTC).

      This is a multicenter, open-label, single-arm study in children (ages 4 to less than 12
      years) with inadequately controlled POS or PGTC. The study will consist of a Core Study and
      Extension Phase. The Core Study will consist of the following 2 phases: Pretreatment and
      Treatment Phase. The Pretreatment Phase, during which participants will be assessed for
      eligibility, will consist of a 4-week Screening/Baseline Period. The Treatment Phase will
      consist of 3 periods: up to 11-week Titration Period (dose titration on the basis of
      individual clinical response and tolerability), 12-week Maintenance Period (continuation of
      perampanel oral suspension once daily at the dose level achieved at the end of the Titration
      Period), and 4-week Follow-up Period (only for those participants not rolling over into the
      Extension Phase). The Extension Phase will consist of a 29-week Maintenance Period and a
      4-week Follow-up Period. All participants who complete all scheduled visits up to and
      including Visit 9 in the Treatment Phase will be eligible to participate in the Extension
      Phase of the study. During the Maintenance Period of the Extension Phase, all participants
      will continue with their optimal perampanel dose (i.e., dose level that they completed on
      during the Core Study). Participants who do not continue in the Extension Phase or those who
      prematurely discontinue from the study will enter a 4-week Follow-up Period.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have a diagnosis of epilepsy with partial-onset seizures (POS) with or without
             secondarily generalized seizures or primary generalized tonic-clonic (PGTC) seizures
             according to the International League Against Epilepsy's (ILAE) Classification of
             Epileptic Seizures (1981). A diagnosis should have been established at least 6 months
             prior to Visit 1 by clinical history and an electroencephalogram (EEG) that is
             consistent with the diagnosis; normal interictal EEGs will be allowed provided that
             the participant meets the other diagnosis criterion (i.e., clinical history)

          -  Male or female participant, from age 4 to less than 12 years at the time of informed
             consent/assent

          -  Have a minimum weight of 16 kilograms (kg) (35 pounds [lb])

          -  Have had a brain imaging (e.g., magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] scan or computed
             tomography (CT)) before Visit 1 that ruled out a progressive cause of epilepsy

          -  During the 4 weeks before Visit 2, participants must have had equal or greater than
             one POS or one PGTC seizure. Only a simple POS with motor signs, a complex POS, and
             complex POS with secondary generalization are counted toward this inclusion for POS.

          -  Are currently being treated with stable doses of one to a maximum of two approved
             antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Doses must be stable for at least 4 weeks before Visit 1;
             in the case in which a new AED regimen has been initiated for a participant, the dose
             must be stable for at least 8 weeks before Visit 1. Only one enzyme-inducing AED
             (EIAED) (defined as carbamazepine, phenytoin, oxcarbazepine, or eslicarbazepine) out
             of the maximum of two AEDs is allowed (a vagal nerve stimulator (VNS) will be counted
             as one of the two allowed AEDs).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Females who are breastfeeding or pregnant at Screening or Baseline (as documented by
             a positive beta human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) (or human chorionic gonadotropin
             (hCG)) test with a minimum sensitivity of 25 International Units per liter (IU/L) or
             equivalent units of β-hCG or hCG). A separate baseline assessment is required if a
             negative screening pregnancy test was obtained more than 72 hours before the first
             dose of study drug.

          -  Females of childbearing potential who:

               -  Had unprotected sexual intercourse within 30 days before study entry and who do
                  not agree to use a highly effective method of contraception (e.g., total
                  abstinence, an intrauterine device, a contraceptive implant, an oral
                  contraceptive, or have a vasectomized partner with confirmed azoospermia)
                  throughout the entire study period or for 28 days after study drug
                  discontinuation. If a highly effective method is not appropriate or acceptable
                  for the participant, then the participant may use a medically effective method
                  (e.g., a double barrier method such as condom plus diaphragm with spermicide).

               -  Are currently abstinent, and do not agree to use a double-barrier method (as
                  described above) or refrain from being sexually active during the study period
                  or for 28 days after study drug discontinuation.

               -  Are using hormonal contraceptives but are not on a stable dose of the same
                  hormonal contraceptive product for at least 4 weeks before dosing and who do not
                  agree to use the same contraceptive during the study or for 28 days after study
                  drug discontinuation.

          -  Current or history of pseudo-seizures (psychogenic nonepileptic seizures) within
             approximately 5 years before Visit 1.

          -  Have a history of status epilepticus that required hospitalization during the 6
             months before Visit 1.

          -  Have an unstable psychiatric diagnosis that may confound participants' ability to
             participate in the study or that may prevent completion of the protocol-specified
             tests (e.g., significant suicide risk, including suicidal behavior and ideation
             within 6 months before Visit 1, current psychotic disorder, acute mania).

          -  Any suicidal ideation with intent with or without a plan within 6 months before Visit
             2 (i.e., answering &quot;Yes&quot; to questions 4 or 5 on the Suicidal Ideation section of the
             Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS)) in participants aged 6 and above.

          -  Are scheduled and/or confirmed to have epilepsy surgery within 6 months after Visit
             1; however, those who have previously documented &quot;failed&quot; epilepsy surgery will be
             allowed.

          -  Evidence of clinically significant disease (e.g., cardiac, respiratory,
             gastrointestinal, renal disease) that in the opinion of the investigator(s) could
             affect the participant's safety or interfere with the study assessments.

          -  Severe renal insufficiency

          -  Evidence of significant active hepatic disease. Stable elevation of liver enzymes,
             alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) due to
             concomitant medication(s), will be allowed if they are less than 3 times the upper
             limit of normal (ULN).

          -  Evidence of significant active hematological disease; white blood cell (WBC) count
             equal or less than 2500/µL (2.50 1E 09/liter [L]) or an absolute neutrophil count
             equal or less than 1000/µL (1.00 1E 09/L).

          -  Clinically significant electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormality, including prolonged
             corrected QT interval (QTc) defined as greater than 450 milliseconds (msec).

             dermatological (e.g., Stevens Johnson syndrome), hematological, or organ toxicity
             reactions.

          -  Concomitant use of felbamate as an AED for less than 2 years or where the dose has
             not been stable for at least 8 weeks before Visit 1. Participants must not have a

             function tests (LFTs) above 3 times the ULN, or other indication of hepatic or bone
             marrow dysfunction while receiving felbamate. If participants received felbamate in
             the past, it must have been discontinued 8 weeks before Visit 1 to be eligible for
             study participation.

          -  Concomitant use of vigabatrin: participants who took vigabatrin in the past must be
             off vigabatrin for at least 5 months before Visit 1 and with documentation showing no
             evidence of a vigabatrin-associated clinically significant abnormality in a visual
             perimetry test.

             1.

          -  Used benzodiazepines (other than intermittent rescue use) for epilepsy (or for
             anxiety or sleep disorders) and for which the dose has not been stable for equal or
             greater than 4 weeks before Visit 1.

          -  A VNS implanted less than 5 months before Visit 1 or changes in parameter less than 4
             weeks before Visit 1 (or thereafter during the study)

          -  On a ketogenic diet for which the diet is not a stable regimen for at least 4 weeks
             before Visit 1.

          -  History of or a concomitant medical condition that in the opinion of the
             investigator(s) would preclude the participant's participation in a clinical study or
             compromise the participant's ability to safely complete the study.

          -  Have previously been exposed to perampanel in a clinical trial or by prescription for
             more than 2 months or discontinued for Adverse Events (AEs).

          -  Have participated in a study involving the administration of an investigational drug
             or device within 4 weeks before Visit 1, or within approximately five half-lives of
