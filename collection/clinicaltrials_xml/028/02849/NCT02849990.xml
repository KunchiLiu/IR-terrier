    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well androgen receptor antagonist ARN-509, abiraterone
      acetate, prednisone, degarelix, and indomethacin work in treating patients with prostate
      cancer that has spread from where it started to nearby tissue or lymph nodes before surgery.
      Androgen can cause the growth of tumor cells. Hormone therapy using androgen receptor
      antagonist ARN-509, abiraterone acetate, prednisone, degarelix, and indomethacin may fight
      prostate cancer by lowering the amount of androgen the body makes and/or blocking the use of
      androgen by the tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. The rate of the pathologic complete response (pCR) (i.e. no evidence of residual tumor)
      as assessed on prostatectomy specimens following 3-months (12 weeks) of neoadjuvant androgen
      receptor antagonist ARN-509 (ARN-509), abiraterone acetate, degarelix and indomethacin.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the negative margin rate as assessed on prostatectomy specimens following
      3-months (12 weeks) of neoadjuvant ARN-509, abiraterone acetate, degarelix and indomethacin.

      II. To determine the rate of near pCR (i.e. =&lt; 5 mm of residual tumor) as assessed on
      prostatectomy specimens following 3-months (12 weeks) of neoadjuvant ARN-509, abiraterone
      acetate, degarelix and indomethacin.

      III. To determine the rate of pathologic T3 disease as assessed on prostatectomy specimens
      following 3-months (12 weeks) of neoadjuvant ARN-509, abiraterone acetate, degarelix and
      indomethacin.

      IV. To determine the rate of nodal metastases as assessed on surgical lymph node specimens
      following 3-months (12 weeks) of neoadjuvant ARN-509, abiraterone acetate, degarelix and
      indomethacin.

      V. To determine the apoptotic index (i.e. percentage of tumor cells undergoing apoptosis) as
      determined by cleaved caspase-3 immunohistochemistry following 3-months (12 weeks) of
      neoadjuvant ARN-509, abiraterone acetate, degarelix and indomethacin.

      VI. To determine the proportion of men who receive adjuvant radiation therapy within 1-year
      of prostatectomy.

      VII. To determine the biochemical (i.e. prostate-specific antigen [PSA]) progression free
      survival estimate two years after the last patient has accrued (i.e. confirmed PSA
      post-radical prostatectomy &gt;= 0.2 ng/mL).

      VIII. To determine the overall survival estimate two years after the last patient has
      accrued.

      IX. Safety as assessed by the incidence and severity of adverse events and serious adverse
      events graded according to the National Cancer Institute - Common Terminology Criteria for
      Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0.

      X. Exploratory biomarker assessment.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive androgen receptor antagonist ARN-509 and abiraterone acetate orally (PO)
      daily, prednisone PO twice per day (BID) and indomethacin PO three times per day (TID).
      Patients also receive degarelix subcutaneously (SC) on day 1 and every 4 weeks for 3 doses.
      Treatment continues for up to 12 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients undergo prostatectomy on day 85.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 28, 113, 450 and 815 days.
