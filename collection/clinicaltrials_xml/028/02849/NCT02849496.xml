    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well veliparib and atezolizumab work either alone
      or in combination in treating patients with stage III-IV triple negative breast cancer.
      Veliparib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell
      growth. Monoclonal antibodies, such as atezolizumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor
      cells to grow and spread. It is not known whether giving veliparib and atezolizumab either
      alone or in combination would work better in patients with triple negative breast cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the progression free survival (PFS) of veliparib in combination with
      atezolizumab (MPDL3280A) in advanced triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) harboring
      homologous deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) repair (HDR) through breast cancer gene (BRCA) 1/2
      mutation.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the overall response rate (ORR) of veliparib (ABT-888) in combination with
      MPDL3280A in advanced TNBC harboring HDR through BRCA 1/2 mutation.

      II. Determine the duration of response (DoR) of ABT-888 in combination with MPDL3280A in
      advanced TNBC harboring HDR through BRCA 1/2 mutation.

      III. Determine the changes in extent of mutational burden in BRCA 1/2 mutated tumors at
      baseline and at progression.

      IV. Evaluate and characterize changes in the extent of programmed cell death ligand-1
      (PD-L1) expression and tumor immune infiltrates.

      V. Retrospectively evaluate tumors with limited immune infiltrate (e.g. &quot;non-inflamed&quot;) to
      determine if poly (adenosine diphosphate) ribose polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) increased
      immune infiltration.

      VI. Determine the immune-related best overall response (irBOR) of ABT-888 in combination
      with MPDL3280A in advanced TNBC harboring HDR through BRCA 1/2 mutation.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate changes in candidate neoantigen profiles and immune/inflammation signatures
      using DNA and ribonucleic acid (RNA)-sequencing in serial tumor biopsies.

      II. Evaluate and characterize immune parameters in peripheral blood/ peripheral blood
      mononuclear cell (PBMCs).

      III. Test the hypothesis that DNA repair status affects the tumor-immune interaction.

      IV. Characterize mechanism of action of the PARP inhibitor ABT-888 (veliparib).

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive veliparib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-21. Courses repeat
      every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive atezolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30-60 minutes on day 1.
      Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM III: Patients receive veliparib PO BID on days 1-21 and atezolizumab IV over 30-60
      minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for at least 4 weeks.
