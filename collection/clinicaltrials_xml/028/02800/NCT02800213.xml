      Investigators compared tidal volumes for single rescuer ventilation using a modified bag
      valve mask with a supplemental external handle versus a conventional bag valve mask in a
      manikin model.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a prospective, randomized, crossover study to assess the tidal volume delivered
      using a standard and modified bag valve mask (BVM) device in a manikin airway model. The
      modified device comprised a standard bag valve mask with supplemental external bar. Data was
      collected during May 2016 at the San Antonio Military Medical Center. Emergency medicine
      providers (physicians, physician assistants, residents, nurses, medics) were randomized to
      device order. Prior to participation each participant filled out a survey indicating their
      job status, gender, years of medical experience, and experience level with BVM ventilation.
      Hand grip strength and size (length, width, span) were measured. Each participant was then
      asked to provide BVM ventilation using the assigned devices at a rate of 10 breaths per
      minute for 3 minutes for a total of 30 breaths. Tidal volume of each delivered breath was
      recorded in milliliters. After a 3 minute rest period, testing was repeated with the second
      device. After ventilation with each device, participants completed an anonymous
      questionnaire that used a Likert scale to assess perceived qualities of the modified device
      including ease of use, ability to provide a superior mask seal, willingness to use in an
      emergency situation, and overall preference between the two devices. Each participant served
      as his/her own control.
