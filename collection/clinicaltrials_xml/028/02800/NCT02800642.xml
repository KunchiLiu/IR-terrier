  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) occurs when the main blood vessel that transports
      blood away from the retina (the very back portion of the eye) becomes blocked, causing the
      leakage of fluid into the retina and thereby causing a swelling of the macula (the portion
      of the retina responsible for fine vision). This swelling is called macular edema. When the
      macula swells with fluid, central vision becomes blurry. The study drug aflibercept has been
      shown to reduce the amount of fluid and blood leaked into the retina. It can help to
      stabilize, and in many cases, improve the vision loss related to CRVO. Aflibercept has been
      approved for the treatment of macular edema secondary to CRVO in the United States (US),
      European Union (EU), Japan, and other countries.

      The study is considered research because, although the study drug is already on the market
      for macular edema secondary to CRVO, there are no studies available that address the
      questions of what are useful intervals for treating and assessing patients, how do they
      differ among patients, and how are criteria applied for retreatment. The purpose of this
      study is to evaluate the effectiveness, treatment interval, and safety of the treatment
      regimen (pattern for administering treatment) in subjects with macular edema secondary to
      CRVO. In addition, this study will explore new imaging methods for assessing the affected
      eye.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Center-involved macular edema secondary to CRVO for no longer than 3 months (at the
             screening visit it should be ensured that the subjects will comply with the criterion
             of ≤ 3 months since onset of macular edema at their scheduled baseline visit).

          -  Adult subjects diagnosed with macular edema secondary to CRVO who are scheduled to be
             treated with IVT aflibercept as per investigator's routine treatment practice with
             the intent to use a T&amp;E regimen after initial dosing.

          -  Treatment-naïve subjects for macular edema secondary to CRVO.

          -  Men and women ≥ 18 years of age.
