      This small feasibility study will evaluate the use of hydrogel electrode pads (rather than
      tap water baths) to deliver iontophoresis treatment using a traditional iontophoresis
      device. Participants will treat one hand with the hydrogel-based iontophoresis device and
      leave the other hand untreated.

    <textblock>
      Palmar hyperhidrosis affects 4.3 million Americans and results in substantial quality of
      life impairment. Treatment options for palmar hyperhidrosis include antiperspirants,
      systemic anticholinergic agents, botulinum toxin injections, and iontophoresis. Standard
      iontophoresis involves submerging the hands in tap water through which current is applied to
      the palms for 30 minutes per day up to 3 times per week. While effective, treatment
      adherence rates are low.

      This is a small feasibility study to evaluate the use of hydrogel electrode pads (rather
      than tap water baths) to deliver iontophoresis treatment using a traditional iontophoresis
      device. Hydrogel electrode pads permit improved mobility and hand functionality during
      iontophoresis treatment sessions.
