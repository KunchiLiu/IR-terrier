    <textblock>
      The study will evaluate the impact of smart adherence technology for monitoring on
      lumacaftor/ivacaftor (LUM/IVA) adherence rates among subjects 16 years of age and older with
      Cystic Fibrosis (CF) who are homozygous for the F508del Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane
      Conductance Regulator (CFTR) mutation.
