  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Perineal tear grade III and IV are relatively common (1-10% of deliveries depending on the
      series), and are a source of potentially serious complications, even long time after
      delivery (especially disorders of anal continence, psychological trauma). If a number of
      risk factors are well described, the support arrangements at the time of delivery and the
      characteristics of the review Proctological remote delivery and its relationship to the
      clinical status of patients is little known and rarely studied.

      In maternity wards of the hospital Saint Joseph Paris and Cochin-Port Royal group, patients
      with a diagnosis of severe perineal tear was made are taken following load with common
      rules, both for the immediate repair for the remote monitoring. Patients of both sites are
      indeed encouraged to consult in proctology consultation in Saint Joseph 4-6 months of birth.

      The same support on both sites allows to consider the creation of a relatively homogeneous
      cohort in terms of support and consider an important recruitment. Moreover, the geographical
      proximity of the inclusions sites (maternity) with proctology service is likely to limit the
      risk of lost sight of.

      Main objective / secondary:

      Describe exactly the operational management of severe perineal tear (grade III and IV),
      their context and the factors associated with them occurring, the results of clinical and
      paraclinical proctology examination carried away from the birth, and study their
      relationship with the clinical status of patients at 6 months, 1, 2 and 3 years of
      confinement.

      Methodology :

      Type prospective, multicentre, non-interventional Study duration: 6 years
