  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overarching objective of this proposal is to conduct a randomized trial to evaluate the
      effectiveness of the Individual Well-Being Navigator (Iwin) mobile application, a substance
      abuse prevention and well-being enhancement program designed specifically for military
      personnel. Iwin provides an innovative, tailored mobile application using best practices in
      behavior change science and innovative technology to assist military personnel in preventing
      substance abuse and enhancing well-being by providing them with the most appropriate
      intervention content at the right time. It integrates Transtheoretical Model of Behavior
      Change based tailoring, in app messaging, stage of change matched activities, and engaging
      game-like features in a cutting edge multiple behavior change program. The efficacy of the
      Iwin program will be determined by tests of statistical significance indicating that
      participants in the Treatment condition had lower scores on an index of substance use and
      other behavioral risks. The overall design is a 2 group (treatment and control group) by 3
      Occasions with repeated measures across occasions.

      The overarching objective of this project is to conduct a randomized trial to evaluate the
      effectiveness of the Individual Well-Being Navigator (Iwin) mobile application, a substance
      abuse prevention and well-being enhancement program designed specifically for military
      personnel.

      Military personnel recruited will be asked to complete a series of screening questions on
      their personal mobile devices. An estimated 1624 Personnel will need to be screened to
      arrive at an eligible sample of 812. Randomization of the eligible sample will occur within
      the online baseline assessment at the individual level as soon as a participant completes
      the Informed Consent form. Those randomized to the Control Group (n=406) will complete
      assessments at baseline, 6 months, and 9 months. Those randomized to the Intervention Group
      (n=406) will complete the same schedule of assessments as the control group and in addition
      will have access to the Iwin application (app) in between the baseline and 6 month
      assessments. The assessments include a variety of questions on health, wellness, substance
      use and well-being.

      Personnel randomized into the treatment group will be able to download the Iwin app for free
      onto their personal device. The Pro‐Change Iwin application has been built using the IMS
      Health AppNucleus™ Platform. AppNucleus is a patented, federally certified (FIPS 140‐2,
      DIACAP MAC II Sensitive), secure application platform that enables Pro‐Change to rapidly
      deploy secure mHealth solutions to users via web portal and commercial mobile technologies
      (such as iOS, Android, Windows Phone, Blackberry). The application provides an innovative,
      tailored program using best practices in behavior change science and innovative technology
      to assist military personnel in preventing substance abuse and enhancing well‐being by
      providing them with the most appropriate intervention content at the right time for their
      individual needs. It delivers assessments and tailored feedback immediately on eleven
      different risk behaviors as well as mobile interactive staged matched activities, engaging
      game‐like features and in‐app notifications on each behavior they are at risk for over the
      course of 6 months. The app will provide reminders for users to return to the program as set
      time points. Both treatment and control participants will receive e-mail reminders to
      complete follow-up assessments at 6 and 9 months.

    <description>The ASSIST (Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test) is an 8 item questionnaire that takes about 5-10 minutes to complete. Originally developed by the World Health Organization primarily for use in primary care settings to identify patients who substance use may be classified as moderate level, it has been adapted in a range of studies for use in other populations and research . This tool has also been adapted by NIDA and published online as a tool for clinicians. It screens for problem or risky use of tobacco, alcohol, cannabis, cocaine, ATS, sedatives, hallucinogens, inhalants, opioids, and other drugs. A risk score is developed for each category, as well as an overall risk score . Previous studies have used changes in this score as at test of effectiveness of interventions successfully.</description>
