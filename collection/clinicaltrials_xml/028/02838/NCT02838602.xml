  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a transnational prospective randomized trial comparing definitive carbon ion therapy
      versus photon or combined photon and protontherapy as standard treatment for unresectable or
      macroscopically uncompleted resected radioresistant tumors. Eligible tumors are axial
      chordoma (except of base of skull), adenoid cystic carcinoma of head and neck (except of
      trachea) and sarcomas of any site (except chondrosarcoma of the skull base), non previously
      irradiated and without pre-planned surgery or chemotherapy after the clinical trial
      procedure. Randomization is balanced 1 for 1. Patients of the experimental arm are treated
      in carbon ions centers in Europe and patients of the standard arm are treated in France in
      their closest participating radiotherapy center. An accrual of 250 patients is needed and an
      absolute difference of 20% of relapse free survival at five years is awaited. The main
      endpoint is the progression free survival at five years. The trial is supported by the
      French program of clinical research and the national health insurance. Two associated
      studies are carried out: a radiobiological one looking for radioresistance markers in the
      sarcomas biopsies, and the second one is about medico economics.
