  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Very few data has been published on the epidemiology of hypoparathyroidism worldwide: none
      exists specifically for France. Hypoparathyroidism could led to complications. Here, the
      investigators plan to collect data about both epidemiology, medication and complication of
      hypoparathyroidism in France.

      Very few data has been published on the epidemiology of hypoparathyroidism worldwide. None
      exists specifically in France. Hypoparathyroidism could led to complications: e.g.
      symptomatic hypocalcemia, calcifications (brain, eye and other soft tissues),
      nephrolithiasis/nephrocalcinosis, renal insufficiency. Here,the investigators plan to
      collect data about both epidemiology, medication and complication of hypoparathyroidism in
      France.
