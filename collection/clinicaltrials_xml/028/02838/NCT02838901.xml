  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, pilot study. Participants will be
      randomized to receive either beetroot juice or a beetroot juice placebo, as a dietary
      supplement, for 30 days. Beetroot juice is high in nitrates, a chemical when ingested is
      found to increase blood flow to the brain. The purpose of this research study is to
      determine the safety and feasibility of using this nutritional intervention in
      (ischemic)stroke survivors, and prove that plasma levels of nitrate and nitrite increase as
      expected. Secondary outcomes includes measuring a comprehensive set of outcomes related to
      functional status post-stroke, including mobility, upper extremity strength, cognition,
      depression, and disability. Patients will also be randomized to MRI perfusion scanning in
      the region of the stroke to measure cerebral blood flow.

    <textblock>
      In this proof of concept study, the investigators will for the first time, determine whether
      dietary nitrate (commercially available beetroot juice) is safe and feasible to administer
      in ischemic stroke patients, and whether its use is associated with increased plasma nitrate
      and nitrite levels and trends toward improvement during the standard 30-day rehabilitation
      period after a stroke. The investigators will test the hypotheses using a double-blinded
      randomized placebo-controlled trial of Beet ItÂ® shots once daily for 30 days for patients
      enrolled within 5 days of stroke onset. This novel study will provide key safety and
      feasibility data on dietary nitrate supplementation and preliminary information on the
      magnitude of its effect on improving mobility and functional status, cognition and cerebral
      blood flow. These data are needed to accelerate the pace of development of this novel
      therapeutic strategy: using a non-pharmacological approach for improving stroke outcomes.
      The specific aims are to: Aim 1) Test the proof of concept that beetroot juice consumption
      is feasible and safe in ischemic stroke patients when given during the post-acute
      rehabilitation period. Primary outcomes are adherence to the intervention, measurement of
      outcomes and follow-up (feasibility), as well as adverse events (safety), reported as
      proportions in each group and across the entire study cohort. Hypothesis: Beetroot juice is
      safe and feasible in this population, and leads to increased plasma nitrate and nitrite
      levels at 30 days. Secondary outcomes of interest include change in gait speed (m/sec),
      Modified Rankin score (disability scale), NIHSS, EuroQOL-5D (quality of life),Patient Health
      Questionnaire-9 (depression), Stroke Impact Scale-16 (SIS-16), Barthel Index, Short Physical
      Performance Battery, grip strength and the MoCA. Aim 2) Determine whether beetroot juice
      consumption increases cerebral blood flow vs. placebo juice. Cerebral blood flow will be
      determined from MRI collected 2 hours following ingestion of the beetroot juice on day 30.
      Anatomic and perfusion imaging (PASL) will be performed. A region of interest will be used
      to measure blood flow in a 20mm sphere placed adjacent to the ischemic stroke and in the
      contralateral hemisphere. Hypothesis: Ischemic stroke patients randomized to the beetroot
      juice intervention will show increased cerebral blood flow as measured by MRI perfusion
      scanning in the region of the stroke compared with the placebo group at 30 days.
