      The PRIME-HF study is a multi-center, patient-level, randomized, open-label study of
      approximately 450 patients with reduced (left ventricular ejection fraction) LVEF of &lt;35%
      and heart-rate &gt;70 beats per minute (bpm) who are being discharged from the hospital
      following stabilization from acute heart failure (HF) and will be randomized to a treatment
      strategy of predischarge initiation of ivabradine or usual care.

      All participants should have a follow-up visit within 7-14 days of hospital discharge. Heart
      rate and systolic blood pressure will be assessed at this clinical visit. For participants
      randomized to predischarge initiation of ivabradine and on ivabradine 5mg BID, the heart
      rate may be used to adjust the dose the dose to 2.5mg BID or 7.5mg BID. For participants
      randomized to usual care, ivabradine may be initiated at the provider's discretion. All
      participants will have a second follow-up study visit 6 weeks (42 +/- 14 days)
      post-discharge. Heart rate, systolic blood pressure and quality of life (KCCQ and PGA) will
      be assessed. For participants already taking ivabradine in either treatment group, the heart
      rate may again be used to adjust the dose of ivabradine. For participants not yet receiving
      ivabradine, it may be initiated at the provider's discretion. All participants will receive
      a 90 (+/-7) day post-discharge phone call by site to assess for event status and
      tolerability of ivabradine. All participants will have a final study visit at 180 (+/-14)
      days post-discharge. Heart rate, systolic blood pressure and quality of life (Kansas City
      Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire and Patient Global Assessment) will be assessed. The attending
      physician may initiate ivabradine per usual care clinical practice.

      The primary hypothesis of the PRIME-HF study is that, compared with usual care, a treatment
      strategy of initiation of ivabradine prior to discharge for a hospitalization for acute HF
      will be associated with a greater proportion of participants using ivabradine at 180 days.
      Secondary objectives are to assess the impact of predischarge initiation of ivabradine
      on:Heart Rate (Percent change in heart rate from baseline to 180 days and Median heart rate
      at 180 days) and Patient-Centered Outcomes (Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ)
      and Patient Global Assessment (PGA)). Tertiary objectives will be to explore the impact of
      predischarge initiation of ivabradine on other assessments of evidence-based implementation
      of ivabradine and beta-blockers at 180 days. Evaluations will incorporate data based on
      whether or not indication status was retained and whether or not an ivabradine prescription
      was provided. Tolerability of ivabradine and adverse events during study follow-up.

      -  Purpose of the study The primary hypothesis of the PRIME-HF study is that, compared
           with usual care, a treatment strategy of initiation of ivabradine prior to discharge
           for a hospitalization for acute HF will be associated with a greater proportion of
           participants using ivabradine at 180 days. Secondary objectives are to assess the
           impact of predischarge initiation of ivabradine on:Heart Rate (Percent change in heart
           rate from baseline to 180 days and Median heart rate at 180 days) and Patient-Centered
           Outcomes (Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) and Patient Global Assessment
           (PGA)). Tertiary objectives will be to explore the impact of predischarge initiation of
           ivabradine on other assessments of evidence-based implementation of ivabradine and
           beta-blockers at 180 days. Evaluations will incorporate data based on whether or not
           indication status was retained and whether or not an ivabradine prescription was
           provided. Tolerability of ivabradine and adverse events during study follow-up.

        -  Background &amp; significance Heart failure is a major public health issue. More than 5
           million Americans have HF and the prevalence is expected to increase as the population
           ages and survival from coronary, hypertensive, and valvular heart disease improves.
           Data from randomized clinical trials have established the efficacy of a number of
           medical and device therapies for patients with chronic Heart failure with reduced
           ejection fraction (HFrEF), but patient outcomes remain poor, especially after a
           hospitalization for heart failure. The 1-year mortality rate after a HF hospitalization
           is 20-30%, and this number has been relatively unchanged over the past decade. These
           data suggest that there is an unmet need for novel treatment strategies and supports
           the assessment of new approaches in the post-acute HF setting.

      There is also wide variation in the implementation of clinical trial evidence into routine
      practice. Previous data highlight a multi-year gap between the generation of new evidence
      through clinical trials and the adoption of the data into routine clinical practice. This
      gap in care translates into many unnecessary deaths and hospitalizations each year for
      patients with HFrEF. While there are multiple reasons for this quality gap, clinical inertia
      has most often been noted as a major barrier. Ivabradine have been approved for use in
      Europe for several years for patients with symptomatic chronic HFrEF (LVEF &lt;35%) and a heart
      rate &gt;75 bpm on guideline-directed medical therapy (or intolerance/contra-indication to
      beta-blocker use). Ivabradine was recently approved for use in the United States. However,
      no US data exist regarding the potential adoption of ivabradine into routine clinical care.

      Previous data for patients with HFrEF suggest that the hospital setting may provide a unique
      opportunity for patients to initiate guideline-directed medical therapy. In the Initiation
      Management Predischarge: Process for Assessment of Carvedilol Therapy in HF (IMPACT-HF)
      study, patients with an LVEF&lt;40% hospitalized for HF that were started on carvedilol prior
      to hospital discharge were more likely to be on a beta-blocker at 60 days post-randomization
      compared to those receiving usual care. These improvements in care were achieved without
      increasing side effects or index hospitalization length of stay. Similar to beta-blockers
      and other medical therapies for HF, ivabradine was initially studied in patients with
      chronic HF. The initiation of ivabradine in patients following stabilization for acute HF
      has not been evaluated.

      • Design &amp; procedures The PRIME-HF study is a multi-center, patient-level, randomized,
      open-label study of approximately 450 patients with reduced LVEF of &lt;35% and heart-rate &gt;70
      bpm who are being discharged from the hospital following stabilization from acute HF and
      will be randomized to a treatment strategy of predischarge initiation of ivabradine or usual
      care.

      All participants should have a follow-up visit within 7-14 days of hospital discharge. Heart
      rate and systolic blood pressure will be assessed at this clinical visit. For participants
      randomized to predischarge initiation of ivabradine and on ivabradine 5mg BID, the heart
      rate may be used to adjust the dose the dose to 2.5mg BID or 7.5mg BID. For participants
      randomized to usual care, ivabradine may be initiated at the provider's discretion. All
      participants will have a second follow-up study visit 6 weeks (42 +/- 14 days)
      post-discharge. Heart rate, systolic blood pressure and quality of life (KCCQ and PGA) will
      be assessed. For participants already taking ivabradine in either treatment group, the heart
      rate may again be used to adjust the dose of ivabradine. For participants not yet receiving
      ivabradine, it may be initiated at the provider's discretion. All participants will receive
      a 90 (+/-7) day post-discharge phone call by site to assess for event status and
      tolerability of ivabradine. All participants will have a final study visit at 180 (+/-14)
      days post-discharge. Heart rate, systolic blood pressure and quality of life (KCCQ and PGA)
      will be assessed. The attending physician may initiate ivabradine per usual care clinical
      practice.
