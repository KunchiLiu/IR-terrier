    <textblock>
      The route of subcutaneous administration of drugs has become a common practice in some
      specialties (palliative care, geriatrics).

      This is an alternative to oral, sublingual, rectal or intravenous Many drugs are used by
      subcutaneous route but few clinical studies evaluating the level of scientific relevance
      justifies their use.

      The purpose of this study is to assess:

        1. / Determine that there is no difference between the subcutaneously compared to
           intravenous administration in terms of dosage and serum PK / PD of Beta lactam
           objectives in a geriatric population.

        2. / The safety and lack of toxicity of administrations subcutaneously.

      Advantages disadvantages

        -  easy Of establishment

        -  Simplicity Monitoring and manipulation

        -  Reduced Risk of infection

        -  No Risk of venous thrombosis

        -  Lower cost Simple -Technique for support at home taking

        -  Limitation Aggressive gestures

        -  multiplicity Of all possible injection sites

        -  Technique Of choice for agitated patients or confused -Risk of localized edema (&lt;1000mL
           / 24 / site)

        -  Use Impossible for some drugs

        -  Risk Discomfort and intolerance at the injection site

      A practical study was conducted among 382 physicians (289 geriatricians and 93 infectious
      disease specialists). Among them 97.5% reported regular use of the subcutaneous route for
      the administration of antibiotics.

      Declarative criteria pretend curb the use of this route was the lack of data Pk / Pd
      (61.2%); the absence of marketing authorization for the subcutaneous route (34.5%); the
      absence of serum assay available (2.1%).

      PROTOCOL

      Primary objective :

      • Determine that there is no difference between the subcutaneously compared to intravenous
      administration in terms of dosage and serum PK / PD objectives Beta lactam in a geriatric
      population.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  Clinical evaluation at J14 and J90 (healing, death)

        -  Clinical tolerance of subcutaneously by self-assessment or hetero-evaluation of the
           existence of cognitive disorders

      Monitoring of antibiotic dosages:

        -  Making systematic assay serum concentrations of residual antibiotics in the range of 30
           min prior to reinjection H24 after starting treatment and then weekly monitoring.

        -  Realization of the assays according to the method of Liquid Chromatography-Mass
           Spectrometry (LC-MS)

      Patient monitoring of J1-J14:

      • Clinical monitoring and biological usual
