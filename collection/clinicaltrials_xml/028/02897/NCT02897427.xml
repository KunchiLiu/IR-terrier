    <textblock>
      There are 2 parts in this study: pre-screening and the &quot;main&quot; clinical research study.

      The goal of the pre-screening part of this study is to learn if participant has antibodies
      against human papillomavirus (HPV) . Antibodies are created by the immune system and may
      attack foreign cells or diseased cells, such as HPV.

      The goal of the main study is to learn about the relationship between HPV and cancer risk in
      men who test positive for HPV antibodies. Researchers want to look for early methods of
      screening for certain types of cancer.

      HPV infections can lead to oropharyngeal, anal, and/or penile cancer. The goal of the entire
      study is to learn if screening for HPV can help doctors learn which participants may be at a
      higher risk for developing these types of cancer.

      Pre-Screening:

      If participant agrees to take part in the pre-screening part of this study, they will have
      the following tests and procedures at the Clinical Research Unit of the Texas Medical Center
      (CRU):

        -  Participant will be interviewed by a member of the study staff and will be asked to
           complete a questionnaire about their cancer history, age, sex, race, income, smoking
           and alcohol drinking history, and sexual behavior. It should take around 15-20 minutes
           to complete.

        -  Participant will also be asked to provide oral rinse samples to test for HPV.
           Participant will swish with a small amount of mouthwash for 15 seconds, gargle for
           another 15 seconds, and then spit the mouthwash into a cup.

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn to test for HPV antibodies. Because the test
           used in this study to check for HPV antibodies is not FDA approved, participant will
           not be told if they have the HPV antibodies or not.

      Up to 90 men who test positive for HPV antibodies and up to 90 men who test negative for HPV
      antibodies will be selected to take part in the main study. Participant will not be told if
      they are HPV-antibody positive or negative.

      If participant is selected to take part in the main study, they will be given a separate
      consent form to sign that explains the main study in more detail, including expected
      tests/procedures and their risks.

      If participant is not selected to be part of the main study, the study staff will contact
      them 1 time each year for up to 5 years to check their health status and ask about any
      diagnosis of cancer or other HPV-related diseases. Participant may be contacted by phone,
      mail, or email. If participant is called, it should last about 5 minutes.

      This is an investigational study.

      Up to 3000 participants may take part in the pre-screening study. All will be enrolled at
      the CRU.

      Follow-up Cohort: Cancers Caused by HPV In Men Screening (CCHIMES):

      If participant is eligible to take part in this study, and they agree, they will be screened
      for cancer and/or dysplasia (a type of pre-cancerous lesion). These visits will be at MD
      Anderson. Participant may refuse taking part in any part of the screening procedures or stop
      taking part in this study at any time. Participant's first visit will be at the time they
      sign this consent form.

      Oropharyngeal Cancer Screening:

      During participant's first study visit and then every 6 months for up to 5 years, they will
      be screened for oropharyngeal cancer. At each screening:

        -  Participant will have a head and neck exam.

        -  Blood (about 6 teaspoons) will be drawn to test how participant's immune system
           responds to infections.

        -  Participant will have an oropharyngeal exam to look for anything unusual in their
           throat. A member of the research team will use a narrow band imaging device to look at
           the back of participant's throat. A narrow band imaging device is an ultra-thin
           flexible probe with a video camera on the end of it that will pass through
           participant's nose and shine a light on the back of their throat. The video will be
           displayed on a color TV so the researchers can look for anything unusual, such as signs
           of cancer.

        -  Participant's tonsils and the back of their tongue will be rubbed with a cotton swab to
           test for HPV.

        -  Participant will have ultrasound scans of their throat and the lymph nodes in their
           neck to check for cancer and/or dysplasia. To do this, an ultrasound probe will be
           placed on the outside of the neck.

      Anal Cancer Screening:

      At participant's first study visit:

        -  Participant will have an anal pap test to test for HPV. To perform this test, anal
           samples will be collected by gently swabbing the anal area with a cotton swab.

        -  Blood (about 6 teaspoons) will be drawn to test how participant's immune system
           responds to infections.

        -  Participant will have high-resolution anoscopy (HRA). HRA is an exam of the anal canal
           that is used to check for anal cancer and dysplasia. During the exam, a liquid solution
           of diluted acetic acid (normally found in vinegar) will be flushed into participant's
           anal canal to help pre-cancerous areas show up better during the exam. Then, a small
           tube with a camera on the end (called a colposcope) will be inserted into participant's
           anus and used to take pictures of possible pre-cancerous areas. This exam should take
           about 5-10 minutes. Participant will not be sedated for this procedure.

      Penile Cancer Screening:

      At participant's first study visit:

        -  The doctor will examine participant's genital area to check for anything abnormal.

        -  Urine will be collected for routine tests.

        -  Participant's penis will be rubbed with a cotton-like swab to test for HPV.

      If participant has an abnormal test result from any of the screening procedures, they will
      be referred to a doctor to discuss more testing and/or treatment options, as part of their
      standard care.

      Length of Study:

      Participation in this study will be over after participant's last oropharyngeal cancer
      screening (about 5 years after their first study visit).

      This is an investigational study.

      Up to 3000 men may be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

    <description>A sample size of 90 men positive for HPV16 E antibodies will allow researchers to estimate the cumulative incidence of oropharyngeal cancer with 95% confidence with precision Â± 8.3%, using the large-sample normal approximation and assuming the cumulative incidence is 20% or less (nQuery 7.0).</description>

    <measure>Incidence Rate of Anal Related Malignancies in Men Aged 50-59 Who Test Serologically Positive for Antibodies to HPV 16 E Antigens</measure>

    <description>Given an incidence rate of anal cancer in men aged 50-59 at 2.5 (95% CI 2.4-2.6) and an estimated increased risk of 75 (95% CI 18-321), researchers expect to detect 1 (95% CI 0-4) cases over 5 years of follow up in 90 men positive for HPV16 E antibodies. A sample size of 90 men positive for HPV16 E antibodies will allow researchers to estimate the cumulative incidence of anal cancer with 95% confidence with precision +6.3% or -2.5%, using Wilson confidence interval, assuming the cumulative incidence is 4% or less.</description>
